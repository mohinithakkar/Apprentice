divine speaker -- theophrastus aristotle leave he he library and all he mss and name he he successor in the school of the lyceum nicomachus the son of aristotle be among he pupil he follow in the step of aristotle diogene laertius ascribe to theophrastus two hundred and twenty book he found by a history of plant the science of botany and he be now best know by the little contribution to moral philosophy in which he give twenty-eight short chapter to concise description of twenty-eight differ quality in man the description in each chapter be not of a man but of a quality the method of theophrastus as casaubon say be between the philosophical and the poetical he describe a quality but he describe it by personification and he aim be the amend of man 's manners the twenty-eight chapter that have come down to we be probably no more than a fragment of a larger work they describe vice and not all of they another part now lose may have describe the virtue in a short proem the writer speak of himself as ninety-nine year old probably those two nines be only a poetical suggestion of long experience from which these picture of the constituent of human life and action have be draw he have wonder he say before he think of write such a book at the diversity of manners among greek all bear under one sky and trained alike for many year he have consider and compare the way of man he have live to be ninety-nine we child may be the better for a knowledge of we way of daily life that they may grow into the best observe and see whether i describe they rightly i will begin he say with dissimulation i will first define the vice and then describe the quality and manners of the man who dissemble after that i will endeavor to describe also the other quality of mind each in its kind then follow the character of these twenty-eight quality : dissimulation adulation garrulity rusticity blandishment senselessness loquacity newsmongering impudence sordid parsimony impurity ill-timed approach inept sedulity stupidity contumacy superstition querulousness distrust dirtiness tediousness sordid or frivolous desire for praise illiberality ostentation pride timidity oligarchy or the vehement desire for honor without greed for money insolence and evil speak one of these character may serve as a example of they method and show they place in the ancestry of character as they be write in england in the seventeenth century _ stupidity you may define stupidity as a slowness of mind in word or deed but the stupid man be one who sit at he counter and have make all he calculation and work out he sum ask one who sit by he how much it come to when any one have a suit against he and he have come to the day when the cause must be decide he forget it and walk out into he field often also when he sit to see a play the rest go out and he be leave fall asleep in the theater the same man have eat too much will go out in the night to relieve himself and fall over the neighbor 's dog who bite he the same man have hide away what he have receive be always search for it and never find it and when it be announce to he that one of he intimate friend be dead and he be ask to the funeral then with a face set to sadness and tear he say good luck to it when he receive money owe to he he call in witness and in midwinter he scold he man for not have gather cucumber to train he boy for wrestle he make they race till they be tired cooking he own lentil in the field he throw salt twice into the pot and make they uneatable when it rain he say how sweet i find this water of the star and when some one ask how many have pass the gate of death -lrb- proverbial phrase for a great number -rrb- answer as many i hope as will be enough for you and I _ the first and the best sequence of character in english literature be the series of sketch of the pilgrim in the prologue to chaucer 's canterbury tale the character be so varied as to unite in represent the whole character of english life in chaucer 's day and they be write upon one plan each with suggestion of the outward body and its dress as well as of the mind within but chaucer owe nothing to theophrastus in he character write he draw all from nature with he own good wit la bruyère in france translate the character of theophrastus and he own writing of character in the seventeenth century follow a fashion that have its origin in admiration of the wit of those greek ethical character la bruyère be bear in 1639 and die in 1696 we joseph hall whose character of vice and virtue be write in 1608 and translate into french twenty year before la bruyère be bear say in he preface to they i have do as i could follow that ancient master of morality who think this the fittest task for the ninety-ninth year of he age and the profitablest monument that he could leave for a farewell to he grecian there be some aim at short and witty sketch of character in description of the ingenuity of horse-courser and coney-catcher who use quick wit for beguile the unwary in those bright day of elizabeth when the very tailor and cook work fantasy in silk and velvet sugar and paste thoma harman whose grandfather have be clerk of the crown under henry vii and who himself inherit estate in kent become greatly interested in the vagrant beggar who come to he door he make a study of they come to london to publish he book and lodge at whitefriar within the cloister for convenience of nearness to they and more thorough knowledge of they way he first publish he book in 1567 as a caveat or warn for common cursitor

elizabeth countess of shrewsbury it contain twenty-four character sketch give the name of the chief tramp then live in england and a vocabulary of they cant word this be harman 's first character _ : -- a ruffler the ruffler because he be first in degree of this odious order and be so call in a statute make for the punishment of vagabond in the twenty-seventh year of king henry viii late of most famous memory he shall be first place as the worthiest of this unruly rabblement and he be so call when he goeth first abroad either he have serve in the war or else he have be a serving-man and weary of well-doing shake off all pain doth choose he this idle life and wretchedly wander about the most shire of this realm and with stout audacity demandeth where he thinketh he may be bold and circumspect enough where he seeth cause to ask charity ruefully and lamentably that it would make a flinty heart to relent and pity he miserable estate how he have be maim and bruise in the war peradventure one will show you some outward wound which he get at some drunken fray either halt of some privy wound fester with a filthy fiery flankard -lrb- brand -rrb- for be well assure that the hardiest soldier be either slay or maim either and -lrb- or if -rrb- they escape all hazard and return home again if they be without relief of they friend they will surely desperately rob and steal and either shortly be hang or miserably die in prison for they be so much ashamed and disdain to beg or ask charity that rather they will as desperately fight for to live and maintain themselves as manfully and valiantly they venture themselves in the prince 's quarrel now these ruffler the outcast of serving-man when beg or craving fail they they pick and pilfer from other inferior beggar that they meet by the way as rogue palliard mort and dox yea if they meet with a woman alone ride to the market either old man or boy that he kneweth well will not resist such they fetch and spoil these ruffler after a year or two at the farthest become upright man -lrb- lusty vagrant who beg and take only money who rob hen roost filch from stall or pocket and have den of they own for drinking and receipt of steal goods -rrb- unless they be prevent by twine hemp i have of late year a old man to my tenant who customably a great time go twice in the week to london either with fruit or with peascod when time serve therefor and as he be come homeward on blackheath at the end thereof next to shooter 's hill he overtake two ruffler the one mannerly wait on the other as one have be the master and the other he man or servant carry he master 's cloak this old man be very glad that he might have they company over the hill because that day he have make a good market for he have seven shilling in he purse and a old angel which this poor man have think have not be in he purse for he will he wife overnight to take out the same angel and lay it up until he come home again and he verily think he wife have so do which indeed forget to do it thus after salutation have this master ruffler enter into communication with this simple old man who ride softly beside they commune of many matter thus feed this old man with pleasant talk until they be on the top of the hill where these ruffler might well behold the coast about they clear quickly step unto this poor man and taketh hold of he horse bridle and leadeth he into the wood and demandeth of he what and how much money he have in he purse now by my troth quoth this old man you be a merry gentleman i know you mean not to take anything from I but rather to give I some if i should ask it of you by and by -lrb- immediately -rrb- this servant thief casteth the cloak that he carry on he arm about this poor man 's face that he should not mark or view they with sharp word to deliver quickly that he have and to confess truly what be in he purse this poor man then all abashed yield and confess that he have seven shilling in he purse and the truth be he know of no more this old angel be fall out of a little purse into the bottom of a great purse now this seven shilling in white money they quickly find think indeed that

character-painting simply come of the keen interest in life that be at the same time develop a energetic drama but at the end of elizabeth 's reign a writing of brief witty character appear to have come into fashion as one of the many form of ingenuity that pleased society and might be distantly related to the euphuism of the day ben jonson 's cynthium 's revel first act in 1600 two or three year before the end of elizabeth 's reign have little character sketch set into the text here be two of they _ : -- a traveller one so make out of the mixture of shred and form that himself be truly

for this doth he familiarly insult over he maintainer that breed he he patron that feed he and in time over all they that will suffer he to set a foot within they door or put a finger in they purse all this and much more be in he that abhor degree and university as relique of superstition have leap from a shop-board or a cloak-bag to a desk or pulpit and that like a sea-god in a pageant have the

madman that delight more to resort to dark cave and secret place than to open and public assembly the lay-hypocrite be to the other a champion disciple and subject and will not acknowledge the tithe of the subjection to any mitre no not to any sceptre that he will do to the hook and crook of he zeal-blind shepherd no jesuit demand more blind and absolute obedience from they vassal no magistrate of the canting society more slavish subjection from the member of that travel state than the clerk hypocrite expect from these lay pulpit nay they must not only be obey fed and defend but admire too and that they lay-follower do sincerely as a shirtless fellow with a cudgel under he arm doth a face-wringing ballad-singer a water-bearer on the floor of a playhouse a wide-mouthed poet that speak

not break wind without a apology or ask forgiveness nor kiss a gentlewoman for fear of lust after she he have nickname all the prophet and apostle with he son and beget nothing but virtue for daughter finally he be so sure of he salvation that he will not change place in heaven with the virgin mary without boot a inn of court man he be distinguish from a scholar by a pair of silk stocking and a beaver hat which make he condemn a scholar as much as a scholar doth a schoolmaster by that he have hear one moot and see two play he think as basely of the university as a young sophister doth of the grammar-school he talk of the university with that state as if he be she chancellor find fault with alteration and the fall of discipline with a it be not so when i be a student although that be within this half year he will talk end of latin though it be false with as great confidence as ever cicero could pronounce a oration though he best author for it be tavern and ordinary he be as far behind a courtier in he fashion as a scholar be behind he and the best grace in he behavior be to forget he acquaintance he laugh at every man whose band fit not well or that have not a fair shoe-tie and he be ashamed to be see in any man 's company that wear not he clothes well he very essence he placeth in he outside and he chiefest prayer be that he revenue may hold out for taffety cloak in the summer and velvet in the winter to he acquaintance he offer two quart of wine for one he give you shall never see he melancholy but when he want a new suit or fear a sergeant at which time he only betake himself to ploydon by that he have read littleton he can call solon lycurgus and justinian fool and dare compare he law to a lord chief-justice 's a mere fellow of a house he be one whose hope

be longer furnish himself for a five mile ' journey than a ship be rig for a seven year ' voyage he be never more troubled than when he have to maintain talk with a gentlewoman wherein he commit more absurdity than a clown in eating of a egg he think himself as fine when he be in a clean band and a new pair of shoe as any courtier doth when he be first in a new fashion lastly he be one that respect no man in the university and be respect by no man out of it a worthy commander in the war be one that account learn the nourishment of military virtue and lay that as he first foundation he never bloody he sword but in heat of battle and have rather save one of he own soldier than kill ten of he enemy he account it a idle vainglorious and suspect bounty to be full of good word he

horseback he cast a smile contempt upon calumny it meet he as if glass should encounter adamant he think war be never to be give o'er but on one of these three condition : a assure peace absolute victory or a honest death lastly when peace fold he up he silver head should lean near the golden sceptre and die in he prince 's bosom a vainglorious coward in command be one that have buy he place or come to it by some nobleman 's letter he love alive dead pay yet wish they may rather happen in he company by the scurvy than by a battle view he at a muster and he go with such a nose as if he body be the wheelbarrow that carry he judgment rumble to drill he soldier no man can worse design between pride and noble courtesy he that salute he not so far as a pistol carry level give he the disgust or affront choose you whether he train by the book and reckon so many posture of the pike and musket as if he be count at noddy when he come at first upon a camisado he look like the four wind

the world can not stay he if ever he do anything beyond he own heart ` tis for a knighthood and he be the first kneel for it without bid a pirate truly define be a bold traitor for he fortify a castle against the king give he sea-room in never so small a vessel and like a witch in a sieve you would think he be go to make merry with the devil of all calling he be the most desperate for he will not leave off he thieve though he be in a narrow prison and look every day by tempest or fight for execution he be one plague the devil have add to make the sea more terrible than a storm and he heart be so harden in that rugged element that he can not repent though he view he grave before he continually open he have so little of he own that the house he sleep in be steal : all the necessity of life he filch but one he can not steal a sound sleep for he troubled conscience he be very gentle to those under he yet he rule be the horriblest tyranny in the world for he give licence to all rape murder

live to know the inside of a church and die on this side wapp a ordinary fencer be a fellow that beside shave of cudgel have a good insight into the world for he have long be beat to it flesh and blood he be like other man but surely nature mean he stockfish he and a dancing-school be inseparable adjunct and be bind though both stink of sweat most abominable neither shall complain of annoyance three large bavin set up he trade with a bench which in the vacation of the afternoon he use for he day-bed when he come on the stage at he prize he make a leg seven several way and scramble for money as if he have be bear at the bath in somersetshire at he challenge he show he metal for contrary to all rule of physic he dare bleed though it be in the dog-day he teach devilish play in he school but when he fight himself he doth it in the fear of a good christian he compound quarrel among he scholar and when he have bring the business to a good upshot he make the reckon he wound be seldom above

another 's will whose armor be he honest thought and silly truth he highest skill whose passion not he master be whose soul be still prepare for death untied unto the world with care of princely love or vulgar breath who have he life from rumor free whose conscience be he strong retreat whose state can neither flatterer feed nor ruin make accuser great who envieth none whom chance doth raise or vice who never understand how deepest wound be give with praise not rule of state but rule of good who god doth late and early pray more of he grace than gift to lend who entertain the harmless day with a well-chosen book or friend this man be free from servile band of hope to rise or fear to fall lord of himself though not of land and have nothing he have all a essay of valor i be of opinion that nothing be so potent either to procure or merit love as valor and i be glad i be so for thereby i shall do myself much ease because valor never need much wit to maintain it to speak of it in itself it be a quality which he that have shall have least need of so the best league between prince be a mutual fear of each other it teacheth a man to value he reputation as he life and chiefly to hold the lie insufferable though be alone he find no hurt it doth he it leave itself to other 's censure for he that brag of he own dissuade other from believe it it feareth a sword no more than a ague it always make good the owner for though he be generally hold a fool he shall seldom hear so much by word of mouth and that enlargeth he more than any spectacles for it make a little fellow to be call a tall man it yield the wall to none but a woman whose weakness be she prerogative or a man second with a woman as a usher which always go before he betters it make a man become the witness of he own word to stand to whatever he have say and thinketh it a reproach to commit he revile unto the law it furnisheth youth with action and age with discourse and both by future for a man must never boast himself in the present tense and to come nearer home nothing draw a woman like to it for valor towards man be a emblem of a ability towards woman a good quality signify a better nothing be more behoveful for that sex for from it they receive protection and we free from the danger of it nothing make a shorter cut to obtain for a man of arm be always void of ceremony which be the wall that stand betwixt pyramus and thisbe that be man and woman for there be no pride in woman but that which rebound from we own baseness as coward grow valiant upon those that be more coward so that only by we pale ask we teach they to deny and by we shamefacedness we put they in mind to be modest whereas indeed it be cunning rhetoric to persuade the hearer that they be that already which we would have they to be this kind of bashfulness be far from man of valor and especially from soldier for such be ever man without doubt forward and confident lose no time lest they should lose opportunity which be the best factor for a lover and because they know woman be give to dissemble they will never believe they when they deny whilom before this age of wit and wear black break in upon we there be no way know to win a lady but by tilt tourneying and ride through forest in which time these slender stripling with little leg be hold but of strength enough to marry they widow and even in we day there can be give no reason of the inundation of serving-men upon they mistress but only that usually they carry they mistress ' weapon and he valor to be count handsome just learn or well-favoured all this carry no danger with it but it be to be admit to the title of valiant act at least the venture of he mortality and all woman take delight to hold he safe in they arm who have escape thither through many danger to speak at once man have a privilege in valor in clothes and good face we but imitate woman and many of that sex will not think much as far as a answer go to dissemble wit too so then these neat youth these woman in man 's apparel be too near a woman to be beloved of she they be both of a trade but he of grim aspect and such a one a glass dare take and she will desire he for newness and variety a scar in a man 's face be the same that a mole in a woman 's be a jewel set in white to make it seem more white for a scar in a man be a mark of honor and no blemish for ` tis a scar and a blemish in a soldier to be without one now as for all thing else which be to procure love as a good face wit clothes or a good body each of they i confess may work somewhat for want of a better that be if valor be not they rival a good face avail nothing if it be in a coward that be bashful the utmost of it be to be kiss which rather increaseth than quencheth appetite he that send she gift send she word also that he be a man of small gift otherwise for woo by sign and token employ the author dumb and if ovid who writ the law of love be alive -lrb- as he be extant -rrb- he would allow it as good a diversity that gift should be send as gratuity not as bribe wit getteth rather promise than love wit be not to be see and no woman take advice of any in she loving but of she own eye and she waiting-woman 's nay which be worse wit be not to be feel and so no good bedfellow wit apply to a woman make she dissolve she simpering and discover she tooth with laughter and this be surely a purge of love for the beginning of love be a kind of foolish melancholy as for the man that make he tailor he means and hope to inveigle he love with such a color suit surely the same deeply hazard the loss of she favor upon every change of he clothes so likewise for the other that court she silently with a good body let I certify he that he clothes depend upon the comeliness of he body and so both upon opinion she that have be seduce by apparel let I give she to wit that man always put off they clothes before they go to bed and let she that have be enamour of she servant 's body understand that if she see he in a skin of cloth that be in a suit make of the pattern of he body she would see slender cause to love he ever after there be no clothes sit so well in a woman 's eye as a suit of steel though not of the fashion and no man so soon surpriseth a woman 's affection as he that be the subject of all whisper and have always twenty story of he own deed depend upon he mistake I not i understand not by valor one that never fight but when he be back with drink or anger or hiss on with beholder nor one that be desperate nor one that take away a serving-man 's weapon when perchance it cost he he quarter 's wages nor yet one that wear a privy coat of defense and therein be confident for then such as make buckler would be count the catiline of the commonwealth i intend one of a even resolution ground upon reason which be always even have he power restrain by the law of not do wrong but now i remember i be for valor and therefore must be a man of few word joseph hall

the divine of the old heathen be they moral philosopher these receive the act of a inbred law in the sinaus of nature and deliver they with many exposition to the multitude these be the overseer of manners corrector of vice director of life doctor of virtue which yet teach they people the body of they natural divinity not after one manner : while some spend themselves in deep discourse of human felicity and the way to it in common other think it best to apply the general precept of goodness or decency to particular condition and person a third sort in a mean course betwixt the two other and compound of they both bestow they time in draw out the true lineament of every virtue and vice so lively that who see the medal might know the face which art they significantly term charactery they papers be so many table they writings so many speak picture or live image whereby the ruder multitude might even by they sense learn to know virtue and discern what to detest i be deceive if any course could be more likely to prevail for herein the gross conceit be lead on with pleasure and inform while it feel nothing but delight and if picture have be account the book of idiot behold here the benefit of a image without the offence it be no shame for we to learn wit of heathen neither be it material in whose school we take out a good lesson yea it be more shame not to follow they good than not to lead they better as one therefore that in worthy example hold imitation better than invention i have tread in they path but with a higher and wider step and out of they tablet have draw these larger portraiture of both sort more might be say i deny not of every virtue of every vice i desire not to say all but enough if thou do but read or like these i have spend good hour ill but if thou shalt hence abjure those vice which before thou thoughtest not ill-favoured or fall in love with any of these goodly face of virtue or shalt hence find where thou hast any little touch of these

because she be not see and vice loseth much detestation because she ugliness be secret certainly my lord there be so many beauty and so many grace in the face of goodness that no eye can possibly see it without affection without ravishment and the visage of evil be so monstrous through loathsome deformity that if she lover be not ignorant they would be mad with disdain and astonishment what need we more than to discover these two to the world this work shall save the labor of exhort and dissuasion i have here do it as i could follow that ancient master of morality who think this the fittest task for the ninety and ninth year of he age and the profitablest monument that he could leave for a farewell visit to he grecian lo here then virtue and vice strip naked to the open view and despoil one of she rag the other of she ornament and nothing leave they but bare presence to plead for affection : see now whether shall find more suitor and if still the vain mind of lewd man shall dote upon they old mistress it will appear to be not because she be not foul but for that they be blind and bewitch and first behold the goodly feature of wisdom a amiable virtue and worthy to lead this stage which as she extend herself to all the follow grace so amongst the rest be for she largeness most conspicuous character of the wise man there be nothing that he desire not to know but most and first

once from home but one keep house while the other rove abroad for intelligence in material and weighty point he abide not he mind suspend in uncertainty but hate doubt where he may where he should be resolute : and first he make sure work for he soul account it no safety to be unsettle in the foreknowledge of he small estate the best be first regard and vain be that regard which endeth not in security every care have he just order neither be there any one either neglect or misplace he be seldom ever see with credulity for know the falseness of the world he have learn to trust himself always other so far as he may not be damage by they disappointment he seek he quietness in secrecy and be wont both to hide himself in retiredness and he tongue in himself he love to be guess at not know and to see the world unseen and when he be force into the light show by he action that he obscurity be neither from affectation nor weakness he purpose be neither so variable as may argue inconstancy nor obstinately unchangeable but frame accord to he after-wit or the strength of new occasion he be both a apt scholar and a excellent master for both everything he see inform he and he mind enrich with plentiful observation can give the best precept he free discourse run back to the age past and recover event out of memory and then preventeth time in fly forward to future thing and compare one with the other can give a verdict well near prophetical wherein he conjecture be better than another 's judgment he passion be so many good servant which stand in a diligent attendance ready to be command by reason by religion and if at any time forget they duty they be miscarry to rebel he can first conceal they mutiny then suppress it in all he just and worthy design he be never at a loss but have so project all he course that a second begin where the first fail and fetcheth strength from that which succeed not there be wrong which he will not see neither doth he always look that way which he meaneth nor take notice of he secret smart when they come from great one in good turn he love not to owe more than he must in evil to owe and not pay just censure he deserve not for he live without the compass of a adversary unjust he contemneth and have rather suffer false infamy to die alone than lay hand upon it in a open violence he confineth himself in the circle of he own affair and list not to thrust he finger into a needless fire he stand like a center unmoved while the circumference of he estate be draw above beneath about he finally he wit have cost he much and he can both keep and value and employ it he be he own lawyer the treasury of knowledge the oracle of counsel blind in no man 's cause best sight in he own of a honest man he look not to what he might do but what he should justice be he first guide the second law of he action be expedience he have rather complain than offend and hate sin more for the indignity of it than the danger he simple uprightness work in he that confidence which ofttime wrong he and give advantage to the subtle when he rather pity they faithlessness than repent of he credulity he have but one heart and that lie open to sight and be it not for discretion he never think aught whereof he would avoid a witness he word be he parchment and he yea he oath which he will not violate for fear or for loss the mishap of follow event may cause he to blame he providence can never cause he to eat he promise : neither saith he this i see not but this i say when he be make he friend 's executor he defray debt pay legacy and scorneth to gain by orphan or to ransack grave and therefore will be true to a dead friend because he see he not all he dealings be square and above the board he bewray the fault of what he sell and restore the oversee gain of a false reckoning he esteem a bribe venomous though it come gilded over with the color of gratuity he cheek be never stain with the blush of recantation neither doth he tongue falter to make good a lie with the secret gloss of double or reserved sens and when he name be traduce he innocency bear he out with courage : then lo he go on the plain way of truth and will either triumph in he integrity or suffer with it he conscience overrule he providence so as in all thing good or ill he respect the nature of the action not the sequel if he see what he must do let god see what shall follow he never loadeth himself with burden above he strength beyond he will and once bind what he can he will do neither doth he will but what he can do he ear be the sanctuary of he absent friend 's name of he present friend 's secret neither of they can miscarry in he trust he remember the wrong of he youth and repay they with that usury which he himself would not take he would rather want than borrow and beg than not to pay : he fair condition be without dissemble and he love action above word finally he hate falsehood worse than death : he be a faithful client of truth no man 's enemy and it be a question whether more another man 's friend or he own and if there be no heaven yet he would be virtuous of the faithful man he eye have no other object but absent and invisible which they see so clearly as that to they sense be blind that which be present they see not if i may not rather say that what be past or future be present to they herein he exceed all other that to he nothing be impossible nothing difficult whether to bear or undertake he walk every day with he maker and talk with he familiarly and live ever in heaven and see all earthly thing beneath he when he go in to converse with god he wear not he own clothes but take they still out of the rich wardrobe of he redeemer and then dare boldly press in and challenge a blessing the celestial spirit do not scorn he company yea he service he deal in these worldly affair as a stranger and have he heart ever at home without a write warrant he dare do nothing and with it anything he war be perpetual without truce without intermission and he victory certain he meet with the infernal power and trample they under foot the shield that he ever bear before he can neither be miss nor pierce if he hand be wound yet he heart be safe he be often trip seldom foiled and if sometimes foiled never vanquish he have white hand and a clean soul fit to lodge god in all the room whereof be set apart for he holiness iniquity have oft call at the door and crave entertainment but with a repulse or if sin of force will be he tenant he lord he can not he fault be few and those he have god will not see he be ally so high that he dare call god father he savior brother heaven he patrimony and think it no presumption to trust to the attendance of angel he understanding be enlighten with the beam of divine truth god have acquaint he with he will and what he know he dare confess : there be not more love in he heart than liberty in he tongue if torment stand betwixt he and christ if death he contemn they and if he own parent lie in he way to god he holy carelessness make they he footstep he experiment have draw forth rule of confidence which he dare oppose against all the fear of distrust wherein he think it safe to charge god with what he have do with what he have promise example be he proof and instance he demonstration what have god give which he can not give what have other suffer which he may not be enable to endure be he threaten banishment there he see the dear evangelist in patmo cut in piece he see esaus under the saw drown he see jonah diving into the living gulf burning he see the three child in the hot walk of the furnace devour he see daniel in the seal den amidst he terrible companion stone he see the first martyr under he heap of many gravestone head lo there the baptist 's neck bleeding in herodia ' platter he emulate they pain they strength they glory he weary not himself with care for he know he live not of he own cost not idly omit means but not use they with diffidence in the midst of ill rumor and amazement he countenance changeth not for he know both whom he have trust and whither death can lead he he be not so sure he shall die as that he shall be restore and outfaceth he death with resurrection finally he be rich in work busy in obedience cheerful and unmoved in expectation better with evil in common opinion miserable but in true judgment more than a man of the humble man he be a friendly enemy to himself for though he be not out of he own favor no man set so low a value of he worth as himself -- not out of ignorance or carelessness but of a voluntary and meek dejectedness he admire everything in another while the same or better in himself he think not unworthily contemn he eye be full of he own want and other ' perfection he love rather to give than take honor not in a fashion of complimental courtesy but in simplicity of he judgment neither doth he fret at those on whom he forceth precedence as one that hope they modesty would have refuse but hold he mind unfeignedly below he place and be ready to go lower -lrb- if need be -rrb- without discontent when he have he due he magnifieth courtesy and disclaim he desert he can be more ashamed of honor than grieve with contempt because he think that causeless this deserve he face he carriage he habit savor of lowliness without affectation and yet he be much under that he seemeth he word be few and soft never either peremptory or censorious because he think both each man more wise and none more faulty than himself and when he approacheth to the throne of god he be so take up with the divine greatness that in he own eye he be either vile or nothing place of public charge be fain to sue to he and hail he out of he choose obscurity which he hold ofif not cunningly to cause importunity but sincerely in the conscience of he defect he frequenteth not the stage of common resort and then alone think himself in he natural element when he be shroud within he own wall he be ever jealous over himself and still suspecteth that which other applaud there be no better object of beneficence for what he receive he ascribe merely to the bounty of the giver nothing to merit he emulate no man in anything but goodness and that with more desire than hope to overtake no man be so contented with he little and so patient under misery because he know the greatest evil be below he sin and the least favor above he deserving he walk ever in awe and dare not but subject every word and action to a high and just censure he be a lowly valley sweetly plant and well water the proud man 's earth whereon he trampleth but secretly full of wealthy mine more worth than he that walk over they a rich stone set in lead and lastly a true temple of god build with a low roof of a valiant man he undertake without rashness and perform without fear he seek not for danger but when they find he he bear they over with courage with success he have ofttime look death in the face and pass by it with a smile and when he see he must yield doth at once welcome and contemn it he forecast the worst of all event and encounter they before they come in a secret and mental war and if the suddenness of a unexpected evil have surprise he thought and infected he cheek with paleness he have no sooner digest it in he conceit than he gather up himself and insult over mischief he be the master of himself and subdue he passion to reason and by this inward victory work he own peace he be afraid of nothing but the displeasure of the highest and run away from nothing but sin : he look not on he hand but he cause not how strong he be but how innocent : and where goodness be he warrant he may be over-mastered he can not be foiled the sword be to he the last of all trial which he draw forth still as defendant not as challenger with a willing kind of unwillingness : no man can better manage it with more safety with more favor he have rather have he blood see than he back and disdain life upon base condition no man be more mild to a relent or vanquished adversary or more hate to set he foot on a carcase he have rather smother a injury than revenge himself of the impotent and i know not whether he more detest cowardliness or cruelty he talk little and brag less and love rather the silent language of the hand to be see than hear he lie ever close within himself arm with wise resolution and will not be discover but by death or danger he be neither prodigal of blood to misspend it idly nor niggardly to grudge it when either god call for it or he country neither be he more liberal of he own life than of other he power be limit by he will and he hold it the noblest revenge that he might hurt and doth not he command without tyranny and imperiousness obey without servility and change not he mind with he estate the height of he spirit overlook all casualty and he boldness proceed neither from ignorance nor senselessness but first he value evil and then despise they he be so balanced with wisdom that he float steadily in the midst of all tempest deliberate in he purpose firm in resolution bold in enterprising unwearied in achieve and howsoever happy in success and if ever he be overcome he heart yield last of a patient man the patient man be make of a metal not so hard as flexible : he shoulder be large fit for a load of injury which he bear not out of baseness and cowardliness because he dare not revenge but out of christian fortitude because he may not : he have so conquer himself that wrong can not conquer he and herein alone find that victory consist in yield he be above nature while he seem below himself the vilest creature know how to turn again but to command himself not to resist be urge be more than heroical he construction be ever full of charity and favor either this wrong be not do or not with intent of wrong or if that upon mis-information or if none of these rashness -lrb- though a fault -rrb- shall serve for a excuse himself crave the offender 's pardon before he confession and a slight answer contents where the offended desire to forgive he be god 's best witness and when he stand before the bar for truth he tongue be calmly free he forehead firm and he with erect and settle countenance hear he just sentence and rejoice in it the jailor that attend he be to he he page of honor he dungeon the lower part of the vault of heaven he rack or wheel the stair of he ascent to glory : he challenge he executioner and encounter the fiercest pain with strength of resolution and while he suffer the beholder pity he the tormentor complain of weariness and both of they wonder no anguish can master he whether by violence or by linger he account expectation no punishment and can abide to have he hope adjourn till a new day good law serve for he protection not for he revenge and he own power to avoid indignity not to return they he hope be so strong that they can insult over the greatest discouragement and he apprehension so deep that when he have once fasten he sooner leaveth he life than he hold neither time nor perverseness can make he cast off he charitable endeavor and despair of prevail but in spite of all cross and all denial he redoubleth he beneficial offer of love he trieth the sea after many shipwreck and beat still at that door which he never see open contrariety of event doth but exercise not dismay he and when cross afflict he he see a divine hand invisibly striking with these sensible scourge against which he dare not rebel nor murmur hence all thing befall he alike and he go with the same mind to the shambles and to the fold he recreation be calm and gentle and not more full of relaxation than void of fury this man only can turn necessity into virtue and put evil to good use he be the surest friend the latest and easiest enemy the greatest conqueror and so much more happy than other by how much he could abide to be more miserable of the true friend he affection be both unite and divide unite to he he loveth divide betwixt another and himself and he one heart be so part that whilst he have some he friend have all he choice be lead by virtue or by the best of virtue religion not by gain not by pleasure yet not without respect of equal condition of disposition not unlike which once make admit of no change except he whom he loveth be change quite from himself nor that suddenly but after long expectation extremity doth but fasten he whilst he like a well-wrought vault lie the stronger by how much more weight he bear when necessity call he to it he can be a servant to he equal with the same will wherewith he can command he inferior and though he rise to honor forget not he familiarity nor suffer inequality of estate to work strangeness of countenance on the other side he lift up he friend to advancement with a willing hand without envy without dissimulation when he mate be dead he account himself but half alive then he love not dissolve by death derive itself to those orphan which never know the price of they father they become the heir of he affection and the burden of he care he embrace a free community of all thing save those which either honesty reserve proper or nature and hate to enjoy that which would do he friend more good he charity serve to cloak note infirmity not by untruth not by flattery but by discreet secrecy neither be he more favourable in concealment than round in he private reprehension and when another 's simple fidelity show itself in he reproof he love he monitor so much the more by how much more he smarteth he bosom be he friend 's closet where he may safely lay up he complaint he doubt he care and look how he leave so he find they save for some addition of seasonable counsel for redress if some unhappy suggestion shall either disjoint he affection or break it it soon knit again and grow the stronger by that stress he be so sensible of another 's injury that when he friend be stricken he cry out and equally smarteth untouched as one affect not with sympathy but with a real feeling of pain : and in what mischief may be prevent he interposeth he aid and offer to redeem he friend with himself no hour can be unseasonable no business difficult nor pain grievous in condition of he ease : and what either he doth or suffer he neither care nor desire to have know lest he should seem to look for thanks if he can therefore steal the performance of a good office unseen the conscience of he faithfulness herein be so much sweeter as it be more secret in favor do he memory be frail in benefit receive eternal : he scorneth either to regard recompense or not to offer it he be the comfort of misery the guide of difficulty the joy of life the treasure of earth and no other than a good angel clothe in flesh of the truly noble he stand not upon what he borrow of he ancestor but think he must work out he own honor : and if he can not reach the virtue of they that give he outward glory by inheritance he be more abashed of he impotency than transport with a great name greatness doth not make he scornful and imperious but rather like the fix star the higher he be the less he desire to seem neither care he so much for pomp and frothy ostentation as for the solid truth of nobleness courtesy and sweet affability can be no more sever from he than life from he soul not out of a base and servile popularity and desire of ambitious insinuation but of a native gentleness of disposition and true value of himself he hand be open and bounteous yet not so as that he should rather respect he glory than he estate wherein he wisdom can distinguish betwixt parasite and friend betwixt change of favor and expend they he scorneth to make he height a privilege of looseness but account he title vain if he be inferior to other in goodness : and think he should be more strict the more eminent he be because he be more observe and now he offence be become more exemplar there be no virtue that he hold unfit for ornament for use nor any vice which he condemn not as sordid and a fit companion of baseness and whereof he doth not more hate the blemish than affect the pleasure he so study as one that know ignorance can neither purchase honor nor wield it and that knowledge must both guide and grace he he exercise be from he childhood ingenious manly decent and such as tend still to wit valor activity : and if -lrb- as seldom -rrb- he descend to disport of chance he game shall never make he either pale with fear or hot with desire of gain he doth not so use he follower as if he think they be make for nothing but he servitude whose felicity be only to be command and please : wear they to the back and then either finding or frame excuse to discard they empty but upon all opportunity let they feel the sweetness of they own serviceableness and he bounty silence in officious service be the best oratory to plead for he respect : all diligence be but lend to he none lose he wealth stand in receive he honor in give he care not either how many hold of he goodness or to how few he be beholden : and if he have cast away favor he hate either to upbraid they to he enemy or to challenge restitution none can be more pitiful to the distressed or more prone to succor and then most where be least mean to solicit least possibility of requital he be equally address to war and peace and know not more how to command other than how to be he country 's servant in both he be more careful to give true honor to he maker than to receive civil honor from man he know that this service be free and noble and ever load with sincere glory and how vain it be to hunt after applause from the world till he be sure of he that mouldeth all heart and poureth contempt on prince and shortly so demean himself as one that account the body of nobility to consist in blood the soul in the eminence of virtue of the good magistrate he be the faithful deputy of he maker whose obedience be the rule whereby he ruleth he breast be the ocean whereinto all the care of private man empty themselves which as he receive without complaint and overflow so he send they forth again by a wise conveyance in the stream of justice he door he ear be ever open to suitor and not who come first speed well but whose cause be best he night he meal be short and interrupted all which he bear well because he know himself make for a public servant of peace and justice he sit quietly at the stern and command one to the topsail another to the main a third to the plummet a fourth to the anchor as he see the need of they course and weather require and doth no less by he tongue than all the mariner with they hand on the bench he be another from himself at home now all private respects of blood alliance amity be forget and if he own son come under trial he know he not pity which in all other be wont to be the best praise of humanity and the fruit of christian love be by he throw over the bar for corruption as for favor the false advocate of the gracious he allow he not to appear in the court there only cause be hear speak not person eloquence be then only not dis-couraged when she serve for a client of truth mere narration be allow in this oratory not proem not excursion not gloss truth must strip herself and come in naked to he bar without false body or color without disguise a bribe in he closet or a letter on the bench or the whispering and wink of a great neighbor be answer with a angry and courageous repulse displeasure revenge recompense stand on both side the bench but he scorn to turn he eye towards they look only right forward at equity which stand full before he he sentence be ever deliberate and guide with ripe wisdom yet he hand be slower than he tongue but when he be urge by occasion either to doom or execution he show how much he hateth merciful injustice neither can he resolution or act be reverse with partial importunity he forehead be rugged and severe able to discountenance villainy yet he word be more awful than he brow and he hand than he word i know not whether he be more fear or love both affection be so sweetly contemper in all heart the good fear he lovingly the middle sort love he fearfully and only the wicked man fear he slavishly without love he hate to pay private wrong with the advantage of he office and if ever he be partial it be to he enemy he be not more sage in he gown than valorous in arm and increaseth in the rigor of discipline as the time in danger he sword have neither rust for want of use nor surfeiteth of blood but after many threat be unsheathed as the dreadful instrument of divine revenge he be the guard of good law the refuge of innocence the comet of the guilty the paymaster of good desert the champion of justice the patron of peace the tutor of the church the father of he country and as it be another god upon earth of the penitent he have a wounded heart and a sad face yet not so much for fear as for unkindness the wrong of he sin trouble he more than the danger none but he be the better for he sorrow neither be any passion more hurtful to other than this be gainful to he : the more he seek to hide he grief the less it will be hide every man may read it not only in he eye but in he bone whilst he be in charity with all other he be so fall out with himself that none but god can reconcile he he have sue himself in all court accuseth arraigneth sentenceth punisheth himself impartially and sooner may find mercy at any hand than at he own he only have pull off the fair visor of sin so as that which appear not but mask unto other be see of he barefaced and bewray that fearful ugliness which none can conceive but he that have view it he have look into the depth of the bottomless pit and have see he own offence torment in other and the same brand shake at he he have see the change of face in that cool one as a tempter as a tormentor and have hear the noise of a conscience and be so frightened with all these that he can never have rest till he have run out of himself to god in whose face at first he find rigor but afterwards sweetness in he bosom he bleed

as he act the better part which have always two face ofttime two heart that can compose he forehead to sadness and gravity while he bid he heart be wanton and careless within and in the meantime laugh within himself to think how smoothly he have cozen the beholder in whose silent face be write the character of religion which he tongue and gesture pronounce but he hand recant that have a clean face and garment with a foul soul whose mouth belie he heart and he finger belie he mouth walk early up into the city he turn into the great church and salute one of the pillar on one knee worship that god which at home he care not for while he eye be fix on some window on some passenger and he heart know not whither he lip go he rise and look about with admiration complain on we frozen charity commend the ancient at church he will ever sit where he may be see best and in the midst of the sermon pull out he table in haste as if he fear to lose that note when he write either he forget errand or nothing then he turn he bible with a noise to seek a omit quotation and fold the leaf as if he have find it and ask aloud the name of the preacher and repeat it whom he publicly salute thanks praise

himself be now better but the time be worse all other sin he reckon up with detestation while he love and hide he darling in he bosom all he speech return to himself and every occurrence draw in a story to he own praise when he should give he look about he and say who see I no alms no prayer fall from he without a witness belike lest god should deny that he have receive they and when he have do -lrb- lest the world should not know it -rrb- he own mouth be he trumpet to proclaim it with the superfluity of he usury he build a hospital and harbor they whom he extortion have spoil so while he make many beggar he keep some he turneth all gnat into camel and care not to undo the world for a circumstance flesh on a Friday be more abomination to he than he neighbor 's bed : he more abhor not to uncover at the name of jesus than to swear by the name of god when a rhymer read he poem to he he beg a copy and persuade the press there be nothing that he dislike in presence that in absence he censure not he come to the sick-bed of he stepmother and weep when he secretly fear she recovery he greet he friend in the street with so clear a countenance so fast a closure that the other think he read he heart in he face and shake hand with a indefinite invitation of when will you come and when he back be turn joy that he be so well rid of a guest yet if that guest visit he unfear he counterfeit a smile welcome and excuse he cheer when closely he frown on he wife for too much he show well and say well and himself be the worst thing he have in brief he be the stranger 's saint the neighbor 's disease the blot of goodness a rotten stick in a dark night a poppy in a corn-field a ill-tempered candle with a great snuff that in go out smell ill and a angel abroad a devil at home and worse when a angel than when a devil of the busybody he estate be too narrow for he mind and therefore he be fain to make himself room in other ' affair yet ever in pretence of love no news can stir but by he door neither can he know that which he must not tell what every man venture in guiana voyage and what they gain he know to a hair whether holland will have peace he know and on what condition and with what success be familiar to he ere it be conclude no post can pass he without a question and rather than he will lose the news he ride back with he to apprise he of tiding and then to the next man he meet he supply the want of he hasty intelligence and make up a perfect tale wherewith he so haunteth the patient auditor that after many excuse he be fain to endure rather the censure of he manners in run away than the tediousness of a impertinent discourse he speech be oft break off with a succession of long parenthesis which he ever vow to fill up ere the conclusion and perhaps would effect it if the other 's ear be as umveariable as he tongue if he see but two man talk and read a letter in the street he run to they and ask if he may not be partner of that secret relation and if they deny it he offer to tell since he may not hear wonder and then fall upon the report of the scottish mine or of the great fish take up at lynne or of the freezing of the thame and after many thanks and admission be hardly entreated silence he undertake as much as he perform little this man will thrust himself forward to be the guide of the way he know not and call at he neighbor 's window and ask why he servant be not at work the market have no commodity which he prizeth not and which the next table shall not hear recite he tongue like the tail of samson 's fox carry firebrand and be enough to set the whole field of the world on a flame himself begin table-talk of he neighbor at another 's board to whom he bear the first news and adjure he to conceal the reporter whose choleric answer he return to he first host enlarged with a second edition so as it use to be do in the sight of unwilling mastiff he clap each on the side apart and provoke they to a eager conflict there can no act pass without he comment which be ever far-fetched rash suspicious dilatory he ear be long and he eye quick but most of all to imperfection which as he easily see so he increase with intermeddle he harbor another man 's servant and amidst he entertainment ask what fare be usual at home what hour be keep what talk passeth they meal what he master 's disposition be what he government what he guest and when he have by curious inquiry extract all the juice and spirit of hope intelligence turn he off whence he come and work on anew he hate constancy as a earthen dulness unfit for man of spirit and love to change he work and he place : neither yet can he be so soon weary of any place as every place be weary of he for as he set himself on work so other pay he with hatred and look how many master he have so many enemy : neither be it possible that any should not hate he but who know he not so then he labor without thanks talk without credit life without love die without tear without pity save that some say it be pity he die no sooner of the superstitious superstition be godless religion devout impiety the superstitious be fond in observation servile in fear he worship god but as he list he give god what he ask not more than he ask and all but what he should give and make more sin than the ten commandment this man dare not stir forth till he breast be cross and he face sprinkle : if but a hare cross he the way he return or if he journey begin unaware on the dismal day or if he stumble at the threshold if he see a snake unkill he fear a mischief if the salt fall towards he he look pale and red and be not quiet till one of the waiter have pour wine on he lap and when he sneezeth think they not he friend that uncover not in the morning he listen whether the crow crieth even or odd and by that token presage of the weather if he hear but a raven croak from the next roof he make he will or if a bittern fly over he head by night but if he troubled fancy shall second he thought with the dream of a fair garden or green rush or the salutation of a dead friend he take leave of the world and say he can not live he will never set to sea but on a Sunday neither ever go without a _ erra pater _ in he pocket saint paul 's day and saint swithin 's with the twelve be he oracle which he dare believe against the almanack when he lie sick on he deathbed no sin trouble he so much as that he do once eat flesh on a Friday no repentance can expiate that the rest need none there be no dream of he without a interpretation without a prediction and if the event answer not he exposition he expound it accord to the event every dark grove and picture wall strike he with a awful but carnal devotion old wife and star be he counsellor he night-spell be he guard and charm he physician he wear paracelsian character for the toothache and a little hallowed wax be he antidote for all evil this man be strangely credulous and call impossible thing miraculous if he hear that some sacred block speak move weep smile he bare foot carry he thither with a offering and if a danger miss he in the way he saint have the thanks some way he will not go and some he dare not either there be bug or he feigneth they every lantern be a ghost and every noise be of chain he know not why but he custom be to go a little about and to leave the cross still on the right hand one event be enough to make a rule out of these he conclude fashion proper to himself and nothing can turn he out of he own course if he have do he task he be safe it matter not with what affection finally if god would let he be the carver of he own obedience he could not have a better subject as he be he can not have a worse of the profane the superstitious have too many god the profane man have none at all unless perhaps himself be he own deity and the world he heaven to matter of religion he heart be a piece of dead flesh without feeling of love of fear of care or of pain from the deaf stroke of a reveng conscience custom of sin have work this senselessness which now have so long entertain that it plead prescription and know not to be alter this be no sudden evil we be bear sinful but have make ourselves profane through many degree we climb to this height of impiety at first he sin and care not now he sinneth and knoweth not appetite be he lord and reason he servant and religion he drudge sense be the rule of he belief and if piety may be a advantage he can at once counterfeit and deride it when aught succeedeth to he he sacrifice to he net and thanks either he fortune or he wit and will rather make a false god than acknowledge the truth if contrary he cry out of destiny and blame he to whom he will not be beholden he conscience would fain speak with he but he will not hear it set the day but he disappoint it and when it cry loud for audience he drown the noise with good fellowship he never name god but in he oath never think of he but in extremity and then he know not how to think of he because he begin but then he quarrel for the hard condition of he pleasure for he future damnation and from himself lay all the fault upon he maker and from he decree fetcheth excuse of he wickedness the inevitable necessity of god 's counsel make he desperately careless so with good food he poison himself goodness be he minstrel neither be any mirth so cordial to he as he sport with god 's fool every virtue have he slander and he jest to laugh it out of fashion every vice he color he usualest theme be the boast of he young sin which he can still joy in though he can not commit and -lrb- if it may be -rrb- he speech make he worse than he be he can not think of death with patience without terror which he therefore fear worse than hell because this he be sure of the other he but doubt of he come to church as to the theater save that not so willingly for company for custom for recreation perhaps for sleep or to feed he eye or he ear as for he soul he care no more than if he have none he love none but himself and that not enough to seek he true good neither care he on whom he tread that he may rise he life be full of license and he practice of outrage he be hate of god as much as he hateth goodness and differ little from a devil but that he have a body of the malcontent he be neither well full nor fasting and though he abound with complaint yet nothing dislike he but the present for what he condemn while it be once past he magnify and strive to recall it out of the jaw of time what he have he seeth not he eye be so take up with what he want and what he see he care not for because he care so much for that which be not when he friend carve he the best morsel he murmur that it be a happy feast wherein each one may cut for himself when a present be send he he ask be this all and what no better and so accept it as if he would have he friend know how much he be bind to he for vouchsafe to receive it it be hard to entertain he with a proportionable gift if nothing he cry out of unthankfulness if little that he be basely regard if much he exclaim of flattery and expectation of a large requital every blessing have somewhat to disparage and distaste it child bring care single life be wild and solitary eminency be envious retiredness obscure fast painful satiety unwieldy religion nicely severe liberty be lawless wealth burdensome mediocrity contemptible everything faulteth either in too much or too little this man be ever headstrong and self-willed neither be he always tie to esteem or pronounce accord to reason some thing he must dislike he know not wherefore but he like they not and otherwhere rather than not censure he will accuse a man of virtue everything he meddleth with he either findeth imperfect or maketh so neither be there anything that soundeth so harsh in he ear as the commendation of another whereto yet perhaps he fashionably and coldly assenteth but with such a after-clause of exception as doth more than mar he former allowance and if he list not to give a verbal disgrace yet he shake he head and smile as if he silence should say i could and will not and when himself be praise without excess he complain that such imperfect kindness have not do he right if but a unseasonable shower cross he recreation he be ready to fall out with heaven and think he be wrong if god will not take he time when to rain when to shine he be a slave to envy and loseth flesh with fret -- not so much at he own infelicity as at other ' good neither have he leisure to joy in he own blessing whilst another prospereth fain would he see some mutiny but dare not raise they and suffer he lawless tongue to walk through the dangerous path of conceited alteration but so as in good manners he have rather thrust every man before he when it come to act nothing but fear keep he from conspiracy and no man be more cruel when he be not manacle with danger he speak nothing but satire and libel and lodgeth no guest in he heart but rebel the inconstant and he agree well in they felicity which both place in change but herein they differ -- the inconstant man affect that which will be the malcontent commonly that which be finally he be a querulous cur whom no horse can pass by without bark at yea in the deep silence of night the very moonshine openeth he clamorous mouth he be the wheel of a well-couched firework that fly out on all side not without scorch itself every ear be long ago weary of he and he be now almost weary of himself give he but a little respite and he will die alone of no other death than other 's welfare of the inconstant the inconstant man tread upon a move earth and keep no pace he proceedings be ever heady and peremptory for he have not the patience to consult with reason but determine merely upon fancy no man be so hot in the pursuit of what he liketh no man sooner weary he be fiery in he passion which yet be not more violent than momentary it be a wonder if he love or hatred last so many day as a wonder he heart be the inn of all good motion wherein if they lodge for a night it be well by morning they be go and take no leave and if they come that way again they be entertain as guest not as friend at first like another ecebolius he love simple truth thence divert he eye he fall in love with idolatry those heathenish shrine have never any more doting and besotted client and now of late he be leap from rome to munster and be grow to giddy anabaptism what he will be next as yet he knoweth not but ere he have winter he opinion it will be manifest he be good to make a enemy of ill for a friend because as there be no trust in he affection so no rancor in he displeasure the multitude of he changed purpose bring with it forgetfulness and not of other more than of himself he say swear renounce because what he promise he mean not long enough to make a impression herein alone he be good for a commonwealth that he set many on work with building ruin alter and make more business than time itself neither be he a greater enemy to thrift than to idleness propriety be to he enough cause of dislike each thing please he better that be not he own even in the best thing long continuance be a just quarrel manna itself grow tedious with age and novelty be the highest style of commendation to the meanest offer neither doth he in book and fashion ask how good but how new variety carry he away with delight and no uniform pleasure can be without a irksome fulness he be so transformable into all opinion manners quality that he seem rather make immediately of the first matter than of well-tempered element and therefore be in possibility anything or everything nothing in present substance finally he be servile in imitation waxy to persuasion witty to wrong himself a guest in he own house a ape of other and in a word anything rather than himself of the flatterer flattery be nothing but false friendship fawn hypocrisy dishonest civility base merchandise of word a plausible discord of the heart and lip the flatterer be blear-eyed to ill and can not see vice and he tongue walk ever in one track of unjust praise and can no more tell how to discommend than to speak true he speech be full of wonder interjection and all he title be superlative and both of they seldom ever but in presence he base mind be well match with a mercenary tongue which be a willing slave to another man 's ear neither regardeth he how true but how please he art be nothing but delightful cozenage whose rule be smooth and guard with perjury whose scope be to make man fool in teach they to overvalue themselves and to tickle he friend to death this man be a porter of all good tale and mend they in the carriage one of fame 's best friend and he own that help to furnish she with those rumor that may advantage himself conscience have no greater adversary for when she be about to play she just part of accusation he stop she mouth with good term and well-near strangleth she with shift like that subtle fish he turn himself into the color of every stone for a booty in himself he be nothing but what pleaseth he great one whose virtue he can not more extol than imitate he imperfection that he may think he worst graceful let he say it be hot he wipe he forehead and unbraceth himself if cold he shiver and call for a warmer garment when he walk with he friend he swear to he that no man else be look at no man talk of and that whomsoever he vouchsafe to look on and nod to be grace enough that he know not he own worth lest he should be too happy and when he tell what other say in he praise he interrupt himself modestly and dare not speak the rest so he concealment be more insinuate than he speech he hang upon the lip which he admireth as if they could let fall nothing but oracle and find occasion to cite some approved sentence under the name he honoureth and when aught be nobly speak both he hand be little enough to bless he sometimes even in absence he extolleth he patron where he may presume of safe conveyance to he ear and in presence so whispereth he commendation to a common friend that it may not be unheard where he mean it he have salve for every sore to hide they not to heal they complexion for every face sin have not any more artificial broker or more impudent bawd there be no vice that have not from he he color he allurement and he best service be either to further guiltiness or smother it if he grant evil thing inexpedient or crime error he have yield much either thy estate give privilege of liberty or thy youth or if neither what if it be ill yet it be pleasant honesty to he be nice singularity repentance superstitious melancholy gravity dulness and all virtue a innocent conceit of the base-minded in short he be the moth of liberal man 's coat the earwig of the mighty the bane of court a friend and a slave to the trencher and good for nothing but to be a factor for the devil of the slothful he be a religious man and wear the time in he cloister and as the cloak of he do nothing plead contemplation yet be he no whit the leaner for he thought no whit learneder he take no less care how to spend time than other how to gain by the expense and when business importune he be more troubled to forethink what he must do than another to effect it summer be out of he favor for nothing but long day that make no haste to they even he love still to have the sun witness of he rise and lie long more for lothness to dress he than will to sleep and after some streak and yawn call for dinner unwashed which have digest with a sleep in he chair he walk forth to the bench in the market-place and look for companion whomsoever he meet he stay with idle question and linger discourse how the day be lengthen how kindly the weather be how false the clock how forward the spring and end ever with what shall we do it please he no less to hinder other than not to work himself when all the people be go from church he be leave sleep in he seat alone he enter bond and forfeit they by forget the day and ask he neighbor when he own field be fallowed whether the next piece of ground belong not to himself he care be either none or too late when winter be come after some sharp visitation he look on he pile of wood and ask how much be crop the last spring necessity drive he to every action and what he can not avoid he will yet defer every change trouble he although to the better and he dulness counterfeit a kind of contentment when he be warn on a jury he have rather pay the mulct than appear all but that which nature will not permit he doth by a deputy and count it troublesome to do nothing but to do anything yet more he be witty in nothing but frame excuse to sit still which if the occasion yield not he coineth with ease there be no work that be not either dangerous or thankless and whereof he foresee not the inconvenience and gainlessness before he enter which if it be verify in event he next idleness have find a reason to patronize it he have rather freeze than fetch wood and choose rather to steal than work to beg than take pain to steal and in many thing to want than beg he be so loth to leave he neighbor 's fire that he be fain to walk home in the dark and if he be not look to wear out the night in the chimney-corner or if not that lie down in he clothes to save two labor he eat and pray himself asleep and dream of no other torment but work this man be a stand pool and can not choose but gather corruption he be descry amongst a thousand

excel in uncleanness for body he have a swollen leg a dusky and swinish eye a blow cheek a drawling tongue a heavy foot and be nothing but a colder earth mould with standing water to conclude be a man in nothing but in speech and shape of the covetous he be a servant to himself yea to he servant and doth base homage to that which should be the worst drudge a lifeless piece of earth be he master yea he god which he shrine in he coffer and to which he sacrifice he heart every face of he coin be a new image which he adore with the highest veneration yet take upon he to be protector of that he worshippeth which he fear to keep and abhor to lose not daring to trust either any other god or he own like a true chemist he turn everything into silver both what he should eat and what he should wear and that he keep to look on not to use when he return from he field he ask not without much rage what become of the loose crust in he cupboard and who have riot among he leek he never eat good meal but on he neighbor 's trencher and there he make amends to he complain stomach for he former and future fast he bid he neighbor to dinner and when they have do send in a trencher for the shot

to come down the desire of rise have swallow up he fear of a fall have once cleave like a burr to some great man 's coat he resolve not to be shake off with any small indignity and find he hold thoroughly fast cast how to insinuate yet nearer and therefore he be busy and servile in he endeavor to please and all he officious respects turn home to himself he can be at once a slave to command a intelligencer to inform a parasite to soothe and flatter a champion to defend a executioner to revenge anything for a advantage of favor he have project a plot to rise and woe be to the friend that stand in he way he still haunteth the court and he unquiet spirit haunteth he which have fetch he from the secure peace of he country rest set he new and impossible task and after many disappointment encourage he to try the same sea in spite of he shipwreck and promise better success a small hope give he heart against great difficulty and draw on new expense new servility persuade he like foolish boy to shoot away a second shaft that he may find the first he yieldeth and now secure of the issue applaud himself in that honor which he still affecteth still misseth and for the last of all trial will rather bribe for a troublesome preferment than return void of a title but now when he find himself desperately cross and at once spoil both of advancement and hope both of fruition and possibility all he desire be turn into rage he thirst be now only of revenge he tongue sound of nothing but detraction and slander now the place he fight for be base he rival unworthy he adversary injurious officer corrupt court infectious and how well be he that may be he own man he own master that may live safely in a mean distance at pleasure free from starve free from burn but if he design speed well ere he be warm in that feat he mind be possess of a higher what he have be but a degree to what he would have now he scorneth what he formerly aspire to he success doth not give he so much contentment as provocation neither can he be at rest so long as he have one either to overlook or to match or to emulate he when he country friend come to visit he he carry he up to the awful presence and now in he sight crowd nearer to the chair of state desire to be look on desire to be speak to by the greatest and study how to offer a occasion lest he should seem unknown unregarded and if any gesture of the least grace fall happily upon he he look back upon he friend lest he should carelessly let it pass without a note and what he wanteth in sense he supply in history he disposition be never but shamefully unthankful for unless he have all he have nothing it must be a large draught whereof he will not say that those few drop do not slake but inflame he so still he think himself the worse for small favor he wit so contrive the likely plot of he promotion as if he would steal it away without god 's knowledge besides he will neither doth he ever look up and consult in he forecast with the supreme moderator of all thing as one that think honor be rule by fortune and that heaven meddleth not with the dispose of these earthly lot and therefore it be just with that wise god to defeat he fairest hope and to bring he to a loss in the hottest of he chase and to cause honor to fly away so much the faster by how much it be more eagerly pursue finally he be a importunate suitor a corrupt client a violent undertaker a smooth factor but untrusty a restless master of he own a bladder puff up with the wind of hope and self-love he be in the common body as a mole in the earth ever unquietly casting and in one word be nothing but a confused heap of envy pride covetousness of the unthrift he range beyond he pale and life without compass he expense be measure not by ability but will he pleasure be immoderate and not honest a wanton eye a liquorish tongue a gamesome hand have impoverish he the vulgar sort call he bountiful and applaud he when he spend and recompense he with wish when he give with pity when he want neither can it be deny that he raught true liberality but overwent it no man could have live more laudably if when he be at the best he have stay there while he be present none of the wealthier guest may pay aught to the shot without much vehemence without danger of unkindness use have make it unpleasant to he not to spend he be in all thing more ambitious of the title of good fellowship than of wisdom when he look into the wealthy chest of he father he conceit suggest that it can not be empty and while he take out some deal every day he perceive not any diminution and when the heap be sensibly abate yet still flatter himself with enough one hand cozen the other and the belly deceive both he doth not so much bestow benefit as scatter they true merit doth not carry they but smoothness of adulation he sens be too much he guide and he purveyor and appetite be he steward he be a impotent servant to he lust and know not to govern either he mind or he purse improvidence be ever the companion of unthriftiness this man can not look beyond the present and neither think nor care what shall be much less suspect what may be and while he lavish out he substance in superfluity think he only know what the world be worth and that other overprize it he feel poverty before he see it never complain till he be pinch with want never spare till the bottom when it be too late either to spend or recover he be every man 's friend save he own and then wrong himself most when he courteth himself with most kindness he vie time with the slothful and it be a hard match whether chase away good hour to worse purpose the one by do nothing or the other by idle pastime he have so dilated himself with the beam of prosperity that he lie open to all danger and can not gather up himself on just warn to avoid a mischief he be good for a almoner ill for a steward finally he be the living tomb of he forefather of he posterity and when he have swallow both be more empty than before he devour they of the envious he feed on other ' evil and have no disease but he neighbor 's welfare whatsoever god do for he he can not be happy with company and if he be put to choose whether he would rather have equal in a common felicity or superior in misery he would demur upon the election he eye cast out too much and never return home but to make comparison with another 's good he be a ill prizer of foreign commodity worse of he own for that he rate too high this under value you shall have he ever inquire into the estate of he equal and betters wherein he be not more desirous to hear all than loth to hear anything over good and if just report relate aught better than he would he redouble the question as be hard to believe what he like not and hope yet if that be aver again to he grief that there be somewhat conceal in the relation which if it be know would argue the commend party miserable and blemish he with secret shame he be ready to quarrel with god because the next field be fairer grown and angrily calculate he cost and time and tillage whom he dare not openly backbite nor wound with a direct censure he strike smoothly with a over cold praise and when he see that he must either maliciously impugn the just praise of another -lrb- which be unsafe -rrb- or approve it by assent he yieldeth but show withal that he means be such both by nature and education that he could not without much neglect be less commendable so he happiness shall be make the color of detraction when a wholesome law be propound he crosseth it either by open or close opposition not for any incommodity or inexpedience but because it proceed from any mouth besides he own and it must be a cause rarely plausible that will not admit some probable contradiction when he equal should rise to honor he strive against it unseen and rather with much cost suborneth great adversary and when he see he resistance vain he can give a hollow gratulation in presence but in secret disparage that advancement either the man be unfit for the place or the place for the man or if fit yet less gainful or more common than opinion whereto he add that himself might have have the same dignity upon better term and refuse it he be witty in devise suggestion to bring he rival out of love into suspicion if he be courteous he be seditiously popular if bountiful he bind over he client to a faction if successful in war he be dangerous in peace if wealthy he lay up for a day if powerful nothing want but opportunity of rebellion he submission be ambitious hypocrisy he religion politic insinuation no action be safe from a jealous construction when he receive a good report of he whom he emulate he saith fame be partial and be wont to blanche mischief and pleaseth himself with hope to find it worse and if ill-will have disperse any more spiteful narration he lay hold on that against all witness and broacheth that rumor for truest because worst and when he see he perfectly miserable he can at once pity he and rejoice what himself can not do other shall not he have gain well if he have hinder the success of what he would have do and could not he conceal he best skill not so as it may not be know that he know it but so as it may not be learn because he would have the world miss he he attain to a foreign medicine by the secret legacy of a die empiric whereof he will leave no heir lest the praise shall be divide finally he be a enemy to god 's favor if they fall beside himself the best nurse of ill-fame a man of the worst diet for he consume himself and delight in

person be much about the same parity that be there you may ask as menippus in lucian which be nireus which thersite which the beggar which the knight -- for they be all suit in the same form of a kind of nasty poverty only to be out at elbow be in fashion here and a great indecorum not to be thread-bare every man shew here like so many wreck upon the sea here the rib of a thousand pound here the relick of so many manor a doublet without button and ` tis a spectacle of more pity than execution be the company one with the other be but a vie of complaint and the cause they have to rail on fortune and fool themselves and there be a great deal of good fellowship in this they be commonly next they creditor most bitter against the lawyer as man that have have a great stroke in assist they hither mirth here be stupidity or hardheartedness yet they feign it sometimes to slip melancholy and keep off themselves from themselves and the torment of think what they have be man huddle up they life here as a thing of no use and wear it out like a old suit the faster the better and he that deceive the time best best spend it it be the place where new comer be most welcome and next they ill news as that which extend they fellowship in misery and leave few to insult : -- and they breath they discontent more securely here and have they tongue at more liberty than abroad man see here much sin and much calamity and where the last do not mortify the other harden as those that be worse here be desperately worse and those from whom the horror of sin be take off and the punishment familiar : and commonly a hard thought pass on all that come from this school which though it teach much wisdom it be too late and with danger : and it be better be a fool than come here to learn it a serve

and a trencher for any greater store of brain it make he but tumultuous and seldom thrive with he he follow he master 's step as well in condition as the street : if he wench or drink he come he in a under kind and think it a part of he duty to be like he he be indeed wholly he master 's of he faction -- of he cut -- of he pleasure : -- he be handsome for he credit and drunk for he credit and if he have power in the cellar command the parish he be one that keep the best company and be none of it for he know all the gentleman he master know and pick from thence some hawk and horse-race term -lrb- 81 -rrb- which he swagger with in the ale-house where he be only call master he mirth be evil jest with the wench and behind the door evil earnest the best work he do be he marry for it make a honest woman and if he follow in it he master 's direction it be commonly the best service he do he a insolent man be a fellow newly great and newly proud one that have put himself into another face upon he preferment for he own be not breed to it one whom fortune have shoot up to some office or authority and he shoot up he neck to he fortune and will not bate you a inch of either he very countenance and gesture bespeak how much he be and if you understand he not he tell you and conclude every period with he place which you must and shall know he be one that look on all man as if he be angry but especially on those of he acquaintance whom he beat off with a surlier distance as man apt to mistake he because they have know he : and for this cause he know not you 'till you have tell he you name which he think he have hear but forget and with much ado seem to recover if you have any thing to use he in you be he vassal for that time and must give he the patience of any injury which he do only to shew what he may do he snap you up bitterly because he will be offend and tell you you be saucy and troublesome and sometimes take you money in this language he very courtesy be intolerable they be do with such a arrogance and imputation and he be the only man you may hate after a good turn and not be ungrateful and man reckon it among they calamity to be beholden unto he no vice draw with it a more general hostility and make man readier to search into he fault and of they he beginning and no tale so unlikely but be willingly hear of he and believe and commonly such man be of no merit at all but make out in pride what they want in worth and fence themselves with a stately kind of behavior from that contempt which would pursue they they be man whose preferment do we a great deal of wrong and when they be down we may laugh at they without breach of good-nature acquaintance be the first draught of a friend whom we must lay down oft thus as the foul copy before we can write he perfect and true : for from hence as from a probation man take a degree in we respect till at last they wholly possess we : for acquaintance be the hoard and friendship the pair choose out of it by which at last we begin to impropriate and inclose to ourselves what before lay in common with other and commonly where it grow not up to this it fall as low as may be and no poorer relation than old acquaintance of whom we only ask how they do for fashion 's sake and care not the ordinary use of acquaintance be but somewhat a more boldness of society a sharing of talk news drink mirth together but sorrow be the right of a friend as a thing nearer we heart and to be deliver with it nothing easier than to create acquaintance the mere be in company once do it whereas friendship like child be engender by a more inward mixture and coupling together when we be acquaint not with they virtue only but they fault they passion they fear they shame -- and be bold on both side to make they discovery and as it be in the love of the body which be then at the height and full when it have power and admittance into the hidden and worst part of it so it be in friendship with the mind when those _ verenda _ of the soul and those thing which we dare not shew the world be bare and detect one to another some man be familiar with all and those commonly friend to none for friendship be a sullener thing be a contractor and taker up of we affection to some few and suffer they not loosely to be scatter on all man the poorest tie of acquaintance be that of place and country which be shift as the place and miss but while the fancy of that continue these be only then gladdest of other when they meet in some foreign region where the encompassing of stranger unite they closer till at last they get new and throw off one another man of part and eminency as they acquaintance be more seek for so they be generally more staunch of it not out of pride only but fear to let too many in too near they : for it be with man as with picture the best show better afar off and at distance and the closer you come to they the coarser they be the best judgment of a man be take from he acquaintance for friend and enemy be both partial whereas these see he truest because calmest and be no way so engage to lie for he and man that grow strange after acquaintance seldom piece together again as those

business and yet no man busier than he and he business be most in he face he be one thrust himself violently into all employment unsent for unfeed and many time unthanked and he part in it be only a eager bustling that rather keep ado than do any thing he will take you aside and question you of you affair and listen with both ear and look earnestly and then it be nothing so much yours as he he snatch what you be do out of you hand and cry give it I and do it worse and lay a engagement upon you too and you must thank he for this pain he lay you down a hundred wild plot all impossible thing which you must be rule by perforce and he deliver they with a serious and counselling forehead and there be a great deal more wisdom in this forehead than he head he will woo for you solicit for you

pardon he if he like he own time better than these because those thing be folly to he now that be wisdom then yet he make we of that opinion too when we see he and conjecture those time by so good a relic he be a man capable of a dearness with the youngest man yet he not youthfuller for they but they older for he and no man credit more he acquaintance he go away at last too soon whensoever with

to pay short a shilling or two in a great sum and be glad to gain that when he can no more he never see friend but in a journey to save the charge of a inn and then only be not sick and he friend never see he but to abuse he he be a fellow indeed of a kind of frantic thrift and one of the strangest thing that wealth can work a mere great man be so much heraldry without honor himself less real than he title he virtue be that he be he father 's son and all the expectation of he to beget another a man that live merely to preserve another 's memory and let we know who die so many year ago one

to be call honest for if he be not this he be nothing : and yet he be not this neither but a good dull vicious fellow that comply well with the debauchment of the time and be fit for it one that have no good part in he to offend he company or make he to be suspect a proud fellow but be sociably a dunce and sociably a drinker that do it fair and above-board without legermain and neither shark for a

and those that commend he be honest fellow a suspicious or jealous man be one that watch himself a mischief and keep a lear eye still for fear it should escape he a man that see a great deal more in every thing than be to be see and yet he think he see nothing : he own eye stand in he light he be a fellow commonly guilty of some weakness which he might conceal if he be careless : -- now he

not a jest throw out but he will make it hit he you shall have he go fret out of company with some twenty quarrel to every man sting and gall and no man know less the occasion than they that have give it to laugh before he be a dangerous matter for it can not be at any thing but at he and to whisper in he company plain conspiracy he bid you speak out and he will answer you when you think not of he

from all thing of that nature for ever this make he glory in the antiquity of he family as if he nobility be the better the further off it be in time as well as desert from that of he predecessor he believe the honor that be leave he as well as the estate be sufficient to support he quality without troubling himself to purchase any more of he own and he meddle we little with the management of the one as the other but trust both to the government of he servant by whom he be equally cheat in both he suppose the empty title of honor sufficient to serve he turn though he have spend the substance and reality of it like the fellow that sell he ass but would not part with the shadow of it or apicius that sell he house and keep only the balcony to see and be see in and because he be privileged

do he good though he know they never will and despise those that would not hurt he if they could the court be he church and he believe as that believe and cry up and down everything as he find it pass there it be a great comfort to he to think that some who do not know he may perhaps take he for a lord and while that thought last he look bigger than usual and forget he acquaintance and that be the reason why he will sometimes know you and sometimes not nothing but want of money or credit put he in mind that he be mortal but then he trust providence that somebody will trust he and in expectation of that hope for a better life and that he debt will never rise up in judgment against he to get in debt be to labor in he vocation but to pay be to forfeit he protection for what be that worth to one

he be like the golden fleece a fine outside on a sheep 's back he be a monster or a indian creature that be good for nothing in the world but to be see he put himself up into a sedan like a fiddle in a case and be take out again for the lady to play upon who when they have do with he let down he treble-string till they be in the humor again he cook and _ valet de chambre _ conspire to dress dinner and he so punctually together that the one may not be ready before the other as peacock and ostrich have the gaudiest and finest feather yet can not fly so all he bravery be to flutter only the beggar

though you know not what to do with he when you have he a court beggar wait at court as a dog do under a table to catch what fall or force it from he fellow if he can when a man be in a fair way to be

undeserving he be provide he be but impudent enough which all such seldom fail to be the better he thrive in he call as other in the same way gain more by they sore and broken limb than those that be

that give they nothing as those few that out of charity give they something when he have pass almost all office as other beggar do from constable to constable and after meet with a stop it do but encourage he to be more industrious in watch the next opportunity to repair the charge he have be at to no purpose he have he emissary that be always hunting out for discovery and when they bring he in anything that he judge too heavy far he own interest to carry he take in other to join with he -lrb- like blind man and cripple that beg in consort -rrb- and if they prosper they share and give the jackal some small snip for he pain in quest that be if he have any further use of he otherwise he leave he like virtue to reward himself and because he deserve well which he do by no means approve of

foreigner to all other place from which he differ in language manner of living and behavior which be as rugged as the coat of a colt that have be breed upon a common the custom of be the best man in he own territory have make he the worst everywhere else he assume the upper end of the table at a ale-house as he birthright receive the homage of he company which be always subordinate and dispense ale and communication like a self-conforming teacher in a conventicle the chief point he treat on be the memoirs of he dog and horse which he repeat as often as a holder-forth that have but two sermon to which if he add the history of he hawk and fishing he be very painful and laborious he do he endeavor to appear a droll but he wit be like he estate within the compass of a hedge be so profound and obscure to a stranger that it require a commentary and be not to be understand without a perfect knowledge of all circumstance of person and the particular idiom of the place he have no ambition to appear a person of civil prudence or understand more than in put off a lame infirm jade for sound wind and limb to which purpose he bring he squirehood and groom to vouch and rather than fail will outswear a affidavit-man the top of he entertainment be horrible strong beer which he pour into he guest -lrb- as the dutch do water into we merchant when they tortured they at amboyna -rrb- till they confess they can drink no more and then he triumph over they as subdue and vanquish no less by the strength of he brain than he drink when he salute a man he lay violent hand upon he and grip and shake he like a fit of a ague and when he accost a lady he stamp with he foot like a french fencer and make a lunge at she in which he always miss he aim too high or too low and hit she on the nose or chin he be never without some rough-handed flatterer that rub he like a horse with a curry-comb till he kick and grunt with the pleasure of it he have old family story and jest that fall to he with the estate and have be leave from heir to heir time out of mind with these he entertain all comer over and over and have add some of he own time which he intend to transmit over to posterity he have but one way of make all man welcome that come to he house and that be by make himself and they drunk while he servant take the same course with theirs which he approve of as good and faithful service and the rather because if he have occasion to tell a strange improbable story they may be in a readiness to vouch with the more impudence and make it a case of conscience to lie as well as drink for he credit all the heroical glory he aspire to be but to be repute a most potent and victorious stealer of deer and beater-up of park to which purpose he have compile commentary of he own great action that treat of he dreadful adventure in the night of give battle in the dark discomfiting of keeper horse the deer on he own back and make off with equal resolution and success a antiquary be one that have he be in this age but he life and conversation be in the day of old he despise the present age as a innovation and slight the future but have a great value for that which be past and go like the madman that fall in love with cleopatra he be a old frippery-philosopher that have so strange a natural affection to worm-eaten speculation that it be apparent he have a worm in he skull he honor he forefather and foremother but condemn he parent as too modern and no better than upstart he neglect himself because he be bear in he own time and so far off antiquity which he so much admire and repine like a younger brother because he come so late into the world he spend the one-half of he time in collect old insignificant trifle and the other in show they which he take singular delight in because the oftener he do it the farther they be from be new to he all he curiosity take place of one another accord to they seniority and he value they not by they ability but they standing he have a great veneration for word that be stricken in year and be grow so aged that they have outlive they employment these he use with a respect agreeable to they antiquity and the good service they have do he throw away he time in inquire after that which be past and go so many age since like one that shoot away a arrow to find out another that be lose before he fetch thing out of dust and ruin like the fable of the chemical plant raise out of its own ash he value one old invention that be lose and never to be recover before all the new one in the world though never so useful the whole business of he life be the same with he that show the tomb at westminster only the one do it for he pleasure and the other for money as every man have but one father but two grandfather and a world of ancestor so he have a proportional value for thing that be ancient and the farther off the greater he be a great time-server but it be of time out of mind to which he conform exactly but be wholly retire from the present he day be spend and go long before he come into the world and since he only business be to collect what he can out of the ruin of they he have so strong a natural affection to anything that be old that he may truly say to dust and worm you be my father and to rottenness thou art my mother he have no providence nor foresight for all he contemplation look backward upon the day of old and he brain be turn with they as if he walk backwards he have rather interpret one obscure word in any old senseless discourse than be author of the most ingenious new one and with scaliger would sell the empire of germany -lrb- if it be in he power -rrb- for a old song he devour a old manuscript with greater relish than worm and moth do and though there be nothing in it value it above anything print which he account but a novelty when he happen to cure a small botch in a old author he be as proud of it as if he have get the philosopher 's stone and could cure all the disease of mankind he value thing wrongfully upon they antiquity forget that the most modern be really the most ancient of all thing in the world like those that reckon they pound before they shilling and penny of which they be make up he esteem no custom but such as have outlive themselves and be long since out of use as the catholic allow of no saint but such as be dead and the fanatic in opposition of none but the live a proud man be a fool in fermentation that swell and boil over like a porridge-pot he set out he feather like a owl to swell and seem bigger than he be he be trouble with a tumor and inflammation of self-conceit that render every part of he stiff and uneasy he have give himself sympathetic love-powder that work upon he to dotage and have transform he into he own mistress he be he own gallant and make most passionate address to he own dear perfection he commit idolatry to himself and worship he own image though there be no soul living of he church but himself yet he believe as the church believe and maintain he faith with the obstinacy of a fanatic he be he own favorite and advance himself not only above he merit but all mankind be both damon and pythia to he own dear self and value he crony above he soul he give place to no man but himself and that with very great distance to all other whom he esteem not worthy to approach he he believe whatsoever he have receive a value in be he as a horse in a nobleman 's stable will bear a greater price than in a common market he be so proud that he be as hard to be acquaint with himself as with other for he be very apt to forget who he be and know himself only superficially therefore he treat himself civilly as a stranger with ceremony and compliment but admit of no privacy he strive to look bigger than himself as well as other and be no better than he own parasite and flatterer a little flood will make a shallow torrent swell above its bank and rage and foam and yield a roaring noise while a deep silent stream glide quietly on so a vain-glorious insolent proud man swell with a little frail prosperity grow big and loud and overflow he bound and when he sink leave mud and dirt behind he he carriage be as glorious and haughty as if he be advance upon man 's shoulder or tumble over they head like knipperdoll he fancy himself a colosse and so he be for he head hold no proportion to he body and he foundation be lesser than he upper storey we can naturally take no view of ourselves unless we look downward to teach we how humble admirer we ought to be of we own value the slighter and less solid he material be the more room they take up and make he swell the bigger as feather and cotton will stuff cushion better than thing of more close and solid part a small poet be one that would fain make himself that which nature never mean he like a fanatic that inspire himself with he own whimsy he set up haberdasher of small poetry with a very small stock and no credit he believe it be invention enough to find out other man 's wit and whatsoever he light upon either in book or company he make bold with as he own this he put together so untowardly that you may perceive he own wit have the rickets by the swell disproportion of the joint imitation be the whole sum of he and he vein be but a itch that he have catch of other and he flame like that of charcoal that be burn before but as he want judgment to understand what be best he naturally take the worst as be most agreeable to he own talent you may know he wit not to be natural ` tis so unquiet and troublesome in he for as those that have money but seldom be always shake they pocket when they have it so do he when he think he have get something that will make he appear he be a perpetual talker and you may know by the freedom of he discourse that he come lightly by it as thief spend freely what they get he measure other man 's wit by they modesty and he own by he confidence he make nothing of write play because he have not wit enough to understand the difficulty this make he venture to talk and scribble as chouse do to play with cunning gamester until they be cheat and laugh at he be always talk of wit as those that have bad voice be always sing out of tune and those that can not play delight to fumble on instrument he grow the unwiser by other man 's harm for the worse other write he find the more encouragement to do so too he greediness of praise be so eager that he swallow anything that come in the likeness of it how notorious and palpable soever and be as shot-free against anything that may lessen he good opinion of himself this render he incurable like disease that grow insensible if you dislike he it be at you own peril he be sure to put in a caveat beforehand against you understanding and like a malefactor in wit be always furnish with exception against he judge this put he upon perpetual apology excuse and defence but still by way of defiance in a kind of whiffling strain without regard of any man that stand in the way of he pageant where he think he may do it safely he will confidently own other man 's writings and where he fear the truth may be discover he will by feeble denial and feign insinuation give man occasion to suppose it if he understand latin or greek he rank himself among the learn despise the ignorant talk criticism out of scaliger and repeat martial 's bawdy epigram and set up he rest wholly upon pedantry but if he be not so well qualify he cry down all learn as pedantic disclaim study and profess to write with as great facility as if he muse be slide down parnassus whatsoever he hear well say he seize upon by poetical license and one way make it he own that be by ill-repeating of it this he believe to be no more theft than it be to take that which other throw away by this mean he writings be like a tailor 's cushion of mosaic work make up of several scrap sew together he call a slovenly nasty description great nature and dull flatness strange easiness he write down all that come in he head and make no choice because he have nothing to do it with that be judgment he be always repeal the old law of comedy and like the long parliament make ordinance in they stead although they be perpetually throw out of coffee-house and come to nothing he be like a italian thief that never rob but he murder to prevent discovery so sure be he to cry down the man from whom he purloin that he petty larceny of wit may pass unsuspected he be but a copier at best and will never arrive to practice by the life for bar he the imitation of something he have read and he have no image in he thought observation and fancy the matter and form of just wit be above he philosophy he appear so over-concerned in all man 's wit as if they be but disparagement of he own and cry down all they do as if they be encroachment upon he he take jest from the owner and break they as justice do false weight and pot that want measure when he meet with anything that be very good he change it into small money like three groat for a shilling to serve several occasion he disclaim study pretend to take thing in motion and to shoot fly which appear to be very true by he often miss of he mark he wit be much trouble with obstruction and he have fit as painful as those of the spleen he fancy himself a dainty spruce shepherd with a flock and a fine silken shepherdess that follow he pipe as rat do the conjurer in germany as for epithet he always avoid those that be near akin to the sense such match be unlawful and not fit to be make by a christian poet and therefore all he care be to choose out such as will serve like a wooden leg to piece out a maimed verse that want a foot or two and if they will but rhyme now and then into the bargain or run upon a letter it be a work of supererogation for similitude he like the hardest and most obscure best for as lady wear black patch to make they complexion seem fairer than they be so when a illustration be more obscure than the sense that go before it it must of necessity make it appear clearer than it do for contrary be best set off with contrary he have find out a way to save the expense of much wit and sense for he will make less than some have prodigally lay out upon five or six word serve forty or fifty line this be a thrifty invention and very easy and if it be commonly know would much increase the trade of wit and maintain a multitude of small poet in constant employment he have find out a new sort of poetical georgic a trick of sowing wit like clover-grass on barren subject which would yield nothing before this be very useful for the time wherein some man say there be no room leave for new invention he will take three grain of wit like the elixir and project it upon the iron age turn it immediately into gold all the business of mankind have presently vanish the whole world have keep holiday there have be no man but hero and poet no woman but nymph and shepherdess tree have bear fritter and river flow plum-porridge we read that virgil use to make fifty or sixty verse in a morning and afterwards reduce they to ten this be a unthrifty vanity and argue he as well ignorant in the husbandry of he own poetry as seneca say he be in that of a farm for in plain english it be no better than bring a noble to nine-penny and as such course bring the prodigal son to eat with hog so they do he to feed with horse which be not much better company and may teach we to avoid do the like for certainly it be more noble to take four or five grain of sense and like a gold-beater hammer they into so many leaf as will fill a whole book than to write nothing but epitome which many wise man believe will be the bane and calamity of learn when he write he commonly steer the sense of he line by the rhyme that be at the end of they as butcher do calf by the tail for when he have make one line which be easy enough and have find out some sturdy hard word that will but rhyme he will hammer the sense upon it like a piece of hot iron upon a anvil into what form he please there be no art in the world so rich in term as poetry a whole dictionary be scarce able to contain they for there be hardly a pond a sheep-walk or a gravel-pit in all greece but the ancient name of it be become a term of art in poetry by this mean small poet have such a stock of able hard word lie by they as dryad hamadryad aonide fauni nympha sylvanus & c that signify nothing at all and such a world of pedantic term of the same kind as may serve to furnish all the new invention and thorough reformation that can happen between this and plato 's great year when he write he never propose any scope or purpose to himself but give he genius all freedom for as he that ride abroad for he pleasure can hardly be out of he way so he that write for he pleasure can seldom be beside he subject it be a ungrateful thing to a noble wit to be confine to anything to what purpose do the ancient feign pegasus to have wing if he must be confine to the road and stage like a pack-horse or be force to be obedient to hedge and ditch therefore he have no respect to decorum and propriety of circumstance for the regard of person time and place be a restraint too servile to be impose upon poetical license like he that make plato confess juvenal to be a philosopher or persius that call the athenian quirite for metaphor he use to choose the hardest and most far-set that he can light upon these be the jewel of eloquence and therefore the harder they be the more precious they must be he 'll take a scant piece of coarse sense and stretch it on the tenterhooks of half-a-score rhyme until it crack that you may see through it and it rattle like a drumhead when you see he verse hang up in tobacco-shop you may say in defiance of the proverb that the weakest do not always go to the wall for ` tis well know the line be strong enough and in that sense may justly take the wall of any that have be write in we language he seldom make a conscience of he rhyme but will often take the liberty to make preach rhyme with cheat vote with rogue and committee-man with hang he 'll make one word of as many joint as the tin-pudding that a juggler pull out of he throat and chop in again what think you of _ glud-fum-flam-hasta-minante _ some of the old latin poet brag that they verse be tougher than brass and harder than marble what would they have do if they have see these verily they would have have more reason to wish themselves a hundred throat than they then have to pronounce they there be some that drive a trade in write in praise of other writer -lrb- like rook that bet on gamester ' hand -rrb- not at all to celebrate the learn author 's merit as they would show but they own wit of which he be but the subject the lechery of this vanity have spawn more writer than the civil law for those whose modesty must not endure to hear they own praise speak may yet publish of themselves the most notorious vapor imaginable for if the privilege of love be allow -- _ dicere quiz puduit scribere jussit amor _ -- why should it not be so in self-love too for if it be wisdom to conceal we imperfection what be it to discover we virtue it be not likely that nature give man great part upon such term as the fairy use to give money to pinch and leave they if they speak of it they say -- praise be but the shadow of virtue and sure that virtue be very foolish that be afraid of its own shadow when he write anagram he use to lay the outside of he verse even -lrb- like a bricklayer -rrb- by a line of rhyme and acrostic and fill the middle with rubbish in this he imitate ben jonson but in nothing else there be one that line a hatcase with a paper of benlowe ' poetry prynne buy it by chance and put a new demi-castor into it the first time he wear it he feel only a singing in he head which within two day turn to a vertigo he be let blood in the ear by one of the state physician and recover but before he go abroad he write a poem of rock and sea in a style so proper and natural that it be hard to determine which be ruggeder there be no feat of activity nor gambol of wit that ever be perform by man from he that vault on pegasus to he that tumble through the hoop of a anagram but benlowe have get the mastery in it whether it be high-rope wit or low-rope wit he have all sort of echo rebus chronogram & c besides carwitchet clench and quibble as for altar and pyramid in poetry he have outdo all man that way for he have make a gridiron and a frying-pan in verse that beside the likeness in shape the very tone and sound of the word do perfectly represent the noise that be make by those utensil such as the old poet call _ sartago loquendus _ when he be a captain he make all the furniture of he horse from the bit to the crupper in beaten poetry every verse be fit to the proportion of the thing with a moral allusion of the sense to the thing as the bridle of moderation the saddle of content and the crupper of constancy so that the same thing be both epigram and emblem even as a mule be both horse and ass some critic be of opinion that poet ought to apply themselves to the imitation of nature and make a conscience of digress from she but he be none of these the ancient magician could charm down the moon and force river back to they spring by the power of poetry only and the modern will undertake to turn the inside of the earth outward -lrb- like a juggler 's pocket -rrb- and shake the chaos out of it make nature show trick like a ape and the star run on errand but still it be by dint of poetry and if poet can do such noble feat they be unwise to descend to mean and vulgar for where the rarest and most common thing be of a price -lrb- as they be all one to poet -rrb- it argue disease in judgment not to choose the most curious hence some infer that the account they give of thing deserve no regard because they never receive anything as they find it into they composition unless it agree both with the measure of they own fancy and the measure of they line which can very seldom happen and therefore when they give a character of any thing or person it do commonly bear no more proportion to the subject than the fish and ship in a map do to the scale but let such know that poet as well as king ought rather to consider what be fit for they to give than other to receive that they be fain to have regard to the exchange of language and write high or low accord as that run for in this age when the smallest poet seldom go below more the most it be a shame for a greater and more noble poet not to outthrow that cut a bar there be a tobacco-man that wrap spanish tobacco in a paper of verse which benlowe have write against the pope which by a natural antipathy that he wit have to anything that be catholic spoil the tobacco for it presently turn mundungus this author will take a english word and like the frenchman that swallow water and spit it out wine with a little heaving and strain would turn it immediately into latin as _ plunderat ilie domo mille hocopokiana _ and a thousand such there be a young practitioner in poetry that find there be no good to be do without a mistress for he that write of love before he have try it doth but travel by the map and he that make love without a dame do like a gamester that play for nothing he think it convenient therefore first to furnish himself with a name for he mistress beforehand that he might not be to seek when he merit or good fortune should bestow she upon he for every poet be he mistress 's godfather and give she a new name like a nun that take order he be very curious to fit himself with a handsome word of a tunable sound but could light upon none that some poet or other have not make use of before he be therefore force to fall to coin and be several month before he could light on one that please he perfectly but after he have overcome that difficulty he find a greater remain to get a lady to own he he accost some of all sort and give they to understand both in prose and verse how incomparably happy it be in he power to make he mistress but could never convert any of they at length he be fain to make he laundress supply that place as a proxy until he good fortune or somebody of better quality would be more kind to he which after a while he neither hope nor care for for how mean soever she condition be before when he have once pretend to she she be sure to be a nymph and a goddess for what greater honor can a woman be capable of than to be translate into precious stone and star no herald in the world can go higher besides he find no man can use that freedom of hyperbole in the character of a person commonly know -lrb- as great lady be -rrb- which we can in describe one so obscure and unknown that nobody can disprove he for he that write but one sonnet upon any of the public person shall be sure to have he reader at every third word cry out what a ass be this to call spanish paper and ceruse lily and rose or clap influence to say the grace be she waiting-woman when they be know to be no better than she bawd that day break from she eye when she look asquint or that she breath perfume the arabian wind when she puff tobacco it be no mean art to improve a language and find out word that be not only remove from common use but rich in consonant the nerve and sinew of speech to raise a soft and feeble language like ours to the pitch of high-dutch as he do that writ -- art rattle foreskin shrill bagpipe quell this be not only the most elegant but most politic way of write that a poet can use for i know no defense like it to preserve a poem from the torture of those that lisp and stammer he that want tooth may as well venture upon a piece of tough horny brawn as such a line for he will look like a ass eating thistle he never begin a work without a invocation of he muse for it be not fit that she should appear in public to show she skill before she be entreat as gentlewoman do not use to sing until they be apply to and often desire i shall not need to say anything of the excellence of poetry since it have be already perform by many excellent person among whom some have lately undertake to prove that the civil government can not possibly subsist without it which for my part i believe to be true in a poetical sense and more probable to be receive of it than those strange feat of building wall and make tree dance which antiquity ascribe to verse and though philosopher be of a contrary opinion and will not allow poet fit to live in a commonwealth they partiality be plainer than they reason for they have no other way to pretend to this prerogative themselves as they do but by remove poet whom they know to have a fairer title and this they do so unjustly that plato who first banish poet he republic forget that that very commonwealth be poetical i shall say nothing to they but only desire the world to consider how happily it be like to be govern by those that be at so perpetual a civil war among themselves that if we should submit ourselves to they own resolution of this question and be content to allow they only fit to rule if they could but conclude it so themselves they would never agree upon it meanwhile there be no less certainty and agreement in poetry than the mathematics for they all submit to the same rule without dispute or controversy but whosoever shall please to look into the record of antiquity shall find they title so unquestioned that the greatest prince in the whole world have be glad to derive they pedigree and they power too from poet alexander the great have no wiser a way to secure that empire to himself by right which he have get by force than by declare himself the son of jupiter and who be jupiter but the son of a poet so caesar and all rome be transport with joy when a poet make jupiter he colleague in the empire and when jupiter govern what do the poet that govern jupiter a philosopher seat himself as spectator and critic on the great theater of the world and give sentence on the plot language and action of whatsoever he see represent accord to he own fancy he will pretend to know what be do behind the scene but so seldom be in the right that he discover nothing more than he own mistake when he profession be in credit in the world and money be to be get by it it divide itself into multitude of sect that maintain themselves and they opinion by fierce and hot contest with one another but since the trade decay and would not turn to account they all fall of themselves and now the world be so unconcerned in they controversy that three reformado sect join in one like epicuro-gassendo-charltoniana will not serve to maintain one pedant he make he hypothesis himself as a tailor do a doublet without measure no matter whether they fit nature he can make nature fit they and whether they be too straight or wide pinch or stuff out the body accordingly he judge of the work of nature just as the rabble do of state affair they see thing do and every man accord to he capacity guess at the reason of they but know nothing of the arcana or secret movement of either they seldom or never be in the right howsoever they please themselves and some other with they fancy and the farther they be off truth the more confident they be they be near it as those that be out of they way believe the farther they have go they be the nearer they journey 's end when they be farthest of all from it he be confident of immaterial substance and he reason be very pertinent that be substantial as he think and immaterial as other do heretofore he beard be the badge of he profession and the length of that in all he polemic be ever account the length of he weapon but when the trade fall that fall too in lucius 's time they be commonly call beard-wearer for all the strength of they wit lay in they beard as samson 's do in he lock but since the world begin to see the vanity of that hare-brained cheat they leave it off to save they credit a melancholy man be one that keep the worst company in the world that be he own and though he be always fall out and quarrel with himself yet he have not power to endure any other conversation he head be haunt like a house with evil spirit and apparition that terrify and fright he out of himself till he stand empty and forsake he sleep and he waking be so much the same that he know not how to distinguish they and many time when he dream he believe he be broad awake and see vision the fume and vapor that rise from he spleen and hypochondria have so smutched and sully he brain -lrb- like a room that smoke -rrb- that he understanding be blear-eyed and have no right perception of anything he soul live in he body like a mole in the earth that labor in the dark and cast up doubt and scruple of he own imagination to make that rugged and uneasy that be plain and open before he brain be so crack that he fancy himself to be glass and be afraid that everything he come near should break he in piece whatsoever make a impression in he imagination work itself in like a screw and the more he turn and wind it the deeper it stick till it be never to be get out again the temper of he brain be earthy cold and dry be apt to breed worm that sink so deep into it no medicine in art or nature be able to reach they he lead he life as one lead a dog in a slip that will not follow but be drag along until he be almost hang as he have it often under consideration to treat himself in convenient time and place if he can but catch himself alone after a long and mortal feud between he inward and he outward man they at length agree to meet without seconds and decide the quarrel in which the one drop and the other slink out of the way and make he escape into some foreign world from whence it be never after hear of he converse with nothing so much as he own imagination which be apt to misrepresent thing to he make he believe that it be something else than it be and that he hold intelligence with spirit that reveal whatsoever he fancy to he as the ancient rude people that first hear they own voice repeat by echo in the wood conclude it must proceed from some invisible inhabitant of those solitary place which they after believe to be god and call they sylvan faun and dryad he make the infirmity of he temper pass for revelation as mahomet do by he fall sickness and inspire himself with the wind of he own hypochondria he lament like heraclitus the maudlin philosopher at other man 's mirth and take pleasure in nothing but he own unsober sadness he mind be full of thought but they be all empty like a nest of box he sleep little but dream much and soundest when he be wake he see vision farther off than a second-sighted man in scotland and dream upon a hard point with admirable judgment he be just so much worse than a madman as he be below he in degree of frenzy for among madman the most mad govern all the rest and receive a natural obedience from they inferior a traveller be a native of all country and a alien at home he fly from the place where he be hatch like a wild goose and prefer all other before it he have no quarrel to it but because he be bear in it and like a bastard he be ashamed of he mother because she be of he he be a merchant that make voyage into foreign nation to drive a trade in wisdom and politics and it be not for he credit to have it think he have make a ill return which must be if he should allow of any of the growth of he own country this make he quack and blow up himself with admiration of foreign part and a generous contempt of home that all man may admire at least the means he have have of improvement and deplore they own defect he observation be like a sieve that let the finer flour pass and retain only the bran of thing for he whole return of wisdom prove to be but affectation a perishable commodity which he will never be able to put off he believe all man 's wit be at a stand that stay at home and only those advance that travel as if change of pasture do make great politician as well as fat calf he pity the little knowledge of truth which those have that have not see the world abroad forget that at the same time he tell we how little credit be to be give to he own relation and those of other that speak and write of they travels he have wear he own language to rag and patch it up with scrap and end of foreign this serve he for wit for when he meet with any of he foreign acquaintance all they smatter pass for wit and they applaud one another accordingly he believe this raggedness of he discourse a great demonstration of the improvement of he knowledge as inns-of-court man intimate they proficiency in the law by the tatters of they gown all the wit he bring home with he be like foreign coin of a baser alloy than we own and so will not pass here without great loss all noble creature that be famous in any one country degenerate by be transplant and those of mean value only improve if it hold with man he fall among the number of the latter and he improvement be little to he credit all he can say for himself be he mind be sick of a consumption and change of air have cure he for all he other improvement have only be to eat in and talk with those he do not understand to hold intelligence with all _ gazette _ and from the sight of statesman in the street unriddle the intrigue of all they council to make a wondrous progress into knowledge by ride with a messenger and advance in politics by mount of a mule run through all sort of learn in a waggon and sound all depths of art in a felucca ride post into the secret of all state and grow acquaint with they close design in inn and hostelry for certainly there be great virtue in highway and hedge to make a able man and a good prospect can not but let he see far into thing a curious man value thing not by they use or worth but scarcity he be very tender and scrupulous of he humor as fanatic be of they conscience and both for the most part in trifle he care not how unuseful anything be so it be but unuseful and rare he collect all the curiosity he can light upon in art or nature not to inform he own judgment but to catch the admiration of other which he believe he have a right to because the rarity be he own that which other man neglect he believe they oversee and store up trifle as rare discovery at least of he own wit and sagacity he admire subtlety above all thing because the more subtle they be the nearer they be to nothing and value no art but that which be spin so thin that it be of no use at all he have rather have a iron chain hang about the neck of a flea than a alderman 's of gold and homer 's iliad in a nutshell than alexander 's cabinet he have rather have the twelve apostle on a cherry-stone than those on st peter 's portico and would willingly sell christ again for that numerical piece of coin that juda take for he he perpetual dotage upon curiosity at length render he one of they and he show himself as none of the meanest of he rarity he so much affect singularity that rather than follow the fashion that be use by the rest of the world he will wear dissent clothes with odd fantastic device to distinguish himself from other like mark set upon cattle he care not what pain he throw away upon the meanest trifle so it be but strange while some pity and other laugh at he ill-employed industry he be one of those that value epictetus 's lamp above the excellent book he write by it if he be a book-man he spend all he time and study upon thing that be never to be know the philosopher 's stone and universal medicine can not possibly miss he though he be sure to do they he be wonderfully take with abstruse knowledge and have rather handle truth with a pair of tong wrap up in mystery and hieroglyphic than touch it with he hand or see it plainly demonstrate to he sens a herald call himself a king because he have power and authority to hang draw and quarter arm for assume a jurisdiction over the distributive justice of title of honor as far as word extend he give himself as great a latitude that way as other magistrate use to do where they have authority and would enlarge it as far as they can ` tis true he can make no lord nor knight of himself but as many squire and gentleman as he please and adopt they into what family they have a mind he dominion abound with all sort of cattle fish and fowl and all manner of manufacture besides whole field of gold and silver which he magnificently bestow upon he follower or sell as cheap as land in jamaica the language they use be barbarous as be but a dialect of pedlar 's french or the egyptian though of a loftier sound and in the propriety affect brevity as the other do verbosity he

only and yet make the basest thing in the world as dog ' turd and woman 's spindle weapon of good and worshipful bearing he be wiser than the fellow that sell he ass but keep the shadow for he own use for he sell only the shadow -lrb- that be the picture -rrb- and keep the ass himself he make pedigree as apothecary do medicine when they put in one ingredient for another that they have not by they by this mean he often make incestuous match and cause the son to many the mother he chief province be at funeral where he command in chief marshal the _ tristitia irritamenta _ and like a gentleman-sower to the worm serve up the feast with all punctual formality he will join as many shield together as would make a roman _ testudo _ or macedonian phalanx to fortify the nobility of a new-made lord that will pay for the impress of they and allow he coat and conduct money he be a kind of a necromancer and can raise the dead out of they grave to make they marry and beget those they

collar he will sell the head or a single joint of a beast or fowl as dear as the whole body like a pig 's head in bartholomew fair and after put off the rest to he customer at the same rate he arm be utterly out of use in war since gun come up have be translate to dish and cup as the ancient use they precious stone accord to the poet _ gemma ad poculum transfert a gladii & c _ and since be like to decay every day more and more for since he give citizen coats-of-arm gentleman have make bold to take they letter of mark by way of reprisal the hangman have a receipt to mar all he work in a moment for by nail the wrong end of a scutcheon upward upon a gibbet all the honor and gentility extinguish of itself like a candle that be hold with the flame downward other arm be make for the spilling of blood but he only purify and cleanse it like scurvy-grass for a small dose take by he prescription will refine that which be as base and gross as bull 's blood -lrb- which the athenian use to poison withal -rrb- to any degree of purity a virtuoso be a well-willer to the mathematics he pursue knowledge rather out of humor than ingenuity and endeavor rather to seem than to be he have nothing of nature but a inclination which he strive to improve with industry but as no art can make a fountain run higher than its own head so nothing can raise he above the elevation of he own pole he seldom converse but with man of he own tendency and wheresoever he come treat with all man as such for as country gentleman use to talk of they dog to those that hate hunting because they love it themselves so will he of he art and science to those that neither know nor care to know anything of they he industry be admirable if it do not attempt the greatest difficulty with the feeblest means for he commonly slight anything that be plain and easy how useful and ingenious soever and bend all he force against the hardest and most improbable though to no purpose if attain to for neither know how to measure he own ability nor the weight of what he attempt he spend he little strength in vain and grow only weaker by it and as man use to blind horse that draw in a mill he ignorance of himself and he undertaking make he believe he have advance when he be no nearer to he end than when he set out first the bravery of difficulty do so dazzle he eye that he prosecute they with as little success as the tailor do he amours to queen elizabeth he differ from a pedant as thing do from word for he use the same affectation in he operation and experiment as the other do in language he be a haberdasher of small art and science and deal in as many several operation as a baby artificer do in engine he will serve well enough for a index to tell what be handle in the world but no further he be wonderfully delighted with rarity and they continue still so to he though he have show they a thousand time for every new admirer that gape upon they set he a-gaping too next these he love strange natural history and as those that read romance though they know they to be fiction be as much affect as if they be true so be he and will make hard shift to tempt himself to believe they first to be possible and then he be sure to believe they to be true forget that belief upon belief be false heraldry he keep a catalogue of the name of all famous man in any profession whom he often take occasion to mention as he very good friend and old acquaintance nothing be more pedantic than to seem too much concerned about wit or knowledge to talk much of it and appear too critical in it all he can possibly arrive to be but like the monkey dance on the rope to make man wonder how ` tis possible for art to put nature so much out of she play he learning be like those letter on a coach where many be writ together no one appear plain when the king happen to be at the university and degree run like wine in conduit at public triumph he be sure to have he share and though he be as free to choose he learning as he faculty yet like st austin 's soul _ creando infunditur infundendo creatur _ nero be the first emperor of he call though it be not much for he credit he be like a elephant that though he can not swim yet of all creature most delight to walk along a river 's side and as in law thing that appear not and thing that be not be all one so he have rather not be than not appear the top of he ambition be to have he picture grave in brass and publish upon wall if he have no work of he own to face with it he want of judgment incline he naturally to the most extravagant undertaking like that of make old dog young tell how many person there be in a room by knock at a door stop up of word in bottle & c he be like he book that contain much knowledge but know nothing themselves he be but a index of thing and word that can direct where they be to be speak with but no farther he appear a great man among the ignorant and like a figure in arithmetic be so much the more as it stand before cipher that be nothing of themselves he call himself a antisocordist a name unknown to former age but spawn by the pedantry of the present he delight most in attempt thing beyond he reach and the greater distance he shoot at the farther he be sure to be off he mark he show he part as drawer do a room at a tavern to entertain they at the expense of they time and patience he invert the moral of that fable of he that caress he dog for fawn and leap up upon he and beat he ass for do the same thing for it be all one to he whether he be applaud by a ass or a wiser creature so he be but applaud a intelligencer would give a penny for any statesman 's thought at any time he travel abroad to guess what prince be design by see they at church or dinner and will undertake to unriddle a government at first sight and tell what plot she go with male or female and discover like a mountebank only by see the public face of affair what private mark there be in the most secret part of the body politic he be so ready at reason of state that he have they like a lesson by rote but as charlatan make disease fit they medicine and not they medicine disease so he make all public affair conform to he own established reason of state and not he reason though the case alter ever so much comply with they he think to obtain a great insight into state affair by observe only the outside pretence and appearance of thing which be seldom or never true and may be resolve several way all equally probable and therefore he penetration into these matter be like the penetration of cold into natural body without any sense of itself or the thing it work upon for all he discovery in the end amount only to entry and equipage address audience and visit with other such politic speculation as the rabble in the street be wont to entertain itself withal nevertheless he be very cautious not to omit he cipher though he write nothing but what every one do or may safely know for otherwise it would appear to be no secret he endeavor to reduce all he politics into maxim as be most easily portable for a travel head though as they be for the most part of slight matter they be but like spirit draw out of water insipid and good for nothing he letter be a kind of bill of exchange in which he draw news and politics upon all he correspondent who place it to account and draw it back again upon he and though it be false neither cheat the other for it pass between both for good and sufficient pay if he drive a inland trade he be factor to certain remote country virtuoso who find themselves unsatisfied with the brevity of the _ gazette _ desire to have exceeding of news besides they ordinary common to furnish those he frequent club and coffee-house the market of news where he engross all he can light upon and if that do not prove sufficient he be force to add a lie or two of he own making which do he double service for it do not only supply he occasion for the present but furnish he with matter to fill up gap in the next letter with retract what he write before and in the meantime have serve for as good news as the best and when the novelty be over it be no matter what become of it for he be better pay for it than if it be true a quibbler be a juggler of word that show trick with they to make they appear what they be not mean for and serve two sens at once like one that play on two jew 's trump he be a fencer of language that falsify he blow and hit where he do not aim he have a foolish sleight of wit that catch at word only and let the sense go like the young thief in the farce that take a purse but give the owner he money back again he be so well verse in all case of quibble that he know when there will be a blot upon a word as soon as it be out he pack he quibble like a stock of card let he but shuffle and cut where you will he will be sure to have it he dance on a rope of sand do the somersault strappado and half-strappado with word play at all manner of game with clinch carwicket and quibble and talk under-leg he wit be left-handed and therefore what other mean for right he apprehend quite contrary all he conception be produce by equivocal generation which make they justly esteem but maggot he ring the change upon word and be so expert that he can tell at first sight how many variation any number of word will bear he talk with a trillo and give he word a double relish he have rather have they bear two sens in vain and impertinently than one to the purpose and never speak without a leer-sense he talk nothing but equivocation and mental reservation and mightily affect to give a word a double stroke like a tennis-ball against two wall at one blow to defeat the expectation of he antagonist he commonly slur every fourth or fifth word and seldom fail to throw doublet there be two sort of quibble the one with word and the other with sense like the rhetorician 's _ figura dictioni et figurae sententiae _ -- the first be already cry down and the other as yet prevail and be the only elegance of we modern poet which easy judge call easiness but have nothing in it but easiness and be never use by any lasting wit will in wiser time fall to nothing of itself a time-server wear he religion reason and understanding always in the mode and endeavor as far as he can to be one of the first in the fashion let it change as oft as it can he make it he business like a politic epicure to entertain he opinion faith and judgment with nothing but what he find to be most in season and be as careful to make he understanding ready accord to the present humor of affair as the gentleman be that use every morning to put on he clothes by the weather-glass he have the same reverend esteem of the modern age as a antiquary have for venerable antiquity and like a glass receive readily any present object but take no notice of that which be past or to come he be always ready to become anything as the time shall please to dispose of he but be really nothing of himself for he that sail before every wind can be bind for no port he account it blasphemy to speak against anything in present vogue how vain or ridiculous soever and arch-heresy to approve of anything though ever so good and wise that be lay by and therefore cast he judgment and understanding upon occasion as buck do they horn when the season arrive to breed new against the next to be cast again he be very zealous to show himself upon all occasion a true member of the church for the time be that have not the least scruple in he conscience against the doctrine or discipline of it as it stand at present or shall do hereafter unsight unseen for he be resolve to be always for the truth which he believe be never so plainly demonstrate as in that character that say it be great and prevail and in that sense only fit to be adhere to by a prudent man who will never be kinder to truth than she be to he for suffer be a very evil effect and not like to proceed from a good cause he be a man of a right public spirit for he resign himself wholly to the will and pleasure of the time and like a zealous implicit patriot believe as the state believe though he neither know nor care to know what that be a prater be a common nuisance and as great a grievance to those that come near he as a pewterer be to he neighbor he discourse be like the bray of a mortar the more impertinent the more voluble and loud as a pestle make more noise when it be ring on the side of a mortar than when it stamp downright and hit upon the business a dog that open upon a wrong scent will do it oftener than one that never open but upon a right he be as long-winded as a ventiduct that fill as fast as it empty or a trade-wind that blow one way for half-a-year together and another as long as if it draw in its breath for six month and blow it out again for six more he have no mercy on any man 's ear or patience that he can get within he sphere of activity but torture he as they correct boy in scotland by stretch they lug without remorse he be like a earwig when he get within a man 's ear he be not easily to be get out again he will stretch a story as unmercifully as he do the ear of those he tell it to and draw it out in length like a breast of mutton at the hercule pillar or a piece of cloth set on the tenter till it be quite spoil and good for nothing if he be a orator that speak _ distincté et ornaté _ though not _ apté _ he deliver he circumstance with the same mature deliberation that one that drink with a gusto swallow he wine as if he be loth to part with it sooner than he must of necessity or a gamester that pull the card that be deal he one by one to enjoy the pleasure more distinctly of see what game he have in he hand he take so much pleasure to hear himself speak that he do not perceive with what uneasiness other man endure he though they express it ever so plainly for he be so divert with he own entertainment of himself that he be not at leisure to take notice of any else he be a siren to himself and have no way to escape shipwreck but by have he mouth stop instead of he ear he play with he tongue as a cat do with she tail and be transport with the delight he give himself of he own make he understand no happiness like that of have a opportunity to show he ability in public and will venture to break he neck to show the activity of he eloquence for the tongue be not only the worst part of a bad servant but of a ill master that do not know how to govern it for then it be like guzman 's wife very headstrong and not sure of foot a disputant be a holder of argument and wager too when he can not make they good he take naturally to controversy like fish in indium that be say to have worm in they head and swim always against the stream the greatest mastery of he art consist in turn and wind the state of the question by which mean he can easily defeat whatsoever have be say by he adversary though excellently to the purpose like a bowler that knock away the jack when he see another man 's bowl lie nearer to it than he own another of he faculty be with a multitude of word to render what he say so difficult to be recollect that he adversary may not easily know what he mean and consequently not understand what to answer to which he secretly reserve a advantage to reply by interpret what he say before otherwise than he at first intend it accord as he find it serve he purpose to evade whatsoever shall be object next to this to pretend not to understand or misinterpret what he antagonist say though plain enough only to divert he from the purpose and to take occasion from he exposition of what he say to start new cavil on the bye and run quite away from the question but when he find himself press home and beat from all he guard to amuse the foe with some senseless distinction like a falsified blow that never hit where ` tis aim but while it be mind make way for some other trick that may pass but that which render he invincible be abundance of confidence and word which be he offensive and defensive arm for a brazen face be a natural helmet or beaver and he that have store of word need not surrender for want of ammunition no matter for reason and sense that go for no more in disputation than the justice of a cause do in war which be understand but by few and commonly regard by none for the custom of disputant be not so much to destroy one another 's reason as to cavil at the manner of express it right or wrong for they believe _ dolus a virtus _ & c ought to be allow in controversy as war and he that get the victory on any term whatsoever deserve it and get it honourably he and he opponent be like two false lute-string that will never stand in tune to one another or like two tennis-player whose greatest skill consist in avoid one another 's stroke a projector be by interpretation a man of forecast he be a artist of plot design and expedient to find out money as other hide it where nobody would look for it he be a great rectifier of the abuse of all trade and mystery yet have but one remedy for all disease that be by get a patent to share with they by virtue of which they become authorised and consequently cease to be cheat he be a great promoter of the public good and make it he care and study to contrive expedient that the nation may not be ill serve with false rag arbitrary puppet-play and insufficient monster of all which he endeavor to get the superintendency he will undertake to render treasonable pedlar that carry intelligence between rebel and fanatic true subject and well-affected to the government for half-a-crown a quarter which he take for give they license to do so securely and uncontrolled he get as much by those project that miscarry as by those that hold -lrb- as lawyer be pay as well for undoing as preserving of man -rrb- for when he have draw in adventurer to purchase share of the profit the sooner it be stop the better it prove for he for he own business be do he be the sooner rid of theirs he be very expert at gauge the understanding of those he deal with and have he engine always ready with mere air to blow all they money out of they pocket into he own as vintner do wine out of one vessel into another he be very amorous of he country and prefer the public good before he own advantage until he have join they both together in some monopoly and then he think he have do he part and may be allow to look after he own affair in the second place the chiefest and most useful part of he talent consist in quack and lie which he call answering of objection and convince the ignorant without this he can do nothing for as it be the common practice of most knavery so it be the surest and best fit to the vulgar capacity of the world and though it render he more ridiculous to some few it always prevail upon the greater part a complementer be one that endeavor to make himself appear a very fine man in persuade another that he be so and by offer those civility which he do not intend to part with believe he add to he own reputation and oblige another for nothing he be very free in make present of he service because he be certain he can not possibly receive in return less than they be worth he differ very much from all other critic in punctilio of honor for he esteem himself very uncivilly deal with if he vow and protestation pass for anything but mere lie and vanity when he give he word he believe it be no longer he and therefore hold it very unreasonable to give it and keep it too he divide he service among so many that there come but little or nothing to any one man 's share and therefore they be very willing to let he take it back again he make over himself in truth to every man but still it be to he own use to secure he title against all other claim and cheat he creditor he be very generous of he promise but still it be without lawful consideration and so they go for nothing he extol a man to he face like those that write in praise of a author to show he own wit not he whom they undertake to commend he have certain set form and routine of speech which he can say over while he think on anything else as a catholic do he prayer and therefore never mean what he say he word flow easily from he but so shallow that they will bear no weight at all all he offer of endearment be but like term of course that carry they own answer along with they and therefore pass for nothing between those that understand they and deceive those only that believe in they he profess most kindness commonly to those he least care for like a host that bid a man welcome when he be go away he have rather be every man 's menial servant than any one man 's friend for servant gain by they master and man often lose by they friend a cheat be a freeman of all trade and all trade of he fraud and treachery be he call though he profession be the strictest integrity and truth he spin net like a spider out of he own entrails to entrap the simple and unwary that light in he way whom he devour and feed upon all the greater sort of cheat be allow by authority have lose they name -lrb- as judge when they be call to the bench be no more style lawyer -rrb- and leave the title to the meaner only and the unallowed the common ignorance of mankind be he province which he order to the best advantage he be but a tame highwayman that do the same thing by stratagem and design which the other do by force make man deliver they understanding first and after they purse oath and lie be he tool that he work with and he get he living by the drudgery of he conscience he endeavor to cheat the devil by mortgage he soul so many time over and over to he forget that he have damnation as priest have absolution of all price he be a kind of a just judgment send into this world to punish the confidence and curiosity of ignorance that out of a natural inclination to error will tempt its own punishment and help to abuse itself he can put on as many shape as the devil that set he on work be one that fish in muddy understanding and will tickle a trout in he own element till he have he in he clutch and after in he dish or the market he run down none but those which he be certain be _ fera natura _ mere natural animal that belong to he that can catch they he can do no feat without the co-operating assistance of the chouse whose credulity commonly meet the impostor half-way otherwise nothing be do for all the craft be not in the catch -lrb- as the proverb say -rrb- but the better half at least in be catch he be one that like a bond without fraud covin and further delay be void and of none effect otherwise do stand and remain in full power force and virtue he trust the credulous with what hope they please at a very easy rate upon they own security until he have draw they far enough in and then make they pay for all at once the first thing he get from he be a good opinion and afterwards anything he please for after he have draw from he guard he deal with he like a surgeon and tie he arm before he let he blood a tedious man talk to no end as well as to no purpose for he would never come at it willingly he discourse be like the road-mile in the north the filthier and dirtier the longer and he delight to dwell the longer upon they to make good the old proverb that say they be good for the dweller but ill for the traveller he set a tale upon the rack and stretch until it become lame and out of joint hippocrate say art be long but he be so for want of art he have a vein of dulness that run through all he say or do for nothing can be tedious that be not dull and insipid digression and repetition like bag and baggage retard he march and put he to perpetual halt he make he approach to a business by oblique line as if he mean to besiege it and fetch a wide compass about to keep other from discover what he design be he be like one that travel in a dirty deep road that move slowly and when he be at a stop go back again and lose more time in picking of he way than in go it how troublesome and uneasy soever he be to other he please himself so well that he do not at all perceive it for though home be homely it be more delightful than finer thing abroad and he that be use to a thing and know no better believe that other man to whom it appear otherwise have the same sense of it that he have as melancholy person that fancy themselves to be glass believe that all other think they so too and therefore that which be tedious to other be not so to he otherwise he would avoid it for it do not so often proceed from a natural defect as affectation and desire to give other that pleasure which they find themselves though it always fall out quite contrary he that converse with he be like one that travel with a companion that ride a lame jade he must either endure to go he pace or stay for he for though he understand long before what he would be at better than he do himself he must have patience and stay for he until with much ado to little purpose he at length come to he for he believe himself injure if he should bate a jot of he own diversion a pretender be easily acquaint with all knowledge but never intimate with any he remember he have see they somewhere before but can not possibly call to mind where he will call a art by its name and claim acquaintance with it at first sight he know it perfectly as the platonic say in the other world but have have the unhappiness to discontinue he acquaintance ever since he occasion call he into this he clap on all the sail he can possibly make though he vessel be empty and apt to overset he be of a true philosophical temper contented with a little desire no more knowledge than will satisfy nature and care not what he want be so he can but keep they from the eye of the world he part be unlimited for as no man know he ability so he do he endeavor that as few should he defect he wear himself in opposition to the mode for he lining be much coarser than he outside and as other line they serge with silk he line he silk with serge all he care be employ to appear not to be for thing that be not and thing that appear not be not only the same in law but in all other affair of the world it should seem that the most impudent face be the best for he that do the shamefulest thing most unconcerned be say to set a good face upon it for the truth be the face be but the outside of the mind but all the craft be to know how ` tis line howsoever he fancy himself as able as any man but not be in a capacity to try the experiment the hint-keeper of gresham college be the only competent judge to decide the controversy he may for anything he know have as good a title to he pretence as another man for judgment be not past in the case -lrb- which shall never be by he means -rrb- he title still stand fair all he can possibly attain to be but to be another thing than nature mean he though a much worse he make that good that pliny say of child _ quus celerius farus cepere tardius ingredus incipiunt _ the apter he be to smatter the slower he be in make any advance in he pretence he trust word before he be thoroughly acquaint with they and they

cheap as he buy he deal in a perishable commodity that will not keep for if it be not fresh it lie upon he hand and will yield nothing true or false be all one to he for novelty be the grace of both a truth grow stale as soon as a lie and as a slight suit will last as well as a better while the fashion hold a lie serve as well as truth till new one come up he be little concerned whether it be good or bad for that do not make it more or less news and if there be any difference he love the bad best because it be say to come soonest for he would willingly bear he share in any public calamity to have the pleasure of hearing and tell it he be deeply read in diurnal and can give as good a account of rowland pepin if need be as another man he tell news as man do money with he finger for he assure they it come from very good hand the whole business of he life be like that of a spaniel to fetch and carry news and when he do it well he be clap on the back and fed for it for he do not take to it altogether like a gentleman for he pleasure but when he light on a considerable parcel of news he know where to put it off for a dinner and quarter himself upon it until he have eat it out and by this mean he drive a trade by retrieve the first news to truck it for the first meat in season and like the old roman luxury ransack all sea and land to please he palate for he import he narrative from all part within the geography of a diurnal and eat as well upon the russ and polander as the english and dutch by this mean he belly be provide for and nothing lie upon he hand but he back which

of error like a pettifogger and reverse of judgment though the case be never so plain he be a mountebank that be always quack of the infirm and diseased part of book to show he skill but have nothing at all to do with the sound he be a very ungentle reader for he read sentence on all author that have the unhappiness to come before he and therefore pedant that stand in fear of he always appeal from he beforehand by the name of momus and zoilus complain sorely of he extra-judicial proceedings and protest against he as corrupt and he judgment void and of none effect and put themselves in the protection of some powerful patron who like a knight-errant be to encounter with the magician and free they from he enchantment a busy man be one that seem to labor in every man 's call but he own and

with all man 's business both public and private and he own be only to expose they he dread nothing so much as to be think at leisure though he be never otherwise for though he be always do he never do anything a pedant be a dwarf scholar that never outgrow the mode and fashion of the school where he should have be teach he wear he little learning unmade-up put it on before it be half finish without press or smooth he study and use word with the greatest respect possible merely for they own sake like a honest man without any regard of interest as they be useful and serviceable to thing and among those he be kindest to stranger -lrb- like a civil gentleman -rrb- that be far from they own country and most unknown he collect old saying and end of verse as antiquary do old coin and be

in get and both be treat at a witch 's feast where nothing feed but only the imagination and like two madman that believe themselves to be the same prince laugh at one another he value he pleasure as they do honor by the difficulty and dearness of the purchase not the worth of the thing and the more he pay the better he believe he ought to be please as woman be fondest of those child which they have groan most for he tongue be like a great practiser 's in law for as the one will not stir so the other will not taste without a great fee he never reckon what a thing cost by what it be worth but what it be worth by what it cost all he sens be like corrupt judge that will understand nothing until they be thoroughly inform and satisfy with a convincing bribe he relish no meat but by the rate and a high price be like sauce to it that give it a high taste and render it savoury to he palate he believe there be nothing dear nor ought to be so that do not cost much and that the dearest buy be always the cheapest he taste all wine by the smallness of the bottle and the greatness of the price and when he be over-reckoned take it as a extraordinary value set upon he as dutchman always reckon by the dignity of the person not the charge of the entertainment he receive put he quality and title into the bill of fare and make he pay for feed upon he own honor and right-worship which he bring along with he he debauch he gluttony with a unnatural appetite to thing never intend for food like preposterous venery or the unnatural mixture of beast of several kind he be as curious of he pleasure

bad humor he should be a man of very great civility for he receive all that he can but never part with any he be like a barren soil plant what you will on he it will never grow nor anything but thorn and thistle that come in with the curse he mother die in child-bed of he for he be descend of the generation of viper in which the dam always eat off the sire 's head and the young one they way through she belly he be like a horse in a pasture that eat up the grass and dung it in requital he put the benefit he receive from other and he own fault together in that end of the sack which he carry behind he back he ill-nature like a contagious disease infect other that be of themselves good who observe he ingratitude become less inclined to do good than otherwise they would be and as the sweetest wine if ill-preserved become the sourest vinegar so the greatest endearment with he turn to the bitterest injury he have a admirable art of forgetfulness and no sooner receive a kindness but he own it by prescription and claim from time out of mind all he acknowledgment appear before he end be serve but never after and like occasion grow very thick before but bare behind he be like a river that run away from the spring that feed it and undermine the bank that support it or like vice and sin that destroy those that be most addict to it or the hangman that break the neck of those whom he get he living by and whip those that find he employment and brand he master that set he on work he plead the act of oblivion for all the good deed that be do he and pardon himself for the evil return he make he never look backward -lrb- like a right statesman -rrb- and thing that be past be all one with he as if they have never be and as witch they say hurt those only from whom they can get something and have a hank upon he no sooner receive a benefit but he convert it to the injury of that person who confer it on he it fare with person as with family that think better of themselves the

mummery and he gospel-walking nothing but dance a masquerade he never wear he own person but assume a shape as he master the devil do when he appear he wear counterfeit hand -lrb- as the italian pickpocket do -rrb- which be fasten to he breast as if he hold they up to heaven while he natural finger be in he neighbor 's pocket the whole scope of all he action appear to be direct like a archer 's arrow at heaven while the clout he aim at stick in the earth the devil bait he hook with he when he fish in troubled water he turn up he eye to heaven like bird that have no upper lid he be a weathercock upon the steeple of the church that turn with every wind that blow from any point of the compass he set he word and action like a printer 's letter and he that will understand he must read

like a spring that run upward within the earth and down without he be a operator for the soul and correct other man 's sin with greater of he own as the jew be punish for they idolatry by greater idolater than themselves he be a spiritual highwayman that rob on the road to heaven he profession and he action agree like a sweet voice and a stink breath a opinionater be he own confidant that maintain more opinion than he be able to support they be all bastard commonly and unlawfully begotten but be he own he have rather out of natural affection take any pain or beg than they should want a subsistence the eagerness and violence he use to defend they argue they be weak for if they be true they would not need it how false soever they be to he he be true to they and as all extraordinary affection of love or friendship be usually upon the meanest account he be resolve never to forsake they how ridiculous soever they render themselves and he to the world he be a kind of a knight-errant that be bind by he order to defend the weak and distressed and deliver enchanted paradox that be bewitch and hold by magician and conjurer in invisible castle he affect to have he opinion as unlike other man 's as he can no matter whether better or worse like those that wear fantastic clothes of they own devise no force of argument can prevail upon he for like a madman the strength of two man in they wit be not able to hold he down he obstinacy grow out of he ignorance for probability have so many way that whosoever understand they will not be confident of any one he hold he opinion as man do they land and though he tenure be litigious he will spend all he have to maintain it he do not so much as know what opinion mean which always suppose uncertainty be not capable of confidence the more implicit he obstinacy be the more stubborn it render he for implicit faith be always more pertinacious than that which can give a account of itself and as coward that be well back will appear boldest he that believe as the church believe be more violent though he know not what it be than he that can give a reason for he faith and as man in the dark endeavor to tread firmer than when they be in the light the darkness of he understanding make he careful to stand fast wheresoever he happen though it be out of he way a choleric man be one that stand for madman and have as many voice as another if he miss he have very hard deal for if he can but come to a fair polling of he fit against he interval he be sure to carry it no doubt it would be a singular advantage to he for as he present condition stand he have more full moon in a week than a lunatic have in a year he passion be like tinder soon set on fire and as soon out again the smallest occasion imaginable put he in he fit and then he have no respect of person strike up the heel of stool and chair tear card limbmeal without regard of age sex or quality and break the bone of dice and make they a dreadful example to deter other from

but a candidate of bedlam and be not yet admit fellow but have the license of the college to practice and in time will not fail to come in accord to he seniority he have he grace for madman and have do he exercise and nothing but he good manners can put he by he degree he be like a foul chimney easily set on fire and then he vapor and flash as if he would burn the house but be presently put out with a greater huff and the mere noise of a pistol reduce he to a quiet and peaceable temper he temper be like that of a meteor a imperfect mixture that sparkle and flash until it have spend itself all he part be irascible and he gall be too big for he liver he spleen make other laugh at he and as soon as he anger be over with other he begin to be angry with himself and sorry he be sick of a preposterous ague and have he hot fit always before he cold the more violent he passion be the sooner it be out like a run knot that strain hardest but be easiest loose he be never very passionate but for trifle and be always most temperate where he have least cause like a nettle that sting worst when it be touch with soft and gentle finger but when it be bruise with rugged hardened hand return no harm at all a superstitious man be more zealous in he false mistaken piety than other be in the truth for he that be in a error have farther to go than one that be in the right way and therefore be concern to bestir himself and make the more speed the practice of he religion be like the schoolman 's speculation full of nicety and trick that take up he whole time and do he more hurt than good he devotions be labor not exercise and he break the sabbath in take too much pain to keep it he make a conscience of so many trifle and nicety that he have not leisure to consider thing that be serious and of real weight he religion be too full of fear and jealousy to be true and faithful and too solicitous and unquiet to continue in the right if it be so and as those that be bungler and unskilful in any art take more pain to do nothing because they be in a wrong way than those that be ready and expert to do the excellentest thing so the error and mistake of he religion engage he in perpetual trouble and anxiety without any possibility of improvement until he unlearn all and begin again upon a new account he talk much of the justice and merit of he cause and yet get so many advocate that it be plain he do not believe himself but have plead not guilty he be concern to defend himself as well as he can while those that confess and put themselves upon the mercy of the court have no more to do he religion be too full of curiosity to be sound and useful and be fitter for a hypocrite than a saint for curiosity be only for show and of no use at all he conscience reside more in he stomach than he heart and howsoever he keep the commandment he never fail to keep a very pious diet and will rather starve than eat erroneously or taste anything that be not perfectly orthodox and apostolical and if living and eating be inseparable he be in the right and life because he eat accord to the truly ancient primitive catholic faith in the purest time a droll play he part of wit readily at first sight and sometimes better than with practice he be excellent at voluntary and prelude but have no skill in composition he will run division upon any ground very dexterously but now and then mistake a flat for a sharp he have a great deal of wit but it be not at he own dispose nor can he command it when he please unless it be in the humor he fancy be counterchange between jest and earnest and the earnest lie always in the jest and the jest in the earnest he treat of all matter and person by way of exercitation without respect of thing time place or occasion and assume the liberty of a free-born englishman as if he be call to the long robe with long ear he impose a hard task upon himself as well as those he converse with and more than either can bear without a convenient stock of confidence he whole life be nothing but a merrymaking and he business the same with a fiddler 's to play to all company where he come and take what they please to give he either of applause or dislike for he can do little without some applauder who by show he ground make he outdo he own expectation many time and theirs too for they that laugh on he side and cry he up give credit to he confidence and sometimes contribute more than half the wit by make it better than he mean he be impregnable to all assault but that of a greater impudence which be stick-free put he like a rough fencer out of he play and after pass upon he at pleasure for when he be once route he never rally again he take a view of a man as a skilful commander do of a town he would besiege to discover the weakest place where he may make he approach with the least danger and most advantage and when he find himself mistaken draw off he force with admirable caution and consideration for he business be only wit he think there be very little of that show in expose himself to any inconvenience the obstinate man do not hold opinion but they hold he for when he be once possess with a error ` tis like the devil not to be cast out but with great difficulty whatsoever he lay hold on like a drown man he never lose though it do but help to sink he the sooner he ignorance be abrupt and inaccessible impregnable both by art and nature and will hold out to the last though it have nothing but rubbish to defend it be as dark as pitch and stick as fast to anything it lay hold on he skull be so thick that it be proof against any reason and never crack but on the wrong side just opposite to that against which the impression be make which surgeon say do happen very frequently the slighter and more inconsistent he opinion be the faster he hold they otherwise they would fall asunder of themselves for opinion that be false ought to be hold with more strictness and assurance than those that be true otherwise they will be apt to betray they owner before they be aware if he take to religion he have faith enough to save a hundred wiser man than himself if it be right but it be too much to be good and though he deny supererogation and utterly disclaim any overplus of merit yet he allow superabundant belief and if the violence of faith will carry the kingdom of heaven he stand fair for it he delight most of all to differ in thing indifferent no matter how frivolous they be they be weighty enough in proportion to he weak judgment and he will rather suffer self-martyrdom than part with the least scruple of he freehold for it be impossible to dye he dark ignorance into a lighter color he be resolve to understand no man 's reason but he own because he find no man can understand he but himself he wit be like a sack which the french proverb say be tie faster before it be full than when it be and he opinion be like plant that grow upon rock that stick fast though they have no root he understanding be harden like pharaoh 's heart and be proof against all sort of judgment whatsoever a zealot be a hot-headed brother that have he understanding block up on both side like a fore-horse 's eye that he see only straight-forwards and never look about he which make he run on accord as he be drive with he own caprice he start and stop -lrb- as a horse do -rrb- at a post only because he do not know what it be and think to run away from the spur while he carry it with he he be very violent as all thing that tend downward naturally be for it be impossible to improve or raise he above he own level he run swiftly before any wind like a ship that have neither freight nor ballast and be as apt to overset when he zeal take fire it crack and fly about like a squib until the idle stuff be spend and then it go out of itself he be always trouble with small scruple which he conscience catch like the itch and the rubbing of these be both he pleasure and he pain but for thing of greater moment he be unconcerned as cattle in the summer-time be more pester with fly that vex they sore than creature more considerable and dust and mote be apter to stick in blear-eye than thing of greater weight he charity begin and end at home for it never go farther nor stir abroad david be eat up with the zeal of god 's house but he zeal quite contrary eat up god 's house and as the word seem to intimate that david fed and maintain the priest so he make the priest feed and maintain he and hence he zeal be never so vehement as when it concur with he interest for as he style himself a professor it fare with he as with man of other profession to live by he call and get as much as he can by it he be very severe to other man 's sin that he own may pass unsuspected as those that be engage in the conspiracy against nero be most cruel to they own confederate or as one say -- compound for sin he be incline to by damn those he have no mind to the overdoer always throw beyond the jack and be go a mile he be no more able to contain himself than a bowl be when he be command to rub with the greatest power and vehemence imaginable and nothing light in he way he be a conjurer that can not keep within the compass of he circle though he be sure the devil would fetch he away for the least transgression he always overstock he ground and starve instead of feed destroy whatsoever he have a extraordinary care for and like a ape hug the whelp he love most to death all he design be greater than the life and he laugh to think how nature have mistake she match and give he so much odds that he can easily outrun she he allow of no merit but that which be superabundant all he action be superfoetation that either become monster or twin that be too much or the same again for he be but a supernumerary and do nothing but for want of a better he be a civil catholic that hold nothing more steadfastly than supererogation in all that he undertake for he undertake nothing but what he overdo he be insatiable in all he action and like a covetous person never know when he have do enough until he have spoil all by do too much he be he own antagonist and be never satisfy until he have outdo himself as well as that which he propose for he love to be better than he word -lrb- though it always fall out worse -rrb- and deceive the world the wrong way he believe the mean to be but a mean thing and therefore always run into extremity as the more excellent great and transcendent he delight to exceed in all he attempt for he find that a goose that have three leg be more remarkable than a hundred that have but two apiece and have a greater number of follower and that all monster be more visit and apply to than other creature that nature have make perfect in they kind he believe he can never bestow too much pain upon anything for he industry be he own and cost he nothing and if it miscarry he lose nothing for he have as much as it be worth he be like a foolish musician that set he instrument so high that he break he string for want of understand the right pitch of it or a archer that break he with overbending and all he do be force like one that sing above the reach of he voice the rash man have a fever in he brain and therefore be rightly say to be hot-headed he reason and he action run downhill bear headlong by he unstaid will he have not patience to consider and perhaps it would not be the better for he if he have for he be so possess with the first apprehension of anything that whatsoever come after lose the race and be prejudge all he action like sin lead he perpetually to repentance and from thence to the place from whence they come to make more work for repentance for though he be correct never so often he be never amend nor will he haste give he time to call to mind where it

within compass but it will be always upon the ramble and playing of trick upon a frolic fancy of pass upon religion state and the person of those that be in present authority no matter how to whom or where for he discretion be always out of the way when he have occasion to make use of it the affect or formal be a piece of clockwork that move only as it be wind up and set and not like a voluntary

drink and not walk but proceed not go but march he draw up himself with admirable conduct in a very regular and well-ordered body all he business and affair be juncture and transaction and when he speak with a man he give he audience he do not carry but marshal himself and no one member of he body politic take place of another without due right of precedence he do all thing by rule of proportion and never give himself the freedom to manage he glove or he watch in a irregular and arbitrary way but be always ready to render a account of he demeanor to the most strict and severe disquisition he set he face as if it be cast in plaster and never admit of any commotion in he countenance nor so much as the innovation of a smile without serious and mature deliberation but preserve he look in a judicial way accord as they have always be establish a flatterer be a dog that fawn when he bite he hang bell in a man 's ear as a carman do by he horse while he lay a heavy load upon he

say to do child in the cradle -rrb- and after change he for a fool he whistle to he as a carter do to he horse while he whip out he eye and make he draw what he please he find out he humor and feed it till it will come to hand and then he lead he whither he please he tickle he as they do trout until he lay hold on he and then devour and feed upon he he tickle he ear with a straw and while he be

and inn and throw himself out of he coach at come the caster he should be a good husband for he have make more of he estate in one year than he ancestor do in twenty he dust he estate as they do a stand of ale in the north he money in he pocket -lrb- like hunt venison -rrb- will not keep if it be not spend presently it grow stale and be throw away he possess he estate as the devil do the herd of swine and be run it into the sea as fast as he can he have shoot it with a zampatan and it will presently fall all to dust he have bring he acre into a consumption and they be strangely fall away

prison when he have spend all upon he pleasure and have nothing leave for sustenance he espouse a hostess dowager and resolve to lick himself whole again out of ale and make it pay he back all the charge it have put he to the inconstant have a vagabond soul without any settle place of abode like the wander jew he head be unfixed out of order and utterly unserviceable upon any occasion he be very apt to be take with anything but nothing can hold he for he presently break loose and give it the slip he head be trouble with a palsy which render it perpetually waver and incapable of rest he head be like a hour-glass that part that be uppermost always run out until it be turn and then run out again he opinion be too violent to last for like other thing of the same kind in nature they

change color with every object he come near he pull off he judgment as commonly as he hat to every one he meet with he word and he deed be all one for when he have give he word he have do and never go farther he judgment be unsound have the same operation upon he that a disease have upon a sick man that make he find some ease in turn from side to side and still the last be the most uneasy a glutton eat he child as the poet say saturn do and carry he felicity and all he concernment in he paunch if he have live when all the member of the body rebel against the stomach there have be no possibility of accommodation he entrails be like the sarcophagus that devour dead body in a small space or the indian zampatan that consume flesh in a moment he be a great dish make on purpose to carry meat he eat out he own head and he horse ' too he know no grace but grace before meat nor mortification but in fast if the body be the tabernacle of the soul he live in a sutler 's hut he celebrate mass or rather mess to the idol in he belly and like a papist eat he adoration a third course be the third heaven to he and he be ravish into it a feast be a good conscience to he and he be trouble in mind when he miss of it he tooth be very industrious in they call and he chop like a bridewell perpetually hatchel he deprave he appetite with _ haut-goust _ as old fornicator do they lechery into fulsomeness and stink he lick himself into the shape of a bear as those beast be say to do they whelp he new form himself in he own belly and become another thing than god and nature mean he he belly take place of the rest of he member and walk before in state he eat out that which eat all thing else -- time -- and be very curious to have all thing in season at he meal but he hour which be commonly at midnight and so late that he pray too late for he daily bread unless he mean he natural daily bread he be admirably learn in the doctrine of meat and sauce and deserve the chair in _ juris-prudentium _ that be in the skill of pottage at length he eat he life out of house and home and become a treat for worm sell he clothes to feed he gluttony and eat himself naked as the first of he family adam do a ribald be the devil 's hypocrite that endeavor to make himself appear worse than he be he evil word and bad manners strive which shall most corrupt one another and it be hard to say which have the advantage he vent he lechery at the mouth as some fish be say to engender he be a unclean beast that chew the cud for after he have satisfy he lust he bring it up again into he mouth to a second enjoyment and play a after-game of lechery with he tongue much worse than that which the _ cunnilingus _ use among the old roman he strip nature stark naked and clothes she in the most fantastic and ridiculous fashion a wild imagination can invent he be worse and more nasty than a dog for in he broad description of other ' obscene action he do but lick up the vomit of another man 's surfeit he tell tale out of a vaulting-school a lewd bawdy tale do more hurt and give a worse example than the thing of which it be tell for the act extend but to few and if it be conceal go no farther but the report of it be unlimited and may be convey to all people and all time to come he expose that with he tongue which nature give woman modesty and brute beast tail to cover he mistake ribaldry for wit though nothing be more unlike and believe himself to be the finer man the filthier he talk as if he be above civility as fanatic be above ordinance and hold nothing more shameful than to be ashamed of anything he talk nothing but aretine 's picture as plain as the scotch dialect which be esteem to be the most copious and elegant of the kind he improve and husband he sin to the best advantage and make one vice find employment for another for what he act loosely in private he talk as loosely of in public and find as much pleasure in the one as the other he endeavor to purchase himself a reputation by pretend to that which the best man abominate and the worst value not like one that clip and wash false coin and venture he neck for that which will yield he nothing a modern politician make new discovery in politics but they be like those that columbus make of the new world very rich but barbarous he endeavor to restore mankind to the original condition it fall from by forget to discern between good and evil and reduce all prudence back again to its first author the serpent that teach adam wisdom for he be really he tutor and not samboscor as the rabbin write he find the world have be mistake in all age and that religion and morality be but vulgar error that pass among the ignorant and be but mere word to the wise he despise all learn as a pedantic little thing and believe book to be the business of child and not of man he wonder how the distinction of virtue and vice come into the world 's head and believe they to be more ridiculous than any foppery of the school he hold it he duty to betray any man that shall take he for so much a fool as one fit to be trust he steadfastly believe that all man be bear in the state of war and that the civil life be but a cessation and no peace nor accommodation and though all open act of hostility be forborne by consent the enmity continue and all advantage by treachery or breach of faith be very lawful that there be no difference between virtue and fraud among friend as well as enemy nor anything unjust that a man can do without damage to he own safety or interest that oath be but springe to catch woodcock withal and bind none but those that be too weak and feeble to break they when they become ever so small a impediment to they advantage that conscience be the effect of ignorance and the same with that foolish fear which some man apprehend when they be in the dark and alone that honor be but the word which a prince give a man to pass he guard withal and save he from be stop by law and justice the sentinel of government when he have not wit nor credit enough to pass of himself that to show respect to worth in any person be to appear a stranger to it and not so familiarly acquaint with it as those be who use no ceremony because it be no new thing to they as it would appear if they should take notice of it that the easiest way to purchase a reputation of wisdom and knowledge be to slight and undervalue it as the readiest way to buy cheap be to bring down the price for the world will be apt to believe a man well provide with any necessary or useful commodity which he set a small value upon that to oblige a friend be but a kind of cast he in prison after the old roman way or modern chinese that chain the keeper and prisoner together for he that bind another man to himself bind himself as much to he and lay a restraint upon both for as man commonly never forgive those that forgive they and always hate those that purchase they estate -lrb- though they pay dear and more than any man else would give -rrb- so they never willingly endure those that have lay any engagement upon they or at what rate soever purchase the least part of they freedom and as partner for the most part cheat or suspect one another so no man deal fairly with another that go the least share in he freedom to propose any measure to wealth or power be to be ignorant of the nature of both for as no man can ever have too much of either so it be impossible to determine what be enough and he that limit he desire by propose to himself the enjoyment of any other pleasure but that of gain more show he have but a dull inclination that will not hold out to he journey 's end and therefore he believe that a courtier deserve to be beg himself that be ever satisfy with beg for fruition without desire be but a dull entertainment and that pleasure only real and substantial that provoke and improve the appetite and increase in the enjoyment and all the greatest master in the several art of thrive concur unanimously that the plain downright pleasure of gain be greater and deserve to be prefer far before all the various delight of spending which the curiosity wit or luxury of mankind in all age could ever find out he believe there be no way of thrive so easy and certain as to grow rich by defraud the public for public thievery be more safe and less prosecute than private like robbery commit between sun and sun which the county pay and no one be greatly concern in and as the monster of many head have less wit in they all than any one reasonable person so the monster of many purse be easier cheated than any one indifferent crafty fool for all the difficulty lie in be trust and when he have obtain that the business do itself and if he should happen to be question and call to a account a pardon be as cheap as a paymaster 's fee not above fourteenpence in the pound he think that when a man come to wealth or preferment and be to put on a new person he first business be to put off all he old friendship and acquaintance as thing below he and no way consistent with he present condition especially such as may have occasion to make use of he or have reason to expect any civil return from he for requite of obligation receive in a man 's necessity be the same thing with pay of debt contract in he minority when he be under age for which he be not accountable by the law of the land these he be to forget as fast as he can and by little neglect remove they to that distance that they may at length by he example learn to forget he for man who travel together in company when they occasion lie several way ought to take leave and part it be a hard matter for a man that come to preferment not to forget himself and therefore he may very well be allow to take the freedom to forget other for advancement like the conversion of a sinner give a man new value of thing and person so different from those he have before that that which be wont to be most dear to he do commonly after become the most disagreeable and as it be account noble to forget and pass over little injury so it be to forget little friendship that be no better than injury when they become disparagement and can only be importune and troublesome instead of be useful as they be before all act of oblivion have of late time be find to extend rather to loyal and faithful service do than rebellion and treason commit for benefit be like flower sweet only and fresh when they be newly gather but stink when they grow stale and wither and he only be ungrateful who make return of obligation for he do it merely to free himself from owe so much as thanks fair word be all the civility and humanity that one man owe to another for they be oblige enough of themselves and need not the assistance of deed to make they good for he that do not believe they have already receive too much and he that do ought to expect no more and therefore promise ought to oblige those only to whom they be make not those who make they for he that expect a man should bind himself be worse than a thief who do that service for he after he have rob he on the highway promise be but word and word air which no man can claim a propriety in but be equally free to all and incapable of be confine and if it be not yet he who pay debt which he can possibly avoid do but part with he money for nothing and pay more for the mere reputation of honesty and conscience than it be worth he prefer the way of apply to the vice and humor of great person before all other method of get into favor for he that can be admit into these office of privacy and trust seldom fail to arrive at greater and with greater ease and certainty than those who take the dull way of plain fidelity and merit for vice like beast be fond of none but those that feed they and where they once prevail all other consideration go for nothing they be he own flesh and blood bear and breed out of he and he have a stronger natural affection for they than all other relation whatsoever and he that have a interest in these have a greater power over he than all other obligation in the world for though they be but he imperfection and infirmity he be the more tender of they as a lame member or diseased limb be more carefully cherish than all the rest that be sound and in perfect vigor all office of this kind be the greatest endearment be real flattery enforce by deed and action and therefore far more prevalent than those that be perform but by word and fawn though very great advantage be daily obtain that way and therefore he esteem flattery as the next most sure and successful way of improve he interest for flattery be but a kind of civil idolatry that make image to itself of virtue worth and honor in some person that be utterly void of all and then fall down and worship they and the more dull and absurd these application be the better they be always receive for man delight more to be present with those thing they want than such as they have no need nor use of and though they condemn the reality of those honor and renown that be falsely imputed to they they be wonderfully affect with they false pretence for dream work more upon man 's passion than any wake thought of the same kind and many out of a ignorant superstition give more credit to they than the most rational of all they vigilant conjecture how false soever they prove in the event no wonder then if those who apply to man 's fancy and humor have a stronger influence upon they than those that seek to prevail upon they reason and understanding especially in thing so delightful to they as they own praise no matter how false and apparently incredible for great person may wear counterfeit jewel of any carat with more confidence and security from be discover than those of meaner quality in whose hand the greatness of they value -lrb- if they be true -rrb- be more apt to render they suspect a flatterer be like mahomet 's pigeon that pick he food out of he master 's ear who be willing to have it believe that he whisper oracle into it and accordingly set a high esteem upon the service he do he though the impostor only design he own utility for man be for the most part better pleased with other man 's opinion though false of they happiness than they own experience and find more pleasure in the dullest flattery of other than all the vast imagination they can have of themselves as no man be apt to be tickle with he own finger because the applause of other be more agreeable to those high conceit they have of themselves which they be glad to find confirm and be the only music that set they a-dancing like those that be bite with a tarantula he account it a argument of great discretion and as great temper to take no notice of affront and indignity put upon he by great person for he that be insensible of injury of this nature can receive none and if he lose no confidence by they can lose nothing else for it be greater to be above injury than either to do or revenge they and he that will be deter by those discouragement from prosecute he design will never obtain what he propose to himself when a man be once know to be able to endure insolence easier than other can impose they they will raise the siege and leave he as impregnable and therefore he resolve never to omit the least opportunity of press he affair for fear of be baffle and affront for if he can at any rate render himself master of he purpose he would not wish a easier nor a cheaper way as he know how to repay himself and make other receive those insolence of he for good and current payment which he be glad to take before and he esteem it no mean glory to show he temper of such a compass as be able to reach from the highest arrogance to the meanest and most dejected submission a man that have endure all sort of affront may be allow like a apprentice that have serve out he time to set up for himself and put they off upon other and if the most common and approved way of grow rich be to gain by the ruin and loss of those who be in necessity why should not a man be allow as well to make himself appear great by debase those that be below he for insolence be no inconsiderable way of improve greatness and authority in the opinion of the world if all man be bear equally fit to govern as some late philosopher affirm he only have the advantage of all other who have the best opinion of he own ability how mean soever they really be and therefore he steadfastly believe that pride be the only great wise and happy virtue that a man be capable of and the most compendious and easy way to felicity for he that be able to persuade himself impregnably that he be some great and excellent person how far short soever he fall of it find more delight in that dream than if he be really so and the less he be of what he fancy himself to be the better he be pleased as man covet those thing that be forbid and deny they more greedily than those that be in they power to obtain and he that can enjoy all the best reward of worth and merit without the pain and trouble that attend it have a better bargain than he who pay as much for it as it be worth this he perform by a obstinate implicit believe as well as he can of himself and as meanly of all other man for he hold it a kind of self-preservation to maintain a good estimation of himself and as no man be bind to love he neighbor better than himself so he ought not to think better of he than he do of himself and he that will not afford himself a very high esteem will never spare another man any at all he who have make so absolute a conquest over himself -lrb- which philosopher say be the greatest of all victory -rrb- as to be receive for a prince within himself be greater and more arbitrary within he own dominion than he that depend upon the uncertain love or fear of other man without he and since the opinion of the world be vain and for the most part false he believe it be not to be attempt but by way as false and vain as itself and therefore to appear and seem be much better and wiser than really to be whatsoever be well esteem in the general value of the world next pride he believe ambition to be the only generous and heroical virtue in the world that mankind be capable of for as nature give man a erect figure to raise he above the grovel condition of he fellow-creature the beast so he that endeavor to improve that and raise himself higher seem best to comply with the design and intention of nature though the stature of man be confine to a certain height yet he mind be unlimited and capable of grow up to heaven and as those who endeavor to arrive at that perfection be adore and reverence by all so he that endeavor to advance himself as high as possibly he can in this world come nearest to the condition of those holy and divine aspirer all the purest part of nature always tend upward and the more dull and heavy downward so in the little world the noblest faculty of man he reason and understanding that give he a prerogative above all other earthly creature mount upward and therefore he who take that course and still aspire in all he undertaking and design do but conform to that which nature dictate be not the reason and the will the two commanding faculty of the soul still strive which shall be uppermost man honor none but those that be above they contest with equal and disdain inferior the first thing that god give man be dominion over the rest of he inferior creature but he that can extend that over man improve he talent to the best advantage how be angel distinguish but by dominion power throne and principality then he who still aspire to purchase those come nearest to the nature of those heavenly minister and in all probability be most like to go to heaven no matter what destruction he make in he way if he do but attain he end for nothing be a crime that be too great to be punish and when it be once arrive at that perfection the most horrid action in the world become the most admire and renowned bird that build highest be most safe and he that can advance himself above the envy or reach of he inferior be secure against the malice and assault of fortune all religion have ever be persecute in they primitive age when they be weak and impotent but when they propagate and grow great have be receive with reverence and adoration by those who otherwise have prove they cruellest enemy and those that afterwards oppose they have suffer as severely as those that first profess they so thief that rob in small party and break house when they be take be hang but when they multiply and grow up into army and be able to take town the same thing be call heroic action and acknowledge for such by all the world court of justice for the most part commit greater crime than they punish and do those that sue in they more injury than they can possibly receive from one another and yet they be venerable and must not be tell so because they have authority and power to justify what they do and the law -lrb- that be whatsoever they please to call so -rrb- ready to give judgment for they who know when a physician cure or kill and yet he be equally reward for both and the profession esteem never the less worshipful and therefore he account it a ridiculous vanity in any man to consider whether he do right or wrong in anything he attempt since the success be only able to determine and satisfy the opinion of the world which be the one and which the other as for those character and mark of distinction which religion law and morality fix upon both they be only significant and valid when they authority be able to command obedience and submission but when the greatness number or interest of those who be concerned outgrow that they change they nature and that which be injury before become justice and justice injury it be with crime as with invention in the mechanic that will frequently hold true to all purpose of the design while they be try in little but when the experiment be make in great prove false in all particulars to what be promise in the model : so iniquity and vice may be punish and correct like child while they be little and impotent but when they be great and sturdy they become incorrigible and proof against all the power of justice and authority among all he virtue there be none which he set so high a esteem upon as impudence which he find more useful and necessary than a vizard be to a highwayman for he that have but a competent stock of this natural endowment have a interest in any man he please and be able to manage it with greater advantage than those who have all the real pretence imaginable but want that dexterous way of solicit by which if the worst fall out he be sure to lose nothing if he do not win he that be impudent be shot-free and if he be ever so much overpower can receive no hurt for he forehead be impenetrable and of so excellent a temper that nothing be able to touch it but turn edge and be blunt he face hold no correspondence with he mind and therefore whatsoever inward sense or conviction he feel there be no outward appearance of it in he look to give evidence against he and in any difficulty that can befall he impudence be the most infallible expedient to fetch he off that be always ready like he angel guardian to relieve and rescue he in he greatest extremity and no outward impression nor inward neither though he own conscience take part against he be able to beat he from he guard though innocence and a good conscience be say to be a brazen wall a brazen confidence be more impregnable and longer able to hold out for it be a greater affliction to a innocent man to be suspect than it be to one that be guilty and impudent to be openly convict of a apparent crime and in all the affair of mankind a brisk confidence though utterly void of sense be able to go through matter of difficulty with greater ease than all the strength of reason less boldly enforce as the turk be say by a small slight handling of they bow to make a arrow without a head pierce deeper into hard body than gun of greater force be able to do a bullet of steel and though it be but a cheat and imposture that have neither truth nor reason to support it yet it thrive better in the world than thing of greater solidity as thorn and thistle flourish on barren grounds where nobler plant would starve and he that can improve he barren part by this excellent and most compendious method deserve much better in he judgment than those who endeavor to do the same thing by the more studious and difficult way of downright industry and drudging for impudence do not only supply all defect but give they a greater grace than if they have need no art as all other ornament be commonly nothing else but the remedy or disguise of imperfection and therefore he think he very weak that be unprovided of this excellent and most useful quality without which the best natural or acquire part be of no more use than the guanch ' dart which the virtuoso say be head with butter harden in the sun it serve he to innumerable purpose to press on and understand no repulse how smart or harsh soever for he that can fail nearest the wind have much the advantage of all other and such be the weakness or vanity of some man that they will grant that to obstinate importunity which they would never have do upon all the most just reason and consideration imaginable as those that watch witch will make they confess that which they would never have do upon any other account he believe a man 's word and he meaning should never agree together for he that say what he think lay himself open to be expound by the most ignorant and he who do not make he word rather serve to conceal than discover the sense of he heart deserve to have it pull out like a traitor 's and show publicly to the rabble for as a king they say can not reign without dissemble so private man without that can not govern themselves with any prudence or discretion imaginable this be the only politic magic that have power to make a man walk invisible give he access into all man 's privacy and keep all other out of he which be as great a odds as it be to discover what card those he play with have in they hand and permit they to know nothing of he and therefore he never speak he own sense but that which he find come nearest to the meaning of those he converse with as bird be draw into net by pipe that counterfeit they own voice by this mean he possess man like the devil by get within they before they be aware turn they out of themselves and either betray or render they ridiculous as he find it most agreeable either to he humor or he occasion as for religion he believe a wise man ought to possess it only that he may not be observe to have free himself from the obligation of it and so teach other by he example to take the same freedom for he who be at liberty have a great advantage over all those whom he have to deal with as all hypocrite find by perpetual experience that one of the best use that can be make of it be to take measure of man 's understanding and ability by it accord as they be more or less serious in it for he think that no man ought to be much concern in it but hypocrite and such as make it they calling and profession who though they do not live by they faith like the righteous do that which be nearest to it get they living by it and that those only take the surest course who make they best advantage of it in this world and trust to providence for the next to which purpose he believe it be most properly to be rely upon by all man he admire good nature as only good to those who have it not and laugh at friendship as a ridiculous foppery which all wise man easily outgrow for the more a man love another the less he love himself all regard and civil application should like true devotion look upward and address to those that be above we and from whom we may in probability expect either good or evil but to apply to those that be we equal or such as can not benefit or hurt we be a far more irrational idolatry than worship of image or beast all the good that can proceed from friendship be but this that it put man in a way to betray one another the best parent who be commonly the worst man have naturally a tender kindness for they child only because they believe they be a part of themselves which show that self-love be the original of all other and the foundation of that great law of nature self-preservation for no man ever destroy himself wilfully that have not first leave off to love himself therefore a man 's self be the proper object of he love which be never so well employ as when it be keep within its own confines and not suffer to straggle every man be just so much a slave as he be concern in the will inclination or fortune of another or have anything of himself out of he own power to dispose of and therefore he be resolve never to trust any man with that kindness which he take up of himself unless he have such security as be most certain to yield he double interest for he that do otherwise be but a jew and a turk to himself which be much worse than to be so to all the world beside friend be only friend to those who have no need of they and when they have become no longer friend like the leaf of tree that clothe the wood in the heat of summer when they have no need of warmth but leave they naked when cold weather come and since there be so few that prove otherwise it be not wisdom to rely on any he be of opinion that no man be so fit to be employ and trust as fool or knave for the first understand no right the other regard none and whensoever there fall out a occasion that may prove of great importance if the infamy and danger of the dishonesty be not too apparent they be the only person that be fit for the undertaking they be both equally greedy of employment the one out of a itch to be think able and the other honest enough to be trust as by use and practice they sometimes prove for the general business of the world lie for the most part in routine and form of which there be none so exact observer as those who understand nothing else to divert they as carter use to blind they fore-horse on both side that they may see only forward and so keep the road the better and man that aim at a mark use to shut one eye that they may see the surer with the other if fool be not notorious they have far more person to deal with of they own elevation -lrb- who understand one another better -rrb- than they have of those that be above they which render they fitter for many business than wiser man and they believe themselves to be so for all for no man ever think himself a fool that be one so confident do they ignorance naturally render they and confidence be no contemptible qualification in the management of human affair and as blind man have secret artifice and trick to supply that defect and find out they way which those who have they eye and be but hoodwink be utterly unable to do so fool have always little craft and fraud in all they transaction which wiser man would never have think upon and by those they frequently arrive at very great wealth and as great success in all they undertaking for all fool be but feeble and impotent knave that have as strong and vehement inclination to all sort of dishonesty as the most notorious of those engineer but want ability to put they in practice and as they be always find to be the most obstinate and intractable people to be prevail upon by reason or conscience so they be as easy to submit to they superior -- that be knave -- by whom they be always observe to be govern as all corporation be wont to choose they magistrate out of they own member as for knave they be commonly true enough to they own interest and while they gain by they employment will be careful not to disserve those who can turn they out when they please what trick soever they put upon other and therefore such man prove more useful to they in they design of gain and profit than those whose conscience and reason will not permit they to take that latitude and since buffoonery be and have always be so delightful to great person he hold he very improvident that be to seek in a quality so induce that he can not at least serve for want of a better especially since it be so easy that the greatest part of the difficulty lie in confidence and he that can but stand fair and give aim to those that be gamester do not always lose he labor but many time become well esteem for he generous and bold demeanor and a lucky repartee hit upon by chance may be the making of a man this be the only modern way of run at tilt with which great person be so delighted to see man encounter one another and break jest as they do lance heretofore and he that have the best beaver to he helmet have the greatest advantage and as the former pass upon the account of valor so do the latter on the score of wit though neither perhaps have any great reason for they pretence especially the latter that depend much upon confidence which be commonly a great support to wit and therefore believe to be its betters that ought to take place of it as all man be greater than they dependent so pleasant it be to see man lessen one another and strive who shall show himself the most ill-natured and ill-mannered as in cuff all blow be aim at the face so it fare in these rencounter where he that wear the toughest leather on he visage come off with victory though he have ever so much the disadvantage upon all other account for a buffoon be like a mad dog that have a worm in he tongue which make he bite at all that light in he way and as he can do nothing alone but must have somebody to set he that he may throw at he that perform that office with the greatest freedom and be contented to be laugh at to give he patron pleasure can not but be understand to have do very good service and consequently deserve to be well reward as a mountebank 's pudding that be content to be cut and slash and burn and poison without which he master can show no trick deserve to have a considerable share in he gain as for the meanness of these way which some may think too base to be employ to so excellent a end that import nothing for what dislike soever the world conceive against any man 's undertaking if they do but succeed and prosper it will easily recant its error and applaud what it condemn before and therefore all wise man have ever justly esteem it a great virtue to disdain the false value it commonly set upon all thing and which itself be so apt to retract for as those who go uphill use to stoop and bow they body forward and sometimes creep upon they hand and those that descend to go upright so the lower a man stoop and submit in these endearing office the more sure and certain he be to rise and the more upright he carry himself in other matter the more like in probability to be ruin and this he believe to be a wiser course for any man to take than to trouble himself with the knowledge of art or arm for the one do but bring a man a unnecessary trouble and the other as unnecessary danger and the shortest and more easy way to attain to both be to despise all other man and believe as steadfastly in himself as he can -- a better and more certain course than that of merit what he gain wickedly he spend as vainly for he hold it the greatest happiness that a man be capable of to deny himself nothing that he desire can propose to he but rather to improve he enjoyment by glory in he vice for glory be one end of almost all the business of this world he who omit that in the enjoyment of himself and he pleasure lose the greatest part of he delight and therefore the felicity which he suppose other man apprehend that he receive in the relish of he luxury be more delightful to he than the fruition itself a modern statesman own he election from free grace in opposition to merit or any foresight of good work for he be choose not for he ability or fitness for he employment but like a _ tale _ in a jury for happen to be near in court if there be any other consideration in it -lrb- which be a hard question to the wise -rrb- it be only because he be hold able enough to be a counsellor-extraordinary for the indifference and negligence of he understanding and consequent probability of do no hurt if no good for why should not such prove the safest physician to the body politic as well as they do to the natural or else some near friend or friend 's friend help he to the place that engage for he honesty and good behavior in it howsoever he be able to sit still and look wise accord to he best skill and cunning and though he understand no reason serve for one that do and be most steadfastly of that opinion that be most like to prevail if he be a great person he be choose as alderman be in the city for be rich enough and fine to be take in as those do to be leave out and money be the measure of all thing it be sufficient to justify all he other talent and render they like itself good and current as for wisdom and judgment with those other out-of-fashioned qualification which have be so highly esteemed heretofore they have not be find to be so useful in this age since it have invent scantling for politics that will move with the strength of a child and yet carry matter of very great weight and that raillery and fooling be prove by frequent experiment to be the more easy and certain way for as the german heretofore be observe to be wisest when they be drunk and know not how to dissemble so be we modern statesman when they be mad and use no reserved cunning in they consultation and as the church of rome and that of the turk esteem ignorant person the most devout there seem no reason why this age that seem to incline to the opinion of they both should not as well believe they to be the most prudent and judicious for heavenly wisdom do by the confession of man far exceed all the subtlety and prudence of this world the heathen priest of old never deliver oracle but when they be drunk and mad or distract and who know why we modern oracle may not as well use the same method in all they proceedings howsoever he be as ably qualify to govern as that sort of opinion that be say to govern all the world and be perpetually false and foolish and if he opinion be always so they have the fairer title to they pretension he be swear to advise no further than he skill and cunning will enable he and the less he have of either the sooner he despatch he business and despatch be no mean virtue in a statesman a duke of buck be one that have study the whole body of vice he part be disproportionate to the whole and like a monster he have more of some and less of other than he should have he have pull down all that fabric that nature raise in he and build himself up again after a model of he own he have dam up all those light that nature make into the noblest prospects of the world and open other little blind loophole

extravagant way as be sick and tired with the old continual wine woman and music put false value upon thing which by custom become habitual and debauch he understanding so that he retain no right notion nor sense of thing and as the same dose of the same physic have no operation on those that be much use to it so he pleasure require a larger proportion of excess and variety to render he sensible of they he rise eat and go to bed by the julian account long after all other that go by the new style and keep the same hour with owl and the antipode he be a great observer of the tartar ' custom and never eat till the great cham have dine make proclamation that all the world may go to dinner he do not dwell in he house but haunt it like a evil spirit that walk all night to disturb the

as he patient he do not talk to a man but attack he and whomsoever he can get into he hand he lay violent language on if he can he will run a man up against a wall and hold he at a bay by the button which he handle as bad as he do he person or the business he treat upon when he find he begin to sink he hold he by the clothes and feel he as a butcher do a calf before he kill he he be a walk

of man he put off the old man but put it on again upon the new one and make he pagan vice serve to preserve he christian virtue from wear out for if he should use he piety and devotion always it would hold out but a little while he be loth that iniquity and vice should be throw away as long as there may be good use for it for if that which be wickedly get may be dispose to pious use why should not wickedness itself as well he believe himself shot-free against all the attempt of the devil the world and the flesh and therefore be not afraid to attack they in they own quarter and encounter they at they own weapon for as strong body may freely venture to do and suffer that without any hurt to themselves which would destroy those that be feeble so a saint that be strong in grace may boldly engage

but if it have be he fate to have be whelp in old rome he have pass for a prodigy and be receive among rain of stone and the speaking of bull and would have put a stop to all public affair until he have be expiate nero clothe christian in the skin of wild beast but he wrap wild beast in the skin of christian a amorist be a artificer or maker of love a swear servant to all lady like a officer in a corporation though no one in particular will own any title to he yet he never fail upon all occasion to offer he service and they as seldom to turn it back again untouched he commit nothing with they but himself to they good grace and they recommend he back again to he own where he find so kind a reception that he wonder how he do fail of it everywhere else he passion be as easily set on fire as a fart and as soon out again he be charge and prime with love-powder like a gun and the least sparkle of a eye give fire to he and off he go but seldom or never hit the mark he have commonplace and precedent of repartee and letter for all occasion and fall as readily into he method of make love as a parson do into he form of matrimony he converse as angel be say to do by intuition and express himself by sigh most significantly he follow he visit as man do they business and be very industrious in wait on the lady where he affair lie among which those of greatest concernment be question and command purpose and other such received form of wit and conversation in which he be so deeply study that in all question and doubt that arise he be appeal to and very learnedly declare which be the most true and primitive way of proceeding in the purest time for these virtue he never fail of he summons to all ball where he manage the country-dance with singular judgment and be frequently a assistant at _ l'ombre _ and these be all the use they make of he part beside the sport they give themselves in laugh at he which he take for singular favor and interpret to he own advantage though it never go further for all he employment be public he be never admit to any private service and they despise he as not woman 's meat for he apply to too many to be trust by any one as bastard by have many father have none at all he go often mount in a coach as a convoy to guard the lady to take the dust in hyde park where by he prudent management of the glass window he secure they from beggar and return fraught with china-orange and ballad thus he be but a gentleman-usher-general and he business be to carry one lady 's service to another and bring back the other 's in exchange a astrologer be one that expound upon the planet and teach to construe the accident by the due join of star in construction he talk with they by dumb sign and can tell what they mean by they twinkling and squint upon one another as well as they themselves he be a spy upon the star and can tell what they be do by the company they keep and the house they frequent they have no power to do anything alone until so many meet as will make a quorum he be clerk of the committee to they and draw up all they order that concern either public or private affair he keep all they account for they and sum they up not by debtor but creditor alone -- a more compendious way they do ill to make they have so much authority over the earth which perhaps have as much as any one of they but the sun and as much right to sit and vote in they council as any other but because there be but seven elector of the german empire they will allow of no more to dispose of all other and most foolishly and unnaturally dispossess they own parent of its inheritance rather than acknowledge a defect in they own rule these rule be all they have to show for they title and yet not one of they can tell whether those they have they from come honestly by they virgil 's description of fame that reach from earth to the star _ tam fictus pravique tenax _ to carry lie and knavery will serve astrologer without any sensible variation he be a fortune-seller a retailer of destiny and petty chapman to the planet he cast nativity as gamester do false dice and by slur and palm sextile quartile and trine like _ six quatre trois _ can throw what chance he please he set a figure as cheat do a main at hazard and gull throw away they money at it he fetch the grounds of he art so far off as well from reason as the star that like a traveller he be allow to lie by authority and as beggar that have no money themselves believe all other have and beg of those that have as little as themselves so the ignorant rabble believe in he though he have no more reason for what he profess than they a lawyer be a retailer of justice that use false light false weight and false measure he measure right and wrong by he retain fee and like a french duellist engage on that side that first bespeak he though it be against he own brother not because it be right but merely upon a punctilio of profit which be better than honor to he because riches will buy nobility and nobility nothing as have no intrinsic value he sell he opinion and engage to maintain the title against all that claim under he but no further he put it off upon he word which he believe himself not bind to make good because when he have part with he right to it it be no longer he he keep no justice for he own use as be a commodity of he own growth which he never buy but only sell to other and as no man go worse shod than the shoemaker so no man be more out of justice than he that get he living by it he draw bill as child do lot at a lottery and be pay as much for blank as prize he undo a man with the same privilege as a doctor kill he and be pay as well for it as if he preserve he in which he be very impartial but in nothing else he believe it no fault in himself to err in judgment because that part of the law belong to the judge and not to he he best opinion and he worst be all of a price like good wine and bad in a tavern in which he do not deal so fairly as those who if they know what you be willing to bestow can tell how to fit you accordingly when he law lie upon he hand he will afford a good pennyworth and rather pettifog and turn common barreter than be out of employment he opinion be one thing while it be he own and another when it be pay for for the property be alter the case alter also when he counsel be not for he client 's turn he will never take it back again though it be never the worse nor allow he anything for it yet will sell the same over and over again to as many as come to he for it he pride increase with he practice and the fuller of business he be like a sack the bigger he look he crowd to the bar like a pig through a hedge and he gown be fortify with flanker about the shoulder to guard he ear from be gall with elbow he draw he bill more extravagant and unconscionable than a tailor for if you cut off two-third in the begin middle or end that which be leave will be more reasonable and nearer to sense than the whole and yet he be pay for all for when he draw up a business like a captain that make false muster he produce as many loose and idle word as he can possibly come by until he have receive for they and then turn they off and retain only those that be to the purpose this he call drawing of breviate all that appear of he study be in short time convert into waste-paper tailor 's measure and head for child 's drum he appear very violent against the other side and rail to please he client as they do child give I a blow and i 'll strike he ah naughty & c this make he seem very zealous for the good of he client and though the cause go against he he lose no credit by it especially if he fall foul on the counsel of the other side which go for no more among they than it do with those virtuous person that quarrel and fight in the street to pick the pocket of those that look on he hang man 's estate and fortune on the slightest curiosity and feeblest nicety imaginable and undo they like the story of break a horse 's back with a feather or sink a ship with a single drop of water as if right and wrong be only notional and have no relation at all to practice -lrb- which always require more solid foundation -rrb- or reason and truth do wholly consist in the right spelling of letter whena the subtler thing be the nearer they be to nothing so the subtler word and notion be the nearer they be to nonsense he overrun latin and french with greater barbarism than the goth do italy and france and make as mad a confusion of language by mix both with english nor do he use english much better for he clog it so with word that the sense become as thick as puddle and be utterly lose to those that have not the trick of skip over where it be impertinent he have but one termination for all latin word and that be a dash he be very just to the first syllable of word but always bobtail the last in which the sense most of all consist like a cheat that do a man all right at the first that he may put a trick upon he in the end he be a apprentice to the law without a master be he own pupil and have no tutor but himself that be a fool he will screw and wrest law as unmercifully as a tumbler do he body to lick up money with he tongue he be a swiss that profess mercenary arm will fight for he that give he best pay and like a italian bravo will fall foul on any man 's reputation that he receive a retain fee against if he could but maintain he opinion as well as they do he he be a very just and righteous man but when he have make he most of it he leave it like he client to shift for itself he fetch money out of he throat like a juggler and as the rabble in the country value gentleman by they housekeeping and they eating so be he suppose to have so much law as he have keep common and the abler to deal with client by how much the more he have devour of inns-of-court mutton and it matter not whether he keep he study so he have but keep common he never end a suit but prune it that it may grow the faster and yield a greater increase of strife the wisdom of the law be to admit of all the petty mean real injustice in the world to avoid imaginary possible great one that may perhaps fall out he client find the scripture fulfil in he that it be better to part with a coat too than go to law for a cloak for as the best law be make of the worst manners even so be the best lawyer of the worst man he hum about westminster hall and return home with he pocket like a bee with he thigh laden and that which horace say of a ant _ ore trahit quodcunque potest atque addit acervo _ be true of he for he gather all he heap with the labor of he mouth rather than he brain and hand he value himself as a carman do he horse by the money he get and look down upon all that gain less as scoundrel the law be like that double-formed ill-begotten monster that be keep in a intricate labyrinth and feed with man 's flesh for it devour all that come within the maze of it and have not a clue to find the way out again he have as little kindness for the statute law as catholic have for the scripture but adore the common law as they do tradition and both for the very same reason for the statute law be certain write and design to reform and prevent corruption and abuse in the affair of the world -lrb- as the scripture be in matter of religion -rrb- he find it many time a great obstruction to the advantage and profit of he practice whereas the common law be unwritten or write in a unknown language which very few understand but himself be the more pliable and easy to serve all he purpose be utterly expose to what interpretation and construction he interest and occasion shall at any time incline he to give it and differ only from arbitrary power in this that the one give no account of itself at all and the other such a one as be perhaps worse than none that be implicit and not to be understand or subject to what construction he please to put upon it : -- great critic in a _ noverint

undo the only way you hate a epigrammatist be a poet of small wares whose muse be short-winded and quickly out of breath she fly like a goose that be no sooner upon the wing but down again he be originally one of those author that use to write upon white wall from whence he work be collect and put together pass in the world like single money among those that deal in small matter he wit be like fire in a flint that be nothing while it be in and nothing again as soon as it be out he treat of all thing and person that come in he way but like one that draw in little much less than the life : -- he bus ` ness be t ' inveigh and flatter like parcel parasite and satyr he be a kind of vagabond writer that be never out of he way for nothing be beside the purpose with he that propose none at

account in word at length but only in figure all he wit reach but to four line or six at the most and if he ever venture farther it tire immediately like a post-horse that will go no farther than he wonted stage nothing agree so naturally with he fancy as bawdry which he dispense in small pittance to continue he reader still in a appetite for more a fanatic st paul be think by festus to be mad

ship that will not endure a storm and be of no use at all in a calm he believe it have enough of the primitive christian if it be but persecute as that be no matter for the piety or doctrine of it as if there be nothing require to prove the truth of a religion but the punishment of the professor of it like the old mathematician that be never believe to be profoundly know in they profession until they have run through all punishment and just escape the fork he be all for suffer for religion but nothing for act for he account good work no better than encroachment upon the merit of free believe

nothing more difficult than a change of religion for the better for as all alteration in judgment be derive from a precedent confess error that error be more probably like to produce another than anything of so different a nature as truth he impose upon himself in believe the infirmity of he nature to be the strength of he judgment and think he change he religion when he change himself and turn as naturally from one thing to another as a maggot do to a fly he be a kind of freebooty and plunder or one head of cattle drive by the priest of one religion out of the quarter of another and they value he above two of they own for beside the glory of the exploit they have a better title to he -lrb- as he that be conquer be more in the power of he that subdue he than he that be bear he subject -rrb- and they expect a freer submission from one that take quarter than from those that be under command before he weakness or ignorance or both be commonly the chief cause of he conversion for if he be a man of a profession that have no hope to thrive upon the account of mere merit he have no way so easy and certain as to betake himself to some forbid church where for the common cause 's sake he find so much brotherly love and kindness that they will rather employ he than one of another persuasion though more skilful and he gain by turn and wind he religion as tradesman do by they stock the priest have commonly the very same design upon he for he that be not able to go to the charge of he conversion may live free enough from be attack by any side he be trouble with a vertigo in he conscience and nothing but change of religion like change of air could cure he he be like a sick man that can neither lie still in he bed nor turn himself but as he be help by other he be like a revolter in a army and as man of honor and commander seldom prove such but common soldier man of mean condition frequently to mend they fortune so in religion clergyman who be commander seldom prevail upon one another and when they do the proselyte be usually one who have no reputation among he own party before and after a little trial find as little among those to whom he revolt a clown be a centaur a mixture of man and beast like a monster engender by unnatural copulation a crab engraft on a apple he be neither make by art nor nature but in spite of both by evil custom he perpetual conversation with beast have render he one of they and he be among man but a naturalised brute he appear by he language genius and behavior to be a alien to mankind a foreigner to humanity and of so opposite a genius that ` tis easier to make a spaniard a frenchman than to reduce he to civility he disdain every man that he do not fear and only respect he that have do he hurt or can do it he be like nebuchadnezzar after he have be a month at grass but will never return to be a man again as he do if he might for he despise all manner of life but he own unless it be he horse 's to whom he be but _ valet de chambre _ he never show himself humane or kind in anything but when he pimp to he cow or make a match for he mare in all thing else he be surly and rugged and do not love to be pleased himself which make he hate those that do he any good he be a stoic to all passion but fear envy and malice and hate to do any good though it cost he nothing he abhor a gentleman because he be most unlike himself and repine as much at he manner of living as if he maintain he he murmur at he as the saint do at the wicked as if he keep he right from he for he make he clownery a sect and damn all that be not of he church he manure the earth like a dunghill but let himself lie fallow for no improvement will do good upon he cain be the first of he family and he do he endeavor not to degenerate from the original churlishness of he ancestor he that be fetch from the plough to be make dictator have not half he pride and insolence nor caligulum 's horse that be make consul all the worst name that be give to man be borrow from he as villain deboise peasant & c he wear he clothes like a hide and shift they no oftener than a beast do he hair he be a beast that gesner never think of a wooer stand candidate for cuckold and if he miss of it it be none of he fault for he merit be sufficiently know he be commonly no lover but able to pass for a most desperate one where he find it be like to prove of considerable advantage to he and therefore have passion lie by he of all size proportionable to all woman 's fortune and can be indifferent melancholy or stark-mad accord as they estate give he occasion and when he find it be to no purpose can presently come to himself again and try another he prosecute he suit against he mistress as client do a suit in law and do nothing without the advice of he learn counsel omit no advantage for want of solicit and when he get she consent overthrow she he endeavor to match he estate rather than himself to the best advantage and if he mistress 's fortune and he do but come to a agreement they person be easily satisfy the match be soon make up and a cross marriage between all four be presently conclude he be not much concern in he lady 's virtue for if the opinion of the stoic be true that the virtuous be always rich there be no doubt but she that be rich must be virtuous he never go without a list in he pocket of all the widow and virgin about the town with particulars of they jointure portion and inheritance that if one miss he may not be without a reserve for he esteem cupid very improvident if he have not more than two string to he bow when he want a better introduction he begin he address to the chambermaid like one that sue the tenant to eject the landlord and accord as he thrive there make he approach to the mistress he can tell readily what the difference be between jointure with tuition of infant land and money of any value and what the odds be to a penny between they all either to take or leave he do not so much go a-wooing as put in he claim as if all man of fortune have a fair title to all woman of the same quality and therefore be say to demand they in marriage but if he be a wooer of fortune that design to raise himself by it he make woo he vocation deal with all matchmaker that be he setter be very painful in he call and if he business succeed steal she away and commit matrimony with a felonious intent he have a great desire to beget money on the body of a woman and as for other issue be very indifferent and care not how old she be so she be not past money-bearing a impudent man be one whose want of money and want of wit have engage he beyond he ability the little knowledge he have of himself be suitable to the little he have in he profession have make he believe himself fit for it this double ignorance have make he set a value upon himself as he that want a great deal appear in a better condition than he that want a little this render he confident and fit for any undertaking and sometimes -lrb- such be the concurrent ignorance of the world -rrb- he prosper in it but oftener miscarry and become ridiculous yet this advantage he have that as nothing can make he see he error so nothing can discourage he that way for he be fortify with he ignorance as barren and rocky place be by they situation and he will rather believe that all man want judgment than himself for as no man be pleased that have a ill opinion of himself nature that find out remedy herself and he own ease render he insensible of he defect from hence he grow impudent for as man judge by comparison he know as little what it be to be defective as what it be to be excellent nothing render man modest but a just knowledge how to compare themselves with other and where that be want impudence supply the place of it for there be no vacuum in the mind of man and commonly like other thing in nature they swell more with rarefaction than condensation the more man know of the world the worse opinion they have of it and the more they understand of truth they be better acquaint with the difficulty of it and consequently be the less confident in they assertion especially in matter of probability which commonly be squint-eyed and look nine way at once it be the office of a just judge to hear both party and he that consider but the one side of thing can never make a just judgment though he may by chance a true one impudence be the bastard of ignorance not only unlawfully but incestuously beget by a man upon he own understanding and lay by himself at he own door a monster of unnatural production for shame be as much the propriety of human nature though oversee by the philosopher and perhaps more than reason laughing or look asquint by which they distinguish man from beast and the less man have of it the nearer they approach to the nature of brute modesty be but a noble jealousy of honor and impudence the prostitution of it for he whose face be proof against infamy must be as little sensible of glory he forehead like a voluntary cuckold 's be by he horn make proof against a blush nature make man barefaced and civil custom have preserve he so but he that be impudent do wear a vizard more ugly and deform than highway thief disguise themselves with shame be the tender moral conscience of good man when there be a crack in the skull nature herself with a tough horny callous repair the breach so a flawed intellect be with a brawny callous face supply the face be the dial of the mind and where they do not go together ` tis a sign that one or both be out of order he that be impudent be like a merchant that trade upon he credit without a stock and if he debt be know would break immediately the inside of he head be like the outside and he peruke as naturally of he own growth as he wit he pass in the world like a piece of counterfeit coin look well enough until he be rub and wear with use and then he copper complexion begin to appear and nobody will take he but by owl-light a imitator be a counterfeit stone and the larger and fairer he appear the more apt he be to be discover whilst small one that pretend to no great value pass unsuspected he be make like a man in arras-hanging after some great master 's design though far short of the original he be like a spectrum or walk spirit that assume the shape of some particular person and appear in the likeness of something that he be not because he have no shape of he own to put on he have a kind of monkey and baboon wit that take after some man 's way whom he endeavor to imitate but do it worse than those thing that be naturally he own for he do not learn but take he pattern out as a girl do she sampler he whole life be nothing but a kind of education and he be always learn to be something that he be not nor ever will be for nature be free and will not be force out of she way nor compel to do anything against she own will and inclination he be but a retainer to wit and a follower of he master whose badge he wear everywhere and therefore he way be call servile imitation he fancy be like the innocent lady 's who by look on the picture of a moor that hang in she chamber conceive a child of the same complexion for all he conception be produce by the picture of other man 's imagination and by they feature betray whose bastard they be he muse be not inspire but infect with another man 's fancy and he catch he wit like the itch of somebody else that have it before and when he write he do but scratch himself he head be like he hat fashion upon a block and work in a shape of another man 's invention he melt down he wit and cast it in a mould and as metal melt and cast be not so firm and solid as those that be work with the hammer so those composition that be found and run in other man 's mould be always more brittle and loose than those that be forge in a man 's own brain he bind himself apprentice to a trade which he have no stock to set up with if he should serve out he time and live to be make free he run a-whoring after another man 's invention for he have none of he own to tempt he to a incontinent thought and beget a kind of mongrel breed that never come to good a sot have find out a way to renew not only he youth but he childhood by be stew like old aeson in liquor much better than the virtuoso 's way of make old dog young again for he be a child again at second hand never the worse for the wear but as purely fresh simple and weak as he be at first he have stupefy he sens by live in a moist climate accord to the poet _ boeotum in crasso jurare aëre natum _ he measure he time by glass of wine as the ancient do by water-glass and as herme trismegistus be say to have keep the first account of hour by the pissing of a beast dedicate to serapi he revive that custom in he own practice and observe it punctually in pass he time he be like a statue place in a moist air all the lineament of humanity be moulder away and there be nothing left of he but a rude lump of the shape of a man and no one part entire he have drown himself in a butt of wine as the duke of clarence be serve by he brother he have wash down he soul and piss it out and live now only by the spirit of wine or brandy or by a extract draw off he stomach he have swallow he humanity and drunk himself into a beast as if he have pledge madam circe and do she right he be drown in a glass like a fly beyond the cure of crumb of bread or the sunbeam he be like a springtide when he be drunk to he high-water-mark he swell and look big run against the stream and overflow everything that stand in he way but when the drink within he be at a ebb he shrink within he bank and fall so low and shallow that cattle may pass over he he govern all he action by the drink within he as a quaker do by the light within he have a different humor for every nick he drink rise to like the degree of the weather-glass and proceeds from ribaldry and bawdry to politics religion and quarrel until it be at the top and then it be the dog-days with he from whence he fall down again until he liquor be at the bottom and then he lie quiet and be freeze up a juggler be a artificial magician that with he finger cast a mist before the eye of the rabble and make he ball walk invisible which way he please he do he feat behind a table like a presbyterian in a conventicle but with much more dexterity and cleanliness and therefore all sort of people be better pleased with he most profession and mystery derive the practice of all they faculty from he but use they with less ingenuity and candor for the more he deceive those he have to do with the better he deal with they while those that imitate he in a lawful calling be far more dishonest for the more they impose the more they abuse all he cheat be primitive and therefore more innocent and of greater purity than those that be by tradition from hand to hand derive to they for he convey money out of one man 's pocket into another be with much more sincerity and ingenuity than those that do it in a legal way and for a less considerable though more conscientious reward he will fetch money out of he own throat with a great deal more of delight and satisfaction to those that pay he for it than any haranguer whatsoever and make it chuck in he throat better than a lawyer that have talk himself hoarse and swallow so many fee that he be almost choke he will spit fire and blow smoke out of he mouth with less harm and inconvenience to the government than a seditious holder-forth and yet all these disown and scorn he even as man that be grow great and rich despise the meanness of they original he call upon presto begone and the babylonian 's tooth to amuse and divert the rabble from look too narrowly into he trick while a zealous hypocrite that call heaven and earth to witness he turn up the eye and shake the head at he idolatry and profanation he go the circuit to all country fair where he meet with good stroll practice and come up to bartholomew fair as he michaelma term after which he remove to some great thoroughfare where he hang out himself in effigy like a dutch malefactor that all those that pass by may for they money have a trial of he skill he endeavor to plant himself as near as he can to some puppet-play monster or mountebank as the most convenient situation and when trade grow scant they join all they force together and make up one grand show and admit the cutpurse and balladsinger to trade under they as orange-woman do at a playhouse a romance-writer pull down old history to build they up finer again after a new model of he own design he take away all the light of truth in history to make it the fitter tutoress of life for truth herself have little or nothing to do in the affair of the world although all matter of the greatest weight and moment be pretended and do in she name like a weak princess that have only the title and falsehood all the power he observe one very fit decorum in date he history in the day of old and put all he own invention upon ancient time for when the world be younger it might perhaps love and fight and do generous thing at the rate he describe they but since it be grow old all these heroic feat be lay by and utterly give over nor ever like to come in fashion again and therefore all he image of those virtue signify no more than the statue upon dead man 's tomb that will never make they live again he be like one of homer 's god that set man together by the ear and fetch they off again how he please bring army into the field like janello 's leaden soldier lead up both side himself and give the victory to which he please accord as he find it fit the design of he story make love and lover too bring they acquaint and appoint meeting when and where he please and at the same time betray they in the height of all they felicity to miserable captivity or some other horrid calamity for which he make they rail at the god and curse they own innocent star when he only have do they all the injury make man villain compel they to act all barbarous inhumanity by he own direction and after inflict the cruellest punishment upon they for it he make all he knight fight in fortification and storm one another 's armor before they can come to encounter body for body and always match they so equally one with another that it be a whole page before they can guess which be likely to have the better and he that have it be so mangled that it have be better for they both to have part fair at first but when they encounter with those that be no knight though ever so well armed and mount ten to one go for nothing as for the lady they be every one the most beautiful in the whole world and that be the reason why no one of they nor all together with all they charm have power to tempt away any knight from another he differ from a just historian as a joiner do from a carpenter the one do thing plainly and substantially for use and the other carve and polish merely for show and ornament a libeller be a certain classic author that handle he subject-matter very ruggedly and endeavor with he own evil word to corrupt another man 's good manners all he work treat but of two thing he own malice and another man 's fault both which he describe in very proper and pertinent language he be not much concerned whether what he write be true or false that be nothing to he purpose which aim only at filthy and bitter and therefore he language be like picture of the devil the fouler the better he rob a man of he good name not for any good it will do he -lrb- for he dare not own it -rrb- but merely as a jackdaw steal money for he pleasure he malice have the same success with other man 's charity to be reward in private for all he get be but he own private satisfaction and the testimony of a evil conscience for which if it be discover he suffer the worst kind of martyrdom and be pay with condign punishment so that at the best he have but he labor for he pain he deal with a man as the spanish inquisition do with heretic clothes he in a coat paint with hellish shape of fiend and so show he to the rabble to render he the more odious he expose he wit like a bastard for the next comer to take up and put out to nurse which it seldom fail of so ready be every man to contribute to the infamy of another he be like the devil that sow tare in the dark and while a man sleep plant weed among he corn when he venture to fall foul on the government or any great person if he have not a special care to keep himself like a conjurer safe in he circle he raise a spirit that fall foul on himself and carry he to limbo where he neck be clap up in the hole out of which it be never release until he have pay he ear down on the nail for fee he be in a worse condition than a schoolboy for when he be discover he be whip for he exercise whether it be well or ill do so that he take a wrong course to show he wit when he best way to do so be to conceal it otherwise he show he folly instead of he wit and pay dear for the mistake a factious member be send out laden with the wisdom and politics of the place he serve for and have he own freight and custom free he be trust like a factor to trade for a society but endeavor to turn all the public to he own private advantage he have no instruction but he pleasure and therefore strive to have he privilege as large he be very wise in he politic capacity as have a full share in the house and a implicit right to every man 's reason though he have none of he own which make he appear so simple out of it he believe all reason of state consist in faction as all wisdom in haranguing of which he be so fond that he have rather the nation should perish than continue ignorant of he great ability that way though he that observe he gesture word and delivery will find they so perfectly agreeable to the rule of the house that he can not but conclude he learn he oratory the very same way that jackdaw and parrot practice by for he cough and spit and blow he nose with that discreet and prudent caution that you would think he have bury he talent in a handkerchief and be now pull it out to dispose of it to a better advantage he stand and presume so much upon the privilege of the house as if every member be a tribune of the people and have as absolute power as they have in rome accord to the lately establish fundamental custom and practice of they quartered predecessor of unhappy memory he endeavor to show he wisdom in nothing more than in appear very much unsatisfied with the present manage of state affair although he know nothing of the reason so much the better for the thing be the more difficult and argue he judgment and insight the greater for any man can judge that understand the reason of what he do but very few know how to judge mechanically without understand why or wherefore it be sufficient to assure he that the public money have be divert from the proper use it be raise for because he have have no share of it himself and the government ill manage because he have no hand in it which truly be a very great grievance to the people that understand by himself and he party that be they representative and ought to understand for they how able he be for it he father all he own passion and concern like bastard on the people because be entrust by they without article or condition they be bind to acknowledge whatsoever he do as they own act and deed a play-writer of we time be like a fanatic that have no wit in ordinary easy thing and yet attempt the hardest task of brain in the whole world only because whether he play or work please or displease he be certain to come off better than he deserve and find some of he own latitude to applaud he which he could never expect any other way and be as sure to lose no reputation because he have none to venture : -- like gaming rook that never stick to play for hundred upon tick 'cause if they chance to lose at play they have not one halfpenny to pay and if they win a hundred pound gain if for sixpence they compound nothing encourage he more in he undertaking than he ignorance for he have not wit enough to understand so much as the difficulty of what he attempt therefore he run on boldly like a foolhardy wit and fortune that favor fool and the bold sometimes take notice of he for he double capacity and receive he into she good grace he have one motive more and that be the concurrent ignorant judgment of the present age in which he sottish foppery pass with applause like oliver cromwell 's oratory among fanatic of he own canting inclination he find it easier to write in rhyme than prose for the world be over-charge with romance he find he plot passion and repartee ready make to he hand and if he can but turn they into rhyme the thievery be disguise and they pass for he own wit and invention without question like a steal cloak make into a coat or dye into another color besides this he make no conscience of steal anything that light in he way and borrow the advice of so many to correct enlarge and amend what he have ill-favouredly patch together that it become like a thing draw by counsel and none of he own performance or the son of a whore that have no one certain father he have very great reason to prefer verse before prose in he composition for rhyme be like lace that serve excellently well to hide the piecing and coarseness of a bad stuff contribute mightily to the bulk and make the less serve by the many impertinence it commonly require to make way for it for very few be endowed with ability to bring it in on its own account this he find to be good husbandry and a kind of necessary thrift for they that have but a little ought to make as much of it as they can he prologue which be commonly none of he own be always better than he play like a piece of cloth that be fine in the beginning and coarse afterwards though it have but one topic and that be the same that be use by malefactor when they be to be try to except against as many of the jury as they can a mountebank be a epidemic physician a doctor-errant that keep himself up by be like a top in motion for if he should settle he would fall to nothing immediately he be a pedlar of medicine a petty chapman of cure and tinker empirical to the body of man he stroll about to market and fair where he mount on the top of he shop that be he bank and publish he medicine as universal as himself for everything be for all disease as himself be of all place -- that be to say of none he business be to show trick and impudence as for the cure of disease it concern those that have they not he further than to get they money he pudding be he setter that lodge the rabble for he and then slip he who open with a deep mouth and have a ill day if he do not run down some he bait he patient 's body with he medicine as a rat-catcher do a room and either poison the disease or he as soon as he have get all the money and spend all the credit the rabble could spare he he then remove to fresh quarter where he be less known and better trust if but one in twenty of he medicine hit by chance when nature work the cure it save the credit of all the rest that either do no good or hurt for whosoever recover in he hand he do the work under god but if he die god do it under he : he time be come and there be a end a velvet jerkin be he prime qualification by which he be distinguish from he pudding as he be with he cap from he this be the usher of he school that draw the rabble together and then he draw they tooth he administer physic with a farce and give he patient a preparative of dancing on the rope to stir the humor and prepare they for evacuation he fool serve for he foil and set he off as well as he bragging and lie the first thing he vent be he own praise and then he medicine wrap up in several papers and lie he mount he bank as a vaulter do he wooden horse and then show trick for he patient as ape do for the king of spain he cast the nativity of urinal and try disease like a witch by water he bail the place with a jig draw the rabble together and then throw he hook among they he pretend to universal medicine that be such as when all man be sick together will cure they all but till then no one in particular a wittol be a person of great complaisance and very civil to all that have occasion to make use of he wife he marry a wife as a common proxy for the service of all those that be willing to come in for they share he engross she first by wholesale and since put she off by retail he profess a form of matrimony but utterly deny the power thereof they that tell tale be very unjust for have not put in they claim before marriage they be bind for ever after to hold they tongue the reason why citizen be commonly wittol be because man that drive a trade and be dealer in the world seldom provide anything for they own use which they will not very willingly put off again for considerable profit he believe it to be but a vulgar error and no such disparagement as the world commonly imagine to be a cuckold for man be the epitomy and representation of all creature can not be say to be perfect while he want that badge and character which so many several species wear both for they defense and ornament he take the only wise and sure course that he wife should do he no injury for have he own free consent it be not in she power that way to do he any wrong at all he wife be like eve in paradise marry to all mankind and yet be unsatisfied that there be no more world as alexander the great be she be a person of public capacity and rather than not serve she country would suffer a army to march over she as sir rice ap thoma do she husband and she give and take equal liberty which preserve a perfect peace and good understanding between both while those that be concern in one another 's love and honor be never quiet but always caterwauling he differ from a jealous man as a valiant man do from a coward that tremble at a danger which the other scorn and despise he be of a true philosophical temper and suffer what he know not how to avoid with a more than stoical resolution he be one of those the poet speak of : -- qui ferre incommoda vitæ nec jactare jugum vita didicere magistra he be as much pleased to see many man approve he choice of he wife and have as great a kindness for they as opiniaster have for all those whom they find to agree with themselves in judgment and approve the ability of they understanding a litigious man go to law as man do to bad house to spend he money and satisfy he concupiscence of wrangle he be a constant customer to the old reverend gentlewoman law and believe she to be very honest though she pick he pocket and put a thousand trick and gullery upon he he have a strange kindness for a action of the case but a most passionate loyalty for the king 's writ a well-drawn bill and answer will draw he all the world over and a breviate as far as the line he enter the list at westminster like a old tiller run he course in law and break a oath or two instead of a lance and if he can but unhorse the defendant and get the sentence of the judge on he side he march off in triumph he prefer a cry of lawyer at the bar before any pack of the best-mouthed dog in all the north he have commonly once a term a trial of skill with some other professor of the noble science of contention at the several weapon of bill and answer forgery perjury subornation champarty affidavit common barretry maintenance & c and though he come off with the worst he do not greatlv care so he can but have another bout for it he fight with bag of money as they do heretofore with sand-bag and he that have the heaviest have the advantage and knock down the other right or wrong and he suffer the penalty of the law for have no more money to show in the case he be a client by he order and votary of the long robe and though he be sure the devil invent it to hide he cloven foot he have the greater reverence for it for as evil manners produce good law the worse the inventor be the better the thing may be he keep as many knight of the post to swear for he as the king do poor knight at windsor to pray for he when he be defendant and like to be worst in a suit he put in a cross bill and become plaintiff for the plainant be eldest hand and have not only that advantage but be understand to be the better friend to the court and be consider for it accordingly a humourist be a peculiar fantastic that have a wonderful natural affection to some particular kind of folly to which he apply himself and in time become eminent ` tis commonly some outlying whimsy of bedlam that be tame and unhurtful be suffer to go at liberty the more serious he be the more ridiculous he become and at the same time please himself in earnest and other in jest he know no mean for that be inconsistent with all humor which be never find but in some extreme or other whatsoever he take to he be very full of and believe every man else to be so too as if he own taste be the same in every man 's palate if he be a virtuoso he apply himself with so much earnestness to what he undertake that he put he reason out of joint and strain he judgment and there be hardly anything in the world so slight or serious that some one or other have not squander away he brain and time and fortune upon to no other purpose but to be ridiculous he be exempt from a dark room and a doctor because there be no danger in he frenzy otherwise he have as good a title to fresh straw as another humor be but a crookedness of the mind a disproportioned swell of the brain that draw the nourishment from the other part to stuff a ugly and deform crup-shoulder if it have the luck to meet with many of its own temper instead of be ridiculous it become a church and from jest grow to earnest a leader of a faction set the psalm and all he party sing after he he be like a figure in arithmetic the more cipher he stand before the more he value amount to he be a great haranguer talk himself into authority and like a parrot climb with he beak he appear brave in the head of he party but braver in he own for vainglory lead he as he do they and both many time out of the king 's highway over hedge and ditch to find out by-way and shorter cut which generally prove the farthest about but never the nearest home again he be so passionate a lover of the liberty of the people that he fondness turn to jealousy he interpret every trifle in the worst sense to the prejudice of she honesty and be so full of caprice and scruple that if he have he will he would have she shut up and never suffer to go abroad again if not make away for she incontinence all he politics be speculative and for the most part impracticable full of curious nicety that tend only to prevent future imaginary inconvenience with greater real and present he be very superstitious of have the formality and punctilio of law hold sacred that while they be perform those that would destroy the very be of it may have time to do they business or escape he bend all he force against those that be above he and like a free-born english mastiff play always at the head he gather he party as fanatic do a church and admit all he admirer how weak and slight soever for he believe it be argument of wisdom enough in they to admire or as he have it to understand he when he have lead he faction into any inconvenience they all run into he mouth as young snake do into the old one and he defend they with he oratory as well as he be able for all he confidence depend upon he tongue more than he brain or heart and if that fail the other surrender immediately for though david say it be a two-edged sword a wooden dagger be a better weapon to fight with he judgment be like a nice balance that will turn with the twentieth part of a grain but a little use render it false and it be not so good for use as one that will not stir without a greater weight a debauched man save the devil a labor and lead himself into temptation be loth to lose he good favor in give he any trouble where he can do the business himself without he assistance which he very prudently reserve for matter of greater concernment he govern himself in a arbitrary way and be absolute without be confine to anything but he own will and pleasure which he make he law he life be all recreation and he diversion nothing but turn from one vice that he be weary of to entertain himself with another that be fresh he live above the state of he body as well as he fortune and run out of he health and money as if he have make a match and bet on the race or bid the devil take the hindmost he be a amphibious animal that live in two element wet and dry and never come out of the first but like a sea-calf to sleep on the shore he language be very suitable to he conversation and he talk as loosely as he live ribaldry and profanation be he doctrine and use and what he profess publicly he practise very carefully in he life and conversation not like those clergyman that to save the soul of other man condemn themselves out of they own mouth he whole life be nothing but a perpetual lordship of misrule and a constant ramble day and night as long as it last which be not accord to the course of nature but its own course

one by one he lose no occasion of offence but very thriftily lay it up and endeavor to improve it to the best advantage he make issue in he skin to vent he ill-humours and be sensible of no pleasure so much as the itching of he sore he hate death for nothing so much as because he fear it will take he away before he have pay all the ill-will he owe and deprive he of all those precious feud he have
