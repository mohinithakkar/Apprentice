especially in certain section of the british public people believe that the german nation be lead blindly into the world war by a unscrupulous military clique now however there be ample evidence to prove that the entire nation be thoroughly well inform of the course which event be take and also warn as to the catastrophe to which the national course be certainly lead even to-day after more than twelve month of devastate warfare there be no unity of opinion in germany as to who cause the war some writer accuse france other england while many lay the guilt at russium 's door they be only unanimous in charge one or other or all the power of the triple entente we shall see that every power now at war with the exception of germany and italy have be hold responsible for armageddon but apparently it have not yet occur to german that the bearer of guilt for this year 's bloodshed -- be germany alone it be true that the conflict between austrium and serbium form the start point whether or not serbium be seriously in the wrong be a matter of opinion but it be generally hold that austrium deal with she neighbor with too much heat and too little discretion austrium kindle the flame of war but it be germany 's mission to seize a blaze torch and set europe alight when the text of austrium 's ultimatum become know a very serious mood come over germany there be not a man who do not realize that a great european war loom on the horizon a well-organized healthy public opinion could at that period have bring the government of the germanic power to recognize they responsibility have the german press be unanimous it might have stop the avalanche but there be two current of opinion the one approve the other condemn austrium for have throw down the gauntlet to serbium and above all to russia one paper exult over the statement that every sentence in austrium 's ultimatum be a whip-lash across serbium 's face a phrase express so aptly the great mass of popular opinion this expression meet with unstinted approval for it correspond with german ideal and standard in deal with a opponent yet there be no lack of warning and very grave one too a glance at german newspaper will suffice to prove this statement on July 24th 1914 krupp 's organ the _ rheinisch-westfälische zeitung _ contain the following : the austro-hungarian ultimatum be nothing but a pretext for war but this time a dangerous one it seem that we be stand on the verge of a austro-serbian war it be possible very possible that we shall have to extinguish east-european conflagration with we arm either because of we treaty or from the compulsion of event but it be a scandal if the imperial government -lrb- berlin -rrb- have not require that such a final offer should be submit to it for approval before its presentation to serbia to-day nothing remain for we but to declare : ` we be not bind by any alliance to support war let loose by the hapsburg policy of conquest ' the _ post _ write on the same date : be that a note no it be a ultimatum of the sharpest kind within twenty-four hour austria demand a answer a reply no but a absolute submission the utter and complete humiliation of serbium on former occasion we have -lrb- and with justice -rrb- make fun of austrium 's lack of energy now we have a proof of energy which terrify we this ` note ' represent about the very uttermost which can be say to any government and such thing be only say when the sender of the ` note ' have absolutely determine upon war the principal organ of germany 's largest political party the social democrat contain a still more emphatic protest on July 25th a telegram from the belgrade correspondent of the _ vorwärts _ run : since the presentation of austrium 's note public opinion have become exceedingly serious although the city be still very calm the general view hold be that austrium 's ultimatum be unacceptable for a sovereign state in belgrade no one doubt that russium will stand by serbium everyone be certain that in consequence of austrium 's excessively sharp tone russium will not remain inactive should austria resort to armed force the populace be prepare for war in view of the subsequent attitude of germany 's social democrat a official proclamation publish in all they seventy-seven daily papers on July 25th be of supreme importance at that date they have apparently no doubt whatever as to the guilty party the change of front in the reichstag on August 4th would seem in the light of this proclamation as nothing other than a betrayal of conscience further the split which have arise in they rank during the war lead to the supposition that liebknecht kautsky and bernstein have be trouble by the inward voice this be the full text of the proclamation as it appear in the _ vorwärts _ : a appeal the balkan plain be still steam with the blood of thousand of murder the ruin of desolate town and devastate village be still smoke after the balkan war hungry workless man widow woman and orphan child be still wander through the land and yet again austrium 's imperialism unchain the war fury to bring death and destruction over all europe even if we condemn the doings of the greater-serbian nationalist still the wicked war-provocation of the austro-hungarian government call forth the most stinging protest the demand make by this government be so brutal that in the history of the world they like have never be present to a independent state and they can only be calculate to provoke war germany 's proletariat conscious of its mission raise herewith in the name of humanity and civilization the most fervent protest against this criminal action of the war party -lrb- _ kriegshetzer _ -rrb- it -lrb- the social democratic party -rrb- demand imperatively that the german government should exercise all its influence on the austrian government to preserve peace and in case this infamous war can not be prevent then to abstain from any warlike interference no single drop of blood of a single german soldier may be sacrifice to gratify the lust for power of the austrian autocracy the imperial profit-interests comrade we call upon you to give expression to the working-class ' unshakable will for peace in mass meeting this be a serious moment more solemn than any in the last few decade there be danger in delay a world war threaten we the ruling class who enslave despise and exploit you in time of peace desire now to misuse you as cannon-fodder from all side the cry must ring in the ear of those in authority : we do not want war down with war long live international brotherhood berlin July 25th 1914 _ the leader of the party _ two day later the _ leipziger tageblatt _ announce that the public prosecutor have commence proceedings against the editor of _ vorwärts _ for have distribute the above appeal in pamphlet form in the street of berlin from this fact we may conclude that the charge throw out by the social democratic party be by no means congenial to the plan of the german government the liberal _ berliner tageblatt _ -lrb- July 24th -rrb- give its unreserved support to austrium 's action the austrian government have voice its demand in a calm and serious tone which contain nothing offensive to the serbian monarchy everyone who have consider the result of the inquiry into the tragedy of serajewo and the burrowing of serbian propagandist in austrium must give he absolute sanction to the latter 's demand much as every right-thinking man must desire that peace should be preserve still he must admit that austrium could not have act otherwise even the _ vossische zeitung _ the organ of army circle be more conservative in its judgment in the issue for July 24th a lead article run : it can not be deny that nearly every point raise by austrium in she note be a encroachment on serbium 's sovereign rights austrium appear as the policeman who undertake to create order in serbium because the serbian government accord to austrium 's claim be unable to hold in check those ` subversive element ' within its frontier which disturb austrium 's peace but only in this manner can austria protect herself against the criminal who be send from serbium to the territory of the hapsburg monarchy no consideration whatever can be show to serbia as austrium 's first duty be self-defence in the german press two widely-differing opinion find expression with regard to the equity of austrium 's demand but the press and people be unanimous in believe that if these demand be ruthlessly press home they could only lead to a european conflagration in view of this latter danger national opinion be again divide into two camp : the first against war the second determine to support austrium and pursue the path choose by the berlin government no matter what the consequence might be the latter party include the vast bulk of the nation and chauvinism dominate in the press theater concert-hall church and music-hall patriotic demonstration be hold before austrian consulate in restaurant and coffee-house the berlin government be overwhelm with telegram from all kind of body -- especially those with a military color such as veteran ' club society of one-year volunteer university society etc -- call upon it to defend germany 's honor against slavonic murder and intrigue in short all germany give itself up to a veritable _ kriegsrausch _ -lrb- war intoxication -rrb- which find expression in the wildest attack on russium and a perfervid determination to see the matter through should russia venture to intervene in any way to protect serbium from whatever measure austria think proper to take it be little to be wonder at that russium in face of this spontaneous outbreak do take military precaution for all germany make it perfectly clear that no kind of intervention on russium 's part in the austro-serbian dispute would be tolerate by germany it be true that late in the day austrium avow that she have no intention of annex serbian territory a declaration which german do not believe and certainly one which russium have no reason to accept after austrium 's annexion of bosnium and herzegowina in 1908 furthermore austria give russium every reason to cherish suspicion as to she intention on July 25th austrium issue official order for the mobilization of eight of she sixteen army corps in addition to which a part of the _ landsturm _ be call up the corps mobilize be : one each in upper and lower austrium dalmatium buda-pest croatium and bosnium and two bohemian corps three-eighth of the force call up be thus place very near to the russian frontier vienna be wild with war-enthusiasm which find expression in demonstration last all through the night July 25-26th austrian officer who have always be hate by the populace be cheer embrace and carry shoulder-high wherever they be meet the effect which this have in berlin may be see from the _ berliner tageblatt _ of July 26th : a enormous mass of people gather before the russian embassy last night between the hour of twelve and one the crowd howl and hiss and cry be raise : ` down with russium long live austrium down with serbium ' gradually the police clear the mass away russia ignore the incident but when about a hundred frenchman demonstrate before the austrian embassy in pari at exactly the same time the ambassador at once protest at the quaus d'orsay and the director of the french foreign office immediately apologize on the whole the report of excess in various part of germany against any and all who dare to show any anti-war sympathy prove clearly that the blood-lust arouse by the german government 's policy have already pass beyond the control of the authority in munich one of the most modern coffee-house -lrb- café fahrig -rrb- be completely gut because the proprietor endeavor to keep the demonstrant within reasonable bound serb and russian be attack and ill-treated one such incident occur at mid-day Sunday July 26th in munich of which a full description be give in the _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ for the follow day a few day later -lrb- August 2nd -rrb- the princess café berlin be demolish because the guest believe that there be russian in the band in hamburg on the follow day a newly-opened restaurant be completely destroy because a young dane have fail to stand up when the national hymn be be play yesterday a young dane remain sit during the singing of the national hymn for which reason the person in the hall become greatly excited ` russian stand up ' be shout to he in the same moment blow begin to rain down upon he so that streaming with blood he be carry out -lrb- _ berliner zeitung be mittag _ August 4th -rrb- these be only a selection of many such incident which show that the national brutishness be appear through the veneer in the light of such event where on german soil german murderously attack they fellow-countryman on such ridiculous pretext it require little imagination to explain the outburst of brutality against belgian who dare to defend hearth and home meanwhile the smaller party which desire peace have not be entirely idle on July 28th the social democrat hold thirty-two mass meeting in berlin to protest against war the attendance be in every case enormous but the meeting be all orderly and calm the police have take extensive precautionary measure the speaker be mostly member of the reichstag or the berlin town council throughout they be guilty of the most fiery and tactless attack on austrium _ to whom alone they ascribe the guilt for the warlike development _ each meeting adopt a resolution against war the chief of police have forbid all procession or demonstration to take place after the day before in spite of this many of the socialist who have attend these meeting try to form procession especially in unter den linden as large body of troops have close the street small party of the socialist manage to reach the linden by means of tram and omnibus at about 10 pm hiss and cry of ` down with the war party ' be hear before the café kranzler in a moment the number of democrat swell to large proportion and the workman 's marseillaise be strike up follow by a short sharp order the mount police advance with draw sword against the rioter the air be fill with shout and cry of _ pfuus _ -lrb- shame -rrb- on the other side of the road the crowd sing the national hymn the mass clash together and the police advance again and again till the street be clear at the corner however the socialist form up again and begin to demonstrate anew so that the police be compel to attack they without any consideration in order to preserve the peace they clear the pavement and gallop up the promenade again the cry echo ` down with war ' and as answer come ` die wacht be rhein ' but it be some considerable time before the struggle cease to surge to and fro -lrb- _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ July 29th -rrb- thus the great socialist-international-pacifist movement with four and a quarter million german voter behind it fizzle out on the pavement of unter den linden probably there be demonstration in other part of germany but this much be certain that the member of catholic and protestant _ arbeiterverbände _ -lrb- workman 's society -rrb- hold meeting and demonstrate in favor of war on the other hand the woman 's union of the german peace society in stuttgart send a telegram to the kaiser beg he in the name of million of german mother to preserve the peace the most interesting protest against the war movement be undoubtedly the following : this then be the cultural height to which we have attain hundred of thousand of the healthiest finest most valuable force in the nation be tremble from anxiety that chance or a nod of europe 's ruler malevolence or a fit of sadism a caesar-madness or a business speculation a empty word or a vague conception of honor will drive they to-morrow out of they home from wife and child from all that which they treasure and have build up with so much pain and trouble -- into death the mad coincidence may arise to-day may call they to-morrow or at any minute and all all of they will go -- obey damnable necessity but still obey at first they will whine on see they bit of earthly happiness snatch away but soon however -- although they conscience may not be quite clean -- they will be possess by the general frenzy to murder and be murder franz pfemfert in _ die aktion _ although this article appear on August 1st it have evidently be write before the proclamation of martial law it be one of the last political article which the paper publish for the next number but one contain the announcement that the _ aktion _ will in future only publish article on art and literature the reason be not far to seek in justice to the pacifist element it must be state that they be up against bayonet the only pity be that british public opinion or any section of it have be lead to believe that it could ever have be otherwise austrium have commit a unpardonable act of provocation which at first reasonable opinion in germany openly condemn simultaneously the german government set in motion a avalanche of racial feeling to play off against the just and moderate measure take by other power to checkmate austrian aggression in addition to the racial hostility which have be lash into bitterness during the spring of 1914 come germany 's morbid conception of national and personal honor lastly the fear of a russian invasion be astutely inoculate into the nation it be the author 's firm conviction and the military event in poland and galicium have only strengthen this opinion that from the very begin germany could have prevent any russian invasion of she territory but she do not desire that end but rather that the fear of russium should complete the kriegsrausch of the german nation after frightening the people the berlin government strike its blow in the direction of they political ambition -- to the west and after the russian have be allow to penetrate german territory they be hurl over the eastern frontier at the end of August while the kaiser be send peaceful telegram to petrograd and vienna the press be full of horrible picture of cossack barbarism and the dread terror of the russian knout both of which -- the public be lead to believe -- be about to strike germany in this manner the kaiser and he adviser create a national psychology which leave open only two alternative : the absolute humiliation of russium and the consequent hegemony of germany in europe -- or war chapter ii on the leash russium give the world to understand by a official declaration issue on Friday July 24th 1914 that she be not a indifferent but a keenly interested spectator to the austro-serbian conflict on the follow day russium 's declaration be publish in almost the entire german press and from that moment the same press be flood with all kind of attack direct against the eastern neighbor russium be frankly tell to mind she own business -- the quarrel do not concern she the german public immediately accept this point of view so that every subsequent move on russium 's part appear in the light of a unwarrantable offensive undoubtedly the bismarckian tactic of publishing inspire article in all part of germany be employ and they coloring leave no doubt on the public mind that the much-talked-of slavonic danger have assume a acute form a request on russium 's part make on July 25th that the space of time -lrb- forty-eight hour -rrb- allow to serbia for a answer should be extend only increase popular irritation in the germanic empire this irritation be accompany by a unmistakable bellicose spirit which call forth its natural counterpart in petrograd nevertheless the fact remain that up till July 25th russium have only ask for time and the reply give by the berlin mob -lrb- -rrb- during the follow night be echo throughout germany the view that russium have no right to interest herself on behalf of serbium -lrb- passing over russium 's right to preserve the newly-established balance of power in the balkan -rrb- be untenable if canada have a quarrel -- just or unjust -- with the united state it would be ridiculous to assert that england have no right to intervene this be however not the first occasion on which germany have advance so preposterous a claim during the tariff conflict between germany and canada some year ago a wave of indignant anger go over the whole fatherland because england venture to interfere in any case during the last week before war break out the german government succeed in impose upon public opinion the feeling that the quarrel be a racial one together with the conviction that russium be interfere in order to protect a band of murderer from just punishment and have neither rights nor interest at stake in the quarrel this conspiracy succeed but the whole german nation must still be hold responsible for the outbreak of war because as have be show in the precede chapter the nation have already be warn by newspaper of various political party they have be plainly tell that austrium have exceed the limit of all diplomatic dealings between two sovereign state and that austrium 's provocation could easily kindle a world war warning and truth be alike forget and the voice which utter they be now raise another hue and cry -lrb- 1 -rrb- racial hatred be ablaze the warlike instinct of a military people be call for action and a diseased conception of national honor be ask why berlin do not act against the russian barbarian in one paper the author remember read a violent demand for action against russium before the national ardor have time to cool down -lrb- footnote 1 : the last mention of austrium as the guilty party be the account of the social democratic demonstration in berlin on July 28th report in the papers of the follow day -rrb- on July 26th austrian mobilization be in full swing and russium admittedly take precaution of a similar nature soon after that date we may be sure that russium understand she neighbor better than the inhabitant of the british isle understand they in 1909 she have suffer a severe diplomatic defeat and corresponding loss of prestige because she could only use word in deal with germany and austrium -lrb- 2 -rrb- now she be face with the alternative of withdraw from she declare attitude -lrb- July 24th -rrb- or take measure of a military character in order not to sacrifice she position as a european power and she special position as the leader of the slavonic people russia choose the latter course the only honorable one open to she german papers and public speaker retort that russium be the patron and protector of assassin -- a calculate distortion of the fact intend to have due effect on public opinion on all side it be say that russium have give serbium secret assurance of help which cause she to become stiff-backed and unrepentant fortunately it be possible to refute the accusation through the pen of a german journalist who describe belgrade 's desperate position on July 25th the day when the ultimatum expire -lrb- footnote 2 : the interest of russian and german imperialism have continually clash during the last ten year and more than once russium have have to beat a retreat before germany 's threat dr paul lensch member of the reichstag in he german social democracy and the world war p 35 publish by vorwärts co berlin 1915 -rrb- at last the inhabitant of belgrade have become aware of they serious situation ` we be lose russium have leave we in the lurch ' be be shout in the street journalist who at 230 pm have assure I that russium have intervene in vienna with success succumb now to the general depression the people believe that they have be betray and sell rumor of assassination pass from mouth to mouth the ministerial council have be characterize by violent recrimination end in blow other assert that the crown prince alexander have be stab by a leader of the war-party another whisper that king peter be die from a apoplectic fit or as the result of a _ attentat _ the report become wilder and each increase the dread of some unutterable imminent catastrophe the street be crowd with terror-stricken citizen curse resound on all side certainly a most unusual struggle be go on between the two party for peace and war shortly after three o'clock it seem to be settle that austrium 's demand will be fulfil it be true the mobilization decree have be post up on all public building but that mean nothing we still have nearly three hour in which all can be right how will this gallows-respite be employ it be four o'clock messenger rush from one embassy to the other in the coffee-house the rumor go round : ` italy be we savior in distress ' cry of ` shame ' against russium be raise while the ' _ viva _ ' for italy sound louder and louder the crowd march to the italian embassy but be receive with long and astonished face no there be nothing to hope for from italy next they go to the french embassy now there be about two thousand of we another disappointment a young diplomat receive the throng mass and talk empty nothing include a great deal about france 's sympathy for serbium but in this dark hour sympathy be of no avail downcast and silent the people go next to the representative of albion -- who decline to appear the confusion in the mind of the mass cause by the government 's indecision increase from minute to minute indescribable scene be witness before the general post office it be allege that thousand and thousand of telegram have arrive from russium beg the member of serbium 's royal family not to give way to austria it may easily be possible that the russian telegram all emanate from one person and have be forge in order to counteract the disposition to yield on the part of the royal family without doubt both the king and crown prince have lose all personal influence on the final decision they be be slowly carry along by the conflagration-party which obtain the upper hand soon after four o'clock -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ July 28th -rrb- this picture give no support to germany 's accusation that russium have stiffen serbium into resist austrium 's unacceptable demand it rather lead one to consider that a action which drive a weak nation to arrive at a decision on so awful a issue in so short a time be a action discreditable to a stronger and impossible on the part of a morally great power if serbium choose wrongly in refuse to bite the dust then the guilt be still chargeable to austria for force she little neighbor to take a choice in haste sir edward gray emphasize in he speech of July 27th the shortness of the time which all the power have have at they disposal to formulate a plan by which the conflict could be restricted to the east or amicably settle the leader of the germanic state have purposely will it so several unsuccessful attempt have be make to break up the triple entente the only barrier to the germanization _ ie _ prussianization of europe and in the tragedy of serajewo the central power -lrb- or at least the dominate factor of the two -rrb- believe they have find a lever with which to break down the opposition by diplomacy if that fail a immediate appeal to the sword should follow the diplomatic forty-eight hour ' _ coup-de-main _ fail and the program contain no other item except war in a few word this mean that the dastardly crime of princip and he fellow conspirator be exploit by germany act through austrium to disturb the european balance of power under the guise of a just vengeance sir edward gray formulate and circulate he conference proposal on the next day July 26th some person to whom i speak at the time welcome the idea they belong principally to the lower middle class one well-known pan-germanist -lrb- dr beckmann professor of history in erlangen university -rrb- say that the proposal be a admission of a diplomatic defeat and a sign that the entente power be afraid to draw the sword if the three power in question be prepare to pocket this smack in the face then germany would be satisfied because such a defeat would mean that the triple entente would never be able to work together again it be interesting to compare with this opinion those of two lead newspaper : -lrb- 1 -rrb- we understand that the german government be not absolutely hostile to england 's endeavor to bring about a mediation between the contend power by those not directly interested in the conflict but the german government make its participation in the mediation dependent upon whether austria-hungary would accept this procedure and in which respect austrium wish the mediation to follow the german government can not support any action which austria-hungary do not desire as that would mean exercise pressure from sir edward gray 's declaration in the house of common it be clear that he be not thinking of mediation between austrium and serbium but between austrium and russium this shade of meaning require attention we think that any attempt at mediation between austrium and serbium would have no prospect of success because in vienna they do not seem inclined to accept such a action diplomatic relation have not be break off the russian minister for foreign affair confer still with the austrian ambassador and it be not easy to see why the other power should not further this discussion in a mediative sense but then sir edward gray give he idea more exact form and propose a conference between the german italian and french ambassador and himself this conference of ambassador be to seek a basis for a agreement and then submit the result to the cabinet in vienna and st petersburg in he yesterday 's speech he emphasize the point that no hostility may take place till the conference have conclude its work here of course be the difficulty which mar he plan for it be questionable whether austrium will consent to a postponement of she military operation negotiation concern sir edward gray 's proposal be at present occupy the cabinet and it be to be hope that a means will be find to make it acceptable to the power most interested in the conflict -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ berliner tagtblatt _ July 28th -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- germany not only cherish in a platonic manner the desire of the western power to prevent the conflict between austrium and serbium spreading to the great power but the berlin cabinet have already be active in more than one european capital in favor of a mediation which will secure european peace in this respect we be pleased -lrb- _ man begrüsst e hier _ -rrb- that in consequence of sir edward gray 's initiative the mediation idea have assume a official form and be open for public discussion there be however reason to doubt whether a conference between four great power as a organ for the mediation be the most suitable way out of the difficulty everyone be quite agree that the detail of the austro-serbian conflict which concern these two state alone can not be bring before the forum of a conference but as regard the removal in good time of any difficulty which may arise between austrium and russium the question must be raise as to whether the government of these state be willing to entrust a official mediation to a conference of four other great power for the success of the mediation proposal it would be more practical if the means to this end be make as simple as possible and that use be make of the current diplomatic discussion in immediate communication with the capital of the empire in question in order to carry through a mediatory action to the result desire on all side in the employment of these means germany would not fail to support the western power as she have already do up to the present -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ kölnische zeitung _ July 28th -rrb- i have carefully search the official publication of the central power -lrb- germany 's white book austrium 's orange book -rrb- and can find no record in they of any pacific action on germany 's part in either of the european capital hence the claim make in the above article seem to be a exaggeration it appear incredible that these power should have omit to give proof of such action when make they case public for the sole purpose of prove they innocence before the world on the other hand the impression give by these book be that germany and austrium 's attitude be : to serbia : the condition must be accept _ ad hoc _ to the smallest tittle and comma alternative war to russium : what we have determine upon be unalterable and inevitable and you must submit to this decision alternative war the _ görlitzer nachrichten _ publish the follow paragraph on July 30th : vienna July 29th after have make inquiry in official circle the morning papers make this announcement : count berchtold have inform the english ambassador that the austro-hungarian government be grateful for gray 's mediation proposal and appreciate the good intention of the british government a peaceful solution of the conflict with serbium be however no longer possible as the declaration of war have already be sign before leave this all-important episode it be instructive to compare three other version of the reason for refuse a conference sir edward gray moot the proposal for a conference to the ambassador in london on Friday July 24th on the afternoon he request the british ambassador in berlin to propose the conference to the german government in spite of this document no 12 in the german white book a telegram from the german chancellor to prince lichnowsky in london run : we know nothing here of a proposal from sir edward gray to hold a conference of four in london etc another telegram document no 15 bear the same date and likewise from bethmann-hollweg to lichnowsky be as follow : we have immediately commence the mediatory action in vienna in the sense desire by sir edward gray furthermore we have inform count berchtold of m sasonow 's desire to communicate with he direct -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : this message lead to the assumption that direct communication between vienna and petrograd have already cease although the _ kölnische zeitung _ tell the german public on the follow day that they have not -rrb- the next document in the german white book be date July 28th it be a telegram from the german ambassador in vienna to the german chancellor in berlin count berchtold beg I to express he thanks to you for communicate the english mediation proposal he reply however that in consequence of the commencement of hostility by serbium and after the declaration of war which have meanwhile be make he must look upon england 's step as be too late in the austrian orange book p 122 we find this passage in a telegram from count berchtold to the austrian representative in london : when sir edward gray speak of the possibility of avoid a outbreak of hostility he be too late for yesterday serbian shoot at we frontier guard and to-day we have declare war on serbium there be two point in these telegram which require explanation firstly why should sir edward gray 's proposal take so long to reach vienna apparently it take from Monday to Wednesday to go by telegram from london via berlin to vienna two german newspaper -lrb- already quote -rrb- know of this conference idea on the 27th of July and comment upon it in they morning edition of the follow day the other point be the austrian statement that serbium commence hostility if this be the case one would expect that austria-hungary in declare war subsequently to the alleged shooting by serbian at frontier guard would make mention of the act as a _ casus bellus _ on p 117 of the red book the text of the declaration of war be give in full but there be no mention of any resort to arm on the part of serbium we be force to the conclusion that germany and austrium be mutually responsible for prevent the conference they desire war and a conference might have preserve peace during the present summer -lrb- 1915 -rrb- a important work have be publish in germany from which the follow passage be take : gray think the time have now arrive to formulate a mediation proposal this idea be from the very begin unacceptable to austria because that would indirectly be a recognition of russium as a interested power in the austro-serbian conflict only those who have follow the development of mutual obligation between the entente power be able to understand the role which russium 's two comrade -lrb- france and england -rrb- -- to say nothing at all of italy -- would have play in this conference during its sitting russium would have continue she military preparation while germany would have be pledge not to mobilize finally nobody could assert that the man -lrb- sir edward gray -rrb- who would have preside over these negotiation could have be impartial the more one think about this mediation proposal the more clearly one recognize that it would have make for a diplomatic victory of the triple entente -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : professor hermann oncken : deutschland und der weltkrieg pp 545-6 -rrb- even the claim that austrium show some inclination to permit mediation on the point in she ultimatum to serbium which be incompatible with serbium 's sovereignty have be categorically deny the vienna _ fremdenblatt _ for September 24th 1914 contain this official announcement : vienna September 24th in a report of the late british ambassador publish by the british government there be a passage which maintain that austria-hungary 's ambassador count szapary in st petersburg have inform monsieur sasonow russium 's minister for foreign affair that austria-hungary ` be willing to submit the point in she note to serbium which seem incompatible with serbian independence to mediation ' we have be inform officially that this statement be absolutely untrue accord to the nature of the step take by the monarchy in belgrade it would have be absolutely unthinkable the passage cite from the british ambassador 's report as well as some other phrase in the same be evidently inspire by a certain bias they be intend to prove by assert that austria-hungary be prepare to yield on some point at issue that german diplomacy be really responsible for the outbreak of war such attempt can not obscure the truth that austria-hungary and germany concur in the wish to preserve european peace if this wish have not be fulfil and a european conflict have arise out of a local settlement it can only be ascribe to the circumstance that russium first threaten austria-hungary and then germany by a unjustifiable mobilization by this she force war upon the central power and thus kindle a general conflagration in deal with germany 's endeavor for peace professor oncken write on p 546 of deutschland und der weltkrieg -lrb- germany and the world war -rrb- : the work of german diplomacy take the form of give warning and peaceful explanation on July 26th she point out to the russian government that preparatory military measure on russium 's part would compel germany to take corresponding step viz the mobilization of the army mobilization mean war oncken do not quote any of the peaceful explanation -lrb- _ friedliche erklärungen _ -rrb- and much as the present writer would like to fill up this gap in he work he must admit he utter inability because in the diplomatic correspondence he can only find exasperating threat throw out to russia by the two germanic empire the whole problem allow of a very simple digest : on July 23rd austria-hungary hand she ultimatum to serbium therein state she demand and on the following day inform all the european power of she attitude the neutral press of the world and a unusually large section of the german press immediately pronounce austria 's position to be indefensible and untenable the german government in spite of these fact give its official and unreserved support to austrium 's attitude on July 26th after eight week of war -lrb- on September 25th -rrb- austrium officially declare that she have never swerve from she original claim nor ever feel any inclination to do so it be true that the usage of everyday life do not always hold good in diplomatic dealings but it be instructive to state the case in the term of everyday affair mr a -lrb- austrium -rrb- inform mr b -lrb- serbium -rrb- that he have a quarrel to settle with he and state he demand mr c -lrb- russium -rrb- who be a relation patron and friend of b 's interfere to see fair play whereupon mr d -lrb- germany -rrb- a friend and relation of a 's inform c in unmistakable fashion that he must neither speak nor act in the affair or he will be immediately thrash messr a and d be unanimous in this view and repeat the threat in mutual form meanwhile a attack b mr c see that they will not accord he a hearing take step to compel they to hear he at which point mr d fulfil he threat and fall upon c it be not yet clear whether austrium would have permit russium to take over the rôle of adviser and second to serbia in she unequal struggle with austrium but from the moment germany appear on the scene the situation become perfectly simple : russium have absolutely no right either to speak or move in the matter on this rock of immovable germanic obstinacy the russian ship of state be intend to meet with diplomatic shipwreck should russia attempt to avoid this fate then the german sword could be trust to arrange matter in the way desire by germany the german language contain a very expressive phrase _ stimmungsmachereus _ which mean create or prepare a certain frame of mind how germany 's public opinion be tune to the war melody be see by a study of the german newspaper publish between July 25th and August 1st a great part of the german nation have welcome austrium 's express determination to compel serbium to lick she shoe as a london paper put it at the time only the social democratic party persist in assert that austrium be the provocative and guilty party down to the evening of July 28th but three day earlier the process of educate public opinion against russium commence in fact it require little tuning to arouse a national chorus which be swell subsequently by the social democratic voice demand that russium too must bite the dust at the psychological moment the term of the alliance between germany and austrium be launch in the press one paper -lrb- 8 -rrb- write : it be interesting at the present moment to call to mind how the treaty exist between germany and austrium regulate the question of mutual support then the various paragraph be cite and the article conclude : that be to say : -lrb- 1 -rrb- assume austrium attack serbium and russium as a precautionary measure send troops to the austrian frontier without commence hostility against the latter then germany be under no obligation to intervene -lrb- 2 -rrb- assume that serbium be the attack party and russium give she support by military measure which threaten austrium then the german empire must immediately assist the hapsburg monarchy with the whole of she military force -lrb- footnote 8 : _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ July 27th -rrb- hence it all depend upon who attack the interpretation of ` attack ' however be debatable both in politics and international law again and again it have be assert that that power which declare war be not the attacker but the one which make a continuance of peaceful relation impossible innumerable notice of russium 's alleged mobilization appear and probably with a view to encouraging german to stand fast ghastly picture of the weakness and unpreparedness of the russian army in a word russian rottenness and corruption persistent rumor of revolution in russium be current a vienna telegram publish in berlin -lrb- 9 -rrb- inform the german public that : news receive from warsaw deny the rumor that a revolution have break out in russian-poland but it be true that yesterday the entire citadel in warsaw be blow up official russian report endeavor to prove that the explosion be cause by lightning the extent of the damage be not yet know but in any case it amount to hundred of thousand of rouble it be also not certain whether any or how many life be lose -lrb- footnote 9 : _ vossische zeitung _ July 29th -rrb- a few day later the german official organ _ norddeutsche allgemeine zeitung _ and the semi-official _ kölnische zeitung _ publish the follow report of the explosion accord to the statement of the governor of warsaw it be cause by revolutionary no proof of this be forthcoming therefore it be ascribe to lightning and as nobody believe this explanation -- there be not a cloud on the sky at the time -- the guilt remain finally with the revolutionary now it have be prove not to the satisfaction of the russian authority of course that russian officer of high rank blow the magazine up because they would have to supply the troops with ammunition after the mobilization -- and the ammunition be not there the money for the same have find its way into the officer ' pocket on July 30th the _ vossische zeitung _ announce : to-day even more alarming news have be in the air than in the last few day the _ lokal anzeiger _ state during

point of we eastern frontier then it only mean the so-called frontier protection -lrb- _ grenzschutz _ -rrb- which have be make necessary by we eastern neighbor strengthen he customary frontier guard by troops of the line frontier protection be not generally intend to prevent a serious attack but mean rather a kind of police action two other passage will suffice to illuminate the mobilization question yesterday russium give official notification in vienna and berlin of mobilization against austrium be it to be wonder at that a feeling of disquietude be spread throughout all class of the nation by delay on we side valuable military advantage may be lose if the people once suspect that there be a absence of that firmness and joy of responsibility -lrb- _ verantwortungsfreudigkeit _ -rrb- which mark the action of the austrian government and be hail with jubilation by the german nation _ summa summarum _ : the german government have take honest pain during the last week in show its peace-loving disposition and in seek a peaceful solution to the crisis nevertheless the political situation on all side and in every respect have become worse from day to day through the fault and accord to the intention of the triple entente -lrb- 10 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : _ kreuz zeitung _ July 31st -rrb- the other be mobilize we -- issue denial we deny everything which might mean

the kaiser the peace society and some of germany 's enemy be look to he can we remain indifferent in we hour of dread need when the gleaming promise of a bright future appear in the distance if the inability to resolve and dare have make berlin its headquarters all effort be for ` peace ' with honor but in politics one must be able to recognize when it be impossible to continue at peace when

order within twelve hour or war would ensue simultaneously the french government be ask what its attitude would be in case of a russo-german war in these measure it be safe to conclude that the german nation be heart and soul behind the government otherwise the tremendous outbreak of national enthusiasm throughout the length and breadth of the land would be entirely inexplicable throughout the day the nation await under tense strain a answer from russium at five o'clock the excitement of the mass in unter den linden have increase to a degree almost beyond endurance the crowd surge from side to

toil the hand of german man leave they work and grasp the sword we enemy shall learn to he terrible cost what it mean to summon a nation in arm to the battlefield the german army go out to fight for we country in a cause which be more stainless and pure than the light of the sun the disgraceful muscovite conspiracy creep in the footstep of serbian murderer believe the moment have arrive in which they will be able to fall upon overthrow and plunder we russia desire to kindle a world war we believe that he will not succeed but should it thus fall out we german will defend not only we land and ourselves but in this war which have be force upon we in the basest manner possible we shall defend the civilization of the world the culture of the earth against debased ` unculture ' and the spreading root of decay this be a lofty and tremendous task if we be victorious as we confidently trust then the ever-increasing number of civilized people honestly toiling in the blessing of peace will thank we for century to come brother sister such a hour have come that the history of the world have never witness before in the struggle which now begin -- a deadly grapple frivolously conjure up by russium 's monarch -- the whole earth will groan the german people however will prove that it be worthy to retain and develop its lead place in the intellectual and cultural progress of the world we enemy envy we this position because in he land stupidity and confusion reign supreme he own uncivilization and barbarism can not be root out we will prevent he from throw europe back to the condition in which he and he likes dwell may god grant that the civilized people of europe may have true understanding for this historic hour just as they heroic ancestor understand the danger when they hurl themselves against the invasion of the mongol first of all the german nation will march against the army of the east and hand in hand with we ally we hope will so grip the enemy that he will lose all desire ever to attack we again -lrb- 17 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ August 2nd -rrb- the last line of this perfervid article give a instructive clue a mere quibble have arise between the central power and russia the former immediately adopt a arrogant even threatening attitude which thoughtful german condemn russium 's willingness to submit the question to a arbitration conference consist of four neutral ambassador seem only to have intensify teutonic lust to humiliate the opponent in any case it be interesting to note that between July 24th and 31st the whole german nation have be convert to the uncompromising attitude of the government further it be evident that the german people believe they be about to march against russium the very last remark which i hear from german lip as we enter the train to leave erlangen on July 31st be : jetzt werden die russen abgeklöpft -lrb- now the russian will get a whacking -rrb- -lrb- 18 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 18 : we leave erlangen at 330 pm martial law have be proclaim some time previous to that but the proclamation in berlin occur at 330 pm on the same day the _ berliner abendblatt _ publish on the same evening state that the kaiser have be wait and hope for a peaceful answer from russium the bavarian authority could not have take so serious a step without a order from the highest war lord which lead to the conclusion that it be a device to get military preparation well under way -rrb- the berlin cabinet mobilize germany 's armed strength as they allege against russium and the government succeed in arouse and enlist national enthusiasm against the eastern neighbor yet when the time come to strike germany 's might be hurl against neutral belgium and unwilling france while russium be leave free to overrun the eastern part of germany the blood-guilt rest in the first place with the kaiser and he government and in the second place -lrb- although in no less a degree -rrb- with the german people because they condone the crime and acquiesce in the duplicity while the war fury seethe through the nation the cry echo on all side : we want peace we have work for a peaceful solution yet a study of the workings of the national mind as reveal in the german press and of diplomatic doings as show in the german white book afford not a single instance -- except the socialist ' demonstration -- of any tangible concrete effort make either by the german people or its representative diplomacy to avoid a catastrophe on the other hand it must be say that the latter -lrb- german diplomacy -rrb- deliberately baulk the only practical proposal -lrb- sir edward gray 's -rrb- which could have bring about a solution the german nation _ do _ desire peace but only on the condition that they opponent grant germany and austrium 's arrogant claim down to the smallest tittle exactly at six minute to one -lrb- midday -rrb- on August 1st a telegram leave berlin instruct the german ambassador in st petersburg to declare war on russium at 5 pm if the latter state have not give a satisfactory answer to germany 's ultimatum by that time count pourtalès perform this duty and therewith the sand of fate run out on the previous day summons have be issue call a meeting of the reichstag for Tuesday August 4th the opening ceremony take place at 1 pm and all the political party be present except the social democrat who accord to they tradition do not appear and thus escape the famous hand-shaking scene the kaiser and two of he son appear in field-grey uniform he theatrical appeal for the leader of each party to swear fidelity to the national cause by shake hand with he as well as he say that now there be only german may have be spontaneous but it be far more probable that they be mean to be a diplomatic appeal to the sentimental vanity of the german nation it would be superfluous to deal with the speech from the throne in this place but at the close of the ceremony a incident occur which deserve mention after take leave of the reichstag 's representative the kaiser stretch out he hand to the famous professor of jurisprudence in strasbourg university dr van calker the kaiser look steadily at professor van calker for a moment then after the handshake clench he fist and strike downward utter these word : ` nun aber wollen wir sie dreschen ' -lrb- 19

germany 's position a tremendous fate have fall upon europe while we have endeavor to maintain the prestige of the german empire in the eye of the world we have live for forty-four year in peace and protect european peace in this work of peace we have become strong and mighty -- therefore we be envy we have suffer with long-enduring patience while in the east and west under the excuse that germany be lust for war hatred for we have be nourish and fetter work where-with to bind we the wind which blow there have now become a storm we desire nothing but to live on in peaceful toil content with a unspoken oath that be echo from the emperor down to the youngest recruit we sword shall only leap from its sheath in defense of a just cause -lrb- loud applause -rrb- the day on which we must draw it have dawn against we will and contrary to we honest endeavor russium have set a burning torch to the house of peace -lrb- loud cry of ` quite true ' -rrb- we stand to-day in a forced war with russium and france gentleman a number of document collect in the haste cause by these overwhelming event have be lay before you permit I to emphasize the fact which characterize we attitude from the moment that the austrian conflict break out we have strive and work to limit the quarrel to austria-hungary and serbium all the cabinet in particular england accept this view only russium have declare that in the settlement of this conflict she must be allow to express she wish therewith the danger of european complication raise its threatening countenance as soon as the first certain news of russian military preparation reach we we cause it to be make know in st petersburg in a friendly but unmistakable manner that warlike measure and military preparation would compel we also to take corresponding step but mobilization be next to war russium assure we in a friendly tone -lrb- cry of indignation -rrb- that she be make no military preparation against we meanwhile england try to mediate between vienna and st petersburg and be warmly support by we on July 28th the kaiser telegraph to the czar beg he to remember that it be austria-hungary 's right and duty to stop the greater-serbian agitation as this threaten to undermine austrium 's existence -lrb- cry of indignation -rrb- the kaiser point out to the czar the gulf between monarchical interest and the outrage at serajewo he beg he to give he personal support to the kaiser 's endeavor to smooth out the antithesis between vienna and st petersburg just before this telegram come into the czar 's hand the czar on he side beg the kaiser for he help : the kaiser should advise vienna to be more moderate the kaiser undertake the task of mediator but the action order by he be hardly in motion when russium begin to mobilize all she force against austria-hungary -lrb- excited shout of indignation and disgust -rrb- but austrium have only mobilize certain army corps against serbium besides which she have only two corps and these be far from the russian frontier at this juncture the kaiser inform the czar that the mobilization of he army against austrium would increase the difficulty of mediation a task which he have undertake at the czar 's express wish and perhaps render it impossible nevertheless we continue we mediatory action in berlin and indeed in a form which go to the limit permit by we alliance -lrb- great excitement -rrb- during this time russium renew she assurance that she be take no military measure against we we come to July 3ist in vienna a decision be to be arrive at on that day by we representation we have already bring it about that vienna which for a time be not in direct communication with st petersburg have commence direct discussion again but before vienna could come to a final decision the news come that russium be mobilize -- _ ie _ against we too -- she whole force -lrb- cry of indignation -rrb- the russian government although fully aware from we repeat representation what a mobilization on we frontier mean do not notify this step to we and give we no explanation concern it as late as the afternoon of July 31st a telegram come from the czar to the kaiser in which the former pledge himself that he army should take up no provocative attitude against we -lrb- great excitement -rrb- but the hostile mobilization on the russian frontier be in full swing during the night July 30th-31st while we be mediate in berlin the russian army appear on we long and almost entirely open frontier france be not yet mobilize but as she admit be already take precautionary measure and we up till then we have not -- the imperial chancellor speak with great emotion and repeatedly strike the table while utter these word -- call up a single reservist out of a loving regard for the peace of europe -lrb- loud cry of ` bravo ' -rrb- be we then to wait on in patience till the power between which we be wedge should choose they moment to strike -lrb- a hurricane of voice ` no ' -rrb- to expose germany to this danger would be a crime -lrb- stormy general and long continued cry of ` quite true ' and ` bravo ' in which the social democrat join too -rrb- therefore on July 31st we request russium to demobilize as the only measure which could save the european peace -lrb- loud applause -rrb- the imperial ambassador in st petersburg further receive instruction to inform the russian government that in case we demand be reject we should consider ourselves in a state of war with russium the imperial ambassador have carry out these instruction what answer russium accord to we demand for demobilization we do not know even to-day telegraphic announcement on this point have not reach we although matter of far less importance have be send over the wire hence long after the expiration of the state time the kaiser see himself compel to mobilize we force at 5 o'clock on August 1st simultaneously it be necessary for we to inquire regard france 's attitude in answer to we definite question whether in case of a russo-german war france would remain neutral the french government have reply that they will act as they interest dictate -lrb- laughter -rrb- this be at least a evasion if not a negative answer to we question in spite of this the kaiser order that the french frontier should be respect this order be strictly obey with one single exception france who mobilize at the same time as ourselves declare that she would respect a ten-kilometre zone along she frontier -lrb- cry of indignation -rrb- and what happen in reality they airman have throw bomb cavalry patrol have violate we territory and company have break into alsace-lorraine -lrb- indignation -rrb- therewith france although war have not yet be declare have attack we

confine themselves entirely to protect the frontier so far the report from the chief of the general staff we be now in a position of self-defence and necessity know no law -lrb- 21 -rrb- -lrb- cry of ` quite right ' -rrb- we troops have occupy luxembourg perhaps they have already enter belgium -lrb- loud applause -rrb- that be a breach of international law the french government it be true have declare in brussels that they would respect belgian neutrality so long as they opponent respect it but we know that france stand ready to invade it -lrb- cry of indignation -rrb- -lrb- footnote 21 : this sentence seem so important that i give the original : wir sind jetzt in der notwehr und not kennt kein gebot -rrb- france could wait we could not and a french attack in we flank on the lower rhine might have be disastrous for we thus we be compel to ignore the protest of the luxembourg and belgian government the injustice which we commit thereby we shall try to make good again as soon as we military goal be attain anyone who fight for the highest as we do now may only think of how he may hack he way through -lrb- hurricane of applause long continue hand-clapping in the whole house and

any case he remain faithful to the tradition of he country although the german press be both venal and supine we shall see that it have do the world a service and play its own government a foul trick -lrb- der deutschen regierung einen bösen streich gespielt -rrb- when bethmann-hollweg be thump the table before he and assure he immediate hearer and the world in general that the berlin cabinet have not call up a single reservist before five o'clock on Saturday August 1st he be guilty of a deliberate falsehood on July 31st i leave erlangen by the 331 train for nuremberg travel in the same train be dr haack professor of the history of art in erlangen university he be accompany by he wife and various colleague include professor busch who bid he farewell on the platform dr haack be a artillery

alone she tell we in a broken voice that she husband have be call up in the soul of germany i have give name and date of other case i do not propose to disgrace my word of honor by play it off against the german chancellor but act on the principle of set a thief to catch a thief i shall adduce some instance from german newspaper the pari correspondent of the _ kölnische zeitung _ travel home via brussels he adventure be relate at length in the _ kz _ for August 4th on August 1st he be in brussels and complain bitterly in he article about the hotel service and excuse it by write : the german waiter have all leave brussels the day before -lrb- July 31st -rrb- to join the army a article date strasbourg August 3rd be publish in the _ frankfurter zeitung _ on the 6th of the same month the writer describe the martial scene which he have witness during the precede week and mention that the officer in the garrison have receive a special order to send they wife and child away from the city several day before martial law be proclaim Friday presumably the order come for the garrison to march to the french frontier for on Saturday the regiment be entrain and leave strasbourg we good german friend describe the scene in the street : alongside the rank be the wife and child of the called-up reservist try to keep step with the quickly move troops before sunset the regiment all on a war-footing have leave the city every layman know that a reservist can not enter a barracks in civilian attire and emerge five minute later in full war-kit ready for the march the german imperial chancellor affirm that not one of they have be call up before five o'clock in the afternoon of that day it be true that neither the age of miracle nor the age of lie have pass away perhaps herr bethmann-hollweg could explain why it be impossible to send trunk-message on germany 's telephone system during the last three day of July 1914 at least the local papers in bavarium assert that that be the case the _ elbinger zeitung _ August 13th contain a reservist 's letter with this illuminating passage : during the last few day everybody be in readiness we linen etc have be pack and send off in advance on Friday July 31st the order arrive that i should present myself mobilization have begin with feeling of joy i change into my uniform and rush to join my company the street be full of frightened people with tear in they eye we officer press each other ' hand and with ardent glance exclaim : ` at last it have come ' the chancellor base he assertion that french troops have cross the german frontier on the report from the chief of the general staff this authority admit that german soldier on August 2nd -lrb- Sunday -rrb- have violate the french frontier and continue with these word : but long before that french airman have drop bomb in southern germany and french soldier have attack we frontier-guard in the schlucht pass the _ frankfurter zeitung _ July 31st give bethmann-hollweg and the chief of the general staff the lie direct the paragraph be date July 30th kolmar and run : the schlucht pass have just be barricade by german frontier guard this be to prevent motor-lorry and such-like vehicle from enter french territory without we permission several papers have announce the alleged occupation of the schlucht -lrb- gorge -rrb- by french troops the report be a absolute invention -lrb- die meldung ist völlig aus der luft gegriffen -rrb- i have take the trouble to look round and may say that the usual tourist traffic be go on as usual the remainder of the charge be that long before August 2nd french airman have drop bomb on south german town the town in question be frankfort and nuremberg the _ kölnische zeitung _ contain this paragraph on August 2nd : a military report have just come in state that french airman drop bomb in the neighborhood of nuremberg this morning as war have not yet be declare between france and germany this be a breach of international law two remark be necessary to supplement the above news firstly in the reichstag the chancellor say this attack have occur long before August 2nd secondly the _ cologne gazette _ receive the report from the _ military authority _ that betray the source from which all these lie emanate the author have in he possession a nuremberg paper -lrb- _ fränkische tagepost _ -rrb- for the whole of August 1914 it contain absolutely no mention of any air raid on or near nuremberg if bomb have be drop in the vicinity it be quite unthinkable that the local papers should contain no report of the affair president poincaré on July 15th 1915 declare the nuremberg flight to be a fable the _ fränkischer kurier _ -lrb- a nuremberg newspaper -rrb- on August 1st 1915 contain a article which state that the news of these allege airman whom nobody saw be spread throughout the length and breadth of the german empire this same paper ridicule the whole affair another extract give the key to the whole mystery yesterday -lrb- Monday August 3rd -rrb- at 8 pm the follow official announcement be give out for publication up till now the german troops in obedience to order give have not cross the french frontier in contrast to this _ since _ yesterday -lrb- August 2nd -rrb- french troops have attack we frontier post without any declaration of war they have cross the german frontier at several point although only a few day ago the french government assure we that they would keep a zone ten kilometre wide free from they troops _ since _ last night french troops hold german place in occupation _ since _ yesterday bomb-dropping airman have come into baden and bavarium further by violate belgian neutrality they have flee over belgian territory into the rhine province and try to destroy we railway thus france have begin a attack upon we and thereby create a state of war the safety of the empire compel we to take defensive measure the kaiser have give the necessary order the german ambassador in paris have be instruct to demand he passport -lrb- 25 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 25 : from the _ berliner lokal anzeiger _ of August 4th -rrb- germany have no earthly excuse to begin war on france and imitate the noble example of bismarck in forge the notorious em telegram which precipitate the 1870 war the german military authority forge the news of alleged attack by french airman and french troops the german official press bureau complete this vile criminal work although the point be prove a few more example of the airman legend will be of interest berlin August 2nd _ last night _ a hostile airship be observe fly from kerprich to andernach hostile aeroplane be observe fly from düren to cologne a french aeroplane be shoot down by wesel -lrb- from the _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ August 3rd -rrb- the _ frankfurter zeitung _ August 4th contain three separate detailed account of french airman drop bomb on frankfort railway station during the previous night the third account will suffice the military authority in frankfort be inform last night that a hostile airman be fly in the direction from darmstadt to frankfort at ten minute past one the noise of the propeller as well as burst bomb be hear by those stand on the command-bridge of the central station in the dark night it be impossible to see the flying-machine as it approach the station where all light be out fifty to sixty soldier station on the command-bridge fire at the aeroplane which soon move off in the direction of the southern station there too it come under a heavy fire from soldier and policeman nothing whatever have be find on the ground or at the station not even part of the bomb it be assume that the hand-bomb explode in the air -lrb- 26 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 26 : yes they burst in the air _ aus der sie gegriffen worden sind _ author -rrb- in peace time no german editor would dare to refuse any contribution send to he by the military authority the above airman-story sufficiently illustrate the state of affair in war time chemnitz August 4th during the past night between 3 and 4 be a french airman drop bomb on chemnitz bomb explode in the street without however do any damage apparently the shot fire at the aeroplane be unfortunately without result _ magdeburgische zeitung _ August 5th this be a excellent example of how the press trick be work a lie report be publish in a city hundred of mile away from the scene of the alleged occurrence the extract where it be allege that a french airman be shoot down at wesel on the dutch frontier be publish in a munich paper four hundred mile away the last and supreme lie in bethmann-hollweg 's speech be the most insidious of all the chancellor sketch a truly move picture of germany beseech austrium to find a _ modus vivendus _ between herself and russium germany claim that up to the last minute of the last fatal week she be work for peace bethmann-hollweg insinuate that on July 31st a last decision be to have fall in vienna he do not tell we what that decision would have be but he maintain that russium 's military preparation forestall it and so the decision be never arrive at thus russium destroy the last hope of peace the chancellor falsely lead he hearer to believe that it be a certain hope and that the european peace would have be save it be useless to choose one 's word in writing of german diplomacy this be a base lie austrium arrive at she decision previous to send she ultimatum to serbia this momentous decision be that russium have no right to intervene in the quarrel which mean in other word that russia have absolutely no right to speak or use she influence in a crisis affect the destiny of the slavonic people neither have russia any right to move in a crisis which would disturb the balance of power in the balkan and in europe it be merely these rights which russia throughout the crisis endeavor to establish if they have be recognize there would have be no war in order to prove what the austro-german standpoint be and that from first to last never change reference must be make to the austrian red book -lrb- 27 -rrb- on page 24 : sir edward gray be inform by count mensdorf on July 24th and i -lrb- mensdorf -rrb- repeat to he -lrb- gray -rrb- many time that we should stick to that view -lrb- footnote 27 : oesterreichisch-ungarisch rotbuch vienna 1915 -rrb- page 25 count czécsen in pari inform french minister : it be a question which can only be settle between serbium and ourselves on July 24th on the same day the austrian ambassador emphasize the same point in a interview with the russian foreign minister -- pp 27-8 during the evening monsieur sasonow have interview with both the german and austrian ambassador the latter telegraph to vienna : my german colleague at once point out to m sasonow that austrium would not accept any interference in she difference with serbium and that germany would also not permit it -- p 29 that give the situation in its simplest form and without make further quotation it will suffice to cite the date on which it be re-emphasize : July 25th in st petersburg p 89 27th p 101 28th berlin by germany p 116 london by austrium p 123 29th st petersburg p 128 30th berlin p 130 30th st petersburg p 131 31st vienna p 133 August 1st st petersburg p 136 moreover no less a personage than the kaiser 's brother confirm this view in prince heinrich 's telegram to the king of england July 30th the following passage occur : if you really and sincerely wish to prevent this terrible misfortune -lrb- a european war -rrb- may i propose that you should exercise you influence on france and russium to keep they both neutral -lrb- in the austro-serbian quarrel -rrb- in my opinion this would be of the greatest service i consider this a certain means and perhaps _ the only possibility of preserve european peace _ prince heinrich express no hope that austrium could be persuade to make any concession but merely request king george to exercise he influence to get russium to accept a position impossible to herself and incompatible with the balance of power in europe the rock of germanic obstinacy be seat in vienna whether germany be the prime mover in erect it remain to be prove germany know full well that european peace would be shatter on that rock yet there be no fragment of evidence to show that she try to remove it but there be overwhelming proof that she encourage austrium to stand by it thus cause a european conflagration and as if the above be insufficient to prove that the german imperial chancellor be guilty of conscious falsification austrium put one more nail in the coffin of european peace on September 24th 1914 when it issue a official communication to the press reiterate that austrium have never dream of depart from the attitude which she first take up -lrb- 28 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 28 : die schuld be weltkriege -lrb- the guilt for the world war -rrb- by a austrian vienna 1915 p 59 -rrb- germany 's aim be to employ the serajewo crime as a lever to put russium as a vital force out of the domain of european politics in spite of denial there be reason to believe that austrium be incline to listen to reason but germany forestall and prevent this by despatch a ultimatum to russium and then declare war a few other point in bethmann-hollweg 's speech deserve brief notice he quote germany 's threat but not one word from the peaceful overture which be so often mention he fail to cite any single point which austrium have yield at germany 's advice further no proof of germany 's vaunted mediatory action be discoverable either in the speech or the diplomatic document publish by the central power in regard to he justification of the violation of belgian neutrality the civilized world have already pass judgment and in this place it only remain to point out that the four hundred member of the reichstag cheer the chancellor 's announcement this alone be a sufficiently severe comment on the conception of right and justice which direct the proceedings of germany 's highest legislative body it evidently do not occur to the reichstag or germany 's imperial chancellor that if necessity know no law which respect a neutrality guarantee by germany then at a later date necessity would also recognize no law which protect belgian territory after germany have conquer it a lamb in the jaw of a lion be in a truly dangerous position and although the outlook may be black it be still wiser for the lamb to try and avoid the lion 's jaw bethmann-hollweg see the mote of greater-serbianism in serbium 's eye but he be peculiarly anxious not to perceive the beam of pan-germanism which have blind germany 's vision for a generation and be the one and only cause for the rapid increase in european armament before consign the german chancellor 's pecksniffian oration to well-deserved oblivion there be one other fact to state because it be of immediate interest to great britain in the person of bethmann-hollweg the german government stand before the world on August 4th 1914 and endeavor to prove that germany be attack and that she conscience be clear there be even briton who have get stick in bethmann-hollweg 's peace-lime yet it would be interesting if the german government would explain why the civilian population be order to leave heligoland on the afternoon of Friday July 31st they be allow twenty-four hour within which to leave the island and one who be in the exodus describe the scene in the _ leipziger neueste nachrichten _ for August 12th early on Saturday morning the civilian proceed on to the landing-stage where several steamer be wait suddenly the _ königin luise _ start off without take any passenger on board and soon disappear under full steam this be the boat which lay mine round the mouth of the thame although the german chancellor protest he desire for peace with england as late as August 4th it seem quite evident from the event in heligoland that war with this country have be decide upon on July 31st chapter iv mobilization munich -- evening after evening mass of people throng the street the heavy oppressive atmosphere weigh upon the spirit -- a leaden pressure which increase with every hour then come the stir event on the evening of July 3ist when the drum beat ` general march ' on the marienplatz and a commissioner read the article of war to a crowd number by thousand thirty drummer and commissioner in motor rush through the street of the city on Saturday evening August 1st the general order for mobilization be proclaim from the office of the _ münchener neuesten nachrichten _ a deep solemnity fall upon the mass of spectator and the crowd fall into rank to march to the royal palace from a window of which king ludwig speak word of comfort and inspiration still sing the ` wacht be rhein ' this river of humanity flow on to the ` englischen garten ' at the corner of which stand the austrian legation a gentleman address the representative of we beloved ally who sound in he reply the note of ` faithfulness unto death ' and now from out the stifle depression of the leaden weight of the previous day there arise a terrible unite will a single mighty think the whole of a great and powerful people be arouse fire by one solemn resolve -- to act advance on the enemy and smash he to the earth dresden -- i be sit in the garden of a suburban restaurant above I be the dark mass of chestnut tree while before we above the railway be a long strip of bright summer-night sky there seem to be something gloomy and uncanny in the air the lamp blink maliciously a spirit of still expectation rest on the people furtive glance be cast from time to time at the near embankment military train be expect and we listen nervously to the noise of the night the first troop-transport where be they go -- against russium or to the french frontier it be whisper that the troops would only be transport by night at last a pound thud come through the stillness of the night and soon two colossal engine be silhouette against the sky like fire-spitting monster they roar seem more sinister than usual heavy foreboding rumble out in the rock and roll of the endless coach -- the clang of a future pregnant with death and pain suddenly the table be empty everyone rush towards the light compartment of the train and a scene of indescribable jubilation follow as train after train of armed man rush by into the night sometimes a troubled father be hear to exclaim : ` if only the first battle be fight and win ' yet calm confidence prevail from the very begin but the sight of the quiet machine-like completion of the mobilization strengthen we trust even though a justifiable indignation and rage fill we heart at europe 's dastardly attack on the central state hate flame highest however when england declare war against we there be several reason for this in the north of germany the englishman be look upon as the european who stand nearest the german and with whom we have the most sympathy he personal reliability and the manly firmness of he bear the culture of english social life english art and style have give imperial germany many point of contact and grounds for sympathy we historical interest have never collide then we suddenly become aware that this country under the mask of friendship have egg on the whole of europe to attack we not because we have injure english feeling or interest but solely to destroy a competitor and divide he coat of many color no political necessity compel modern carthage to declare war on we but merely the avowed aim to do a good piece of business by the war without england 's intrigue europe would never have dare to attack we in we case therefore hate have spring out of disappointed love england have become we mortal enemy just as russium be austrium 's in a word the two central power be inspire by moral superiority over they enemy and be determine to wage war on they to the last drop of blood and if fate permit it to settle they off and settle up with they once for all at the commencement of the mobilization the railway time-table in force be cancel railway traffic cease and only slow local-train run stop at every station to pick up the man during the night a gigantic transport of troops go on to the frontier from that moment the sale of alcohol on the station be prohibit the publication of news concern troop movement be suppress in order to veil we objective and to keep secret we strength on the various frontier the train in the tyrol be deck with wreath and flower they bear german from the most southerly corner of we neutral ally -- italy member of the _ wehrkraftverein _

destroy the brenner line the whole plan of mobilization would have be disturbed therefore sentinel be place along the whole line and strong guard protect every tunnel at night all light be put out and those on the engine cover up even the station be not illuminate -- everywhere darkness slowly feel its way the train creep over the brenner -- it take twelve hour in innsbruck the station be crowd with german to welcome the warrior and the ancient hill echo again and again the ` wacht be rhein ' the solemnity which have mark the first day in munich have give place to boisterous joy thousand of man in mountain costume have flock into munich to offer themselves as volunteer and the street and station ring with they _ jodeln _ -lrb- the peculiar cry of alpine herdsman -rrb- outside the station lay vast quantity of material for the fly corps and innumerable motor-car a regiment of artillery be just leave while a band be in the center of the station the rhythm of the kettle-drum roll mightily and the music clash in the huge central hall thousand of voice join in then helmet hat cap rifle and sword be wave and the train move off amid shout : ` go for they cut they down ' -lrb- ` drauf auf

hundred i shall never forget these day they be the greatest in we history we never dream that anything so overwhelming could be experience on earth only three week ago and we should have be quite incapable of imagine its like the feeling that we have experience something overpower something which we can not utter overwhelm we all we see it in each other 's face and feel it in the pressure of a hand word be too weak so each be silent about what he feel we be conscious of one thing alone : germany 's heart have appear to we at last we see each other as we be and that be the indescribable something -- the birth of this great time never have we be so earnest and never so glad every other thought every other feeling have go what we have think and feel before be all unreality mere ghost day have dawn and they have flee the whole land bristle with arm and every german heart be fill with trust if we be always as we be to-day -- one heart and one voice -- then the whole world would have to bow before we but we no longer know ourselves we have forget we real nature we be so many and so divided and each want only to be himself how be it that such madness could have blind we and discord weaken we now we realize we strength and see what we can achieve for in spite of all we have retain we integrity we have suffer no injury to the soul germany 's soul have sleep awhile and now awake like a giant refreshed and we can hardly recollect what it be all like only three week ago when each live for himself when we be at best only party not a people each know not the other because he know not himself in unholy egoism everyone have forget he highest will now each have find he true will again and that be prove -- for we have only one in all german heart flame the same holy wrath a sacred wrath which sanctify and heal every wound heal we be again healthy and whole praise be to god for this war which deliver we on the first day from german quarrelsomeness when the day of peace return we must prove that we deserve to have live through this holy german war then no word must be speak no deed do on german soil which would be unworthy of these sublime day group stand at the street corner read the latest news one count aloud how many enemy we have : there be already six a silence ensue till someone say : ` many enemy great honor and we shall win for we cause be just ' such utterance can be hear every day that be german faith human might do not decide but god 's justice that be the supreme blessing of this great time we put we trust in the spirit modern german have never breathe before so pure a atmosphere for germany 's soul have appear to we \* \* \* \* \* i be go to pronounce a blessing on this war the blessing which be on all lip for we german no matter in what part of the world we be all bless bless and bless again this world war i do not intend to become lyrical lyric be so far from I that in all these three month i have not compose a single war poem no i shall endeavor to count up quite calmly unlyrically what we have see during these three month : point for point the whole list of surprise for they have all be surprise one after the other only a few day ago a high state official say to I : ` let we confess at once that in all europe nobody believe in this war everybody have prepare for it but nobody think it possible -- not even those who want war ' all think man consider that the interwoven economic dependence on each other among the nation be so strong that none dare commit suicide by commence a war thus we speak to each other and that seem a axiom further it seem to be true that even if a madman let loose the dog of war then it would be all over in a fortnight the man in the street imagine that it would be a kind of parade -lrb- _ aufmarsch _ -rrb- a mobilization test and the power which succeed best would be the victor for no country in the world be strong enough to stand the enormous cost for longer than three week now three month have go and we have stand the strain and we can bear it for another three six month a year or as many year as it must be the calculation be wrong all the calculation be wrong : the reality of this war surpass everything which we have imagine and it have be glorious to experience on so grand a scale that reality always surpass the conception even that be not true which we learn in all the school and read in all the book -- that every war be a awful misfortune even this war be horrible yes but we salvation it seem so to we and so it have appear to we from the very first day onward that first day will remain in we memory for ever never in all we life have we experience anything so grand and we have never believe it possible to experience anything so magnificent word for word bismarck 's prophecy -lrb- 1888 -rrb- have come true : ` it must be a war to which the whole nation give its assent it must be a national war conduct with a enthusiasm like that of 1870 when we be ruthlessly attack then all germany from the memel to lake constance will blaze up like a powder-mine and the whole land bristle with bayonet ' the war which bismarck prophesy be this war and what he foretell come to pass and we see it with we eye we see the german mobilization with eye which since then have be consecrate all enthusiasm be splendid even in a individual be he who he may and for whatever cause you like in enthusiasm everything good in a man appear while the common and vulgar in he sink away any enthusiasm either of group or society in which the individual ego lose itself be grand but the mighty enthusiasm of a powerful people be overwhelming this be however a enthusiasm of a peculiar sort -- it be well discipline a enthusiasm combine with and control by the highest order in this the fundamental secret of german power be reveal : to remain calm in enthusiasm cold amidst fire and still obedient to duty in a tornado of passion then we be all inspire by the thought and feeling : ` nobody can achieve that for in order to be able to do it we have have to perform a huge intellectual and spiritual task it be not alone the result of the last century and a half no that work have be go on for nearly a thousand year ' what be the spirit of we german mysticism the spirit of eckhart and tauler except : drunkenness of the soul in a wake condition the accept law on which all great german deed rest be : to dovetail enthusiasm with discipline and order from we gothic through german _ barock _ to frederick the great and kant on to the classical period -- what do all that mean if it be not the architecture of one huge feel the soul run riot in its imagining and therewith the intellect build the ravings of the soul provide the material with which the mind build what be german music from bach to beethoven and from beethoven to wagner -- yes even to richard strauss -- but enthusiasm with discipline german music have be we mobilization it have go on just as in a _ partitur _ by richard wagner -- absolute rapture with perfect precision hence when we see the miracle of this mobilization -- all germany 's military manhood pack in railway train roll through the land day by day and night after night never a minute late and never a question for which the right answer be not ready and wait -- when we see all this we be not astonished because it be no miracle it be nothing other than a natural result of a thousand year of work and preparation it be the net profit of the whole of german history at the german mobilization not only we brave soldier reserve and militia -lrb- _ landwehrmänner und landstürmler _ -rrb- enter the field but the whole of germany 's historic past march with they it be this which inspire the unshakable confidence which have endure from the first day of war in truth the dear fatherland have every reason to be calm in the meantime something more have happen : all in a moment we become german we hold we breath when the kaiser utter these word this too arise out of the deepest depths of germany 's yearning it sound like a eagle-cry of we most ancient longing germany 's soul have long pine to tear itself from its narrow confines -lrb- _ verwerden _ as eckhart or _ sich entselbsten _ as goethe put it -rrb- to lay aside self-will and sacrifice itself to be absorb in the whole and yet still to serve -lrb- wagner -rrb- and this eternal german yearning have never reach fulfilment but self-interest and egoism have always be stronger every german have be at war with all the other ` for every man to go he own way ' say goethe ` be the peculiar characteristic of the german race i have never see they united except in they hate for napoleon i be curious to see what they will do when he be banish to the other side of the rhine ' and goethe be right : no sooner be the land free from the oppressor than each begin again to think and act only for himself hence when we first learn of the kaiser 's word we feel almost a joyous fear if it be only true that now there be only german but on the very next day we eye see and we ear hear that at last there be only german and with that all pain and fear be forget if war be awful even a just war a holy war -- even for the victor too we will endure all that for it be as nothing no sacrifice be too great for this prize -- that we be all only german since the emperor speak those word three month have pass and there have only be german in the land these three month have bring much sorrow to german heart for there be hardly a home which do not lament a father a son or a brother nevertheless one may say that since we existence as a nation germany have never be more joyous in the best sense of the word than in this time of suffer through we tear the noblest joy have shine not alone at the success of we arm it be not from pride at fight against a world of enemy it be not the fact that we be now assure of a future which in July last we could not have imagine it be not the feeling of power of which even we ourselves do not know that shine joy spring from deeper reason we be glad because we have find each other we do not know each other before indeed no one know himself now we know each other and above all each know himself it be bismarck who utter these terrible word : ` when the unoccupied german must give up the struggle and strife which have become dear to he and offer the hand of reconciliation then he lose all joy in life civil war be always the most terrible thing which any land can have but with we german it be still more terrible because it be fight out by we with more love for the strife than any other war ' do it not sound truly horrible for the greatest benefactor of a nation which have to thank he for have realize its century-old dream of unity to say in all calm and as something quite obvious that he own nation engage in a civil war ` with more love ' than any other war and wherever we look in bismarck 's speech the same complaint be find which have be the eternal lamentation of goethe -- the lament over the lack of faith and will of the german how will it be this time will it be as after the seven year ' war after the war of liberation after 1870 will it be again all in vain as soon as the fatherland be secure will every german once again cease to be a german in order to become some kind of - crat or - ist or - er this time it will be more difficult for from this war he will return no more into the same fatherland it will have expand the german fatherland will be greater arndt 's poem must be write over again : no longer merely ` as far as the german tongue be speak ' germany will stretch beyond that limit and in it the german will have work to do in he speech bismarck speak of the ` unoccupied ' but in all probability after this war for year to come there will be no ` unoccupied ' german they will be fully occupy with the new organization what the sword have win we shall keep ` the pike in the european carp-pond ' say bismarck once ` prevent we from become carp they compel we to exertion which voluntarily we should hardly be willing to make they compel we to hold together which be in direct contradiction to we innermost nature ' as we can not change we nature it will be good if we take over for good and all a number -- a very considerable number -- of these european pike that will occupy the german peasant and give a outlet to he superfluous energy there will be no leisure-energy to discharge itself in party strife further we must build europe up again it stand on rotten foundation

leave the fatherland in the lurch -- and the pledge be repeat on many occasion -- they be free to babble to french english and italian socialist about the blessing of internationalism general strike and eternal peace but there be no single instance on record to show that german socialist consider any other benefit of internationalism except those which serve the purpose of they own nationalism at halle 1890 liebknecht say : these idea be indisputably correct nobody -lrb- 64 -rrb- no matter how enthusiastic he may be for the international cause will dare to maintain that we have no national duty national and international be not oppose principle the word ` national ' must be rightly understand it include only a certain limited portion of international humanity the part belong to the whole and international merely mean go beyond the boundary-post of the nation the narrower limit of the native land to extend one 's horizon to include the whole to consider humanity as one family and the world as a home -lrb- footnote 64 : liebknecht be wrong there be dupe who hold that they international obligation come before they national duty and unfortunately in the rank of these traitor english mp 's may be find who receive # 400 per annum from the british state presumably to aid they in injure the british cause -rrb- the error into which british socialist have fall -- or be lead -- be they attitude towards militarism german democrat have never denounce the bearing of arm they have admit that arm will always be necessary pre-supposing that the world continue along the same line of development as heretofore they have only object to the exist _ form _ -lrb- 65 -rrb- of militarism but otherwise they have always be unanimous that military training should be compulsory and universal they british _ genossen _ -lrb- comrade -rrb- have either misunderstand or wilfully pervert these teaching german socialist have unswervingly insist upon every man learn the use of arm while they british follower have preach absolute disarmament and do they utmost to betray this country into weaken herself below the minimum necessary to guard the land and to maintain the country 's pledge to the world -lrb- footnote 65 : kautsky : die internationalität und der krieg -lrb- vorwärts publish house berlin 1915 -rrb- p 26 we have fight against the military system not to make the land defenceless but in order to introduce another system in its place which will give we the necessary guarantee that the army will always be the tool of the civil authority and never they master when the latter be the case we call such a condition ` militarism ' and it be against that alone that we fight see that military power be absolutely subordinate to the civil authority in the case of great britain -lrb- mutiny act -rrb- then accord to the principle of german socialist they british colleague be wrong in all the effort which they have make against the armed power of these island -rrb- in halle herr bebel make this statement : i have already make it clear that i consider the effort of the so-called peace friend towards disarmament to be useless -lrb- _ aussichtslo _ -rrb- because it be unthinkable that the rival state would agree to legal restriction concern disarmament if such be make each would endeavor by secret preparation to out-do the other war and national enmity be necessary product of society and the exist class distinction the german be quite logical in this matter in effect they say -- the exist state and form of government make militarism necessary and war inevitable therefore we declare war to the knife on every exist government include russian czarism british constitutionalism german autocracy and american republicanism they be one and all rotten unjust and inhuman we program include they complete overthrow and the erection in they stead of a _ volksstaat _ -lrb- people 's state -rrb- the position be perfectly simple and to those who be sufficiently ignorant and naïve this program promise a universal salvation as delirious in its joy as that expect by african race when bend the knee before image of wood and stone german socialist be pledge just as irrevocably to the doctrine of brute force as be the junker and military power in the german fatherland what be they industrial and class warfare but a attempt to enforce the doctrine of might be right in the official program draw up at erfurt 1891 there be a paragraph state a claim for _ uneingeschränktes koalitionsrecht _ -lrb- absolute and unlimited right of coalition -rrb- which mean that the mass may unite to enforce what they will and annihilate whom they please the same rights of coalition be deny to anyone else and in the coal-strike in south wale -lrb- 66 -rrb- we have a lurid example -- such instance could not be find in germany -- of the absolute and unlimited right of coalition at the risk of undoing any and every other right -lrb- footnote 66 : the strike during the present war -- author -rrb- the point be this : german socialist have declare they intention to give no allegiance to any existing form of government and to overthrow they at the earliest possible moment do british socialist accept this part of the program throughout german social democratic literature we find mr ramsay macdonald refer to as _ genosse _ ramsay macdonald which mean that he be consider a full member of the brotherhood if that be really the case and if he accept they program as one to be follow here he would be favor the substitution of the _ volksstaat _ for the british constitutional monarchy in face of this it may be ask why do british member of the socialist party take a oath on enter the house of common and why do they accept # 400 per annum to support a national state if they have pledge themselves internationally to overthrow it the author admit he inability to solve the riddle but during the year 1902-1914 he have hear member of all non-socialist german party assert that the german socialist do not recognize any religious oath and section of the socialist admit this position as a party they be professedly atheistic therefore when the might of the german state compel they to take a oath -- they take it with a inward _ rückversicherung _ in a word false-swearing be permit when one be oblige by circumstance to take a oath to authority whose right and might the oath-taker do not admit so long ago as 1892 the social democrat be publicly charge with condone perjury in order to rescue fellow member from the result of breach of the law judge schmidt in a court at breslau say in that year : social democrat have never conceal the fact that they be hostile to any religious form of oath for they the religious importance and responsibility of a oath have no meaning whatever numerous german judge and author have express themselves in a similar strain reader who be interested in the point be refer to the report -lrb- 67 -rrb- of the socialist congress hold in berlin October 1892 the party leader endeavor to gloss the matter over with righteous indignation and ambiguous phrase but it nevertheless remain a fact that the desire to counteract effectively a tendency to perjury among socialist lead the german government a few year later to make perjury punishable by penal servitude up to ten year -lrb- footnote 67 : all these report may be see in the british museum reading room press mark be : 08072d -rrb- before leave the _ volksstaat _ the author only wish to state that it lay the axe on every conception of morality religion and social order which we esteem in the place of exist condition it would erect a mob tyranny more degrading to the individual than czarism or republicanism the mine of siberium and the tinned-meat factory of chicago may enslave the body but the _ volksstaat _ as portray by socialist writer and speaker promise a intellectual tyranny -- hopeless alike to body and soul and those who have have a opportunity to observe the brutal tyranny call party discipline which rule the german social democrat will bear the present writer out in say that its like could only be find inside the german army the strongest best organize and most thoroughly disciplined political party in the world have repeatedly express its unalterable determination to place national before international interest whenever these two should seem to be at variance in the light of these declaration the action of german socialist in give unreserved support to the german government in this war be not altogether surprising furthermore this foundation-stone in they policy ought never to have be leave out of consideration when ponder over they ecstatic utterance on peace and internationalism the communistic manifesto of karl marx and friedrich engel first publish in london in the german language in 1847 contain the following : man say that we communist wish to destroy the nationality of the native land workman have no fatherland it be impossible to take away what they do not possess the communist scorn to conceal they view and intention we declare openly that they aim can only be attain by the violent overthrow of all exist social order let the ruling class tremble before a communistic revolution the proletarian have nothing but they chain to lose while they have a world to gain -lrb- 68 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 68 : envy and greed be the two powerful lever by which the social democrat be endeavor to lift the world off its hinge they live by the destruction of every ideal treitschke in the preussische jahrbücher vol 34 -rrb- german socialist have incorporate these principle _ in theory _ in they program but _ in practice _ they do not hold they especially if they own skin be endanger together with the government which be threaten by violent overthrow that be the sum total of they extensive defense -- literature publish _ since _ the outbreak of the present war in its naked reality that be what the guarantee-insurance policy cover so long as no danger threaten they own life goods and chattel such eloquence as the following extract be shout into the world but when they personally stand face to face with the moloch upon which for year they have heap contemptuous abuse then national -lrb- _ ie _ personal -rrb- interest come first herr fischer in he capacity as president of the socialist congress in berlin 1892 say : the reception of french delegate at halle and of liebknecht at marseille have prove incontrovertibly that the struggle french proletarian be of one mind and heart with german social democracy let the chauvinist burn with hate on this and that side the rhine urge we on to war let the diplomat and government of both country sacrifice the well-being of the two nation to militarism and the war-bogey the working-man in the two country stretch out they hand to each other over the frontier as pioneer of true culture and morality they be convince that there be only one enemy which separate they and that it be they common task to fight against and annihilate this one enemy -- capitalism now as ever we social democrat reply to the government 's military and economic policy this parole : not a man and not a farthing will be vote for this system -lrb- 69 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 69 : social democrat member of the reichstag in they report to the annual congress hold in cologne 1893 -rrb- these quotation have be intentionally take from speech etc publish in the early ninety of the last century if necessary it would be a easy matter to fill several volume of similar matter from the annual congress report down to 1913 from the vast mass of german social democratic literature publish between 1890 and 1914 and from the hundred party newspaper and review circulate in the fatherland yet in the face of all these assurance it seem to we that the german socialist have shamefully betray they principle on August 4th 1914 by give they unreserved support to germany 's holy war -lrb- 70 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 70 : in all germany and among all class this have become the popular designation of the european war : _ unser _ heiliger krieg -rrb- probably the betrayal be not so shameful as it seem because the fact be not make know in this country that the german socialist have but imitate bismarck 's policy with russium and austrium -lrb- bismarck conclude a treaty with the one power then behind that power 's back he conclude a _ rückversicherungsvertrag _ with the other _ ie _ a cover insurance policy intend to protect he against all risk -rrb- during a quarter of a century german social democrat have be the most ardent and insistent pioneer of internationalism and anti-militarism but it have not be so generally know that they too have protect they rear by a _ rückversicherung : _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- they have consistently teach that every man must learn to bear arm and that both man and woman must be prepare to make any sacrifice for they fatherland -lrb- 2 -rrb- they have always hold that national interest must be consider before international palaver in chapter i we have see that up till July 28th 1914 the german social democratic party consider austrium and germany to be entirely responsible for the european crisis they have then no shadow of doubt that austrium alone be guilty for bring the danger of a european war to they very door from that point we again take up the story -lrb- 71 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 71 : in all the mass of literature publish by german socialist during the war i have find only one mention of they first attitude to the war danger on the first anniversary of the ultimatum to serbium -lrb- July 23rd 1915 -rrb- the _ leipziger volkszeitung _ contain these line in a leading article : to-day we may not repeat that which we write about the ultimatum in we issue of July 24th 1914 but there be no doubt in any section of the press that europe stand on the brink of war from the moment that ultimatum be despatch -rrb- three day later they tacitly agree that russium be the guilty party and acquiesce in the mobilization of the german army on August 1st this proclamation occupy the front page of they seventy-seven daily papers : parteigenossen military law have be proclaim any hour may bring with it the outbreak of the world war thereby the severest trial will be impose upon not only we nation but upon the whole of we continent up till the last minute the internationalist have do they duty and on the other side of we frontier every nerve be be strain to preserve peace and to make war impossible if we earnest protest we repeat endeavor have be without success it be because the condition under which we live have once again prove stronger than we will and the will of we workman brother hence whatever come we must now face it with firmness the horrible self-laceration of the european people be the cruel confirmation of we warning to the ruling class for more than a generation we have speak admonishingly and in vain _ parteigenossen _ -lrb- comrade -rrb- we shall not live through come event in fatalistic indifference we shall remain true to we cause we shall hold firmly together permeate by the sublime greatness of we cultural mission the woman on whom the burden of event press two and threefold have above all in these serious time the task of work in the spirit of socialism for the high ideal of humanity so that a repetition of this dreadful catastrophe may be avert and this war may be the last the stern regulation of martial law strike the workman 's movement with terrible force imprudent action useless and falsely-conceived sacrifice damage in this moment not only the individual but also we cause comrade we appeal to you to persevere in the unshakable confidence that the future belong in spite of all to nation-binding socialism to justice and humanity der parteivorstand -lrb- the leader of the party -rrb- berlin July 3ist 1914 with these word million of german socialist represent by four and a quarter million voter and a hundred and eleven member of the reichstag tacitly deny they previous protestation that austrian imperialism be let loose the war-fury on europe there be rumor of a secret consultation with the german chancellor but that be of little import in this place the leader of this huge party proclaim on July 25th that austrium be the blood-guilty power and maintain this attitude in spite of bloodshed till 11 pm on July 28th by what lightning-change austrium 's original guilt be transfer to russia by July 31st be not record with regard to the text of the above proclamation there be variation to be note in the _ vorwärts _ it run within and without we frontier in the second paragraph the text as i have give it be take from the _ leipziger volkszeitung _ in the fifth paragraph the nuremberg _ fränkische tagespost _ give capitalistic for fatalistic a few extract from socialist newspaper will suffice to illustrate the complete change of front which happen in three day : we social democrat in this solemn hour be at one with the whole german nation without distinction of party or creed in accept the fight force upon we by russian barbarism and we be ready to fight till the last drop of blood for germany 's national independence fame and greatness _ der folksfreund _ -lrb- karlsruhe -rrb- August 1st we desire peace and we have do everything humanly possible to secure that end but when war be force upon we by russian czarism then whatever the final decision may be we must drop all class distinction and difference of every kind to form a single determine people prepared to defend germany 's independence and greatness against the enemy -- even to the last drop of blood _ volksstimme _ -lrb- mannheim -rrb- July 31st a defeat would mean collapse annihilation and horror most dreadful for all of we -lrb- 72 -rrb- we imagination revolt at such a possibility we representative in the reichstag have unanimously declare on innumerable occasion that the social democrat could not leave they fatherland in the lurch when the hour of destiny strike the workman will now redeem the promise give by they representative the ` fatherlandless fellow ' -lrb- 73 -rrb- will do they duty and in do it will allow themselves to be surpass in no wise by the patriot _ münchener post _ August 1st -lrb- footnote 72 : these sentiment do not occur to this journalist when germany begin a ruthless war of invasion on belgium -- author -rrb- -lrb- footnote 73 : a phrase of contempt employ by the kaiser when speaking of the social democrat in 1889 and which become proverbial -rrb- whatever we opponent have do to we at this moment we all feel the duty to fight against russian knout-rule we woman and child shall not be sacrifice to russian bestiality nor the german people become a booty for the cossack _ die volksstimme _ -lrb- chemnitz -rrb- August 2nd it be possible that even at the end of the war no explanation will be forthcoming for this astounding change of attitude some have suggest that the russian or slavonic danger cause it yet just these journal and this party have maintain so long as any degree of free speech be permit that austrium have provoke the danger and they be fully aware that the german government have from first to last approve of and openly assist in provoke nay challenging russium on a question which involve the latter 's prestige and diplomatic existence bethmann-hollweg give the alleged russian mobilization as the immediate cause of the war but doubtless the social democrat know full well that for several day before russium 's mobilization be announce germany have be secretly mobilize she army from July 26th till July 30th german papers contain many report that russium be mobilize they may have be true or not but the diplomatic correspondence publish by austrium and discuss on page 63 show conclusively that the central power be bait russium into take that step and when the greatest slavonic power have make the desire move germany reply with a ultimatum which bring about the war so ardently desire by the great majority of germany 's warlike tribe britisher who sympathize with german social democracy may advance the plea : if germany 's military preparation be secret how could the social democrat know of these proceedings the answer be direct and simple : every individual social democrat -- and man woman and child they number some twenty million -- have for year past be a spy and informer in the interest of the _ umsturzparteus _ -lrb- overthrow-party -rrb- all the happening of the workshop barracks farmyard shop and office have be systematically report to the local press and local committee of the democratic party the ammunition thus obtain have be just as systematically employ to fire insidious paragraph and press article at government local authority employer officer and even the employer of servant-girl of late year it have be dangerous to have a difference even with a maid-servant a few day later the inevitable insidious anonymous attack would certainly appear in one or other of the sd journal one instance will suffice to illustrate the everyday routine of the class-war -lrb- _ klassenkampf _ -rrb- in which the whole energy of the social democrat have be absorb for a quarter of a century a acquaintance of the author 's major schub in the 19th infantry regiment station in erlangen dare some year ago to send he orderly with a she-goat to a peasant in the district who keep the indispensable he-goat two day later he be pillory in a furth paper for call upon a private soldier to fulfil such a degrading office german workman do not read the _ vorwärts _ -lrb- its circulation be well under 100000 -rrb- but they read one or other of the seventy purveyor of filth and class hatred which form the stock-in-trade of the social democratic party the author of this work know as early as July 25th that reserve officer have be warn to hold themselves in readiness on succeed day he see tangible evidence that mobilization be proceed stealthily and it would be ridiculous for he to claim greater knowledge than the hundred and eleven sd member of the reichstag and the seventy-seven editor of they party papers -- especially when these have a army of million of spy at they command in order to obtain a correct judgment of the motive which actuate german social democrat in they complete support of the german government it be necessary to consult the work publish by they during the war karl kautsky write : -lrb- 74 -rrb- that which under these circumstance be most immediate and press in determine the attitude to war not only for the mass but also many of we leader be the fear of a hostile invasion the urgent necessity to keep the enemy out of we territory no matter what the cause object or result of the war may be this fear be never greater and more justified than on this occasion never have the devastating result of invasion be more terrible belgium and east prussium speak plainly -lrb- footnote 74 : die internationalität und der krieg berlin 1915 p 32 -rrb- the increase size of the army greatly extend the unavoidable desolation of war and in addition to this a second strongly-working popular motive decide the attitude of a nation to war viz the interest of the entire people in the fate of a army in which every family be represent it thus become evident that no motive of justice right or wrong or politics play any part in the decision arrive at but merely a great fear which impel the social democrat to consider first and foremost how to save they own skin all protest meeting be cancel on August 1st and the press restricted itself to chronicle rumor and event the sit of the reichstag be await with impatience as that be expect to bring more light on the crisis the effect which bethmann-hollweg produce upon he hearer be to convince they that russium alone be to blame the question of support the war by vote a loan be all the easier for we to decide because the provocation have come not from france or england but from russia i admit openly that while i be travel to berlin to the reichstag i have very little time to hunt for precedent in the party 's history to determine my vote for I the force of circumstance alone be decisive the material interest of the work class and the entire nation common sense and the realization of a practical policy -lrb- 75 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 75 : die kriegssitzung des deutschen reichstag -lrb- the war sit of the reichstag -rrb- by karl hildenbrand member for stuttgart publish 1915 p 13 -rrb- at the time of voting on August 4th we be not in a position to take england into consideration because at the moment she have not yet declare war but by england 's intervention we attitude on August 4th have be still more emphatically justified -lrb- 76 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 76 : ibid p 16 -rrb- this statement be a gross distortion of the truth it be true that england have not yet declare war but sir edward gray have make england 's attitude quite clear on the previous day he speech have be publish in the berlin papers furthermore the chancellor inform the reichstag that england 's position be perfectly clear although he suppress the fact that germany have begin preparation for war with this country five day before by order civilian to leave heligoland and despatch the _ königin luise _ to lay mine on we coast in any case the action of the social democrat on that occasion be a example of unfaithfulness to principle accept the invasion fear as a ground for vote a loan for a war of defense there be still no evident reason why they should vote fund for a war of aggression against belgium on the surface there be no explanation for they cheer when bethmann-hollweg announce the invasion of two neutral state by germany 's army have they be trick into support a alleged defensive war there be still time to protest against german horde overrun two weak neighbouring country in spite of they terror that they personally might suffer through the horror of war they vaunted humanitarianism lead to no outcry against those same horror be wilfully and ruthlessly force upon they belgian _ genossen _ the only anxiety which the speech of they choose spokesman herr haase betray be the anxiety to avoid responsibility in the name of my party i be empower to make the follow declaration : we be stand in a hour of solemn destiny the consequence of the imperialistic policy -- which bring about a era of armament and make international difficulty more acute -- have now fall upon europe like a storm-flood the responsibility for this recoil upon the leader of that policy we decline to accept it social democracy have fight against this ominous development with all the force at its command up to the very last hour we have work for the maintenance of peace through mighty demonstration in every land especially in intimate cooperation with we french brother -lrb- applause from the social democrat -rrb- we effort have be in vain now we be face to face with the stern reality of war we be threaten by the terror of a hostile invasion to-day we have not to decide either for or against war but only concern the necessary means for the defense of we country now we have to think of the million of we _ genossen _ who be innocently sweep into this fate they will suffer most through the devastation of war we ardent wish accompany also we brother who be call to the flag without distinction of party -lrb- loud applause -rrb- we think too of the mother who must give they son and of the woman and child who be rob of they bread-winner and to whose fear for they loved one be add the dread of hunger ten of thousand of wound and mutilate warrior will soon be add to these we consider it we most compelling duty to help they to lighten they burden and relieve they distress -lrb- 77 -rrb- -lrb- loud applause -rrb- -lrb- footnote 77 : there be every reason to believe that the party have work hard to keep this promise -- author -rrb- in case of a victory for russian despotism which be already stain with the blood of russium 's best son much -- if not everything -- be at stake for we people and we free future it be a question of avert this danger and of secure the culture and independence of we own country -lrb- loud applause -rrb- now we will redeem we oft repeat pledge : in the hour of danger we shall not leave we fatherland in the lurch -lrb- loud applause -rrb- thereby we feel ourselves in unison with the principle of internationalism which have always admit the right of each single people to national independence and national defense we condemn as internationalism do every war of conquest we demand that as soon as the goal of security have be attain and we enemy be incline to make peace the war shall end by a peace that will make friendship with neighbouring country possible we demand this not only in the interest of the international solidarity for which we have uniformly fight but also in the interest of the german nation we hope that the cruel school of war 's suffering will awaken a horror for war in new million and win they over to the socialistic ideal and international peace guide by these principle we vote in favor of the war loan -lrb- loud applause -rrb- -lrb- 78 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 78 : _ leipziger volkszeitung _ August 5th -rrb- a short historical comparison will assist in make the social democratic action still clearer in 1870 when bismarck ask the reichstag for a war credit to prosecute the campaign against france the socialist be few and helpless yet liebknecht and bebel refuse to vote in its favor they moral demonstration be in itself perfectly logical for bismarck 's and napoleon iii 's intrigue equally deserve condemnation -lrb- 79 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 79 : kautsky : die internationalitat und der krieg p 19 -rrb- apparently it do not occur to the democrat in 1914 that probably germany have again be guilty of intrigue it be noteworthy however that the small party in 1870 protest when a national issue be at stake while the mighty party of 1914 make no protest whatever although as they have previously announce and denounce the issue have be raise by the unjust action and vile intrigue of austrian imperialism the campaign against russium conduct by the nationalist press up till August 1st be take up by the organ represent social democracy immediately war break out they papers be flood with appalling picture of russian -lrb- generally term asiatic -rrb- barbarism tyranny and misrule passage from the speech and writings of bebel liebknecht and other be quote to show the fiendishness of russian policy and the justice of every german do he utmost to smash czarism and deliver million of fellow workman from its thrall even a blood-and-thunder story of the russian police be turn on as a serial story in they daily papers -lrb- 80 -rrb- in short nothing be omit which go to make _ stimmung _ -lrb- footnote 80 : der polizeimeister ein russischer polizeiroman by gabryelum zapolska the story commence in the nuremberg party organ on August 11th and in kautsky 's _ leipztger volkszeitung _ on August 18th -rrb- have they be honestly impartial a still blacker picture of austrium paint by one of the founder of the workman 's movement might have be quote yet it might have be indiscreet to tell german what lassalle write austrium russium be a mammoth barbarian empire which its despotic ruler endeavor to civilize just so far as suit they despotic interest in that country barbarism be excusable because it be a national element but the case be very different with austrium there it be the government which represent the barbaric principle and crush beneath it by artifice and violence the civilized people under its rule -lrb- 81 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 81 : bernstein 's edition of lassalle 's reden und schriften vol i p 306 -rrb- with the exception of a few britisher the socialist of all country have unanimously condemn the attitude of the german party not the least interesting be the condemnation express by the italian section dr südekum reichstag member for nuremberg be send to italy to discuss the situation with italian socialist and justify they own action in support the war the follow account of the meeting appear in the _ vorwärts _ for September 12th : the meeting last from 330 pm till 7 pm südekum declare that he have come to inform they italian comrade of the situation in which the german socialist find themselves and in order to learn whether the italian have take any step to keep up communication with democrat in other land we hold firmly to the contention that the german socialist could have do nothing except what they do my presence here be a proof that we german be aware of we duty towards internationalism -lrb- 82 -rrb- we believe that the german government have give proof of its peaceful tendency and be force into war against its will therefore the social democratic party support it -lrb- footnote 82 : there be no evidence to show that südekum 's italian visit have any other purpose than win over the sympathy of italian socialist and with they the whole italian nation for the purpose of german nationalism -- author -rrb- delium seta answer that this be no justification for give they support the italian socialist would not have give they assistance under the same circumstance just as they have refuse to vote in favor of the libyan war dr südekum reply that the german socialist be compel to defend they fatherland against czarism further he repeat haase 's declaration in the reichstag and continue : ' i be astonish that the italian socialist be able to believe that so strong a party as the german democrat have deny they ideal and be untrue to they task you must admit that no other way be open to we except to grant the credit demand ' after this he assert the nationalist press of france and italy be work against germany and it seem as if the italian comrade be in agreement with italian nationalist in endeavor to maintain the exist condition of affair -lrb- 83 -rrb- in italy -lrb- footnote 83 : the exist condition of affair seem to mean italian neutrality -- author -rrb- finally südekum conclude by point out that the german democrat have neither the intention nor the right to influence the attitude of the italian socialist but be merely endeavor to link up hearty international intercourse again in reply delium seta say he find it remarkable that the german socialist have appeal to they italian comrade in this solemn hour all the more remarkable because intention might easily be ascribe to this intervention ` this be a serious motive which impel we to state we opinion with unreserved frankness ' he continue : ` you defense do not convince we you speak of france be ally with we and of england germany 's enemy but we speak of we france revolutionary france jauré 's france the french socialist oppose the military preparation make by france you german do not do the same in you country or at least only up to the point where the imperialistic feeling of the kaiser and he party might be hurt ` the point of view of german democrat coincide with that of german imperialism german predominance mean for we a far greater danger than czarism because czarism prevent the german army from march on pari and thus protect the banner of france which in spite of all mistake and error be still the most revolutionary ` germany 's motto be : _ deutschland über alle _ and you have not oppose it but you have publish in the _ vorwärts _ a appreciation of the kaiser allege that he have work during twenty-five year for peace ` you speak of german civilization be in danger but in this civilization we can find no trace of culture when you attack and torture neutral belgium and complete the destruction of louvain take as a whole german socialist be just as plausible and use the same excuse as the minister of the german government -lrb- 84 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 84 : might not this also be say of messr morel macdonald bernard shaw etc and the _ labor leader _ whose writings on the war have be scatter broadcast throughout germany during the last six month -rrb- ` we be enrage at the terrible fact that germany have violate belgium 's neutrality and you have not even protest we tell you quite openly that we honor and weep for devastate belgium and tremblingly follow the fate of france ' südekum have no word with which to answer this terrible indictment and the _ vorwärts _ could only add the following comment : we consider the judgment of we italian comrade to be one-sided but for reason easy to understand desist from discuss it in the present situation unfortunately we must recognize the fact however that the italian view be widespread among the socialist of other neutral country germany 's revolutionary party lose no time in hoist the banner of no annexation the _ leipziger folkszeitung _ second in importance only to the _ vorwärts _ nail down a phrase in the kaiser 's speech from the throne which state : we be inspire by no desire for conquest in comment on this phrase kautsky 's organ say : the part of the speech which excite most sympathy in we be the admission that germany cherish no lust for conquest at the proper time we shall refer to that again it be with sincere regret that we see the french government on the side of the criminal power which have enslave and rob the russian people if germany in a delirium of victory should raise claim which mean annexation then we shall -- that must be repeat again -- recall the speech from the throne of the german kaiser on August 4th 1914 -lrb- 85 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 85 : _ leipziger volkszeitung _ August 4th -rrb- during the first year of war a split among the social democrat have become evident and it appear certain that it be the annexation question which be cause the cleavage in December last liebknecht abstain from vote when the second war loan be grant by the reichstag evidently doubt have arise in a small section of the party either as to the origin of the war or in regard to the object which the german government hope to attain on August 20th 1915 dr liebknecht put this question in the reichstag : be the government prepare to enter into immediate peace negotiation on the basis that germany renounce all annexation claim and assume that the other power in question be willing to negotiate von jagow reply : i believe the great majority of the member will agree with I when i refuse to answer the question as be at present beside the purpose the reply evoke a hurricane of bravo a parallel may be find in the year 1870 the central committee of german social democrat pass a resolution that : it be absolutely necessary for the party to organize simultaneously in all part of the country great popular demonstration against the annexation of alsace-lorraine and pass resolution in favor of a honorable peace with the french republic nothing come of the movement for on September 9th the committee be place under arrest and prosecute if germany should be victorious in this war it be to be assume that the socialist would again prove powerless to prevent annexation what the ally can not hinder the social democrat would be still more helpless to prevent especially as the great majority of they be unreservedly on the side of the kaiser and he government when in need the latter flattered and persuade the democrat to vote for a alleged war of defense but should german arm be victorious the german government would neither seek nor accept advice on she national project from she quondam internationalist there be grounds for suspicion that the party be play a game desire by the berlin government for some month past they have try every mean possible to arrange personal interview with the leader of the correspond party in france -- the french comrade have refuse to meet they the _ leipziger volkszeitung _ for July 16th 1915 contain more than a column about we and the french in which the german party spread the usual teutonic lime of sophistry and empty phrase one passage betray the entire intrigue they wish they french brother to agree to a peace without annexation which mean in so many word that the french socialist be to renounce alsace-lorraine for ever have they be or should they be in the future so foolish as to enter this german mouse-trap then before the war have reach a decisive conclusion a large section of the french nation would be pledge to renounce the lost province even in case of a german defeat this be a excellent instance of the manner in which german social democracy work in a enemy country to assist its own government in like manner the independent labor party and union of democratic control be force exceedingly sensitive to german influence and in a decisive moment can be set in motion by the german comrade the hundred and eleven social democrat in the reichstag have no real power in germany if they possess any degree of power then fear for they own skin prevent they from risk its exercise they real opinion concern alsace-lorraine appear in the same journal four day later accord to we opinion it would be a crime if france make the return of these province a condition of peace in the same article a accusation of one-sidedness be make against the socialist in france for support the french government after which it be not surprising that every time the name of the _ genossen _ macdonald snowden hardie and newbold occur in the _ leipziger volkszeitung _ they be mention with awe and reverence besides ramsay macdonald and philip snowden we friend jt walton newbold have get on the nerve of the english patriot -lrb- 86 -rrb- these gentleman invariably receive polite mention but french socialist be evidently in disfavor -- presumably because they know too well the german game -lrb- footnote 86 : _ leipziger volkszeitung _ July 23rd 1915 -rrb- the peace program of the german socialist have be publish a official declaration of the party which appear on August 23rd 1915 give the following condition while care for the national interest and rights of we own people and at the same time respect the vital interest of all nation german social democracy strive for a peace which bear the guarantee of permanence and will bring the european state closer together in matter of justice culture and commerce in this sense we have draw up the follow scheme : i the security of german independence and the entirety of the german empire which imply the rejection of all annexation plan on the part of we opponent that include the french plan to re-incorporate alsace-lorraine with france no matter in what form that end may be seek ii in order to secure free economic development for the german nation we demand : -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- the ` open door ' _ ie _ equal rights for commercial and such-like activity in all colonial territory -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- the inclusion of the most-favoured-nation clause in the article of peace of all the nation now at war -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- the further of a economic entente by abolish tariff etc as far as possible -lrb- _ d _ -rrb- the equalization and improvement of the social-political institution accord to ideal aim at by the workman 's international party -lrb- _ e _ -rrb- the freedom of the sea be to be guarantee by a international treaty to this end the right of capture at sea must be abolish and all strait and narrow of importance for world commerce must be internationalize iii in the interest of germany 's security and the free exercise of commercial and economic effort in south-eastern europe we reject all the warlike aim of the quadruple alliance to weaken or disintegrate austria-hungary and turkey iv -- in consideration of the fact that the annexation of territory inhabit by another race transgress the rights of nation to govern themselves furthermore because thereby the unity and strength of germany would be weaken and she foreign relation seriously and permanently injure we oppose the plan in that direction cherish by shortsighted conquest-politician -lrb- 87 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 87 : there be two and a half line of dot at this point probably the german censor have cut out a sentence -rrb- v -- the terrible destruction and suffering bring upon humanity by this war have win over million of heart to the ideal of a world peace permanently secure by a international court of justice the attainment of this end must be recognize as the highest moral duty of all those who be appoint to the work of frame a peace therefore we demand that a international arbitration court shall be create which shall settle all future difference between the nation -lrb- 88 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 88 : _ leipziger volkszeitung _ August 23rd 1915 -rrb- this imaginary peace-treaty be what german would call a _ zankapfel _ -lrb- apple of discord -rrb- it may represent the serious opinion of germany 's greatest political party but the german government will welcome it because it will give germany 's sympathizer in france england italy and russia a excellent weapon with which they can attack they respective government and hamper they in protect they national interest it will doubtless be a inspiration to the member of the ilp and the udc -lrb- 89 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 89 : above prophecy write end of August fulfil in the _ labor leader _ October 28th -- author -rrb- if the german government seriously formulate such proposal the author believe that all britisher worthy of the name would simply answer : fight on on this assumption the proposal deserve no discussion yet the document be interesting as reveal the mind of social democratic germany these sublime pharisee be unconscious of belgium 's wrong and germany 's crime the former deserve no compensation and the latter no penalty here we be on the bed-rock of they idea of justice and humanitarianism still we be not altogether surprised because the democratic newspaper organ have openly defend and justify the atrocity commit by german soldier and whenever any particularly damning evidence have be produce they parole have consistently be : at any rate now be not the time to discuss it accord to they comprehension the only time for discussion be when europe be under the german heel they be willing to discuss -- when discussion can no longer injure the fatherland when germany have gain all she want the most remarkable metamorphosis which the german democrat have undergo be show in they change attitude to england this country give a home to marx and engel the former be bury in highgate cemetery for many decade the party profess enthusiastic admiration of british institution and we ideal of personal freedom they admiration for england be not always convenient to the german government and be certainly a thorn in the side of the kaiser in 1898 the party publish a handbook for social democratic voter which contain lengthy explanation of they entire policy therein they justify they opposition to german naval expansion and while concede that naval supremacy be vital and indispensable to england continue : boundless plan be veil beneath the navy bill -lrb- 1897 -rrb- the hotspur among the water-patriots dream of a first-class navy which might rival yes even surpass the british fleet for the water-patriot the navy bill mean a instrument to further they unlimited _ weltpolitik _ and scheme of conquest a weapon with which to realize they mad imagining of a greater germany they desire to employ it as a tool for they absolutist plan and adventurous world enterprise it increase the risk of foreign conflict at the same time it brighten the prospects of success of those influential circle which -- impel by a overpowering impulse to deed and inspire by a diseased longing for prestige -- press on from excitement to excitement from daring to daring and from crisis to crisis this remarkable prophecy have be verify by history but with its realization the party which make it have be convert to the side of they former opponent to-day the social democrat be just as hearty in the desire to see britain overthrow and british naval supremacy smash as be the kaiser 's government no impartial thinker dare deny that the british fleet have be the principal factor in prevent europe 's subjugation to german autocracy and the world to german militarism yet the so-called party of freedom pray earnestly that this fleet may be destroy this represent the tone of they daily press and the change of attitude have be prove to be scientifically correct in various book publish by they leader during the present year one of these work will be quote at considerable length because of its importance in show what the pioneer of liberty wish may be the end of the home of liberty the work bear the title german social democracy and the world war -lrb- 90 -rrb- its author be a socialist member of the reichstag -lrb- footnote 90 : die deutsche sozialdemokratie und der weltkrieg by dr paul lensch publish by the vorwärts publish house berlin 1915 -rrb- in deal with england he refer to they former admiration for this country and proceed to prove that it be wrong -- wrong in the interest of germany and the world england 's fight against napoleon for european freedom dr lensch dispose of in a sentence : consume by greed england take the long-yearned-for opportunity and fall upon she rival france -lrb- p 16 -rrb- he inform he reader that england and russium be two beast of prey england 's disarmament proposal be only intend to secure she naval supremacy because germany seem to be escape from the strangulation cord which england have draw tight round she throat therefore three problem present themselves to dr lensch which the war must solve : -lrb- 1 -rrb- shall the german people continue to exist as a independent nation -lrb- 2 -rrb- shall the danger of czarism continue to threaten west european culture -lrb- 3 -rrb- shall britain 's naval supremacy be eternalize or overthrow see that britain only allow other nation to develop so far as they be compatible with she national interest -lrb- p 15 -rrb- england 's oft-praised freedom be base upon the enslavement of the world the people now recognize that england 's wealth freedom and greatness be merely the corollary to they poverty slavery and wretchedness -lrb- p 20 -rrb- international socialism have not the slightest interest in help to bolster up this supremacy -lrb- p 22 -rrb- when this monopoly be break the english work class will lose they present privileged position they will be reduce to the same level as the workman of other land then socialism will flourish in england -lrb- p 23 -rrb- -lrb- 91 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 91 : the author have fondly imagine that the british workman stand foremost as the result of he own battle in any case it be to be hope that british socialist will be grateful for genosse lensch 's prayer for they downfall -rrb- no party stand to lose more by a british victory than social democracy the overthrow of england 's world-position would clear the way for the continuation of the world 's progress on the right historical line and its economic development -lrb- p 25 -rrb- in the present world war the interest of the internationalist be bind up in a german victory hence a german victory would be a victory for marx 's internationalism and only then would the heart and head of english workman be open to the intellectual schooling of the socialistic idea -lrb- p 27 -rrb- as early as the eighty in the last century friedrich engel prove that the ruin of england 's industrial monopoly have begin what the scientist have foretell become evident to all eye two decade later the social system of the greatest world-ruling industrial state be shake to its foundation international socialist have every reason to welcome this peaceful downfall of england 's world power -lrb- pp 21-22 -rrb- marx once write that war be like a locomotive in the history of the world may this war have that effect and under full steam lead to a finish the work which peaceful development have already commence _ ie _ the downfall of english supremacy if the war hasten and conclude this process then the sacrifice in blood and treasure will not have be in vain a great stumbling-block to human progress and especially to the proletarian fight for freedom will have be hurl out of the way -lrb- pp 27-8 -rrb- have fail during a peaceful fight of over forty year to hurl german autocracy and militarism out of the world these hot-headed pioneer of liberty -lrb- kaiserdom -rrb- wish to destroy the very state which be they place of refuge when german liberty overwhelm they with its kindly attention still we can not be too grateful to dr lensch for he lucid statement it be a effective reply to germany 's sympathizer in this country and if british workman should ever see these line it will interest they to know that german socialist be anxious to pull they down a little in the belief that if british workman be cut short in they luxury they will become better socialist and internationalist dr lensch have only one step more to take and he will certainly gain the highest german order -- _ pour le mérite _ the famous communist manifesto of marx and engel conclude with the word : proletarian of all land unite it be much to be desire that dr lensch should amend this by add to marx 's phrase a few word so that the amend form would run : proletarian of all land unite to sing ` deutschland deutschland über alle ' by this simple mean the learn doctor would condense the entire teaching of he book into a single sentence the position to-day be that the interest of freedom and democracy be utterly at variance with a french victory -lrb- p 42 -rrb- greater prussium be found by the war of 1866 while the 1870 struggle establish a little germany through the present war great germany will be create -lrb- p 46 -rrb- on another page this socialist-chauvinist proclaim that the freedom of the oppressed must be the work of the oppressed themselves which be a principle that the ilp and udc etc would do well to note the peculiarity of we situation be to be find in the fact that extraordinarily advanced ideal have penetrate into we unripe condition -lrb- 92 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 92 : loui bamberger in a essay on german social democracy in the _ deutsche rundschau _ vol 14 p 243 -rrb- it be to these unripe condition that lensch liebknecht david hildenbrand and the remain leader of german social democracy should give they undivided attention last year the berlin government publish a record of crime commit in germany it be the most awful record of any nation in the world and the above gentleman would do well to study volume 267 of the _ vierteljahrshefte _ there be hundred of thousand of brutal crime commit in germany by german proletarian during the year 1912 for half a century marx lassalle bebel liebknecht and they successor have be busily engage in intellectualize germany 's proletarian now it be advisable for the socialist party to begin the work of humanize they they effort to internationalize the world have result in a hopeless _ débâcle _ let they now begin the task of humanize germany they have all evidently forget the german proverb : _ kehr vor deiner eignen tür _ -lrb- sweep first before you own door -rrb- chapter vii necessity know no law on August 2nd 1914 belgium announce she neutrality in the european war france have already declare she intention to respect belgian neutrality at all cost on the other hand we have bethmann-hollweg 's word that he know french army be stand ready to strike at germany through belgium this statement he have never support by any proof nor even mention he authority for the same -lrb- 93 -rrb- in view of the fact that no military preparation have be make on the franco-belgian frontier and that the german army first come into contact with french force long after the fall of liége we be compel to declare the german chancellor 's statement to be a pure invention -lrb- footnote 93 : so-called evidence have be give by richard grasshoff in he book belgien 's schuld -lrb- belgium 's guilt -rrb- pp 14-20 grasshoff quote the swear statement of a german corporal who reside in boitsfort near brussels the corporal state that he see two french and one english officer in brussels on July 26th and eight french soldier on July 29th the statement of three french soldier prisoner of war in germany be also cite these man maintain that they enter belgium on the 31st of July and the 2nd of August with regard to this evidence we must note that grasshoff be a german official the corporal a german spy and that the frenchman have make these statement in a prisoner ' camp a place where they be expose to the temptation of german gold and the influence of teutonic bully lastly the berlin general staff have record that the german army first come in touch with french troops on August 19th near namur -rrb- moreover germany 's excuse for invade belgium be give in the title of this chapter have germany possess any proof that french officer in disguise be organize preparation in belgium or that french airman have cross the latter 's territory in order to drop bomb by wesel etc then bethmann-hollweg would have have no reason to admit in the reichstag that he country be commit a breach of international law under such circumstance belgian neutrality would no longer have exist the chancellor instead of necessity could have plead justification and the world could scarcely have withhold its approval in the early hour of August 4th the german cross the belgian frontier although the _ cologne gazette _ have publish a notice three day before announce that germany have no intention whatever of take the step and that no german troops be near the frontier general von emmich immediately issue this proclamation in french : to my great regret german troops have be compel to enter belgian territory they be act under the compulsion of unavoidable necessity for french officer in disguise have already violate belgian neutrality by try to reach germany via belgium in motor-car -lrb- 94 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 94 : one wonder what military purpose these officer have in view they would have be inevitably arrest at the german frontier the fable be make public by wolff 's agency and have be ridicule even by the german press _ vide _ pp 96-7 -rrb- belgian it be my most ardent desire that it may yet be possible to avoid a struggle between two people which up till now have be friend formerly even ally remember the glorious day of la belle alliance when german arm help to find the independence and future of you fatherland now we must have a free way the destruction of tunnel bridge and railway will be consider hostile action belgian you have to choose the german army do not intend to fight against you but seek a free path against the enemy who wish to attack we that be all we desire herewith i give the belgian people a official pledge that they will not have to suffer under the terror of war that we will pay ready money for all necessaries which we may have to requisition that we soldier will show themselves the best friend of a nation for which we have the highest esteem and ardent affection it depend upon you prudence and you patriotism whether you land shall be spare the horror of war -lrb- appear in the _ cologne gazette _ August 6th -rrb- a dresden paper of the same date contain a illuminating statement we have just receive official information that the german general staff have be inform by a absolutely reliable source that the french intend to march through the valley of the meuse into belgium the execution of this plan have already commence therefore france be by no means prepare to respect belgian neutrality for year past the king of belgium have conspire with england behind the back of he minister to damage german interest he telegram to the king of england be a trick plan long ago these fact will soon be supplement by a large number of documentary proof from this the necessity have arise to direct germany 's advance through belgium irrespective of neutrality consideration -lrb- 95 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 95 : _ leipziger neueste nachrichten _ August 9th -rrb- here we have the first clumsy attempt to prove that belgian neutrality do not exist these after-thought have grow during the past year into no inconsiderable literature probably the two motive which have inspire germany -- official and unofficial -- to print many volume on belgian neutrality have be the indignation arouse in neutral country and the fact that a complete german victory be not obtain in three month of war german newspaper again betray the plot against belgium and a search through they file reveal in the clearest manner possible how wolff 's bureau be again the source of a widespread campaign to prove that germany be right and simultaneously to lash public opinion into hatred for the belgian barbarian and beast in the first few day of August the press be fill with report concern the murder and ill treatment of german in belgium before any act of war have take place no doubt a justified fear for the mighty brutal neighbor exist in the popular imagination and fear may be the father of ill-considered deed nevertheless there be no proof that mob law prevail in belgium as it do in germany moreover the latter country outlaw herself when she proclaim the law of necessity in the light of this consideration the german outcry that the belgian be break both the law of humanity and international jurisprudence lack sincerity and remain unconvincing a country which announce she intention to ignore exist law and hack a way through at all cost should surely be the last to declaim on the alleged offence against the law of war by a small weak unprepared neighbor if these consideration be insufficient there remain the fact that germany herself begin war against unarmed belgian civilian during the night follow the unsuccessful _ coup de main _ against liége a zeppelin attack the town and drop bomb on Thursday August 6th at 330 be z6 return from a air-cruise over belgium the airship take a conspicuous part in the attack on liége and be able to intervene in a markedly successful manner we first bomb be drop from a height of 1800 foot but fail to explode the ship then sink to 900 foot above the city and a non-commissioned officer drop twelve more bomb all of which explode set the city ablaze in several place -lrb- 96 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 96 : german official report in the _ berliner tageblatt _ August 10th -rrb- a austrian who be in the town afterwards describe the attack in the _ grazer tagespost _ accord to this witness it be already daylight when the airship appear and the effect of the bomb be truly awful in view of the circumstance that it be already light germany can not put forward the defense that the bomb be intend for the twelve fort which surround liége at a distance of some mile this be the earliest official record of a attack upon civilian -- and it come from the german side the crew of z6 be the recipient of a tremendous ovation on they return while the news of this dastardly murder be receive with jubilation throughout the german empire in lunéville fifteen civilian be kill by airship bomb two day earlier shortly afterwards follow the attack by airship on civilian in antwerp the author have before he about one hundred different newspaper report allege the most awful barbarism on the part of the belgian among the numerous statement that german be murder only two name be mention and both these man be alive to-day the one be herr weber proprietor of a hotel in antwerp we have now receive full detail of the murder of the german weber he have flee from he pursuer and hidden himself in a cellar as the rage mob could not find he they burn sulphur in the house which cause weber to break into a violent fit of cough this betray he hiding-place he be drag out and murder -lrb- 97 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 97 : _ hamburger fremdenblatt _ August 12th and simultaneously in many other journal on the follow day the _ vorwärts _ announce that herr weber have return to germany in the company of they own correspondent -rrb- the german pork-butcher deckel who have a large business in brussels be attack in he house by a crowd of belgian beast because he have refuse to hang a belgian flag before he shop with axis and hatchet the mob cut off he head and hew he corpse in piece -lrb- 98 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 98 : _ kölnische volkszeitung _ August 10th -rrb- a few day later the _ berliner tageblatt _ inform its reader that herr deckel be reside in rotterdam and have suffer no harm whatever reader who be acquaint with the official record of brutal crime committed year by year in germany and the haughty contempt for civilian rights which the whole german army have consistently show in the fatherland during the orderly time of peace will require little imagination to conceive that this same army would show still less consideration for civilian in a country which they be wrongfully invade the german press during the last thirty year as well as many book publish in the fatherland contain ample proof of german brutality at home and above all of the legal brutality of german non-commissioned and commission officer how can germany expect the world to believe that these same man be transform into decent human being by the mere act of step over the belgian frontier grant that vulgar element of the belgian population do transgress there still remain incontrovertible evidence that almost unheard-of kindness be show to the invade army and that german have display brutal insolence to belgian before a state of war have be declare nearly every single letter from soldier publish in german papers record the fact that in the village through which they pass they be give water wine and food while payment be in many case refuse it be part of germany 's policy to blacken belgium 's character in order to justify she own ruthlessness -- naturally wolff 's agency be one of the principal tool to that end much as we condemn the excess of the belgian still we must not wreak vengeance on the whole nation as a section of we press demand have not harmless and defenceless foreigner be terribly ill-treated in germany without distinction of sex have not shop and restaurant be demolish in hundred wherever a french word be to be meet and the rage of the german mass have find a outlet not only against foreigner but against good german patriot and even german officer -lrb- 99 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 99 : _ leipziger volkszeitung _ August 12th this journal as well as the _ fränkische tagespost _

antwerp and brussels have sing they national song in a loud provocative manner and taunt the bystander with such remark as : in three day we shall be here again accord to the same authority german resident have insult the populace by display they national flag and german employer have be among the first to discharge employee of they own nationality without salary in lieu of notice thus increase the difficulty of german resident in belgium german official pronouncement be much more reticent in they judgment on these allegation of belgian cruelty none the less the berlin government must be hold responsible for they be scatter throughout the land after germany 's official representative have return from brussels to berlin he make a statement to the press consider that von below be in the belgian capital at the time he view be instructive he express he great astonishment that such thing should have happen and assert that up till the very last minute he have be treat with the greatest kindness and politeness neither he nor any of he legation staff have experience the slightest unpleasantness further von below express the conviction that only single instance of such excess have occur and these be a result of the quarrelsome walloon character no village _ fête _ pass off among they without such outbreak accompany by bloodshed -lrb- 100 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 100 : this may be true but von below could have say the same with absolute truth of german village fair _ kirmesse _ etc -- author -rrb- german papers of August 15th report this official version and four day later a proclamation be issue by state secretary dr delbrück call upon all person who have be ill-treat in belgium to report themselves so that the numerous newspaper report could be confirm or refute the result of the inquiry have never be publish from a number of witness who testify whole-heartedly to belgian kindness one will suffice a lady report she adventure in the _ vorwärts _ of September 6th from which the follow sentence have be glean even if it be true that german be subject to inconsideration and ill-treatment during they flight from belgium still there be hundred of german who like myself meet with generous sympathy and unstinted help a flemish servant refuse she month 's wages say that she employer would need it on the journey many german be offer home in belgian family till the war be over my own landlord in brussels place a empty flat at my disposal for german refugee at parting he and he wife be as deeply move as we and when i begin to make excuse for be unable to pay the rent she at once prevent I from speak another word my husband be provide with a hat which look less ` german ' they fill we pocket with provision for the journey and after he wife have embrace I and my child we leave the house in silence german refugee whom i meet afterwards related hundred of similar act of kindness when such severe accusation be raise against the entire belgian people justice demand this statement that belgian in hundred of case uninfluenced by the prevail bitterness show themselves kindly helpful and humane towards the german in the second month of the war two representative of the social democratic party receive special permission from the general staff to visit belgium and the theater of war in northern france they report have be issue by the vorwärts

authority -lrb- german -rrb- be now permit full investigation in those part of belgium occupy by we troops and it be already obvious that many exaggeration be circulate by german newspaper without doubt beer-house and business house be wreck but the tartar story which be report in germany and belgium herr von sandt chief of the civil administration put down to hysteric and the desire of some people to make themselves important -lrb- 102 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 102 : ibid pp 14-15 -rrb- no correct judgment on the apportionment of right and wrong between the belgian civilian and the german army be possible without take into consideration the status of militarism in each of these country before the war as far as belgium be concern the army be look upon as a necessary evil the social democratic doctrine import from germany have obtain such a hold upon the people that the belgian government experience ever-increasing difficulty in get supplies vote in the house of deputy for defense purpose belgian socialist unfortunately play into the hand of the german government by do they utmost to prevent money from be spend for the defense of they country consciously or unconsciously german socialist have render the kaiser and he army inestimable service they propaganda against armament have bear fruit in belgium england and france but do not prevent a single german battleship from be build nor a single regiment from be add to the german army in germany militarism be a gospel all class and all political party have be unanimous for year past that every man should be a soldier the military ethos have rule supreme and whenever civilianism have dare merely to cherish thought contrary to the ideal of the ruling caste no time be lose in seek a opportunity to challenge a quarrel which invariably end in humiliation for the civilian ethos characteristically therefore the contemptuous phrase have become current both in the german army and navy -- das civil -- when speaking of the non-military element of the nation imbue with these tradition and inspire by this contempt for everything civilian the german army invade belgium and it may be safely assume that in a country where the civilian ethos predominate look word and even deed express hostility such provocation would certainly rouse the military ego to a revenge ten thousand-fold greater than that take at zabern german militarism brook neither contempt criticism nor opposition from german civilian and much less so from the civilian of another nation when it be possible to obtain cool and clear account of the event in belgium the author have no doubt whatever that proof of civilian-baiting will be forthcoming in that unhappy country the policy of frightfulness be not only intend to drive a enemy into abject submission and as a punishment for resistance to germany 's imperious will but it be the military ethos in strife with the civilian spirit in order to hinder the march of the invader the tree line the road be cut down and form into barrier but the civilian population be compel at the bayonet 's point to remove all obstacle and thus assist in the conquest of they native country the

civilian population to resistance other german war-writer state that the belgian and french government have organize a _ franc-tireur _ warfare long before and this accusation be one of the pillar of germany 's defense for the destruction of louvain soon after cross the frontier we see the first ruin house we route lead we down the same road on which a few day before the violent and bitter struggle have take place between german troops and belgian soldier aid by the inhabitant the belgian have support they troops in a manner which can only be describe as bestial and cruel from the house they have shoot at troops on the march and of course they home have be reduce to ash the road from aix-la-chapelle to liége be one long sad line of desolation -lrb- 110 -rrb- otherwise the district be

have express for belgium the german public be fully inform of all that have be do and consider that _ they _ have be brutally wrongfully treat lord bryce 's report as well as the french and belgian official report have be deal with at considerable length in the german press but receive no credence whatever they be lie all lie invent to blacken the character of poor noble generous germany german be well aware of the awful number of brutal crime which they men-folk commit year by year at home yet they be absolutely convince that these same man be immediately transform into chivalrous knight so soon as they don the kaiser 's uniform they seem incapable of conceive that a race which debauch its own woman can hardly be expect to show the crudest form of respect to the woman of a enemy people herr knutz -- a elementary school-teacher in civilian attire and a non-commissioned officer when in the german army -- seem to possess some ray of human feeling just as i be leave the fort i see seven or eight belgian civilian guard by we man with fix bayonet they be charge with firing on german soldier i must say that the lamentation of these man -- aged from 20 to 50 -- make a deep impression on I they have throw themselves upon they knee and with raise hand be weep and beseech that they life might be spare the villager be exceedingly ignorant and when they land be in danger believe themselves justified in seize any old shot-gun or revolver which lie at hand probably some of the more prudent be aware that it be a mad enterprise but the instinct of self-defence be so innate in the simple country people that advice do not help in the least -lrb- von bethmann-hollweg and von tirpitz justify the use of gas the sinking of merchant vessel contain woman and child the drop of bomb on open town etc etc by the plea of self-defence -- author -rrb- but it be otherwise with regard to the atrocity on we wound these be a stain on belgium 's national honor which will not easily be wipe out a german would never perpetrate such monstrous crime -lrb- 112 -rrb- and that we can say without any overweening opinion of ourselves -lrb- 113 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 112 : this be hypocrisy or ignorance -- author -rrb- -lrb- footnote 113 : ibid pp 18-19 -rrb- herr knutz offer no proof of the alleged atrocity he have hear of they believe and repeat the story i have some fifty german book describe the war in belgium and in all of they similar legend be mention but in no single instance be a case prove and nail down no victim be name and the scene of the alleged atrocity be never give hence it seem to be the usual german artifice to make _ stimmung _ _ ie _ to raise feel one thumb-nail picture from the teacher 's diary show that the german create only too well a _ stimmung _ of abject terror among the belgian this morning August 19th we search a small wood for belgian but find none on leave the wood a touching picture meet we eye several family be flee with they child and the barest necessaries of life into a neighbouring village a old woman on crutch be try in vain to keep up a young mother with a suck child be sob and press the babe to she bosom the boy be weep

-rrb- -lrb- footnote 114 : ibid p 27 -rrb- among the various interesting picture of the fatherland sketch by german author perhaps the follow be the most naïve : english french and belgian hand in hand how nicely it be all think out belgian neutrality -- so solemnly pledge by all the power -- be nothing but a screen behind which they work the most devilish plan against germany it be a neutrality which have long since be betray and sell by the belgian government but the german people -- a pure fool-like parsifal who could not conceive such treachery and knavery because it be incapable of such thing itself -- toil and work day by day enjoy the blessing of peace be happy in its existence and ignorant of the loom cloud gather on its frontier all hail to we choose leader who keep watch and ward over a dream people and do not allow themselves to be lull into watchlessness by the lie of we enemy who while talk of peace intrigue for we annihilation -lrb- 115 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 115 : von lüttich bi flandern -lrb- from liége to flander -rrb- by wilhelm kotzde weimar 1914 p 5 -rrb- the same author 's opinion of the belgian coincide with that express by many of he fellow countryman what do we troops find by the roadside on all side haversack strap cartridge cap tunic and rifle to we soldier this be a remarkable sign of flight for they be accustom to military training of a different sort in the fort it be true they find among the soldier also civilian wear patent-leather shoe indeed the whole belgian campaign have show how badly the army be prepare and equip the lack of discipline and order be evident however in every department of belgium 's national life and these virtue they endeavor to replace by cunning and cruelty -- at least among the walloon -lrb- 116 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 116 : ibid pp 61-2 -rrb- a knight of the order of st john -lrb- 117 -rrb- be still more cynical in he condemnation of the conquered enemy : the greatest misfortune in this land be unemployment factory be inactive and shop close the horror of famine draw nearer and we as well as some neutral country be endeavor to relieve the torture of want but charity only encourage the laziness of the inhabitant just as the refugee in holland the belgian who have remain in they land would like to put they hand in they pocket and be feed of course that be not permissible and the german government do its best to rap these lazy wretch on the finger -lrb- footnote 117 : kriegsfahrten eine johanniter by fedor von zobeltitz pp 86-7 -rrb- it be characteristic that the belgian always place they hope on foreign help and never dare to rely on the strength of they own army this alone be a serious symptom of national weakness still the belgian army have fight bravely it be true they have not the discipline and preparation which distinguish the german troops but everything which a badly equipped and trained army could achieve they have do -lrb- 118 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 118 : wilhelm kotzde : von lüttich bi flandern p 71 -rrb- it be not necessary for the author of this work to write a song of glorification for belgium she have herself compose a epic of valor and self-sacrifice write in immortal deed at present she only reward seem to be a desolate land in the hand of the conqueror and the grave of she fall son germany 's evident intention be the annexation of that part of belgium where flemish be speak at the moment of write goliath have vanquish david france and england have a supreme duty to fulfil : they be call to avenge belgium 's wrong and thereby establish the principle that even necessity must recognize law chapter viii atrocity the question of belgian atrocity be so important that no apology be require for give the british public every possible opportunity to sift evidence and above all to hear the german side in the interest of fair play we will allow a german lawyer -lrb- 119 -rrb- to state the case against the belgian herr grasshoff be arm with two doctorate and be in practice as a advocate in one of the higher court of law -lrb- _ kammergericht _ -rrb- chapter iii of he work be entitle : the belgian outrage in the foregoing chapter he endeavor to show that the belgian press have work upon public opinion and lash it into such a state that atrocity and mutilation of german by belgian man woman boy and girl be the natural consequence -lrb- footnote 119 : richard grasshoff : belgien 's schuld -lrb- belgium 's guilt -rrb- -rrb- that the goad rage of the lower class find expression in nameless horror be unfortunately a sorry truth the proof we be not in a position to satisfy the desire for sensation with a cabinet of horror the equipment of the german army do not include either the jar or the chemical fluid for preserve hacked-off limb hence it be impossible to display exhibit as in a museum we hospital do not admit the dead if germany should be compel to conduct a second campaign against the culture people of western europe then she will not forget to add the above article to she equipment in any future war against such opponent pity mother earth cover the murder victim this eloquent lawyer have overlook the aid which the art of photography afford and as the german army be well equip with camera some tangible proof could still have be procure -- assume there be any shred of truth in germany 's accusation the berlin government have circulate photograph of dum-dum bullet _ ie _ english and french bullet with the point cut off it be true no statement be offer regard the time and place of the point be cut off which leave we free to believe that capture ammunition be doctor in this manner by the german themselves necessity know no law be a principle capable of the widest application grasshoff 's work be only publish a few month ago so that he have ample time to collect fact and proof -- the result be six detailed case with the name of he german informant and they regiment in each case the evidence be of a exceedingly doubtful character in view of the gravity of the charge the lack of corroboration -lrb- each case be prove by one witness alone -rrb- and the partisanship of all concern we may safely conclude that no court of justice would convict on it the same criticism apply to the official white book publish in June or July of the present year every witness have previously swear a oath to protect the german flag -lrb- _ der fahneneid _ -rrb- which preclude the probability of all impartiality in the witness and make bias -lrb- _ befangenheit _ -rrb- he simple duty another important factor to be bear in mind be the hysterical morbid self-importance of the german nation in general which cause police and member of the german army to shoot or cut down with the sword they own civilian for the most trivial offence even in time of peace the white book in question contain a six-page introduction state the charge against belgian civilian and three hundred and seventeen page of swear evidence of german officer and soldier take for the most part in belgium and france a few extract from the introduction will suffice to make the german side clear finally there be not the slightest doubt that belgian civilian rob and kill german wound in short mutilate they in a barbarous manner even woman and young girl participate in these atrocity hence german wound have have they eye gouge out nose ear finger and genitals cut off and they body cut open in other case german soldier have be poison hang on tree or have burn liquid pour on they cause death in a most terrible form this bestial behavior on the part of the civilian population be a breach of article i convention of geneva -lrb- 120 -rrb- and the principle of military law as well as the principle of humanity -lrb- p 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 120 : self-proclaimed outlaw cite the law when it suit they purpose -- author -rrb- the guilt for these transgression of international law lie largely at the door of the belgian government the latter have make a attempt to rid itself of responsibility by ascribe the guilt to the rage for destruction in the german troops who be accuse of proceed to deed of violence without any reason or ground -lrb- 121 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 121 : certainly just as in germany in peace time -- author -rrb- a examine commission have be appoint by the belgian government to inquire into the alleged cruelty of german soldier and the evidence thus obtain have be make the subject of diplomatic complaint this attempt to pervert the truth have absolutely fail the german army be accustom to wage war against hostile troops but not against peaceful citizen -lrb- 122 -rrb- investigation conduct by any examine commission whatsoever can never dispose of the irrefutable fact that german troops be force by belgium 's native population to take defensive measure in the interest of self-preservation -lrb- footnote 122 : german non-commissioned officer be accustom to kick and beat german private and the behavior of german soldier to fellow-subject be aptly illustrate by lieutenant förster fight a pitched battle with a lame old cobbler in zabern -- author -rrb- the refugee ' tale collect by the belgian commission and declare by they to be the result of a impartial investigation bear a stamp which make they unworthy of belief accord to the nature of thing the commission be not in a position to test the veracity of such rumor or to apprehend the association of event hence they accusation against the german army be nothing other than base slander which be completely invalidate by the accompany document -lrb- pp 5-6 -rrb- it must be assume that reader be acquaint with the official publication of the belgian and french government accuse the german army with wage war in a atrocious manner as well as the report of lord bryce 's commission and professor morgan 's report in the nineteenth century for June in the above extract the berlin government rule they one and all out of court which be the author 's justification for make no use of they evidence fortunately the roman catholic church of germany have publish a refutation of germany 's white book and surely this authority deserve credence the work in question bear the title : der lügengeist im völkerkrieg kriegsmärchen gesammelt von bernhard duhr sj -lrb- the spirit of lie in the war of the nation war legend collect by the rev bernhard duhr sj -rrb- -lrb- 123 -rrb- the reverend gentleman castigate all the nation at war with the same offence -- lie he work should have permanent value in the literature of war psychology but he only undertake to expose german lie and in he 72-paged booklet he prove to the hilt the charge make in this work -lrb- footnote 123 : the author hope to publish a complete translation shortly -rrb- in he introduction the rev duhr state that the office of the priest ' society pax in cologne have take great pain to expose and refute lie as fast as they have appear the original document be preserve in the above office and may be see by anyone who care to apply probably one of the motive actuate the society pax and the rev b duhr be the intention to refute the accusation of cruel outrage by belgian and french catholic priest whatever they motive may have be one thing be certain they have produce most convincing proof of german mendacity it be to be hope that the pax will give the world the benefit of all the document in they possession even the kaiser have the audacity to state in he telegram of September 8th 1914 to president wilson that woman and priest have be guilty of atrocity in this guerilla warfare for reason easy to understand the reverend gentleman do not introduce the kaiser 's name into he booklet but in the introduction he remark : finally the refutation of such fairy-tale be a patriotic duty nothing be more essential for we german especially in war time than unity but this harmony be necessarily endanger by religious bitterness and strife of a necessity it must cause deep pain and embitterment to we catholic population when again and again entirely untrue accusation be make against the priesthood of they church the rev duhr 's exposure of what he call erlogener schauergeschichten -lrb- lie horror tale -rrb- kill most of the fairy-tale accuse the russian french and belgian of atrocity on german soldier a few illustration will suffice to show the absence of all foundation for the charge against the belgian charge we must remember which the german soldiery believe and which convince they they be perform a holy task at louvain tirlemont dinant etc on October 1st 1914 a telegraphic agency -lrb- wolff 's -rrb- issue the follow notice : ' a high bavarian officer write from the front have inform the _ münchen-augsburger abendzeitung _ of this incident south of cambrai a column of german motor-car be attack by a company of french cyclist for the most part the guard be kill by rifle fire while the car be all burnt later a german patrol discover the remains and on investigation find that the dead german have all have they eye gouge out ' the reverend father comment as follow : on follow up this case it be impossible to prove whether the patrol have see rightly or whether they have really make the report at all so much be certain however that in the matter of eye be gouge out a absolute mania of gruesomeness break loose a innumerable swarm of such horrible tale be tell pass on and finally guarantee as true -- and yet they be all fairy-tale a few case will suffice in September 1914 the follow paragraph appear in the papers : ` several lady engage in red cross work on cologne station be inform with every assurance of truth that a hospital at aix-la-chapelle contain a whole ward full of wounded whose eye have be gouge out on the battlefield of belgium ' on September 26th the editor of the catholic _ kölnische volkszeitung _ write to dr kaufmann a high roman catholic dignitary in aix-la-chapelle beg he to ascertain whether the report be true two day later that gentleman reply : ` as regard the rumor mention in you letter i beg to

I that in all the local hospital there be no ward for wound whose eye have be put out and such a case have never be observe in the town although the place be full of wound ' a second report which the same journal expose date from October 1914 recently dean a who be the superior in a military hospital in the franciscan nunnery at s come to we and report that a wounded soldier have tell he that he have hear -lrb- 124 -rrb- that in the monastery bl by v in holland there be twenty-two wounded german soldier whose eye have be gouge out by belgian the dean beg we to write to the mother superior and

inquiry be make in all direction wherever a case of gouged-out eye be report the result be everywhere the same -- a fairy-tale yet when the german imperial chancellor receive a party of american journalist -lrb- representative of the united press and the associated press -rrb- on September 2nd 1914 he communicate this statement : the english will inform you countryman that german troops have burn down belgian village and town but they will conceal the fact that belgian girl have gouge out the eye of we helpless soldier lie on the battlefield berlin papers inform the public that ' a large number of belgian civilian be prisoner in münster they be the same bestial creature who shoot from they house on we unsuspecting troops and who before the arrival of we invade army in belgium have perpetrate all sort of cruelty on helpless german citizen indeed when they be search on they arrival at the prisoner ' camp finger with ring on they which they have hack off they victim be find in they pocket justice will soon strike down these belgian among whom a very large number of priest be to be find twenty to thirty have already be condemn to death by a court-martial ' the ` pax ' society of priest immediately write to the commander of the prisoner ' camp and receive this reply : ` the ridiculous assertion of a berlin paper that finger have be find in the pocket of belgian

19 -rrb- the above extract will suffice to show how these roman catholic gentleman proceed immediately a atrocity be report they apply to the authority and in every case receive a affirmation that the deed have never take place among the monstrous lie expose by these investigator be report that belgian priest pay eight shilling for every german head bring to they high treason charge against catholic priest in alsace all kind of monstrous crime charge to the priesthood that a belgian boy be catch with a bucketful of dead german ' eye espionage by priest etc etc yet one other case deserve quotation : on October 5th 1914 a priest be travel by rail to mayence in the same compartment there be four private from infantry regiment no 94 one of they name rössner related the follow story to he comrade and then at the priest 's request again repeat it : ` in the belgian village of patsie the _ curé _ welcome a german major and he orderly into he house afterwards the priest promise a boy of thirteen that he should go straight to heaven if he would murder the two german the lad perpetrate the murder after which he and the _ curé _ be shoot under martial law ' when the priest point out how incredible the whole story be the soldier swear to its truth and become very impolite to he auditor a inquiry be institute and this be the result : ` war office no 1866 the investigation make in especial the hearing under oath of private rössner and several officer in he regiment have result in the follow particulars be obtain : at the beginning of the campaign as the troops march into a village -- name unknown -- they see by the roadside two or three dead civilian one be apparently a boy of about thirteen while the other be a adult with a dark coat it be not establish whether this be the body of a priest furthermore we have not be able to discover by whom or for what reason these people be shoot ` at that time the story quote by you about a _ curé _ and a boy be tell as a rumor to

the above document may be say without presumption to possess historic importance it be a frank admission by the german war office that belgian civilian be actually shoot down without rhyme or reason apparently german soldier -lrb- -rrb- have a _ carte blanche _ to shoot whom they like without render or be expect to render a report of they doings the rev duhr write : the incredible speed with which these lie tale of horror spread on all side must be class as a morbid phenomenon a sort of blood-cult they consequence could only be to act upon the national soul as a stimulant inspiring fear and brutality -lrb- 128 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 128 : ibid p 9 -rrb- the author of this work be prepare to go much farther than the rev father and maintain that the foul diseased imagination which could invent such monstrous horror be also capable of perpetrate they they do not spring from the imagination of a edgar allan poe but arise in the mind of germany 's brutal peasantry and bloodthirsty work class who together every year commit in time of peace 9000 act of brutal immoral bestiality and maliciously wound 175000 of they fellow german citizen -lrb- 129 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 129 : _ vide _ vol

regenerate the augean stable know to the world as germany without further comment reader be leave to form they own opinion of a press which breed such filth and the cultural level of a people which consume such garbage but the world owe a debt of gratitude to the rev bernhard duhr sj and the pax society in cologne the accusation of plunder on the part of german soldier be naturally deny _ in toto _ by all party in the fatherland indeed it have be discover that the british army be guilty of wilful destruction in belgium a certain major krusemarck command the 2nd battalion of the 12th infantry reserve regiment be responsible for the story on October 10th i enter wilryk near antwerp and take up my quarter in the italian consulate all the house have be desert by the inhabitant immediately after enter the house i perceive that english soldier have be here and behave in a barbarous manner mirror valuable object of art etc have be smash in a way which betray purpose the major

visiting-card be find with the name : major el gerrard royal marine light infantery -lrb- sic -rrb- during the subsequent pursuit of the belgian and english army we hear repeat complaint from the inhabitant that especially the english troops have act in the most inconsiderate manner purposely destroy furniture etc in civilian house -lrb- 130 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 130 : richard grasshoff : belgien 's schuld p 84 -rrb- without doubt the story belong to the group of legend expose by the pax society for which reason it be quote here as a fitting supplement to they yet it be psychologically interesting to note how difficult it be for german who burn destroy and violate in they own country to believe that they behave otherwise than as lamb when play the rôle of invader one quotation from a large number will illustrate sufficiently the respect which the german troops feel for civilian home in the territory occupy by they : we get into the house by a back-door order have be issue that only food and shirt be to be take the cellar be full of wine and champagne a corporal bring we some of the latter after half a hour the room look very different all the cupboard have be empty in order

the former and propose for themselves the part of liberator and savior for flemish culture they have discover among other thing that belgium be merely a paper state a diplomatic invention a experiment and that no belgian people have ever exist but rather two hostile element be pack under the same roof against they will by the conference of london -- the say roof bear the name belgium accord to a good german-swiss -lrb- 133 -rrb- the belgian have no national feeling no patriotism and have never have a fatherland if a serious writer can make such statement after the belgian have defend they native country so heroically one naturally wonder whether herr blocher be sane or merely a pay agent of the german authority in he work he deny every and any intention to justify or condemn either germany or belgium and then proceed to blacken the latter 's character by quote every belgian utterance which may be interpret as anti-german these expression lead he to the remarkable conclusion that belgian have already violate they own neutrality -lrb- footnote 133 : belgische neutralität by eduard blocher zurich 1915 -rrb- blocher state that he work be only intend to prove that switzerland have nothing to fear from germany 's precedent in invade belgium but he never mention belgium 's maritime interest antwerp and the extensive seacoast on the north sea he be oblivious to the fact that germany 's desire to possess these be the sole motive for precipitate war and invade belgium to germany the coast of belgium be the door to the world and world domination switzerland do not possess such a door and therefore have nothing to fear from she powerful neighbor but if the ally be unable to bar this door to germany 's aggressive scheme then the time be not far distant when germany would remember that she have brother within swiss frontier and insist upon they entrance into the great teutonic sheepfold -- just as she most earnest desire at present be to drive the lose fleming back to they parent race among the many phrase which german have coin to describe belgium the follow occur : bastard eunuch and hermaphrodite accord to the german conception of a state belgium be a unnatural monstrosity from which one draw the natural conclusion that germany intend to remove it from the domain of earthly affair on the whole german writer admit the existence of belgian neutrality and also germany 's pledge to respect it the three most serious writer on the subject be dr reinhard frank -lrb- 134 -rrb- professor of jurisprudence in munich university dr karl hampe -lrb- 135 -rrb- professor in heidelberg and dr walter schoenborn -lrb- 136 -rrb- also a professor in heidelberg university -lrb- footnote 134 : reinhard frank : die belgische neutralität tubingen 1915 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 135 : karl hampe : belgien 's vergangenheit und gegenwart berlin 1915 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 136 : walther schoenborn : die neutralität belgien 's this be a appendix to a large work write by twenty university professor entitle deutschland und der weltkrieg publish by bg teubner leipzig and berlin 1915 -rrb- the nearer examination of these three work must be premise by two important consideration firstly the three professor ignore the fact that germany be a menace to belgium and make no mention of german aspiration for a coastline on or near the english channel holland and belgium form a twentieth century naboth 's vineyard on which the german ahab have cast avaricious glance for upward of forty year a casual acquaintance with pan-german and german naval and military literature during the same period afford overwhelming proof of this powerful current in german nationalism if naboth consult strong neighbor as to necessary precaution against ahab 's plan for obtain the vineyard then naboth act as a wise man and the only regret to-day be that the strong neighbor only offer naboth assurance and word instead of deed in other word great britain do nothing because as lord haldane express it the liberal cabinet be afraid -lrb- -rrb- to offend germany and precipitate a crisis secondly the three professor like all other of they class in the fatherland have swear a oath on take office not to do anything either by word or deed detrimental to the interest of the german state of which they be _ official _ member a ordinary german in write on germany may be under the subjective influence of he national feeling but a german who have take the staatseid -lrb- oath to the state -rrb- can not be objective in national question and interest -- he oath leave only one course open to he and any departure from that course may mean the loss of he daily bread the author have the greatest respect for the achievement of german professor in the domain of science and abstract think by those achievement they have deservedly become famous but in all judgment where germany 's interest be concern they be bind hand and foot -lrb- 137 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 137 : towards the close of 1913 i have a conversation with half a dozen german -lrb- average age twenty-five -rrb- in erlangen gymnasium -lrb- state secondary school -rrb- they be candidate in training for the teaching profession all university man i listen patiently to they diatribe concern the perfidy of english statesman and then point out give chapter and verse in german biography that bismarck 's record be exceedingly tortuous the forgery of the em telegram be give as a instance a few week later i meet the vice-principal of the school at a private party this gentleman be a good friend of mine he remind I of the above conversation and give I a friendly warning never again to make such statement to my pupil the candidate have talk it over and although they have provoke the discussion propose to have I report to the minister for education for utter such opinion the vice-principal have intervene and prevent the _ denunziation _ if a professor of history in a german university express any opinion in he academic lecture unfavourable to modern germany he would be immediately _ denunziert _ to the state authority by he own student should he publish such opinion in book form of course the process of cashier he would be simpler german do not desire the truth so far as they own country be concern they do not will the truth they will _ deutschland über alle _ and all information knowledge or propaganda contrary to they will be prohibit if space permit i could mention numerous case in which famous professor have be treat like schoolboy by the german state -- they stern father and master -rrb- when a german conscript enter the army he take the _ fahneneid _ -lrb- oath on and to the flag -rrb- which bind he to defend the fatherland with bayonet and bullet in like manner it may be say that german professor be bind by the _ staatseid _ either to discreet silence or to employ they intellectual pop-gun in defend germany that these pop-gun fire colossal untruth innuendo word-twisting and such like missile give out gas calculate to stupefy and blind honest judgment will become painfully evident in the course of we consideration that any and every german obey the impulse to defend he country be just and praiseworthy but in we search for truth we be compel to note the fact that german professor be merely intellectual soldier fight for germany without depart from the truth by one jot or tittle reader may even call they outside clerk of the german foreign office or the ink-slinger under the command of the german state these premise have be lay down _ in extenso _ because some fifty book will be discuss in this work which emanate from german university a neutral reader may retort : you also be not impartial for you be a englishman have anticipate the question the author venture to give a answer if he could make a destructive attack on britain 's policy -- the attack would be make without the least hesitation such a attack if prove to the hilt would bring any man renown and in the worst case no harm but if a german professor launch a attack base upon incontrovertible fact against bethmann-hollweg and germany 's policy that professor would be ruin in time of peace and in all probability imprison or send to penal servitude in time of war nothing which the present author could write would ever tarnish the reputation of german professor as man of science but in the narrower limit as historian of the fatherland and propagandist of the _ deutschland-über-alle _ gospel they be tie with fetter for the like of which we should seek in vain at the university of great britain or america it would be in the interest of truth and impartiality if every german professor who write on the cause of the world war england 's conspiracy against germany the non-existence of belgian neutrality and similar theme would print the german _ staatseid _ on the front page of he book the text of that oath would materially assist he reader in form a opinion regard the trustworthiness and impartiality of the professor 's conclusion professor frank commence he historical sketch of belgian neutrality with the year 1632 when cardinal richelieu propose that belgium should be convert into a independent republic doubtless the desire to find a buffer state inspire richelieu just as it do the representative of prussium russium france austrium and england when they draw up the treaty guaranteeing belgium 's neutrality in perpetuity at the conference of london 1839 but a additional motive actuate the diplomatist of 1839 viz belgium be henceforth to be the corner-stone support the structure commonly designate the balance of power in europe a objection have be make to the validity of the treaty sign in london viz england herself do not consider it reliable and binding or she would not have ask for and obtain pledge from both prussium and france to respect belgian neutrality in 1870 another objection be the claim that the german empire found in 1870 be not bind by the prussian signature attach to a treaty in 1839 other writer have endeavor to show that the addition of african territory -lrb- congo free state -rrb- to belgium change the political status of that country expose it to colonial conflict with two great colonial power and thus tacitly end the state of neutrality each of the professor in question override these objection and frank remark p 13 : lawyer and diplomatist refuse and rightly so to accept this view again p 14 : there be no international document in existence which have cancel belgian neutrality germany 's alleged violation of she promise to regard belgium as a neutral country be justify on quite other grounds belgium have herself violate she neutrality by a secret alliance with france and england frank argue that a neutral state have certain duty impose upon it in peace time and in support of he contention quote professor arendt -lrb- louvain university 1845 -rrb- who write : a neutral state may not conclude a alliance of defense and offence by which in case of war between two other state it be pledge to help one of they yet it be free and possess the right to form alliance to protect its neutrality and in its own defense but such defensive alliance can only be conclude after the outbreak of war another authority quote to support he point be professor hilty -lrb- university of bern 1889 -rrb- a neutral state may not conclude a treaty _ in advance _ to protect its own neutrality because by this mean a protectorate relationship would be create frank continue -lrb- p 21 -rrb- : hence belgian neutrality be guarantee in the interest of the balance of power in europe and i have already point out that the same idea prevail when the barrier-system of 1815 and 1818 be establish consider the matter from this point of view the falsity of modern belgium 's interpretation at once become apparent accord to belgian official opinion she neutrality obligation only come into force in the event of war and therefore could not be violate during peace but this balance of power be to be maintain above all in time of peace and might not be disturb by any peaceful negotiation whatever especially if these be calculate to manifest themselves in either advantageous or prejudicial form in the event of war in this category we may place the surrender of territory no impartial thinker can deny that the cession of antwerp to england would have be a breach of neutrality on the part of belgium even if it have occur in peace time the same be true for the grant of occupation rights and landing place for troops or for the establishment of a harbor which might serve as a basis for the military or naval operation of another state moreover it be unnecessary to exert one 's imagination in order to discover ` peaceful negotiation ' which be incompatible with permanent neutrality for history offer we two exceedingly instructive example when a tariff union between france and belgium be propose in 1840 england object because the plan be not in accord with belgian neutrality again in 1868 when the eastern railway company of france seek to obtain railway concession in belgium it be the latter country which refuse its consent and in the subsequent parliamentary debate the step be designate a act of neutrality from this extract it be evident that professor frank have undermine he own case belgian neutrality be intend by the great power to be the corner-stone of the european balance of power during the last forty year germany 's carefully meditate increase of armament on land and sea threaten to dislodge the corner-stone when the conference of london declare belgium to be a permanently neutral country there be apparent equality of power on each side of the stone in 1870 the franco-german war show that the balance of power be already disturb at this corner of the european edifice still germany 's pledge word be consider sufficient guarantee of the _ status quo _ since 1870 the potential energy on the german side of the corner-stone have increase in a unprecedented degree and this huge energy have be consistently convert into concrete military and naval force this alteration in the potential _ status quo ante _ have be partly the result of natural growth but in a still greater degree to germany 's doctrine that it be only might which count another german professor -lrb- 138 -rrb- have define the position in a sentence : germany be a boiler charge to danger-point with potential energy in such a case be it a sound policy to try to avert the possibility of a explosion by screw down all its safety-valves recognize that belgian neutrality have exist for many year past solely on germany 's good-will it become the right and urgent duty of the other signatory power to endeavor to strengthen the corner-stone germany absolutely refuse to relax in any way the pressure which she potential energy be exercise at this point therefore it be necessary above all for france and great britain to bolster up the threaten corner -lrb- footnote 138 : hermann oncken -lrb- heidelberg -rrb- in the _ quarterly review _ October 1913 the author of the article charge great britain with screw down the valve which be a deliberate distortion of the truth britain have always open she market free to german goods and admit the same privilege to she rival -- so far as these do not run contrary to established rights -- in all part of the world with regard to territorial expansion a treaty have be draw up between the two power and be ready to be sign just when war break out that treaty would have afford germany immense opportunity for expansion but not at the expense of europe germany however desire european expansion and accord to she accept teach the fate of extra-european territory will be decide on the battlefield of europe -rrb- the former power could have achieve this purpose by build a chain of huge fortress along she belgian frontier why this precautionary measure be never take be difficult to surmise but have it be take germany would have ascribe to she neighbor plan of aggression -- and declare war great britain could have restore the balance by create a army of several million lord haldane have announce that the late liberal government be afraid to do this although the fear of lose office may have be greater than they fear for germany the measure which england do take be merely non-binding conversation with the military authority of france and belgium the making of plan for put a british garrison of defense on belgian territory in the event of the latter 's neutrality be violate or threaten and the printing of book describe the means of communication in belgium -lrb- 139 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 139 : belgium road and river report prepare by the general staff vol i 1912 ii 1913 iii & iv 1914 copy of this work have be seize by the german in belgium and capital be be make of the incident to prove a violation of belgian neutrality if the british general staff have nothing better to do than to compile guide-book to belgium for a non-existent british army it appear merely amusing but if the late liberal government believe that germany 's potential energy could be prevent from break through into belgian territory by a barricade of guide-book -- it be a lamentable error of judgment on the whole we be force to call it a tragical irony that the only defence which belgium possess against the _ furor teutonicus _ -- except the belgian army -- be a scrap of paper and a barricade of the same material -rrb- as a result of these measure belgium stand charge by germany with have break she own neutrality and german writer be naively ask why belgium do not give the same confidence to germany which she give to england the german mind know quite well that in building strategic railway to the belgian frontier she betray the line of direction which the potential energy be intend to take when the burst come unofficially germany have long since proclaim she intention to invade belgium it be a open secret the _ denouement _ of August 4th 1914 when belgian neutrality be declare a scrap of paper -lrb- 140 -rrb- be not the inspiration of a moment nor a decision arrive at under the pressure of necessity but the result of year of military preparation and plan it have be carefully arrange that the boiler should pour forth its energy through the belgian valve -lrb- footnote 140 : this famous phrase be employ as far back as 1855 by a belgian minister in the house of deputy brussels m lebeau in plead for greater military preparation use these word : history have show what become of neutrality which be guarantee by what may be term a ` scrap of paper ' -rrb- or to draw another comparison it be a modern variety of the wolf and the lamb fable with this difference : the wolf have first of all swallow the lamb and now excuse himself by assert that the traitorous wretch have muddy the stream belgian be painfully aware of the danger threaten they and would have make greater effort to protect themselves have not they own social democrat resist every military proposal as the matter stand to-day however all the effort which belgium do make be class by germany as intrigue of the triple entente threaten she -lrb- germany 's -rrb- existence and all the horror which have fall upon this gallant neutral country the german pecksniff designate belgium 's atonement -lrb- 141 -rrb- it be to be fear that sooner or later unless germany 's military pride and unbounded greed of she neighbor 's goods can be check german professor will be engage in the scientific task of prove that the water of the upper rhine be unpalatable because the lamb reside in holland have stir up mud in the lower reach of the same river -lrb- footnote 141 : _ belgien 's sübne _ the title of a chapter describe the desolation and havoc of war in a book entitle mit dem hauptquartier nach westen by heinrich binder berlin 1915 -rrb- belgium know that england and france have no other interest than the maintenance of she neutrality belgium saw and feel where the storm cloud lower and probably seek or accept advice from those power who wish to perpetuate both the territorial integrity and neutrality of belgium germany 's afterthought on the point be : it be belgium 's duty to protect she neutrality and she owe this duty to all state alike in the interest of the balance of power -- a conception to which she owe she existence she be bind to treat all the signatory power in the same manner but she fail to do so in that she permit one or two of they to gain a insight into she system of defense by this mean she afford the state admit to she confidence certain advantage which they could employ for they own end at any moment by allow certain of the great power to see she card belgium be not support the european balance but seriously disturbing it even belgium 's legation secretary in berlin have warn he government concern the political danger arise out of intimacy with england by reveal she system of defense to england belgium destroy its intrinsic value and still more -- she violate she international obligation -lrb- 142 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 142 : professor frank 's work pp 29-30 -rrb- consider that the british army at that time be small that britain have no idea of annex belgian territory one naturally wonder how the value of belgium 's defense system have be depreciate by conversation with british officer in effect germany maintain that belgium should have behave as a nonentity which be contrary to all reason the berlin government have always treat she small neighbor as a sovereign state equal in quality though not in power to any state in the world if germany recognize belgium 's sovereignty why should not england do the same and above all why have belgium no right to think of she self-preservation when she know the danger on she eastern frontier grow more menacing month by month frank conclude he dissertation with he opinion of england and quote thucydide v 105 as the best applicable characterization of the british with which he be acquaint among themselves indeed and out of respect for they traditional constitution they prove to be quite decent as regard they treatment of foreigner a great deal might be say yet we will try to express it in brief among all whom we know they be the most brazen in declare what be good to be agreeable and what be profitable to be just the very offence which germany accuse england of have premeditate she commit herself many year before when france seem to threaten belgium 's existence king leopold i conclude a secret treaty -lrb- 143 -rrb- with the king of prussium whereby the latter be empower to enter belgium and occupy fortress in case of france become dangerous the french danger pass away and its place be take by a more awful menace -- the pressure of german potential energy and when belgium in turn open she heart -lrb- this be the unproved accusation which germany make to-day -- author -rrb- to england then she have violate she neutrality and undermine the balance of power -lrb- 144 -rrb- there be even a suspicion that leopold ii renew this treaty with germany in 1890 in spite of the fact that the minister for foreign affair prince de chimay in a official speech deny its existence -lrb- footnote 143 : german love anything which be secret geheimniskrämerei -lrb- affectation of mysteriousness and secrecy -rrb- be a national and individual characteristic of the german people -- author -rrb- -lrb- footnote 144 : karl hampe : belgien vergangenheit und gegenwart -lrb- belgium past and present -rrb- p 49 -rrb- professor schoenborn 's essay on belgian neutrality be the least satisfactory exposition of the three professorial effusion it be no credit to a man of learning and be merely the work of a incapable partisan try to make a bad cause into a good one schoenborn commence -lrb- 145 -rrb- with the customary german tactic by state that bethmann-hollweg 's scrap-of-paper speech and von jagow 's -lrb- german secretary of state -rrb- explanation to the belgian representative in berlin on August 3rd 1914 be of no importance in decide the justice of germany 's violation of she pledge word one be lead to inquire when be a german utterance -- whether give in the reichstag by the chancellor or on paper in the form of a treaty -- final and binding -lrb- footnote 145 : deutschland und der weltkrieg -lrb- germany and the world war -rrb- pp 566-8 -rrb- subterfuge insinuation distortion even brazen falsehood be scatter throughout german war literature thicker than autumnal leaf in vallombrosa 's brook it be to be fear that just as german have lie for a century to prove that the english be annihilate at the battle of waterloo and for over forty year to show that bismarck be not a forger so they will lie for century to come in order to prove that the invasion of belgium be not what bethmann-hollweg call it a breach of international law like he _ confrères _ herr schoenborn admit that germany be pledge to respect the neutrality of belgium but the say neutrality be non-existent which appear somewhat paradoxical yet this be not the least logical part of he case the passage of german troops through belgium be indispensable in the interest of the preservation of the german empire a successful resistance to the annihilation-plan which we enemy have work for we downfall seem possible only by this mean the government regret that by so do we should commit a formal infringement of the rights of a third state -lrb- belgium -rrb- and promise to make all possible compensation for the transgression the judicial point of view which influence the decision of the german government be perhaps best illustrate by a parallel take from the ordinary law of the country : a forester -lrb- game-keeper -rrb- be attack by a poacher and in that same moment perceive a second poacher bear a gun at full-cock creep into a strange house in order to obtain a better shot at the forester just as he be about to enter the house the forester break the door open and thus forestall he -- in order to surprise and overcome he the forester be justified in take this step but must make good all damage result to the householder -lrb- 146 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 146 : ibid p 575 -rrb- the instance hold good in the land of _ kultur _ where law and order afford so little protection to a civilian and he property but in country where law be base upon culture the author believe that the forester would receive condign punishment for break into another man 's house no matter under what pretext unconsciously the learn professor be humorous when he compare germany to a gamekeeper and russium and france to poacher but he be naïve to a degree of stupidity when he make france carry a weapon fully prepare to shoot the forester we will consult another german authority to show that france 's weapon be not at full-cock during the last ten year france have give special attention to the fortress on the german frontier but those face belgium have be so carelessly equip that we see clearly to what a degree she rely upon she neighbor the fort be in the same condition as they be twenty or thirty year ago as some of these fortification be build fifty year ago various point on the frontier be strategically absolutely useless a typical example of this be fort les ayvelles which be intend to protect the bridge and meuse crossing south of mézières-charleville the fort be level to the ground by 300 shot from we 21-centimetre howitzer it be build in 1878 and arm with forty cannon of these the principal weapon consist of two battery each contain six 9-centimetre cannon which however be cast in the year 1878-1880 and in the best case could only carry 4000 yard then there be some 12-centimetre bronze piece cast in 1884 and a few five-barrelled revolver cannon besides these there be old howitzer from the year 1842 muzzle-loader with the characteristic pyramid of cannon ball by the side such as be often use in germany at village festival or to fire a salute the fort itself be a perfect picture of the obsolete and out-of-date apart from the crude primitive equipment the organization must have be faulty indeed on the road lead up to the fort we see some tree-branch which have be hurriedly place as obstacle and higher up wire entanglement have be commence at the last moment at least one battery be useless for the field of fire be cut off by high tree and at the last minute the garrison have try to place the gun in a better position we artillery which fire from a north-westerly position display a precision of aim which be rare one battery have have nearly every gun put out of action by clean hit in several case we see the barrel of the gun yard away from its carriage and only a heap of wheel earth stone etc mark the place where it have stand another proof of the excellent work do by the artillery be the fact that hardly a shell have strike the earth in the 500 yard from the battery to the fort after the former have be dispose of the artillery fire be concentrate on the fort which be reduce to a heap of rubbish the stonework and the high wall -- yard thick -- have tumble to piece like a child 's box of brick a garrison of 900 man have be place in this useless cage and they have flee almost at the first shot instead of put these man in trench they superior have put they at this ` lose post ' and allow they to suffer the moral effect of a complete inevitable defeat near the fort i see the grave of its commander the unfortunate man who have witness the hopeless struggle he live to see he man save they life in wild flight -- and then end he own -lrb- 147 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 147 : heinrich binder : mit dem hauptquartier nach westen pp 107-9 -rrb- here we have a sorry picture of the poacher whom germany fear so much the world know now that neither britain france nor russium be prepare for war which exclude the probability that they desire or provoke a conflict but germany know that and much more in the month of July 1914 bethmann-hollweg when address the reichstag draw a terrifying picture of french army -lrb- 148 -rrb- stand ready to invade belgium but he know full well that the necessary base-fortress be lack on the franco-belgian frontier -lrb- footnote 148 : richard grasshoff in he work belgien 's schuld -lrb- belgium 's guilt -rrb- p 14 _ et seq _ reproduce several confession allege to have be make by french soldier prisoner of war in germany state that they enter belgian territory on July 31st 1914 at present it be impossible to test the value of this evidence cf p 151 -rrb- as regard the alleged plan which germany 's enemy have make to annihilate germany it will be necessary for professor schoenborn to prove that the entente power have : -lrb- 1 -rrb- cause the murder in serajewo -lrb- 2 -rrb- despatch the ultimatum to serbium -lrb- 3 -rrb- prepared themselves for war until he prove these three point the world will continue to believe that it be germany alone who cherish annihilation-plans schoenborn mention too britain 's refusal to promise she neutrality even if germany respect the neutrality of belgium this offer be make to sir edward gray who decline it accord to professor schoenborn germany 's final decision to invade belgium be only take after that refusal it be a striking example of the immorality which prevail both in germany 's business and political life she give she solemn pledge in 1839 yet endeavor to sell the same pledge in 1914 -- for britain 's neutrality the author once make a agreement with a german but soon find that the arrangement be ignore and write to the person in question : you have employ we arrangement merely as a means for make further incursion into my rights that summarize the teutonic conception of a treaty either private or national it be only a wedge with which to broaden the way for a further advance usually a man sign a agreement with a idea of finality and look forward to freedom from further worry in the matter not so the german with he it be a instrument to obtain or blackmail further concession and as individual instead of occupy they thought and energy in the faithful fulfilment of its term they plot and plan in the pursuit of ulterior advantage heidelberg 's great scholar seem to have have doubt concern he simile of the gamekeeper hence in he last footnote he make the innocuous remark : because the house-breaking gamekeeper fire the first shot it be not usual to draw the conclusion that the poacher have only defensive intention -lrb- p 590 -rrb- all in all professor schoenborn 's attempt at partisanship be a miserable failure and as a academic thesis it be doubtful whether the faculty of law in any german university would grant a student a degree for such a crude effort various fact indicate germany 's intention to annex belgium if not the entire country then those district in which flemish be speak germany have suddenly remember that the fleming be a low german people and that they have be oppress by the walloon the hypocrisy of the plea become evident when we recall german -lrb- include austrian -rrb- oppression of the pole slav and

to review here the history of franco-german relation during the last half century other writer have already perform the task yet the whole trend of development in the relation between the two powerful neighbor may be define by two watch-word : _ saigner à blanc _ in germany and the _ revanche idée _ in france but there be this difference : the former have become ever more and more and the latter less and less a factor in european politics while the german nation have be gradually and systematically leaven with the teaching that might alone be right the french revenge party have be weaken year by year by national prosperity colonial expansion and the growth of a powerful anti-military party whatever may be say of french chauvinist this much remain a immovable fact -- the party be incapable of provide adequate national defence against the germanic neighbor while plan of reconquest can only be assign to the domain of myth on every occasion that the _ revanche _ cry have be resuscitate the direct cause be to be seek in germany have displace france in 1870 from she position of the first military power in europe germany have endeavor by fair and foul means to prevent she neighbor from again raise she head and that policy alone be to blame for the suspicion and hatred which have mark franco-german relation during the whole period and plunge europe into a era of armament end in a world war england and russium prevent bismarck from annihilate france in 1875 a incident which arouse justified fear throughout france and give a impulse to the revenge party in 1881 the iron chancellor tell the french ambassador : outside europe you can do what you like bismarck 's intention be to divert revive french energy to colonial work and if possible involve she in conflict with the other colonize power in both of these plan he succeed but the common sense and loyalty of great britain and italy prevent the conflict from assume a dangerous form -- war -- as desire by the government in berlin as soon as the latter perceive that french genius and persistency be bear fruit in a magnificent colonial empire the innate jealousy and greed of the german nation lead to a policy of colonial pinprick on the part of the kaiser 's government this seem the most probable explanation of germany 's attitude during the last decade before 1914 the natural consequence be that those power which have most to fear through german ill-will be weld together more firmly in a policy of self-protection germany can not or will not recognize that the cause of the above-mentioned development be to be find solely and alone in she own action on the contrary she designate the consequence a world-wide conspiracy against german interest in naval affair she adopt the same naïve line of argument first and foremost germany commit herself to a policy of unlimited -- even provocative -- naval expansion when the power most concerned -- great britain -- take precautionary measure to guarantee british interest in view of germany 's peaceful development then the latter power declare the consequence of she own action to be a hostile initiative direct against she a defense of this kind may be convince for those who observe event in the german perspective but it will be unable to withstand impartial historical criticism boxer expect a rebound when they punch the ball but none of they would be so foolish as to deny have deliver a blow when the rebound take place yet that be the unscientific defense which germany have adopt in she endeavor to explain away she aggressive attitude to belgium france and great britain in a word the principle underlie _ saigner à blanc _ have grow during the past four decade into a possible avalanche possess huge potential energy the momentum be give to it in August 1914 if it be necessary a picture of german popular opinion might be project show how that opinion be influence and form during the critical day at the close of July last year but from consideration of space only the outline of the picture can be give before the war german newspaper abound in report of french unpreparedness and chaos the german public be inform that france dread and fear war with germany without any exaggeration it may be say that a state of nerve have seize the french nation such as we should seek for in vain at the time of tangier and

we suddenly there be a awful explosion half a dozen yard away i hear the scream of my comrade then we rush forwards the rush across the field be awful -- flank fire from the right here and there a comrade bite the grass at last i throw myself down but there be no cover the wound crouch there too none of my company be there it seem that the two last shell have play havoc with they the enemy ' -lrb- french -rrb- main position be nearly a mile away in a forest up the next slope we dead lie thick around and here too a deadly bullet have find the breast of we heroic captain but in the strip of

twenty yard shell strike and shrapnel burst fill the air with earth dust smoke and smell forward till almost exhaust i throw myself down again a hundred to a hundred and fifty fusilier form a firing-line column of infantry pour a murderous fire on to we from the forest it can not go on thus one after the other be wound or kill we have advance nearly eight hundred yard over open ground on the right there be a small thicket of reed some of the company have already seek shelter there and i make a rush there with the same hope ` for heaven 's sake lie down corporal ' scream a man as i come up in fact the reed afford no cover whatever wound and dead lie there and bullet keep hit they in front of I lay a man from the fourth company a bullet have enter he chest and pass out of he back the blood be ooze out of a wound about the size of a shill the horror be too much for I and i creep to the other end of the strip there i find everything far worse but i can not describe the terror which i see one poor fellow beg for a drop of water there be just another draught in my bottle with grateful eye he hand it back to I and in the same moment i feel a stinging pain in the shoulder my arm be numbed and helpless hardly one of we who be not wound we can offer no resistance to the enemy but the awful way back at last the run back over eight hundred yard of open field begin now and again a comrade sink to the ground never to rise again my breath be nearly go one last effort and in truth i have escape from the hail of bullet it be remarkable and noteworthy that german writer charge the french army with looting and destruction in they own country probably this be merely a device to get rid of unpleasant accusation raise against the german army furthermore the most reckless charge of uncleanliness be make in comment on the lot of the landsturm troops quarter in the village of northern france one author -lrb- 168 -rrb- write : the landsturm man pass they time as best they

certainly the owner of château frenoi situate a few minute ' walk from the town will be more unpleasantly surprise on he return than the hotel proprietor in he home french marauder and plunderer have

they wild flight yet they desire they reader to believe that the same soldier have time to rob and destroy indeed carry they plunder with they since September no french troops have be in the district yet the kaiser find it necessary to place guard round château bellevue be it not more reasonable to assume that the precaution be take against the predatory instinct of he own soldiery who admittedly be in occupation of the province herr köhrer find it almost beneath he dignity to reply to charge of barbarism and hunnism yet he devote several page to the art of white-washing the inhabitant who remain in they home and those who have return since the flight -- unfortunately it be only a small part of the entirety -- have recognize long ago that the german soldier be not a barbarian the terrible distress which prevail among the french be often enough relieve by the generosity of the german troops throng of woman and child from the filthy village of the argonne and the ardenne gather

the result of germany 's guilt but the point which all german writer miss be the explanation of positive evidence of brutal deed they kindly incident and proof of german chivalry be all of a negative character and do not overthrow one jot or tittle of the oppose positive evidence iron cross have fall in thick shower on the german army during the month of July 1915 no fewer than 3400 of these

will also give a new basis to the privileged position of german officer in public life million of german man have see how in this war the german lieutenant have again merit he special position for some generation to come i wish to emphasize this point over and over again during the first two month of hostility nearly forty thousand iron cross be award to many of those at home this appear to be overdo it like the many exaggeration in the domain of order and honor with which we have become familiar during the last decade -lrb- 172 -rrb- as a matter of fact the number of cross give be too small -lrb- footnote 172 : _ vide _ the soul of germany chapter xiii -rrb- not forty thousand hero be at the front but a nation of hero in emphasize why the work of we officer be so splendid i must lay down these premise the bravery and joyous spirit of self-sacrifice in we man be above all praise but the officer have higher and more responsible duty they have not only to set a example of physical courage but they must possess the mental capacity to lead and spur on they man -- and that under condition so hard and rude that the man at home have no conception of they i have be in the trench on the slope of the argonne where officer lie side by side with the man in clay and chalk unwashed and filthy cut off from the outside world expose to continuous fire and throw entirely upon themselves i have see they in the artillery position on the aisne in the mud-cave of the heavy battery where they sit in the dark on empty packing-case listen to the music of explode shell and whistle bullet and everywhere i receive the same impression : the man be enthusiastic in praise of they leader many a one who have never vote for any other party than the social democrat have exclaim : ` lieutenant _ donnerwetter _ yes hat off to they ' for the lieutenant be not only the first in the fight but he be the soul of the company untire in he effort to keep up they spirit in the interval between the fighting and when we again witness the scene which often disgust we before the war -- the monocled young gentleman in gay uniform walk through the street nose in the air -- when we see all this again and perhaps a bit of iron pin on the breast then we must remember that for they life of danger and hardship in argonne clay and russian mud no earthly compensation can be too great no nation can ever imitate we lieutenant and in this war of mass and technical perfection it be still the value of individual personality which will decide the issue we may affirm that this value stand very high in we army -- both as regard officer and man only he who have see for himself the burnt village devastate town and desolate land of france can comprehend the full meaning of the awful word _ krieg _ -lrb- war -rrb- mere word can not express what it mean to german and germany that the horror of war have be carry almost alone into the enemy 's territory but then a spirit of irresistible ardor go through the rank of we warrior from every eye in every word burn the deepest most unbounded faith in victory in the trench battery and hospital there be no doubt no fear one great thought hover victoriously above all hardship distress and suffering : germany to the front in the world and from out the blood which flow -- and that be shed plenteously very plenteously -- -lrb- this be the sacred faith which i bring back from the battlefield -rrb- out of this blood the proud harvest will grow whose blessing we shall all feel -- the world dominion of the german idea -lrb- 173 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 173 : ibid p 50 _ et seq _ -rrb- in spite of köhrer 's assurance that the relationship between officer and man in the german army be a ideal one there be evidence that such be not always the

continue the war for twenty year twenty year -- on french soil if under these circumstance the french break with they ally -- who have exploit france for the last twenty-five year and who have plunge she into this war -- in order to arrive at a reasonable understanding with germany then they would only show that they do not intend to accept the final consequence of the mistake commit by the french government no one be compel to eat the last drop of a soup prepare by false friend in this sense to seduce france to a direct breach of faith with she ally would in truth only mean the protection of france 's best interest -lrb- pp 51-2 -rrb- one other writer deserve mention -- a lecturer in history bonn university -- because he present a opinion the exact contrary to the one last quote accord to dr platzhoff france herself be the guilty party who have trick russium and great britain into the service of revenge for 1870 therefore france find it necessary to extract herself from isolation and acquire ally against she neighbor -lrb- germany -rrb- in several decade of painful effort french diplomacy have solve the problem in brilliant fashion _ revanche _ -- and alliance policy be

footnote 186 : ibid pp 26-8 -rrb- many such passage might be cite to prove that germany would like to see a split among the ally but france 's honor and welfare be in she own hand and it appear a futile hope that germany after fail to bring france to submission and self-effacement by threat of _ saigner à blanc _ will succeed in she purpose by the reality chapter xi the intellectual and the war mention have already be make that a large number of germany 's war book have emanate from the university not the least important of these effort be deutschland und der weltkrieg -lrb- germany and the world war -rrb- -lrb- 187 -rrb- twenty well-known university professor have contribute to the work the fact be emphasize that special facility have be accord to they by the german foreign office for british reader the chapter by professor marck and oncken be the most interesting viz england 's policy of might by the former and event lead up to the war and the outbreak of war by the latter they take up a fifth of the 686 page of which the entire work consist -lrb- footnote 187 : deutschland und der weltkrieg herausgegeben von otto hintze friedrich meinecke hermann oncken und hermann schumacher leipzig und berlin 1915 -rrb- the purpose of professor marck ' essay be to prove on historical and scientific line the lesson which have be teach in german school for nearly half a century _ ie _ england be a astute but ruthless robber who respect no right and no nation which stand in she way england 's modern history begin with the tudor and she world policy with elizabeth first of all england have to liberate herself economically and politically from a position of dependence on the other power then she take up she particular attitude to the world she separation from the roman catholic church be exceedingly rich in consequence this step assign to she a peculiar place in the camp of the nation and exercise a deep influence upon she intellectual development it give she a impetus towards internal and external independence but the determine factor for england 's future be she insular position this have be the case from the time europe enter the ocean-period since the year 1600 england by she commerce and politics have influence europe from without while she have maintain for herself a position of independence and direct she energy across the ocean into the wide world successively she seize upon the baltic north sea and atlantic ocean gradually she become the merchant and shipbuilder for most of the european nation the sea have give she everything -- independence security and prosperity -- both in treasure and land the sea protect she and spare she the unpleasantness of mighty neighbor it be the ocean which permit free development to she internal life parliament government and administration and save she from the continental form of government -- a strong armed monarchy the sea have allow the english to develop undisturbed the peculiarity of they race -- personal energy train by contact with the ocean personal freedom favor but not oppress by the living organism of the state the sea afford they liberty of action in every direction without fear of attack from behind free from the chain which bind europe england go out into the wide world yet she remain constantly associate with the continent not only because europe be she field of action english statesman have always seize upon every opportunity to influence european policy at first this be from motive of defense but afterwards from a ever-increasing spirit of aggression the balance of power on the continent have always be one of the premise for england 's security and existence she be indebted to she insular position for the supreme advantage of be able to exercise she influence in europe without allow she force to be tie to the continent european country be bind by they own conflict and difference enable england to exert she influence upon they without active participation england have become thoroughly accustom to a state of affair under which she have no neighbor and never permit any -- not even on the sea she have come to consider this she god-given prerogative the barrier of geographical position which hamper other land nature do not impose upon england the security afford by she girdle of wave seem as it be to impel she to strike out into the unbounded and to look upon every obstacle as a wrong there be a thread of daring lawlessness run through all england 's world-struggle through all period of she history right down to the present day when england speak of humanity she mean herself she cosmopolitan utterance refer to she own nationality she forget too easily that other nation have arise on the earth who esteem they own distinguishing trait and be inspire by the ardent desire to uphold they own institution form of government and culture england believe all too easily that the world 's map should be all one color but the soul of the modern world demand variety -lrb- 188 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 188 : ibid 297 _ et seq _ -rrb- there be no important objection to raise against professor marck ' statement of english history and britain 's favored position on the surface of the globe germany do not choose she own geographical situation in the world -- it be hers by nature and the right of historical succession britain have never envy she or endeavor to deprive she of the advantage consequent upon she place in the sun neither do the british select they island home destiny and history be again the determine factor but it would be a travesty of the truth to assert that germany have not envy she that position together with the advantage arise from it yet in the same degree as the inhabitant of these island have use the talent entrust to they through they favourable position germany 's jealousy seem to have become more bitterly angry by right of birth and national necessity germany demand the domination of the rhine but she fail to recognize that right of birth and the demand of national existence compel britain to claim the domination of the sea the remainder of professor marck ' essay be devote to prove that the freedom of we world require that it shall not be so in future whatever motive actuate germany in precipitate the war this much be now evident -- it be she supreme desire and the aim of she highest endeavor to destroy britain 's favored situation and every advantage accrue to she from it to-day the issue be clear and simple for germany -- the annihilation of british power and influence in the world literally hundred of german war book echo that cry and above all else it be the hope of attain this aim which have arouse the bitterest war fury in the entire german nation -- man woman and child reduce to first principle this difference of geographical position and the vary advantage arise therefrom be the prime cause -- if not _ the _ cause -- of the present world-struggle it be solely the fear of perpetuate british supremacy -lrb- 189 -rrb- which have lead germany consistently to reject the extended hand of friendship standing side by side with great britain either in friendship or alliance germany would have give she approval to britain 's historical position in the world when this country depart from the policy of splendid isolation repeat attempt be make to establish more intimate relation with germany -lrb- 1898-1902 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 189 : graf ernst zu reventlow : der vampir des festlande -lrb- england the vampire of the continent -rrb- berlin 1915 p 117 england 's withdrawal from the policy which seek to establish a mutual plan of procedure in world politics between germany and britain date from the time when britain recognize that germany would not allow herself to be employ against russium in germany to-day voice may be hear proclaim that von bülow choose wrongly in refuse england 's offer especially as russium have repay we loyalty and friendship with iniquitous ingratitude the latter represent the truth but in judge the policy of that period two factor must be bear in mind the acceptance of great britain 's offer would have place a tie upon the german empire which would have be unendurable germany would have become the strong but stupid power whose duty would have be to fight british battle on the continent besides which the choice concerned germany 's world future above all the development of the german war fleet -rrb- but as professor marck -lrb- p 315 -rrb- observe : germany refuse the hand extend to she count reventlow and a host of other writer have chronicle the fact too yet on September 2nd 1914 the german chancellor dare to say to representative american journalist : when the archive be open then the world will learn how often germany have offer the hand of friendship to england it be only one more confirmation that the law of necessity be incompatible with the truth the truth be that germany prefer to drive britain into another and hostile camp rather than have she friendship germany prefer british hostility rather than relinquish she plan for unlimited naval expansion -- which she believe to be the only means of destroy britain 's position and with that resolution already take the kaiser present he photograph to a distinguished englishman with this significant remark write on it with he own hand : i bide my time although britain draw the sword to defend belgium the supreme issue -- and the only one which occupy the german mind to-day -- be whether this country shall continue to hold the position allot to she by destiny and confirm by history or whether she be to be supplant by germany that be the one political thought which permeate german intelligence at this moment and no other consideration must be allow to darken this issue professor oncken review the event of the period 1900-1914 in considerable detail and to he the policy of _ entente _ appear to be the main cause lead up to the world war from this alone it be obvious that consciously or unconsciously he be wrong the _ entente _ in themselves be result not prime cause the prime cause lead to these political agreement be to be find in germany 's attitude to the rest of europe in a word they be defensive action take by the power concern as a precaution against german aggression german aggression consist in commit herself to unlimited armament cherish the irreconcilable determination to be the strongest european power accord to she doctrine of might everything can be attain by the mightiest british advance she answer with battleship simultaneously provoke france and russium by increase she army corps the balance of power in europe germany declare to be a out-of-date british fad invent solely in the interest of these island in secret germany have long be a apostate to the balance-of-power theory the war have cause she to drop the mask and it be without doubt she resolve never to submit to the chain of the balance in europe which force three other state to waive they difference and form the triple entente simply state this be cause and result but professor oncken maintain -- and in do so he voice german national opinion -- that the entire _ entente _ policy be a huge scheme to bring about germany 's downfall he go further and proclaim that the hague conference -lrb- 1907 -rrb- be a british trick to place the guilt of armament on germany 's shoulder england fill the world with disarmament project so that afterwards full of unction she could denounce germany as the disturber of the peace at that time the imperial chancellor answer justly : ` pressure can not be bring to bear on germany not even moral pressure ' -lrb- 190 -rrb- and in that sentence german obstinacy and sullen irreconcilability be most admirably express -lrb- footnote 190 : deutschland und der weltkrieg p 495 -rrb- have see that professor oncken have fail to recognize the prime cause which provoke the _ entente _ policy it be not surprising to find he equally in error when discuss the diplomatic clash between the rival camp the professor call they _ machtproben _ -lrb- test of power -rrb- but how he can dare to state that these diplomatic trial of strength be engineer by great britain -- remain he own secret king edward 's meeting with the czar at reval in June 1908 be follow by a far-reaching macedonian reform program the commencement of the division of european turkey what britain have fail to induce germany to help she in execute be to be attain with the sword 's point direct against germany and britain proceed in cold blood to conjure up a era of might-struggle which in the island language be call preserve the balance of power -lrb- 191 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 191 : ibid p 297 -rrb- the trial of strength recount by oncken be the bosnian crisis the morocco question and the austro-serbian quarrel which lead to the present war it seem banal to have to point out that bosnium be unlawfully annex by germany 's vassal -- austrium that germany herself bring europe to the verge of war by send the _ panther _ to agadir and that the final catastrophic _ machtprobe _ be likewise provoke by germany 's eastern vassal for good or evil germany have be convince for nearly two decade that the balance of power in europe be a obstacle to she world future furthermore she believe that the balance impose fetter upon she which only mighty armament could break all germany 's energy in the domain of diplomacy have be set in motion to make the balance of power a mere figment of the imagination in pursue this end it have suit she purpose to declare all attempt at maintain the outward appearance of equality between the power of europe to be machiavellian scheme against she existence or to cite the kaiser 's own word to deprive germany of she place in the sun britain 's _ entente _ policy be the only one calculate to preserve we own existence and to restrain germany from establish a hegemony in europe she be completely convince that the domination of europe belong to she by right of mental moral and military superiority over she neighbor not in vain have germany 's educational institution inculcate the belief in she population that the british empire be a effete monstrosity with foot of clay france a rotten decay empire and russium a barbarian power with no new _ kultur _ to offer europe except the knout inspire by such conception together with a astoundingly exaggerated idea of germany 's peerlessness in order discipline obedience morality genius and other ethical value as well as a unshaken belief in germany 's invincibility by land and sea -- the entire nation from kaiser to cobbler have long since hold that by right of these virtue -- by right of she absolute superiority over all other nation -- germany could and must claim other rights and power than those which fall to she under a antiquated balance of european power in few word that be the gospel of _ deutschland deutschland über alle _ these be the motive which inspire germany 's naval expansion and forbid she to accept a compromise the same ideal lead to she endeavor to shatter the _ entente _ and it be alone the general acceptance of this gospel which explain the remarkable unanimity with which the german nation have stand behind the kaiser 's government in each trial of strength they have learn to consider all attempt of the lesser people -lrb- britain france and russium include -rrb- to maintain themselves against the teutonic onset as impudent attack on sacred germany which also illuminate the fact that german call the present struggle -- germany 's holy sacred war german statesman be quite clear as to the national course at least fifteen year ago hence they have persistently pursue a policy of no compromise and no agreement a compromise recognize and perpetuate in part at least the very thing which stand in the way a agreement with britain in regard to naval armament would have perpetuate british naval supremacy as well as recognize its necessity likewise a agreement or the shadow of a understanding with france on the question of alsace-lorraine would have be a recognition of french claim hence on these two question -- which be merely give as example illustrative of german mentality -- every attempt at a agreement have be a failure a cardinal point in germany 's program have be the consistent manner in which she have try to separate she european neighbor from britain in order to deal with they separately or alone that she endeavor end in failure be due to the instinct of self-preservation which have draw germany 's opponent closer together in exact proportion to the increase force of she effort both in peace and war germany desire and endeavor to switch off britain 's influence in europe the diplomatic battle of 1905 1908 and 1911 be a few of the effort to dislodge great britain from she _ entente _ while she repeat attempt to buy this country 's neutrality down to the eve of war be proof that germany want a free hand in europe -lrb- 192 -rrb- if she have succeed in she purpose it be exceedingly doubtful whether any power could have prevent she from exercise a free hand in the whole world -lrb- footnote 192 : professor schiemann : wie england eine verständigung

-rrb- that be if a anglo-german alliance could not be achieve -- a alliance which would have guarantee the world 's peace -lrb- schiemann 's insinuation that germany desire a alliance be a instance of

fact that it too be a challenge on the part of the central empire the condition seem peculiarly favourable to they for the british ambassador declare to the russian government on July 24th 1914 that britain would never draw the sword on a purely serbian question moreover in the preceding year a british minister say professor schiemann have give what we may style a remarkable semi-official promise that great britain would never go to war with germany on February 18th 1913 mr charle trevelyan mp pay I a visit and assure I with the greatest certainty that england would under no circumstance wage war on germany a ministry which make preparation for war would be immediately overthrow -lrb- 193 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 193 : ibid p 27 in the light of this revelation it would be interesting to know what be the real motive which induce mr trevelyan to resign he office when war break out either he be conscious of have seriously compromise he position as a minister of the crown or he conscientiously believe that britain be draw the sword in a unjust cause unfortunately a section of the british public accept the latter interpretation in any case mr trevelyan 's indiscretion afford overwhelming proof that he have a utterly false conception of germany -- author -rrb- professor schiemann affirm that he good impression be strengthen by a visit to london during march and April 1914 and report a conversation which he have with lord haldane when dine privately with the latter in london after return to berlin he say he receive a letter from lord haldane date April 17th 1914 but from schiemann 's quotation it be not evident whether the follow be a extract or the entire letter : it be a great pleasure to see you and to have have the full and unreserved talk we have together my ambition be like yours to bring germany and great britain into relation of ever-closer intimacy and friendship we two country have a common work to do for the world as well as for themselves and each of they can bring to bear on this work special endowment and quality may the co-operation which i believe be now begin become closer and closer -lrb- 194 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 194 : lord haldane have state during the war that he visit to berlin in 1912 have fill he mind with doubt and suspicion in regard to germany -- author -rrb- of this i be sure the more wide and unselfish the nation and the group question make she supreme purpose of they policy the more will friction disappear and the sooner will the relation that be normal and healthy reappear -lrb- 195 -rrb- something of this good work have now come into existence between we two people we must see to it that the chance of growth be give -lrb- 196 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 195 : a word or phrase appear to have be drop in this sentence -- author -rrb- -lrb- footnote 196 : professor schiemann 's book pp 27-8 -rrb- it be not difficult to conceive that such utterance on the part of two british minister would raise hope in the german mind for it would be useless to imagine that professor schiemann would keep they secret for he own private edification and it be possible that they lead the german government into a false reckoning as to what this country would do under certain circumstance and so encouraged germany into take up a irreconcilable attitude in the crisis of July 1914 whatever germany expect must however for the present remain a matter of conjecture schiemann 's comment on the above letter leave no doubt that he expect lord haldane -lrb- 197 -rrb- to resign when one remember that lord haldane belong to the inner circle of the cabinet and be therefore privy to all the secret move of sir edward gray it be hard to believe in the sincerity of the sentiment express in this letter besides he do not resign like three other member of the cabinet -lrb- lord morley burn and charle trevelyan -rrb- when sir edward 's foul play lay open to the world on August 4th -lrb- footnote 197 : lord haldane seem to have injure he reputation both in great britain and germany professor oncken designate he : the one-time friend of germany the decoy-bird of the british cabinet _ vide _ deutschland und der weltkrieg p 561 -rrb- the most regrettable side of the whole incident be that the resignation of the above gentleman have be proclaim by innumerable german writer as proof of sir edward gray 's double dealing and proof that britain be wage a unjust war still it may console these gentleman to know that the nation which wages war on woman and child acclaim they to-day all honorable man and doubtless without the shakespearian intonation by reason of the above incident and more of a similar nature german accuse the late liberal government with perfidy of the basest kind the author be not in the least inclined to admit the charge but think rather that the government in question -- individually and collectively -- be astonishingly ignorant of european condition and problem especially those prevail in the germanic empire to what a degree germany be obsess by the idea that britain be try to strangle she by a encircle policy be apparent in a diplomatic document quote by professor oncken its author 's name be not give and it be doubtless a secret report send to the german foreign office in 1912 its freedom from bias be also questionable moreover it be probable that it belong to the same category of document as those quote in the french yellow book -- report intend to exercise due influence on the mind of the emperor french diplomacy be succeed more and more in entangle england in the mesh of she net the encouragement which england give directly or indirectly to french chauvinism may one day end in a catastrophe in which english and french soldier must pay with they blood on french battlefield for england 's encircle policy the seed sow by king edward be spring up another link in the chain of proof of britain 's guilt be find in the document seize by the german in brussels the enemy seem to attach great importance to they for they be be employ in much the same way that parliamentary candidate use pamphlet during a election yet they do not contain a particle of proof that britain have hostile intention against germany but only confirm the presence of the german menace the document -lrb- 198 -rrb- in question be report send by the belgian legation secretary in london paris and berlin to the minister for foreign affair in brussels these gentleman hold opinion identical with those express again and again in german newspaper and even in some british and french organ messieur comte de lalaing -lrb- london -rrb- greindl -lrb- berlin -rrb- leghait -lrb- pari -rrb- evidently believe that the activity of the triple alliance and the triple entente endanger the peace of europe -lrb- footnote 198 : publish by the berlin government as supplement to the _ nord-deutsche allgemeine zeitung _ July 29th and 31st August 4th 8th and 12th 1915 -rrb- further they believe the latter constellation to be the more aggressive of the two and formally report these conviction to the belgian government if read as a modern edition of pepy ' diary they form entertaining literature but by no stretch of the imagination could they be class as historical source a gentleman who report to he government that king edward take breakfast in company with m delcassé and that the press have neglect to chronicle the incident can hardly rank as a historian moreover it be by no means clear why the german press should laud m greindl as a gentleman of german origin if this be true it would probably explain everything which deserve explanation in the say document and would probably account for the intimate confidential treatment which m greindl receive at the hand of german official german newspaper be gloat over the fact that the british government have not deign to reply to these revelation there be really nothing to which it can reply three observer express they opinion on contemporaneous happening during the year 1905-1911 but a brutal sequence of event in 1914 show they -- if they have not be convince during the precede three year -- that they have draw false conclusion from they observation to return to the last trial of strength between the two group of european power it be interesting to note that professor oncken deny german participation in formulate the ultimatum to serbium or that germany be aware of its contents germany merely leave austria a free hand in the matter oncken endeavor to show that austrium 's demand be not excessive and express astonishment that the oppose power find they exorbitant he do not mention the fact that a large section of the german nation hold the same opinion on July 25th 1914 he comment on sir edward gray 's effort for peace be characteristic : england claim that she do everything possible to preserve the peace it can not be deny that gray make a series of mediation proposal but mere good-will be not everything it be much more important to weigh they practical importance and the goal at which they aim : whether they be intend to preserve the world 's peace under condition honorable for all party or calculate to obtain for the _ entente _ a one-sided diplomatic victory which would have establish its future predominance -lrb- 199 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 199 : deutschland und der weltkrieg p 544 -rrb- gray consider the moment suitable for a mediation proposal on the evening of July 26th after obtain russium 's consent he propose to the government of france germany and italy that they london ambassador should meet in london to confer on a peaceful solution of the conflict the proposal be unacceptable to austria because it would have be a indirect recognition on she part of russium 's interest in the conflict only those who have follow the grow intimacy of the mutual obligation between the entente power and they organization to a ` london center ' during the summer of 1914 be able to estimate the role -- to say nothing of italy -- which russium 's two comrade would have play in the conference during its course russium would have continue she military preparation while germany would have have to pledge herself not to mobilize finally no unprejudiced observer would dare assert that the man -lrb- sir edward gray -rrb- who be ready to transform himself at a suitable opportunity into a ally of russium would have be a impartial chairman in a conference hold under the pressure of a russian mobilization the more one think about this mediation proposal the more convinced one become that it would at least have work for a diplomatic victory for the entente power gray put the whole machinery of the triple entente in motion in order to force back germany and austria-hungary along the whole line -lrb- 200 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 200 : ibid p 545 _ et seq _ -rrb- a analysis of professor oncken 's theses give the following result : first britain 's effort to preserve peace be admit but he fail to mention any friendly advance to meet they secondly the fundamental principle underlie the germanic attitude be again expose viz that russium have no right to intervene in a question affect the balance of power in the balkan and in europe -lrb- _ vide _ p 63 -rrb- thirdly a diplomatic struggle be in progress along the whole line between the two group of power in weigh the second point it would be wrong to assume that the central empire be not fully aware of the presence of a far more vital question behind the austro-serbian conflict they know it from the very begin and have already express threat in st petersburg hope to achieve the same effect as in the bosnian crisis if austrium have be allow to destroy serbium 's military power the material force of europe would have be seriously disturbed the ineffectiveness of the triple entente finally establish and its dissolution the inevitable consequence if these consideration be correct then the statement attribute by m de l'escaille -lrb- see p 281 -rrb- to sir george buchanan that britain would never draw the sword could only have serve to strengthen the resolution of the germanic power in enforce they point germany above all desire that the balance of power theory should be finally smash and it may be safely assume that a austro-serbian conflict seem to she a most fitting opportunity to realize she purpose the third point suggest two question who provoke the diplomatic conflict and who would have benefit most by a diplomatic victory a reply to the first question be superfluous and the answer to the second be obvious from the precede line of reasoning germany would have reach the goal towards which she have strive for more than a decade -- the removal of all diplomatic hindrance to the unlimited assertion of she will in europe it may even be doubt whether the dual alliance would have survive the shock another phase of professor oncken 's work be the open attack on sir edward gray only three year ago this statesman be acclaimed in germany as a man of peace -- _ the _ man who have prevent the balkan war from become a european conflagration to-day he be accuse by the same nation of be the originator of the world war oncken -lrb- 201 -rrb- go back to the year 1905 and state that sir edward gray initiate only two member of the cabinet -- mr asquith and lord haldane -- into the detail of the agreement with france and these three gentleman he refer to as the inner circle king edward and afterwards sir edward gray in continue the late king 's policy succeed in harness the _ revanche idée _ and the spirit of russian aggression to the chariot of british imperialism all offer of friendship make by this country be insincere -lrb- the professorial pleader do not say so but he leave he reader to infer that sincerity be a german monopoly -rrb- concern the british minister 's declaration in parliament that no secret treaty exist with france oncken remark : the declaration be just as true formally as it be a lie in essential -lrb- footnote 201 : the authority -lrb- -rrb- most frequently cite by professor oncken in make out he case be messr morel macdonald hardie g b shaw and the _ labor leader _ -- author -rrb- follow the development of event after the conference proposal have be drop oncken write : meanwhile the russian government endeavor to persuade england 's lead statesman that the opinion prevail in germany and austrium that england would remain neutral in every case in consequence of this delusion the central power be obdurate england could only dispel the danger of war by destroy this false conception _ ie _ openly join russium and france it be noteworthy how quickly gray assimilate this train of thought disregard the suggestion of the british ambassador in st petersburg he do nothing to exercise a moderate influence upon russium and thereby further the success of the conversation between vienna and st petersburg on the other hand he proceed to take step which probably in he opinion be calculate to damp the suppose desire for war on the part of germany practically the result of all he action be to exercise one-sided pressure upon germany and austrium and simultaneously through unmistakable declaration concern england 's eventual attitude to encourage pari and st petersburg to energetic measure but all hope for peace be destroy at a single blow by russium on the evening of July 30th after the conversation with austria-hungary have be resume sasonow increase he demand -- and in truth with england 's co-operation -- to such a degree that they acceptance would have mean the complete submission of the dual monarchy and as if this be insufficient a few hour later before a reply have be receive and while negotiation be proceed in vienna russium suddenly break off the communication with a momentous decision -lrb- mobilization -rrb- the certainty which she have gain from the move of english diplomacy that in case of war she be sure of france 's support and with it england 's turn the scale -- against peace that this calculation be decisive for russium 's change of front be confirm by a witness whose impartiality even we opponent will admit -lrb- 202 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 202 : deutschland und der weltkrieg pp 553-4 -rrb- professor oncken then support he argument with quotation from a letter write by the belgian legation secretary in st petersburg to he government the letter be doubtless steal while in transit by the berlin postal authority monsieur b de l'escaille write the letter on July 30th despatch it by courier to berlin where it be post on the follow day the outside envelope be address to madame costerman 107 rue froissard bruxelle inside be a letter address to m darignon minister for foreign affair german writer state that no letter be forward to foreign country after martial law be proclaim on July 31st -lrb- a statement which be untrue -rrb- thus it fall into they hand overwhelming importance be attach to this document by german war writer the more important passage of the despatch run as follow : the last two day have pass in the expectation of event which be bind to follow -lrb- 203 -rrb- upon austria-hungary 's declaration of war against serbium the most contradictory report be in circulation without any possibility of confirm they truth or falsity -lrb- footnote 203 : thus the impartial witness whom german quote to prove they innocence definitely state that russium have no other course leave open to she by austrium 's action -- author -rrb- one thing be however indisputable viz that germany have do everything possible both here and in vienna -lrb- 204 -rrb- to find a means of avoid a general conflict but have only be meet with the determination of the vienna cabinet on the one hand not to yield a single step and on the other hand russian distrust of vienna 's declaration that they merely intend a punitive expedition against serbium -lrb- footnote 204 : how could m de l'escaille know what have pass in vienna -- author -rrb- one must really believe that everybody want war and be only anxious to postpone the declaration in order to gain time at first england give out that she would not allow herself to be draw into a conflict sir george buchanan say that definitely but to-day they be firmly convince in st petersburg indeed they have receive a assurance that england will stand by france this support be of extraordinary importance and have contribute not a little to the war-party gain the upper hand in the cabinet sit hold yesterday there be difference of opinion and the mobilization order be postpone this morning at four o'clock mobilization be order the russian army feel itself strong and be full of enthusiasm the reorganization of the navy be still so incomplete that it would be out of the count in case of war for that reason england 's assurance of help be of the greatest consequence -lrb- 205 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 205 : kriegs-depeschen 1914 -lrb- german war-telegram 1914 -rrb- berlin 1914 p 96 _ et seq _ -rrb- if professor oncken be correct in state that sir edward gray 's measure be calculate to exercise a pressure on germany and austrium then he merely confirm what this country have hitherto believe -- sir edward gray act rightly where else should he have exert pressure except in the quarter from whence a provocative insolent challenge have proceed with regard to the assertion that russia -- stiffen by england -- take a momentous decision on the evening of July 30th professor oncken be guilty of distortion the decision to mobilize have be take earlier and as m de l'escaille write be make public at four o'clock on the morning of July 30th whether russium have increase she demand -lrb- peremptorily sharpen be oncken 's word -rrb- the reader can judge for himself by compare the two text i ii if austrium recognize if austrium agree to that the austro-serbian stay the advance of she question have troops on serbian territory assume the character and if recognize of a european question that the austro-serbian declare herself ready to dispute have assume the eliminate from she ultimatum character of a question the point which of european interest she infringe the sovereign admit that the great rights of serbium russium power shall examine engage to stop she the satisfaction which military preparation serbium might give to -lrb- russian orange book the austro -- hungarian no 60 -rrb- government without affect she sovereign rights and independence russium undertake to maintain she wait attitude -lrb- french yellow book no 113 -rrb- oncken in make this comparison comment : it be most remarkable that the original formulum choose by sasonow have be peremptorily sharpen -lrb- _ einschneidend verschärft _ -rrb- on July 31st at the request of the british ambassador this interference by england in the formulation of the proposal must arouse the gravest doubt regard the peaceful tendency of england 's policy sasonow have every reason to thank gray ` for the firm amicable tone which he have employ in he pourparler with germany and austrium ' -lrb- 206 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 206 : deutschland und der weltkrieg p 553 oncken 's quotation in the last line take from the russian orange book no 69 -rrb- sir edward gray have propose five day earlier -lrb- July 26th -rrb- that all military measure should cease pend a settlement hence the introduction of this clause be not a new demand moreover in the meantime russium and germany -- in spite of the latter 's denial -- have commence to mobilize austrium have mobilize and commence hostility against serbium thus there be far more urgent reason to include the cessation of military measure on July 31st than before lastly it be the only acceptable pledge of austrian sincerity which russium could accept whether the formulum would have meet with austrium 's approval can not be determine for austrium be save from what oncken term complete submission by germany 's ultimatum to russia despatch on the same day July 31st it be impossible to get rid of the suspicion that germany think austrium might accept the proposal in any case germany deliberately shatter the last chance of a settlement by she demand that russium should demobilize if germany outwardly work for peace in st petersburg as m de l'escaille state it would be quite in harmony with the method of german diplomacy but as the same gentleman testify : austrium would not yield a step -- the conclusion must be draw that germany have order she to stand firm austrium do not yield a single inch and so it be a matter of indifference as to the sincerity or otherwise of germany 's peace endeavor oncken further mention britain 's refusal to remain neutral in return for a promise that french territory should not be annex but he omit the question of french colony he analysis of the belgian question deserve quotation : gray be seek a excuse for war and he find one in the question of belgian neutrality it be just such a reason as he require in order to carry away the cabinet parliament and public opinion and since then that reason have be much discuss accompany by appeal to international law and humanity by england 's and the world 's press but there be more than one irrefutable proof at hand to show that this reason for war be merely a veil cover the real one anticipate gray 's intention before the german government have finally declare themselves on the subject -lrb- 207 -rrb- prince lichnowsky put the question to sir edward gray on August 1st as to whether england would remain neutral if germany undertake to respect the neutrality of belgium -lrb- footnote 207 : britain have ask germany a day or two before whether she would respect belgium 's neutrality -- author -rrb- gray however refuse to give the pledge with which he could -- if he be really concern about belgium -- have spare that unhappy land its terrible fate but by these mean the trump card of belgian neutrality have be take from we opponent 's hand in advance yet gray actually consider it permissible to conceal this offer from the british cabinet yes he dare even more after the matter have be mention by ramsay macdonald in the _ labor leader _ keir hardie ask a question in the house of common on August 27th as to whether lichnowsky 's proposal have be submit to the cabinet and why the same have not be make the basis of peaceful negotiation with germany gray make a weak attempt to discriminate between official proposal make by a government and a private question ask by a ambassador when the inconvenient questioner ask for further information he be cry down the oxford theologian conybeare gain the impression from this parliamentary incident : ` that all sir edward gray 's answer to mr keir hardie 's question be example of _ suppressio verus _ and _ suggestio falsus _ ' he later revocation of this judgment do not alter its value as objective evidence after gray 's refusal prince lichnowsky press he to formulate england 's condition for she neutrality at the same time the ambassador increase he offer of July 29th by propose to guarantee the integrity of france and she colony in return for england 's neutrality gray suppress this proposal too before the cabinet as any negotiation on this basis would have thwart he pre-conceived plan only a immovable determination for war can explain this behavior even before he could assume that belgian neutrality be in danger he pledge english policy to the wish of france on the afternoon of the same August 1st he give the french ambassador -- who be anxiously press for a decision -- reason to believe that he would be able to give a formal promise on the follow day at the cabinet meeting on August 2nd -- the same in which he suppress germany 's offer -- he get a motion accept empower he to assure cambon that if germany attack the french coast england would intervene it be necessary to return to germany 's proposal in regard to belgian neutrality in simple language it mean that germany want to sell she pledge word give in 1839 for british neutrality in 1914 in view of the fact that professor oncken look upon this as a legitimate bargain one wonder in silence at he standard of morality and honor be he not a scoundrel who first give he word of honor and afterwards try to strike a bargain with the same strip of all verbiage that be germany 's proposal in its naked immorality and the author chronicle with pleasure that the house of common cry down even its discussion it recall to he memory the fact that the reichstag -- germany 's highest legislative assembly -- cheer to the echo bethmann-hollweg 's announcement that german army in violate the dictate of moral and international law by break germany 's word of honor have occupy luxembourg and enter belgium the two incident be drastic concrete illustration of the gulf which separate british and german conception of right and wrong furthermore there be two question of a disciplinary nature arise out of this incident which the man in the street have a perfect right to raise assume that sir edward gray exercise he discretion and conceal the infamous proposal from the cabinet which of he colleague afterwards betray the fact and from what source -- german or english -- do he obtain he information full knowledge on these point would probably be of great assistance in destroy the trail of the serpent -lrb- _ ie _ german influence and intrigue -rrb- in the political and national life of great britain professor oncken praise german disinterestedness in offer to guarantee the integrity of french continental and colonial territory in case germany gain a victory in the war sir edward gray 's refusal to guarantee british neutrality in return for this promise the professor consider supreme and final proof that britain be bent on war the nation have rightly approve of this policy and the point need not be argue in this place but professor oncken in the seclusion of he german study would do well to weigh two problem : if germany have gain a victory -- and in August 1914 she be absolutely convince that france and russium would succumb if they face she alone -- then germany would have obtain the long seek upper and free hand in europe what earthly power could have compel she in that moment to respect she promise in regard to french territory certainly germany 's sense of honor could not be count upon to do so the second problem refer to the bull and the china-shop presuming that the bull could talk would professor oncken advise the guardian of the proverbial china-shop to accept the bull 's promise to respect the _ status quo ante _ of he property before let he -lrb- the bull -rrb- run amock amongst the china lastly reader be advise when study the german case to remember that germany never offer to respect the integrity of french territory _ and _ the neutrality of belgium although german writer -- with malice aforethought -- seek to give that impression yet have this combine offer be make the author submit that in spite of such a promise it would still have be ruinous to british interest to stand aside and see germany gain the upper and free hand in europe have obtain that all else would have follow to the desire of germany 's heart chapter

individual may be explain as result from the desire to remove or destroy a obstacle which have prove to be immovable and indestructible a healthy well-balanced mind admit defeat and endeavor to make a compromise -- to adjust itself to the inevitable but assume other condition -- a false sense of honor a morbid conception of self-importance -- then hate seem to be a natural although unhealthy result unfortunately there be evidence that these factor influence modern germany one of the root of tragedy be to be find in the inequality between the will and power to perform in its helplessness the will recoil upon itself turn to gall and bitterness or seek a solution in self-destruction it be noteworthy that some thirteen thousand individual commit suicide every year in germany unwilling or unable to adjust themselves to the phenomenon of life they choose death in preference to the compromise -- life a lean towards the tragic characterize the german of to-day a inclination not to compromise not to admit defeat thereby admit the will to be incapable of transformance into actuality between germany and britain fate have place such a rock of destiny _ ie _ this country 's position in the world

height into the dust by force of arm starvation and the power of lie they hope to force we back to unimportance and now the issue be : whether the categoric imperative of the east prussian kant or the hypocrisy of british cant shall gain the victory we be unalterably convince that england be we mortal enemy and that all endeavor to find a _ modus vivendus _ will be in vain still we present naval force be unequal to the task of overthrow she this will make it easy for the german government to obtain even the greatest sum from the reichstag in order to increase we fleet every other aim -- no

popular opinion for the cry ` nieder mit england ' it re-echoes daily from the lip of every german but still we must continue to point out its necessity -- it be a commandment which must banish every weak inclination to yield and make we strong to hold out to the bitter end to some it may appear ` one-sided ' but yet it be a moral duty to emphasize and strengthen we hate for england not only because we _ will _ hate but because we _ must _ hatred ennoble when it be direct with full force against the evil and bad and what be the evil for a answer consider how the english pedlar-spirit with cunning and lie have subjugate the world and hold it in bondage even in the upper class -lrb- english -rrb- ignorance reign supreme in they famous school _ eg _ eton college the young people --

east and west will be of no avail if at the conclusion of peace we have not conquer and compel england to accept we term there can never be justice or morality on earth or keep of treaty or recognition of moral international obligation till the power of the most faithless hypocritical nation which ever exist have be finally break and lie prostrate on the ground so long ago as 1829 goethe say to förster : ` in no land be there so many hypocrite and sanctimonious dissembler as in england ' we must wait in patience and with confidence in we leader for the final settlement which the

intelligence and will -lrb- 214 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 214 : ibid p 37 _ et seq _ -rrb- another of the fundamental reason for german hate must be seek in the different conception of life and its duty in the two nation in its chief result this have find expression in two totally different being professor engel -lrb- berlin -rrb- once write that from the cradle to the grave the german be on the line or in other word the state direct he every action probably it would be more correct to look upon the german state as a teutonic nirvana -- with this distinction that it be a negation of personal individuality but at the same time a huge collective positive the individual german fulfil he life 's mission by absorption into nirvana and by have all he activity transform in the collective whole for the benefit of the state the will of the state be supreme individual exist in through and for the whole and above all the state 's motto have be thoroughness and efficiency in every department of its manifold life knowledge and power its aim britain 's development have be along other line the widest possible room have be leave to the individual and the tie bind he to the whole have be loose in the extreme german discipline be replace by british liberty with its advantage to the individual and corresponding disadvantage for the state liberty imply the right to rise by honest endeavor but do not exclude the possibility of a wilful surrender to slothful inactivity _ eg _ the human flotsam and jetsam of british city the casual ward and similar institution these and other phenomenon of life in we island have arouse bitter contempt among german contempt have be succeed by envy and hatred rightly or wrongly the german have argue that the people who prefer sport to knowledge self-will to a sense of duty to the community selfishness to sacrifice -lrb- 215 -rrb- wire-pulling and patronage to efficiency -- this people be no longer worthy of the first place among the nation by right of merit morality and efficient fitness -- that place belong to germany -lrb- footnote 215 : a article by the present writer on some german school in the _ time _ educational supplement October 5th 1915 give some faint idea of the unprecedented sacrifice make by german school during the war all class of the population have voluntarily renounce a part of they earnings for war charity in the _ fränkischer kurier _ for October 13th 1915 the burgomaster of nuremberg announce that the voluntary reduction of salary agree to by the municipal official of that city have result in 264000 mark -lrb-

nuremberg with a population of 350000 -rrb- unfortunately the present war have bring many proof that there be no small amount of truth in this indictment and most unfortunate of all neutral country too accept germany 's version that britain be unorganized self-interested inefficient and effete and to just the same degree they be convince that germany be thorough they love britain 's humanitarian idea but admire german efficiency -- although they fear the latter 's militarism still when they be drive to choose to whom they shall confide they vital interest _ ie _ future existence they prefer to lean on successful german thoroughness than on britain 's humanitarianism unsupported by the strong arm at the moment of write there be wail and gnash of tooth throughout the british empire at the diplomatic failure in bulgarium and the previous fiasco in turkey sir edward gray have deal with the question in parliament but he have not mention the true reason the true reason be that this country have fall into the habit of send diplomatic representative abroad who have not be keen enough to obtain a mastery of the language or a full knowledge of the feeling and national aspiration of the people to whom they be accredit instead of be live ambassador of the british idea they have often be concrete example before foreign eye of british inefficiency a example of the language question which come under the author 's personal notice deserve mention in the spring of 1914 there seem to be a danger that a german would be appoint british consul in nuremberg and in order to prevent this the author write to a british minister station in munich he be greatly surprise to receive a reply -- the latter of course be in english -- address on the outside to : dr t smith _ on the top _ of the university of erlangen that be to say the german preposition _ auf _ be employ instead of _ a _ a mistake which even a elementary knowledge of german should have make impossible in the british legation at munich there be a german-british consul -- a munich timber-merchant if reader imagine that munich be a unimportant city in the diplomatic sense then they be recommend to study the french yellow book which contain final proof that a efficient french minister be able to make important discovery at the bavarian court british prestige confidence in british efficiency and power among neutral have gravitate dangerously in the direction of zero while admiration for germany have correspondingly rise that there be only too much reason for the change the course of the war have give ample proof and therein lie the hope of britain 's future the war will reveal to the british both they strength and weakness and if the war do not destroy the dry rot in the land then it be merely the precursor of britain 's final downfall there can be no greater mistake than close one 's eye to the good point in a resolute enemy as far as this war be concern they can be summarize under two head : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the german board of education which have develop and mobilize the last ounce of german brain and direct they into the service of the fatherland -lrb- 216 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- the german war office which have mobilize germany 's physical and technical force -lrb- footnote 216 : five year ago the present author write in the September number 1910 of macmillan 's _ school world _ : -- educational reform and plan must come from the schoolman they never spring of themselves from out of the people and this be perhaps the most deplorable admission of all that modern england have no great educationist or statesman capable of formulate a national system of school which shall develop the intellectual material of the nation to its highest power and direct those power into the best channel for several decade school inspector etc have visit continental country to study they educational system and have return home with innumerable fad -- but no system everything of the fantastic have be copy but no foundation have be lay with the result that england 's educational system to-day resemble a piece of patchwork contain a rich variety of color and a still greater variety of stuff-quality it be better for we to have do with educationist who preach about ` the rigid uniformity of system which be alien both to the english temperament and to the line on which english public school have develop ' the say public school have hopelessly fail to meet the necessity of a national system of education or to form the nucleus from which such a system could or can develop itself that the fall of niagara however dissipate untold natural force be just as true as that england waste immeasurable intellectual force because she force be allow to dissipate through not be discipline and bridle by a fitting educational mechanism therefore let england turn to the prosaic work of organise -rrb- no other state possess institution to compare with they they be the foundation of germany 's strength and the present author 's only regret be that the overwhelming force obtain by bridle the teutonic niagara of brain and muscle have be direct by a false patriotism into the wrong channel still that be what britain be up against and britain can only secure a honorable victory by surpass they and this much may be admit even at this stage of the struggle : one part of the german idea be certain of complete victory along the whole line -- german thoroughness and self-sacrifice because only by adopt that ideal be it possible for germany 's enemy to beat she political intrigue hunger cause by blockade cant wire-pulling hide the truth etc etc will break down before the german onslaught like wave break upon a rock britain have get to hark back to strafford 's watchword thorough and season it with the spirit of cromwell 's ironside to-day german be seriously discuss measure by which britain 's financial supremacy -- and therewith she naval supremacy -- can be overthrow after the present war one writer propose a return to napoleon 's continental system and conclude he plea : the british empire can and must be overthrow so that the continent of europe may flourish and develop accord to the dictate of europe 's will accord to herbert spencer 's view europe must exercise the highest ethic viz ` give the highest possible total of human being life happiness and above all harmony of work ' england have never comprehend what ` the harmony of work ' mean she entire heroism consist in brutally suppress the weaker and avaricious exploitation of everything foreign by means of cunning treaty and business trick even a englishman sir j seeley in he book ` the growth of british policy ' have defy this characteristic with objective clearness for sixty year england struggle against holland -- after which the latter lay prostrate before she now england 's battle against she greatest and mightiest rival have commence -- against germany this struggle will last sixty year and longer if great britain do not succumb before every peace will only mean preparation for new battle till the final result be attain english history afford proof of this shall germany the latest rival be break too or shall it be she mission to awaken europe to war against greed and avarice hypocrisy and theft robbery and violence land which have sleep and dream for century do not easily awake and a part of europe still dream deeply under the hypnotic influence of english cant and altruism or at least of she god-ordained hegemony this must be the goal of german statecraft and german diplomacy the dream must be dispel and the mask tear from the hypocrite 's face if germany desire to exist then the weak falter expediency-policy of the german empire must be at a end we one and only aim must be : down with england germany however may not strive to enter into england 's heritage -- that must fall to the continent england 's heir shall be europe which will then be able to progress

assiduously spread throughout the german press the berlin government allow the german people to believe that incriminate document be in they possession and the vilest statement to blacken mr findlay 's character be print in german newspaper when that gentleman be appoint to the bulgarian court in sofium there be so few utterance in german war literature which display reason or even moderation that the author feel glad to be in a position to cite two in the may number of the _ süddeutsche-monatshefte _ professor wilhelm franz -lrb- tübingen -rrb- review one of the hate-book viz a work entitle pedlar and hero by a german name sombart a few passage will suffice to show that germany be not quite devoid of straight-forward man who dare to castigate hate towards the end of he book sombart solemnly assure the english that ` they need not fear we as a colonize power we -lrb- the german -rrb- have not the least ambition to conquer half-civilized and barbarian people in order to fill they with german spirit -lrb- _ geist _ -rrb- but the english can colonize and fill such people with they spirit -- for they have none or at least only a pedlar 's ' it would never occur to any sane man to refute effusion of this kind for they can not be take seriously still i can not but wish that a angry english journalist with he clever and fiery pen would fall upon sombart 's book and give its author a sample of english spirit the work teem with unjust incorrect opinion be full of crass ignorance and grotesque exaggeration which lead the unlearned astray injure germany 's cause and annoy those who know better -- so far as they do not excite ridicule what be one to think when sombart ask he reader : ` what single cultural work have emerge from the great shop england since shakespeare -- except that political abortion the english state ' if i have to answer sombart i should say the great shop have give the english state practically everything which make for internal peace solidarity and national health it have enable the nation to exercise tolerance within and develop splendor and power without which in they turn have make britannium the mistress of the world 's waterway and the british the first colonial nation in the world england 's cultural development have bring all these since shakespeare 's time energy willpower unite with high endeavor to realize great aim and overcome mighty resistance and the basis of this splendid progress which compel the admiration of all other state be what sombart presume to call a ` abortion ' the other be take from der englische gedanke in deutschland -lrb- the english idea in germany -rrb- by ernst müller-holm p 72 it be not true that all englishman be scoundrel it be not true that there be nothing but pedlar 's spirit in england and because it be not true it should not be say not even in these time when war passion run high the fatherland of shakespeare byron and thackeray the home of newton adam smith darwin and lyell will ever remain a land of honor to educate german where would it end if i be to count up the hero of english intellect whose name be write in letter of gold in humanity 's great book it be well to conclude this chapter of hate with two quotation which breathe respect the author do not believe that german hate will be so long-enduring as the hate-monger would have we think rather he be convince that mutual interest will force the two nation together within one or two decade preparatory for that day it be britain 's duty to compel germany 's respect there be good even magnificent force in the german nation there be still noble-minded high-thinking german who yearn to work in the great civilizing world enterprise but -- and therein lie the tragedy -- the good the true the pure the just be not to-day the predominate power they must work out they own salvation but if the time ever come when the finest and best german thought direct germany 's destiny then there will be no lack of sympathizer in this country who will hail the day as the advent of a new world era for the present all mutual jealousy all the burning ambition all quarrel and hate be submit to the arbitrament of the sword if britain only wield she sword so well and honourably as to gain unstinted victory that will prove to be the firmest basis for future respect and endure peace chapter xiii man to man and steel to steel _ scott _ mention have already be make of german disrespect even contempt for england and the english one of the reason for this contempt be the smallness of the british army and the fact that we soldier be pay servant of the country german apparently never could comprehend why a man should receive payment for serve he country by bear arm and that fact appear to they to afford overwhelming evidence of the pedlar-soul -lrb- _ krämergeist _ -rrb- the second conclusion draw have generally be that the britisher be devoid of all sense of duty and self-sacrificing patriotism probably the flock of several million man to arm in defense of the empire and in defense of british conception of right and wrong have do something to convince german that the premise of the syllogism be not so self-evident as they have imagine among all the great european power england be the only one which have not introduce national service and remain true to the principle of keep a army of pay soldier hence when in all other land at the outbreak of war the entire people stand ready to defend the national honor england be compel to beat the recruiting drum before she can wage

to despise the quality of the soldier or to cherish contempt for they the standard of physical fitness demand of the recruit be -- at least up till a short time ago -- more severe than that impose in other land there be no doubt we german brother who have meet the english on the field of battle admit that they fight not only with valor but with unyielding stubbornness this result not so much from barrack-yard drill and field maneuver as from the practical experience of warfare gain in many campaign england be occupy almost uninterruptedly in warlike enterprise in some part of the world or other further the officer -- belong mostly to the upper circle -- have distinguish themselves in the field by a rash bravery which be marked perhaps not so much by military as sportsmanlike behavior all in all the strategic value of the english army in regard to leadership training discipline and the spirit of the troops can not compare with the conscript army of other land -- especially the german army yet the contempt which have be express for it in the press as a army of hireling be just as little merited to-day as it be in the past when it add many a glorious page to england 's
