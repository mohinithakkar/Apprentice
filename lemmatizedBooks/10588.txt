of the world famous oration and of the best of the world 's classic etc _ in ten volume illustrate vol i great britain and ireland part one general introduction a two-fold purpose have be keep in view during the preparation of these volume -- on the one-hand to refresh the memory and if possible to enlarge the knowledge of reader who have already visit europe on the other to provide something in the nature of a substitute for those who have not yet do so and to inspire they with new and stronger ambition to make the trip reader of the first class will perhaps find matter here which be new to they -- at least some of it and in any case should not regret a opportunity again to see standard description of world-famed scene and historic monument of the other class it may be say that in any profitable trip to europe a indispensable thing be to go there possest of a large stock of historical knowledge not to say with some distinct understanding of the profound significance to we american civilization past present and future of the thing to be see there as have so often be say one find in europe what one take there -- that be we recognize there exactly those thing which we have learn to understand at home without a equipment of this kind the trip will mean little more than a sea-voyage good or bad a few ride on railroad somewhat different from we own meal and bed in hotel not quite like ours and opportunity to shop in place where a few real novelty may be find if one search for they long enough no sooner have a american tourist find himself on board a ship bind for europe than he be conscious of a social system quite unlike the one in which he be bear and rear on french ship he may well think himself already in france the manners of sailor no less than those of officer proclaim it the furniture proclaim it and so do woodwork wall decoration the dinner gong -lrb- which seem to have come out of a chateau in old touraine -rrb- and the free wine at every meal the same be quite as true of ship bind for english and german port on these be splendid order sober taste efficiency in servant and call for dinner that start reminiscence of hunting horn the order and system impress one everywhere on these ship thing be all in they proper place employee be at they proper post do they work or alert to do it when the need come here the utmost quiet prevail each part of the great organization be so well adjust to other part that the system operate noiselessly without confusion and with never a failure of cooperation at any point so long as the voyage last impression of a perfect system drive themselves into one 's consciousness after one go ashore and as long as he remain in europe that well order state will impress delight and comfort he possibly he will contrast it with he own country 's more hurry less firmly control way but once he reflect on cause he will perceive that the way of europe be product of a civilization long since settle and already ancient while the hurry and more thoughtless method at home be concomitant of a civilization still too young too ambitious and too successful to bear the curb and restraint which make good manners and good order possible among all class it be from fine example in these social matter no less than from visit to historic place that the observe and thoughtful tourist derive benefit from a european tour the literature of travel in europe make in itself a considerable library those who have contribute to it be in literary quality of many kind and various degree of excellence it be not now so true as it once be that we best writer write for the benefit of tourist if they do it be to compile guide-book and describe automobile trip in any search for adequate description of scene and place we can not long depend on present-day writer but must hark back to those of the last century there we shall find washington irving 's pen busily at work for we and the pen of other who make up a noble company the writings of these be still fresh and they fit we purpose as no other do fortunately for we the thing in europe that really count for the cultivate traveler do not change with the passing of year or century the experience which goethe have in visit the crater of vesuvius in 1787 be just about such as a american from kansas city or cripple creek would have in 1914 in the old papal palace of avignon dickens seventy year ago see essentially the same thing that a keen-eyed american tourist of today would see when irve more than a century ago make he famous pilgrimage to westminster abbey he see about everything that a pilgrim from oklahoma would see today it be believe that these volume alike in they form and contents present a mass of select literature such as have not be before offer to reader at one time and in one place franci w halsey introduction to vol i and ii great britain and ireland the tourist who have embark for the british isle land usually at liverpool fishguard or plymouth whence a special steamer-train take he in a few hour to london in landing at plymouth he have pass outside the harbor eddystone most famous of lighthouse and have see water in which drake overthrow the armada of philip ii once the tourist leave the ship he be conscious of a new environment aboard the tender -lrb- if there be one -rrb- he will feel this in the custom house formality when ride on the steamer-train on step to the station platform at he destination when ride in the tidy taxicab at the door and in the office of he hotel in he well-ordered bedroom and at he initial meal first of all he will appreciate the tranquility the unobtrusiveness the complete efficiency with which service be render he by those employ to render it when lord nelson before begin the battle of trafalgar say to he officer and sailor that england expect every man to do he duty the remark be merely one of friendly encouragement and sympathy rather than of stern discipline because every man on board that fleet of ship already expect to do he duty life in england be a school in which do one 's duty become a fundamental condition of stay in the game not alone sailor and soldier know this and adjust they life to it but all class of public and domestic servant -- indeed all man be subject to it whether servant or barrister lawmaker or king emerge from he hotel for a walk in the street the tourist even tho he visit be not the first will note the ancient look of thing here be building that have survive for two or even five hundred year and yet they be still find fit for the purpose to which they be put few building be tall the skyscraper be undiscoverable on great and crowded thoroughfare one may find building in plenty that have only two or at most three story and they window small with pane of glass scarcely more than eight by ten the great wall mass and dome of st paul 's the roof and tower of westminster abbey unlike the lone spire of old trinity in new york still rise

friend 's office in one of those little square so common in the older part of london how ancient all thing here may seem to he the very street doorway a antiquity and so the fireplace within the hinge and handle of the door from some upper rear window he may look out on a extension roof of solid lead that have survive sound and good after the storm of several generation and beyond may look into a ancient burial ground or down upon the grass-plot and ample walk around a church -lrb- perchance the temple church -rrb- and again may see below he the tomb of oliver goldsmith in america we look for antiquity to boston with she long wharf or faneuil hall to new york with she frauncc tavern and van cortlandt manor house to jamestown with she lone crumble church tower to the pacific coast with she

the revolution we history as a nation begin before that we be a group of colony each a part of the british empire we fight single-handed with indian it be true and we cooperate with the mother country

perhaps never imprest the imagination more than when approach it by night on the top of a coach you see its numberless light flare as tennyson say like a dreary dawn the most impressive approach be now by the river through the infinitude of dock quay and shipping london be not a city but a province of brick and stone hardly even from the top of st paul 's or of the monument can anything like a view of the city as a whole be obtain it be indispensable however to make one or the other of these ascent when a clear day can be find not so much because the view be fine as because you will get a sensation of vastness and multitude not easily to be forget there be or be not long ago a point on the ridge which connect hampstead with highgate from which as you look over london to the surrey hill beyond the modern babylon present something like the aspect of a city the ancient babylon may have vie with london in circumference but the greater part of its area be occupy by open space the modern babylon be a dense mass of humanity the empire and the commercial relation of england draw representative of trading committee or subject race from all part of the globe and the face and costume of the hindu the parsee the lascar and the ubiquitous chinaman mingle in the motley crowd with the merchant of europe and america the street of london be in this respect to the modern what the great palace of tyre must have be to the ancient world but pile carthage on tyre venice on carthage amsterdam on venice and you will not make the equal or anything near the equal of london here be the great

talisman in you pocket as in pari berlin st petersburg benare yokohama or peking that london be the great distribute center of the world be show by the fleet of the carry trade of which the countless mast rise along she wharf and in she dock she be also the bank of the world but we be remind of the vicissitude of commerce and the precarious tenure by which its empire be hold when we consider that the bank of the world in the middle of the last century be amsterdam the first and perhaps the greatest marvel of london be the commissariat how can the five million be regularly supply with food and everything needful to life even with such thing as milk and those kind of fruit which can hardly be leave beyond a day here again we see reason for except to the sweeping jeremiad of cynicism and conclude that tho there may be fraud and scamping in the industrial world genuine production faithful service discipline energy and skill in organization can not wholly have depart from the earth london be not only well feed but well supply with water and well drain vast and densely people as it be it be a healthy city yet the limit of practical extension seem to be nearly reach it become a question how the increase multitude shall be supply not only with food and water but with air the east of london which be the old city be as all know the business quarter let the worshiper of mammon when he set foot in lombard street adore he divinity of all whose temple this be the richest and the most famous note the throng incessantly thread those narrow and tortuous street nowhere be the face so eager or the step so hurry except perhaps in the business quarter of new york commerce have still its center here but the old social and civic life of the city have flee what once be the dwelling of the merchant of london be now vast collection of office the merchant dwell in the mansion of the west end they clerk in villa and box without number to which when they office close they be take by the suburban railway on Sunday a more than sabbath stillness reign in those street while in the church the monument of wren 's architectural genius which in wren 's day be so crowd the clergyman sleepily perform the service to a congregation which you may count upon you finger it be worth while to visit the city on a Sunday here and there in a back street may still be see what be once the mansion of a merchant prince ample and stately with the room which in former day display the pride of commercial wealth and resound with the festivity of the olden time now the sound of the pen alone be hear these and other relic of former day be fast disappear before the march of improvement which be drive straight new street through the antique labyrinth some of the old thoroughfare as well as the old name remain there be cheapside along which through the changeful age so vary a procession of history have sweep there be fleet street close to which in bolt court johnson live and which he prefer or affect to prefer to the finest scene of nature temple bar once grimly garnish with the head of traitor have be number with the thing of the past after furnish mr bright by the manner in which the omnibus be jam in it with a vivid simile for a legislative deadlock society have migrate to the westward leave far behind the ancient abode of aristocracy the strand where once stand a long line of patrician dwelling great queen street where shaftesbury 's house may still be see lincoln 's inn field where in the time of george ii the duke of newcastle hold he levee of office-seeker and russell square now reduce to a sort of dowager gentility hereditary mansion too ancient and magnificent to be desert such as norfolk house spencer house and lansdowne house stay the westward course of aristocracy at st jame 's square and street piccadilly and mayfair but the general tide of fashion have sweep far beyond in that vast realm of wealth and leisure the west end of london the eye be not satisfy with see neither the ear with hearing there be not nor have there ever be anything like it in the world note of admiration might be accumulate to any extent without aid the impression in every direction the visitor may walk till he be weary through street and square of house all evidently the abode of wealth some of they veritable palace the park be throng the street be block with handsome equipage fill with the rich and gay shop blaze with costly wares and abound with everything that can minister to luxury on a fine bright day of may or early June and day of may or early June be often as bright in london as anywhere the park be probably the greatest display of wealth and of the pride of wealth in the world the contrast with the slum of the east end no doubt be striking and we can not wonder if the soul of the east end be sometimes fill with bitterness at the sight a social jeremiah might be move to holy wrath by the glittering scene the seer however might be remind that not all the owner of those carriage be the child of idleness living by the sweat of another man 's brow many of they be professional man or chief of industry work as hard with they brain as any mechanic work with he hand and indispensable minister of the highest civilization the number and splendor of the equipage be think to have be somewhat diminish of late by the reduction of rent the architecture of the west end of london be for the most part drearily monotonous its form have too plainly be determine by the builder not by the artist tho since the restoration of art variety of style have be introduce and individual beauty have be more cultivate it be the boundless expanse of opulence street after street square after square that most impress the beholder and make he wonder from what miraculous horn of plenty such a tide of riches can have be pour a beautiful city london can not be call in beauty it be no match for paris the smoke which not only blacken but corrode be fatal to the architecture as well as to the atmosphere moreover the fine building which if bring together would form a magnificent assemblage be scatter over the immense city and some of they be ruin by they surroundings there be a fine group at westminster and the view from the step under the duke of york 's column across st jame 's park be beautiful but even at westminster meanness jostle splendor and the picture be mar by mr hankey 's huge tower of babel rise near london have have no edile like haussmann the embankment on the one side of the thame be noble in itself but you look across from it at the hideous and dirty wharf of southwark nothing be more charming than a fine water street and this water street might be very fine be it not mar by the projection of a huge railway shed the new court of law a magnificent tho it be say inconvenient pile instead of be place on the embankment or in some large open space be choke up and lose in rookery london we must repeat have have no edile perhaps the finest view be that from a steamboat on the river embrace the house of parliament somerset house and the temple with st paul 's rise above the whole westminster abbey -lrb- footnote : from the sketch book publish by gp putnam 's son -rrb- by washington irving on one of those sober and rather melancholy day in the latter part of autumn when the shadow of morning and evening almost mingle together and throw a gloom over the decline of the year i pass several hour in rambling about westminster abbey i spend some time in poet 's corner which occupy a end of one of the transept or cross aisle of the abbey the monument be generally simple for the life of literary man afford no striking theme for the sculptor shakespeare and addison have statue erect to they memory but the greater part have bust medallion and sometimes mere inscription notwithstanding the simplicity of these memorial i have always observe that the visitor to the abbey remain longest about they a kinder and fonder feeling take the place of that cold curiosity or vague admiration with which they gaze on the splendid monument of the great and heroic they linger about these as about the tomb of friend and companion for indeed there be something of companionship between the author and the reader other man be know to posterity only through the medium of history which be continually grow faint and obscure but the intercourse between the author and he fellow man be ever new active and immediate from poet 's corner i continue my stroll toward that part of the abbey which contain the sepulcher of the king i wander among what once be chapel but which be now occupy by the tomb and monument of the great at every turn i meet with some illustrious name or the cognizance of some powerful house renown in history as the eye dart into these dusky chamber of death it catch glimpse of quaint effigy some kneeling in niche as if in devotion other stretch upon the tomb with hand piously prest together warrior in armor as if repose after battle prelate with crozier and miter and noble in robe and coronet lie as it be in state in glancing over this scene so strangely populous yet where every form be so still and silent it seem almost as if we be tread a mansion of that fabled city where everything have be suddenly transmute into stone in the opposite transept to poet 's corner stand a monument which be among the most renowned achievement of modern art but which to I appear horrible rather than sublime it be the tomb of mr nightingale by roubillac the bottom of the monument be represent as throw open its marble door and a sheeted skeleton be start forth the shroud be fall from its fleshless frame as he launch he dart at he victim she be sink into she affrighted husband 's arm who strive with vain and frantic effort to avert the blow the whole be execute with terrible truth and spirit we almost fancy we hear the gibbering yell of triumph burst from the distended jaw of the specter but why should we thus seek to clothe death with unnecessary terror and to spread horror round the tomb of those we love the grave should be surround by everything that might inspire tenderness and veneration for the dead or that might win the live to virtue it be the place not of disgust and dismay but of sorrow and meditation i continue in this way to move from tomb to tomb and from chapel to chapel the day be gradually wear away the distant tread of loiterer about the abbey grow less and less frequent the sweet-tongued bell be summon to evening prayer and i see at a distance the chorister in they white surplice cross the aisle and enter the choir i stand before the entrance to henry the seventh 's chapel a flight of step lead up to it through a deep and gloomy but magnificent arch great gate of brass richly and delicately work turn heavily upon they hinge as if proudly reluctant to admit the foot of common mortal into this most gorgeous of sepulcher on enter the eye be astonish by the pomp of architecture and the elaborate beauty of sculptured detail the very wall be work into universal ornament incrust with tracery and scoop into niche crowd with statue of saint and martyr stone seem by the cunning labor of the chisel to have be rob of its weight and density suspend aloft as if by magic and the fret roof achieve with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb along the side of the chapel be the lofty stall of the knight of the bath richly carve of oak tho with the grotesque decoration of gothic architecture on the pinnacle of the stall be affixt the helmet and crest of the knight with they scarf and sword and above they be suspend they banner emblazon with armorial bearing and contrast the splendor of gold and purple and crimson with the cold gray fretwork of the roof in the midst of this grand mausoleum stand the sepulcher of its founder -- he effigy with that of he queen extend on a sumptuous tomb and the whole surround by a superbly work brazen railing when i read the name inscribe on the banner they be those of man scatter far and wide about the world some toss upon distant sea some under arm in distant land some mingling in the busy intrigue of court and cabinet all seek to deserve one more distinction in this mansion of shadowy honor the melancholy reward of a monument two small aisle on each side of this chapel present a touching instance of the equality of the grave which bring down the oppressor to a level with the opprest and mingle the dust of the bitterest enemy together in one be the sepulcher of the haughty elizabeth in the other be that of she victim the lovely and unfortunate mary not a hour in the day but some ejaculation of pity be utter over the fate of the latter mingled with indignation at she oppressor the wall of elizabeth 's sepulcher continually echo with sigh of sympathy heave at the grave of she rival a peculiar melancholy reign over the aisle where mary lie bury the light struggle dimly through window darken by dust the greater part of the place be in deep shadow and the wall be stain and tint by time and weather a marble figure of mary be stretch upon the tomb round which be a iron railing much corroded bear she national emblem -- the thistle i be weary with wander and sit down to rest myself at the monument revolve in my mind the chequered and disastrous story of poor mary suddenly the note of the deep-laboring organ burst upon the ear fall with double and redoubled intensity and rolling as it be huge billow of sound how well do they volume and grandeur accord with this mighty building with what pomp do they swell through its vast vault and breathe they awful harmony through these cave of death and make the silent sepulcher vocal and now they rise in triumph and acclamation heave higher and higher they accordant note and pile sound on sound and now they pause and the soft voice of the choir break out into sweet gush of melody they soar aloft and warble along the roof and seem to play about these lofty vault like the pure air of heaven again the peal organ heave its thrilling thunder compress air into music and roll it forth upon the soul what long-drawn cadence what solemn sweeping concord it grow more and more dense and powerful -- it fill the vast pile and seem to jar the very wall -- the ear be stunned -- the sens be overwhelm and now it be wind up in full jubilee -- it be rise from the earth to heaven -- the very soul seem rapt away and float upward on this swell tide of harmony i rise and prepare to leave the abbey as i descend the flight of step which lead into the body of the building my eye be catch by the shrine of edward the confessor and i ascend the small staircase that conduct to it to take from thence a general survey of this wilderness of tomb the shrine be elevated upon a kind of platform and close around it be the sepulcher of various king and queen from this eminence the eye look down between pillar and funeral trophy to the chapel and chamber below crowd with tomb where warrior prelate courtier and statesman lie molder in they bed of darkness close by I stand the great chair of coronation rudely carve of oak in the barbarous taste of a remote and gothic age the scene seem almost as if contrived with theatrical artifice to produce a effect upon the beholder here be a type of the beginning and the end of human pomp and power here it be literally but a step from the throne to the sepulcher would not one think that these incongruous memento have be gather together as a lesson to live greatness to show it even in the moment of its proudest exaltation the neglect and dishonor to which it must soon arrive how soon that crown which encircle its brow must pass away and it must lie down in the dust and disgrace of the tomb and be trample upon by the foot of the meanest of the multitude the last beam of day be now faintly streaming through the paint window in the high vault above I the lower part of the abbey be already wrapt in the obscurity of twilight the chapel and aisle grow darker and darker the effigy of the king fade into shadow the marble figure of the monument assume strange shape in the uncertain light the evening breeze creep through the aisle like the cold breath of the grave and even the distant footfall of a verger traverse the poet 's corner have something strange and dreary in its sound i slowly retrace my morning 's walk and as i pass out at the portal of the cloister the door close with a jarring noise behind I fill the whole building with echo i endeavor to form some arrangement in my mind of the object i have be contemplate but find they be already fall into indistinctness and confusion name inscription trophy have all become confound in my recollection tho i have scarcely take my foot from off the threshold what think i be this vast assemblage of sepulcher but a treasury of humiliation a huge pile of reiterate homily on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of oblivion it be indeed the empire of death he great shadowy palace where he sit in state mocking at the relic of human glory and spread dust and forgetfulness on the monument of prince how idle a boast after all be the immortality of a name time be ever silently turn over he page we be too much engross by the story of the present to think of the character and anecdote that give interest to the past and each age be a volume throw aside to be speedily forget the idol of to-day push the hero of yesterday out of we recollection and will in turn be supplant by he successor of to-morrow we father say sir thoma browne find they grave in we short memory and sadly tell we how we may be bury in we survivor history fade into fable fact become clouded with doubt and controversy the inscription molder from the tablet the statue fall from the pedestal column arch pyramid what be they but heap of sand and they epitaph but character write in the dust what be the security of a tomb or the perpetuity of a embalmment the remains of alexander the great have be scatter to the wind and he empty sarcophagus be now the mere curiosity of a museum the egyptian mummy which cambys or time have spare avarice now consumeth mizraim cure wound and pharaoh be sell for balsam -lrb- footnote : sir thoma browne -rrb- what then be to insure this pile which now tower above I from share the fate of mightier mausoleum the time must come when its gilded vault which now spring so loftily shall lie in rubbish beneath the foot when instead of the sound of melody and praise the wind shall whistle through the broken arch and the owl hoot from the shatter tower -- when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy mansion of death and the ivy twine round the fall column and the foxglove hang its blossom about the nameless urn as if in mockery of the dead thus the man pass away he name perish from record and recollection he history be as a tale that be tell and he very monument become a ruin the house of parliament -lrb- footnote : from english note book by arrangement with and by permission of the publisher of hawthorne 's work houghton mifflin co copyright 1870-1898 -rrb- by nathaniel hawthorne a little before twelve we take a cab and go to the two house of parliament -- the most immense building methink that ever be build and not yet finish tho it have now be occupy for year its exterior lie hugely along the ground and its great unfinished tower be still climb toward the sky but the result -lrb- unless it be the river-front which i have not yet see -rrb- seem not very impressive the interior be much more successful nothing can be more magnificent and gravely gorgeous than the chamber of peer -- a large oblong hall panel with oak elaborately carve to the height of perhaps twenty foot then the balustrade of the gallery run around the hall and above the gallery be six arched window on each side richly paint with historic subject the roof be ornamented and gilded and everywhere throughout there be embellishment of color and carve on the broadest scale and at the same time most minute and elaborate statue of full size in niche aloft small head of king no bigger than a doll and the oak be carve in all part of the paneling as faithfully as they use to do it in henry vii 's time -- as faithfully and with as good workmanship but with nothing like the variety and invention which i saw in the dining-room of smithell 's hall there the artist work with he heart and head but much of this work i suppose be do by machinery it be a most noble and splendid apartment and tho so fine there be not a touch of finery it glisten and glow with even a somber magnificence owe to the deep rich hue and the dim light bedimm with rich color by come through the paint window in arched recess that serve as frame at each end of the hall there be three picture by modern artist from english history and tho it be not possible to see they well as picture they adorn and enrich the wall marvelously as architectural embellishment the peer ' seat be four row of long sofa on each side cover with red morocco comfortable seat enough but not adapt to any other than a decorously exact position the woolsack be between these two division of sofa in the middle passage of the floor -- a great square seat cover with scarlet and with a scarlet cushion set up perpendicularly for the chancellor to lean against in front of the woolsack there be another still larger ottoman on which he might lie at full length -- for what purpose intended i know not i should take the woolsack to be not a very comfortable seat tho i suppose it be originally design to be the most comfortable one that could be contrived the throne be the first object you see on enter the hall be close to the door a chair of antique form with a high peak back and a square canopy above the whole richly carve and quite cover with burnish gilding besides be adorn with row of rock crystal -- which seem to I of rather questionable taste we next after long contemplate this rich hall proceed through passage and corridore to a great central room very beautiful which seem to be use for

200 a year the interior of st paul 's be not without a grandeur of its own but in detail it be bare cold and uninteresting tho wren intend to have line the dome with mosaic and to have place a grand baldacchino in the choir tho a comparison with st peter 's inevitably force itself upon those who be familiar with the great roman basilica there can scarcely be a greater contrast than between the two building there all be blaze with precious marble here there be no color except from the poor glass of the eastern window or where a tattered banner wave above a hero 's monument in the blue depths of the misty dome the london fog love to linger and hide the remains of some feeble fresco by thornhill hogarth 's father-in-law in st paul 's as in st peter 's the statue on the monument destroy the

arrangement with and by permission of the publisher houghton mifflin co copyright 1881 -rrb- by john rg hassard i take a steamboat one day at westminster bridge and after a voyage of 40 minute or so land near limehouse hole and follow the river street both east and west it be easy enough to trace the course of mortimer lightwood and eugene wrayburn as they walk under the guidance of riderhood through the stormy night from they room in the temple four mile away past the tower and the london dock and down by the slippery water 's edge to limehouse hole when they go to cause gaffer hexam 's arrest and find he drown tie to he own boat the strictly commercial aspect of the dock -- the london dock above and the west indium dock below -- shade off by slight degree into the black misery of the hole the warehouse be succeed by boat-builder ' shed by private wharf where ship all hide as to they hull behind wall and close fence thrust unexpected bowsprit over the narrow roadway by lime-yard by the shop of marine store-dealer and purveyor to all the want and folly of seaman and then by a variety of strange establishment which it would be hard to classify close by a yard pile up with crate and barrel of second-hand bottle be a large brick warehouse devote to the purchase and sale of broken glass a wagon load with that commodity stand before the door and man with scoop-shovel be transfer the glass into barrel a enclosure of one or two acre in a out-of-the-way street might have be the original of the dust-yard that contain boffin 's bower except that boffin 's bower be several mile distant on the northern outskirt of london a string of cart full of miscellaneous street and house rubbish all call here by the general name of dust be wait they turn to discharge there be a mountain of this refuse at the end of the yard and a party of laborer more or less impede by two very active black hog be sift and sort it other mound form from the sitting of the first be visible at the side there be huge accumulation of broken crockery and of scrap of tin and other metal and of bone there be a quantity of stable-manure and old straw and a heap as large as a two-story cottage of old hoop stript from cask and packing-case i never understand until i look into this yard how there could have be so much value in the dust-mound at boffin 's bower gradually the street become narrower wetter dirtier and poorer hideous little alley lead down to the water 's edge where the high tide splash over the stone step i turn into several of they and i always find two or three muddy man lounge at the bottom often a foul and furtive boat creep across the field of view the character of the shop become more and more difficult to define here a window display a heap of sailor 's thimble and pack-thread there another set forth a array of trumpery glass vase or a basket of stale fruit pretext perhaps for the disguise of a leave shop or unlicensed pawnbroker 's establishment out of which i expect to see miss pleasant riderhood come forth twist up she back hair as she come at a place where the house cease and a open space leave free a prospect of the black and bad-smelling river there be a old factory disused and ruin like the ancient mill in which gaffer hexam make he home and lizzie tell the fortune of she brother in the hollow by the fire i turn down a muddy alley where 12 or 15 placard head body find be paste against the wall they be print form fill in with a pen mr forster tell we in he life of dickens that it be the sight of bill of this sort which give the first suggestion of we mutual friend at the end of the alley be a neat brick police-station stair lead to the water and several trim boat be moor there within the station i could see a officer quietly busy at he desk as if he have be sit there ever since dickens describe the night inspector with a pen and ink ruler post up he book in a whitewashed office as studiously as if he be in a monastery on the top of a mountain and no howling fury of a drunken woman be bang herself against a cell-door in the back yard at he elbow a handsome young fellow in uniform who look like a cross between a sailor and a constable come out and ask very civilly if he could be of use to I do you know say i where the station be that dickens describe in ` we mutual friend ' oh yes sir this be the very spot it be the old building that stand just here : this be a new one but it have be put up in the same place mr dickens often go out with you man in the boat do not he yes sir many a night in the old time do you know the tavern which be describe in the same book by the name of the six jolly fellowship porter no sir i do not know it at least not by that name it may have be pull down for a lot of warehouse have be build along here and the place be very much change or it may be one of those below of course i choose to think that it must be one of those below i keep on a little farther by the crooked river lane where public house be as plentiful as if the entire population suffer from a rage and inextinguishable thirst for beer the sign-board display a preference for the plural which seem not to have escape the observation of the novelist if i do not see the six porter i come across the three mariner the three cup the three sun the three tun the three fox and the two brewer and in the last i hope that i find the original of the tavern so often mention in the story i have first notice it from the steamboat -- a narrow lop-sided wooden jumble of corpulent window heap one upon another as you might heap as many topple orange with a crazy wooden veranda impend over the water -- a tavern of dropsical appearance which have not a straight floor in its whole constitution and hardly a straight line i get at the entrance on the land side after a search among puzzling alley and there i find still stronger reminder of we mutual friend stick against the wall be a array of old and new hand-bill head drown and offer reward for the recovery of body the value set upon dead person in limehouse hole be not excessive : the customary recompense for find they seem to be ten shilling and in only one instance do the price reach the dazzling amount of one pound by the side of the house be a approach to the river : most of the building near be old and irregular and at low tide a great deal of the shore must be expose go upon the slippery stone beside which lay a few idle and rickety boat i find the expect range of window with red curtain match the nose of the regular customer i look in at the door a long passage open a vista of pleasant bar-parlor or whatever it may have be on the river-side and perhaps i should have see miss abbey potterson if i have go to the end several water-side character be drink beer at the lead-covered counter wait upon by a sharp young woman who seem to have replace bob gliddery instead of the little room call cozy where the police inspector drink burn

length be 520 foot -- westminster abbey be more than 100 foot less as we enter the immensity of it grow it be a beautiful theory that these great gothic church as outgrowth of the spirit of christianity in they largeness and in the form of they window and aisle be mean to represent the universality and lofty ideal of the christian faith pagan worship largely in family temple which none

form of white stone and wonderfully symmetrical in all its outline a screen richly work divide the norman from the gothic part two flight of stone step lead from one to the other it will not be easy to forget the impression make that dark December morning when i enter the little doorway of this cathedral and first walk down its long gray lofty nave to this flight of step the chanting in the choir

englishman and for descendant of englishman in the new world st martin 's be somewhat remove from the town where it stand alone on a sloping knoll and be very simple in form the tower that rise over

english town and district -rrb- by edward a freeman the tower of lincoln simply as tower be immeasurably finer than those of york but the front of york as a front far surpass the front of lincoln as for the general outline there can be no doubt as to the vast superiority of lincoln lincoln have sacrifice a great deal to the enormous pitch of its roof but it have its reward in the distant view of the outside the outline of york be spoil by the incongruity between the low roof of the nave and choir and the high roof of the transept the dumpiness of the central tower of york -- which be in truth the original norman tower case -- can not be wholly make a matter of blame to the original builder for it be clear that some finish whether a crown like those at newcastle and edinburgh or any other be intend still the proportion which be solemn in romanesque become squat in perpendicular and if york have never receive its last finish lincoln have lose the last finish which it receive surely no one who be not locally swear to the honor of york can doubt about prefer the noble central tower of lincoln soar still even tho shear of its spire the eastern transept again be far more skilfully manage at lincoln than at york it may well be doubt whether such a transept be really a improvement but if it be to be there at all it be certainly better to make it the bold and important feature which it be at lincoln than to leave it as it be at york half afraid as it be to proclaim its own existence come to the east end we again find as at the west lincoln throw away great advantage by a perverse piece of sham the east window of lincoln be the very noblest specimen of the pure and bold tracery of its own date but it be crusht as it be by the huge gable window above it -- big enough to be the east window of a large church -- and the aisle whose east window be as good on they smaller scale as the great window be absurdly finish with sham gable destroy the real and natural outline of the whole composition at york we have no gable at all the vast east window with its many flimsy mullion be wonderful rather than beautiful still the east end of york be real and so far it surpass that of lincoln on enter either of these noble church the great fault to be find be the lack of apparent height to some extent this be due to a cause common to both we be convince that both church be too long the eastern part of lincoln -- the angel ' choir -- be in itself one of the loveliest of human work the proportion of the side elevation and the beauty of the detail be both simply perfect but its addition have spoil the minster as a whole the vast length at one unbroken height give to the eastern view of the inside the effect of look through a tube and the magnificent east window when see from the western part of the choir be utterly dwarf and the same arrangement be open to the further objection that it do not fall in with the ecclestiastical arrangement of the building in the nave of york look eastward or westward it be hard indeed to believe that we be in a church only a few foot lower than westminster or saint ouen the height be utterly lose partly through the enormous width partly through the low and crush shape of the vaulting-arch the vault it must be remember be a imitation of a imitation a modern copy of a wooden roof make to imitate stone this imitation of stone construction in wood run through the greater part of the church it come out specially in the transept where a not very successful attempt be make to bring the gable window within the vault -- the very opposite to the vast space lose in the roof at lincoln yet with all this many noble view may be get in york nave and transept provide only the beholder take care never to look due east or west the western view be still further injure by the treatment of the west window -- in itself a admirable piece of tracery -- which fit into nothing and seem cut through the wall at a arbitrary point but the nave elevation take bay by bay be admirable look across out of the aisle -- the true way to judge -- the real height at last come out and we be remind of some of the most stately minster of france

durham cathedral have one advantage over the other i have see there be no organ-screen nor any sort of partition between the choir and nave so that we see its entire length nearly 500 foot in one vista the pillar of the nave be immensely thick but hardly of proportionate height and they support the round norman arch nor be there as far as i remember a single pointed arch in the cathedral the effect be to give the edifice a air of heavy grandeur it seem to have be build before the best style of church architecture have establish itself so that it weigh upon the soul instead of help it to aspire first there be these round arch support by gigantic column then immediately above another row of round arch behind which be the usual gallery that run as it be in the thickness of the wall around the nave of the cathedral then above all another row of round arch enclose the window of the clerestory the great pillar be ornament in various way -- some with a great spiral groove run from bottom to top other with two spiral ascend in different direction so as to cross over one another some be fluted or channel straight up and down some be work with chevron like those on the sleeve of a police inspector there be zigzag cutting and carving which i do not know how to name scientifically round the arch of the door and window but nothing that seem to have flower out spontaneously as natural incident of a grand and beautiful design in the nave between the column of the side aisle i see one or two monument i leave my seat and after stroll up and down the aisle a few time sally forth into the churchyard on the cathedral door there be a curious old knocker in the form of a monstrous face which be place there century ago for the benefit of fugitive from justice who use to be entitle to sanctuary here the exterior of the cathedral be huge be therefore grand it have a great central tower and two at the western end and repose in vast and heavy length without the multitude of niche and crumble statue and richness of detail that make the tower and front of some cathedral so endlessly interesting one piece of sculpture i remember -- a carve of a cow a milkmaid and a monk in

it be a very beautiful day and tho the shadow of the cathedral fall on this side yet it be about noontide it do not cover the churchyard entirely but leave many of the grave in sunshine there be not a great many monument and these be chiefly horizontal slab some of which look aged but on closer inspection prove to be mostly of the present century i observe a old stone figure however half worn away which seem to have something like a bishop 's miter on its head and may perhaps have lie in the proudest chapel of the cathedral before occupy its present bed among the grass about fifteen pace from the central tower and within its shadow i find a weather-worn slab of marble seven or eight foot long the inscription on which interested I somewhat it be to the memory of robert dodsley the bookseller johnson 's acquaintance who as he tombstone rather superciliously aver have make a much better figure as a author than could have be expect in he rank of life but after all it be inevitable that a man 's tombstone should look down on he or at all event comport itself toward he de haut en bas i love to find the grave of man connect with literature they interest I more even tho of no great eminence than those of person far more illustrious in other walk of life i know not whether this be because i happen to be one of the literary kindred or because all man feel themselves akin and on term of intimacy with those whom they know or might have know in book i rather believe that the latter be the case we go around the edifice and pass into the close penetrate through a arched passage into the crypt which methought be in a better style of architecture than the nave and choir thence we go into the cloister which be entire but not particularly interesting indeed this cathedral have

the generation that build cathedral by the sanctity which they attribute to they salisbury cathedral be far more beautiful than that of york the exterior of which be really disagreeable to my eye but this mighty spire and these multitudinous gray pinnacle and tower ascend toward heaven with a kind of natural beauty not as if man have contrived they they might be fancy to have grow up just as the spire of a tuft of grass do at the same time that they have a law of propriety and regularity among themselves the tall spire be of such admirable proportion that it do not seem gigantic and indeed the effect of the whole edifice be of beauty rather than weight and massiveness perhaps the bright balmy sunshine in which we see it contribute to give it a tender glory and to soften a little its majesty when we go in we hear the organ the forenoon service be near conclusion if i have never see the interior of york cathedral i should have be quite satisfied no doubt with the spaciousness of this nave and these side aisle and the height of they arch and the girth of these pillar but with that recollection in my mind they fall a little short of grandeur the interior be see to disadvantage and in a way the builder never mean it to be see because there be little or no painted glass nor any such mystery as it make but only a colorless common daylight reveal everything without remorse there be a general light hue moreover like that of whitewash over the whole of the roof and wall of the interior pillar monument and all whereas originally every pillar be polish and the ceiling be ornament in brilliant color and the light come many-hued through the window on all this elaborate beauty in lieu of which there be nothing now but space between the pillar that separate the nave from the side aisle there be ancient tomb most of which have recumbent statue on they one of these be longsword earl of salisbury son of fair rosamond in chain mail and there be many other warrior and bishop and one cross-legged crusader and on one tombstone a recumbent skeleton which i have likewise see in two or three other cathedral the pavement of the aisle and nave be lay in great part with flat tombstone the inscription on which be half obliterated and on the wall especially in the transept there be tablet among which i see one to the poet bowle who be a canon of the cathedral between the nave and the choir as usual there be a screen that half destroy the majesty of the building by abridge the spectator of the long vista which he might otherwise have of the whole interior at a glance we peep through the barrier and see some elaborate monument in the chancel beyond but the door of the screen be keep lock so that the verger may raise a revenue by show stranger through the richest part of the cathedral by and by one of these verger come through the screen with a gentleman and lady whom he be take around and we join ourselves to the party he show we into the cloister which have long be neglect and ruinous until the time of bishop dennison the last prelate who have be but a few year dead this bishop have repair and restore the cloister in faithful adherence to the original plan and they now form a most delightful walk about a pleasant and verdant enclosure in the center of which sleep good bishop dennison with a wife on either side of he all three beneath broad flat stone most cloister be darksome and grim but these have a broad paved walk beneath the vista of arch and be light airy and cheerful and from one corner you can get the best possible view of the whole height and beautiful proportion of the cathedral spire on one side of this cloistered walk seem to be the length of the nave of the cathedral there be a square of four such side and of place for meditation grave yet not too somber it seem to I one of the best while we stay there a jackdaw be walk to and fro across the grassy enclosure and haunting around the good bishop 's grave he be clothe in black and look like a feathered ecclesiastic but i know not whether it be bishop dennison 's ghost or that of some old monk on one side of the cloister and contiguous to the main body of the cathedral stand the chapterhouse bishop dennison have it much at heart to repair this part of the holy edifice and if i mistake not do begin the work for it have be long ruinous and in cromwell 's time he dragoon station they horse there little progress however have be make in the repair when the bishop die and it be decide to restore the building in he honor and by way of monument to he the repair be now nearly complete and the interior of this chapter-house give I the first idea anywise adequate of the splendor of these gothic church edifice the roof be sustain by one great central pillar of polished marble -- small pillar cluster about a great central column which rise to the ceiling and there gush out with various beauty that overflow all the wall as if the fluid idea have spring out of that fountain and grow solid in what we see the pavement be elaborately ornament the ceiling be to be brilliantly gilded and paint as it be of yore and the tracery and sculpture around the wall be to be faithfully renew from what remain of the original pattern exeter -lrb- footnote : from cathedral day by arrangement with and by permission of the publisher little brown & co

along high street that one might be some day in town without so much as suspect that one of the finest cathedral in england be a near neighbor it be almost by chance i remember that as we turn into a long quaint alley-way fill up with little low shop we catch a glimpse of a green plot of grass and some tree in the distance we guide instinct divine these to be the cathedral close to analyze the beauty of exeter be only to add another note to one 's joy in they they quality and rarity being of such a order as to warrant one 's cooler admiration the front be as unique in design as it be architecturally beautiful there be that rarest of feature in english cathedral -- a elaborately sculptured screen thoroughly honest in construction in originality of conception this front be perhaps unrivalled at least on english soil there be three recede story so admirably proportion as to produce a beautiful effect in perspective the glory of the great west window be further enhance by the graduate arcade which have the appearance of recede behind it above the west window rise a second and smaller triangular window in the gabled roof thus the triangular motif be sustain throughout from the three low doorway in the screen up to the far-distant roof this complete and harmonious front be nobly enrich by the splendid note of contrast in the two transeptal norman tower whose massive structural elegance and elaborateness of detail lend a extraordinary breadth and solidity to the edifice the grandeur which distinguish the exterior be only a fitting preparation for the solemnity and splendor of the interior passing beneath the thickly mass sculpture of the low portal the effect of the vastness of the nave be striking in its immensity curiously enough in this instance this effect of immensity be not due to a unbroken stretch of nave-aisle or to a lengthy procession of pier-arch but to the magnificent sweep of the unencumbered vaulting in the roof a organ screen intercept the line of vision at the entrance to the choir this however be the sole obstruction which the eye encounter above the great roof with its unbroken 300 foot of interlace line rise like some mighty forest its airy loftiness give to the entire interior a certain open-air atmosphere of breadth and vastness what most deeply concerned we be the desire to secure a uninterrupted session of contemplative enjoyment we have lose we heart to the beauty of the cathedral and care little or nothing for a clever dissect of its part we come again and again and it be the glory of the cathedral as a whole -- its expressive noble character its breadth and grandeur the poetry of its dusky aisle and the play of the rich shadow about its massive column -- that charm and enchain we it be one of the few english cathedral we say to each other that possess the old-world continental charm the charm of perpetual entertainment and whose beauty have just the right quality of richness and completeness to evoke a

worth gaze at in the whole world and now after behold a great many more i remember it with less prodigal admiration only because other be as magnificent as itself the trace remain in my memory represent it as airy rather than massive a multitude of beautiful shape appear to be comprehend within its single outline it be a kind of kaleidoscopic mystery so rich a variety of aspect do it assume from each altered point of view through the presentation of a different face and the rearrangement of its peak and pinnacle and the three battlemented tower with the spire that shoot heavenward from all three but one loftier than its fellow thus it imprest you at every change as a newly create structure of the pass moment in which yet you lovingly recognize the half-vanished structure of the instant before and feel moreover a joyful faith in the indestructible existence of all this cloudlike vicissitude a gothic cathedral be surely the most wonderful work which mortal man have yet achieve so vast so intricate and so profoundly simple with such strange delightful recess in its grand figure so difficult to comprehend within one idea and yet all so consonant that it ultimately draw the beholder and he universe into its harmony it be the only thing in the world that be vast enough and rich enough inside of the minster there be a long and lofty nave transept of the same height and side-aisle and chapel dim nook of holiness where in catholic time the lamp be continually burn before the richly decorate shrine of saint in the audacity of my ignorance as i humbly acknowledge it to have be i criticize this great interior as too much break into compartment and shear of half its rightful impressiveness by the interposition of a screen betwixt the nave and chancel it do not spread

second century she would be unreasonable to require any melancholy emotion in a chance interview at she tombstone it add a rich charm to sacred edifice this time-honored custom of burial in church

and i have no thought of find it here in a little country church windsor -lrb- footnote : from sunny memory of foreign land -rrb- by harriet beecher stowe about eleven o'clock we find ourselves go up the old stone step to the castle it be the last day of a fair which have be holden in this part of the country and crowd of the common people be flock to the castle man woman and child patter up the stair before and after we we go first through the state apartment the principal thing that interest I be the ball room which be a perfect gallery of vandyke 's painting here be certainly a opportunity to know what vandyke be i should call he a true court painter -- a master of splendid conventionality whose portrait of king be the most powerful argument for the divine right i know of the queen 's audience chamber be hang with tapestry represent scene from the book of esther this tapestry make a very great impression upon I a knowledge of the difficulty to be overcome in the material part of painting be undoubtedly a unsuspected element of much of the pleasure we derive from it and for this reason probably this tapestry appear to we better than painting execute with equal spirit in oils we admire it exceedingly entirely careless what critic might think of we if they know it from the state room we be take to the top of the round tower where we gain a magnificent view of the park of windsor with its regal avenue mile in length of ancient oak its sweep of greensward clump of tree its old herne oak of classic memory in short all that constitute the idea of a perfect english landscape the english tree be shorter and stouter than ours its foliage dense and deep lie with a full round outline against the sky everything here convey the idea of concentrated vitality but without that rank luxuriance see in we american growth have unfortunately exhaust the english language on the subject of grass i will not repeat any ecstasy upon that topic after descend from the tower we file off to the proper quarter to show we order for the private room the state apartment which we have be look at be open at all time but the private apartment can only be see in the queen 's absence and by special permission which have be procure for we on this occasion by the kindness of the duchess of sutherland one of the first object that attract my attention when enter the vestibule be a baby 's wicker wagon standing in one corner it be much such a carriage as all mother be familiar with such as figure largely in the history of almost every family it have neat curtain and cushion of green merino and be not royal only maternal i muse over the little thing with a good deal of interest in the family breakfast room we see some fine gobelin tapestry represent the classical story of meleager in one of the room on a pedestal stand a gigantic china vase a present from the emperor of russium and in the state room before we have see a large malachite vase from the same donor the toning of this room with regard to color be like that of the room i describe in stafford house -- the carpet of green ground with the same little leaf upon it the wall chair and sofa cover with green damask the whole air of these room be very charming suggestive of refined taste and domestic habit the idea of home which pervade everything in england from the cottage to the palace be as much suggest here as in any apartment i have see the wall of the different room be decorate with portrait of the member of the royal family and those of other european prince after this we go thro the kitchen department -- see the silver and gold plate of the table among the latter be some design which i think particularly graceful to conclude all we go through the stable the man who show they tell we that several of the queen 's favorite horse be take to osborne but there be many beautiful creature leave which i regard with great complacency the stable and stall be perfectly clean and neatly keep and one in short derive from the whole view of the economy of windsor that satisfaction which result from see a thing thoroughly do in the best conceivable manner blenheim -lrb- footnote : from famous home of great britain and they story ah malan editor by arrangement with the publisher gp putnam 's son copyright 1899 -rrb- by the duke of marlborough the architecture of the house itself clearly indicate the taste and training of its builder vanbrugh share the enthusiasm of the day for classical work as understand and develop whether well or ill by the italian of the sixteenth and seventeenth century but with characteristic disregard of law he think to combine classical severity with the fancifulness natural in a northerner and a playwright thus while the general scheme of the south front for instance be distinctly severe the massive tower at its end be surmount by fantastic mass of open stone-work most quaintly finish off with arrangement of cannon-ball and coronet throughout he repeatedly make use of classical member with strange disregard to they structural intention silvester the french artist employ to make design for the decoration of the salon sniff contemptuously at vanbrugh 's gothic tendency i can not approve of that double line of niche it suggest the faade of a gothic church and then with savage delight he announce he discovery that much of the design be merely a unintelligent imitation of the palazzo farnese at florence certainly in spite of vanbrugh 's attempt to achieve at once dignity and lightness the probable impression make by the building on the casual observer be that it be ponderous without be stately and irregular without be tasteful but the final feeling of any one whose fate it be to study it at leisure will assuredly be one of respect even of enthusiasm for the ability of vanbrugh it take time to realize the boldness of the general design and the solidity of the masonry in many part there be about as many foot of solid stone as a modern architect would put inch of lath and plaster the negative quality of integrity and thoroughness be rare enough in work of the present day now that the architect have delegate to the contractor the execution of he design the interior proportion of the room be generally admirable and so perfectly be the work carry out that it be possible to look through the keyhole of ten door and see daylight at the end over three hundred foot off it be noticeable further that the whole be design by a single man there be no subsequent addition as there be for instance at chatsworth and wentworth vanbrugh be responsible for good and bad quality alike one would imagine a priori that he have everything in he favor -- unlimited money and a free hand far from this be the case the stupendous work be accomplish under difficulty greater than any long-suffering architect ever have to contend with the beginning of the building be most auspicious in 1705 the year after blenheim queen anne in accordance with a address of the common grant marlborough the royal estate of which woodstock be the center with money to build a suitable house the nation be anxious to show its gratitude to the general under whom english troops have win they first considerable victory on foreign soil since agincourt the queen be for do all in she power for she dear mr freeman marlborough see in the scheme a dignified and legitimate method of perpetuate he fame and so vanbrugh be commission to build a house which should be worthy of all three the work be at once begin on the exist scale difficulty spring up when the duchess begin to lose by she abuse of it the power which she have always possess over the queen when too it be see that the architect 's estimate bear no sort of relation to the actual cost vanbrugh be often in the greatest strait for money and write piteously to the duchess and the lord treasurer godolphin without the slightest effect thing naturally grow worse when both the duke and duchess be dismiss from all they post in 1711 and at last in 1721 the dispute culminate in a lawsuit successfully bring against the duke by the workman for arrears of pay the defendant 's contention be that the treasury be liable for the whole expense the duchess vent she displeasure on the unfortunate architect whom she never credit with do anything right she carefully keep he letter and make spiteful endorsement on they for the benefit of she counsel at the trial while sarah be perpetually involve herself in quarrel with she architect the duke be indirectly further the progress of the building by a succession of victory abroad without take a active part he be yet much interested in the house always look forward to the time when he should live there in peace with he wife when on a campaign he write to she nearly every other day and in almost every letter there be a personal touch show he ever-present love for she he keen anxiety to keep she love and to win she approval of everything he do the main interest of marlborough 's later life center in blenheim the duchess have do the lion 's share of the work of superintendence it remain for he to arrange the many work of art he have buy and have be give during the war there still exist a account of the price he pay for tapestry make in brussels most of which be now on the wall of the house over the south front be place a bust of loui xiv a trophy take from the gate of tournay change of fashion and of taste have leave they mark on blenheim and as the old oak recall the joyousness of the middle age and the elm and cedar have a certain air of eighteenth-century stateliness so perhaps the orchid with they exotic delicacy may be hold typical of the decadent present from the house many treasure once part of its adornment be now miss and while book picture and gem have disappear modern idea of comfort have suggest the insertion of electric light and telephone to regret the treasure of the past be a commonplace it would seem fitter to make the best of the advantage of the present warwick -lrb- footnote : from sunny memory of foreign land -rrb- by harriet beecher stowe when we come fairly into the courtyard of warwick castle a scene of magnificent beauty open before we i can not describe it minutely the principal feature be the battlements tower and turret of the old feudal castle encompass by grounds on which have be expend all that princely art of landscape gardening for which england be famous -- leafy thicket magnificent tree opening and vista of verdure and wide sweep of grass short thick and vividly green as the velvet moss we sometimes see grow on rock in new england grass be a art and a science in england -- it be a institution the pain that be take in sowing tend cut clipping rolling and otherwise nursing and coax it be second by the misty breath and often fall tear of the climate produce result which must be see to be appreciate here under the shade of lofty cedar have spring and fall a hereditary line of prince one can not but feel in look on these majestic tree with the battlements turret and tower of the old castle everywhere surround he and the magnificent park and lawn open through dreamy vista of tree into what seem immeasurable distance the force of the soliloquy which shakespeare put into the mouth of the die old king-maker as he lie ebreathe out he soul in the dust and blood of the battlefield i have describe the grounds first but in fact we do not look at they first but go into the house where we see not only all the state room but through the kindness of the noble proprietor many of those which be not commonly exhibit a bewildering display of magnificent apartment picture gem vase arm and armor antique all in short that the wealth of a princely and powerful family have for century be accumulate the great hall of the castle be sixty-two foot in length and forty in breadth ornament with a richly carve gothic roof in which figure

quantity of yew-tree wood the rude simplicity of thus arrange it on the polished floor of this magnificent apartment strike I as quite singular i suppose it be a continuation of some ancient custom opening from this apartment on either side be suite of room the whole series be three hundred and thirty-three foot in length these room be all hang with picture and stud with antique and curiosity of immense value there be first the red drawing-room and then the cedar drawing-room then the gilt drawing-room the state bedroom the boudoir etc etc hang with picture by vandyke ruben guido sir joshua

brutal unfeeling tyrant be veritably set forth with all the gold and gem which in he day blind mankind he fat white hand be beautifully paint after have examine all the upper story we go down into the vault underneath -- vault once grim and hoary terrible to captive and feudal enemy now devote to no purpose more grim than that of coal cellar and wine vault in oliver 's time a regiment be quarter there they be extensive enough apparently for a army the kitchen and its adjunct be of magnificent dimension and indicate a ancient amplitude in the way of provision for good cheer worthy a ancient house and what strike I as a still better feature be a library of sound sensible historical and religious work for the servant we go into the beer vault where a man draw beer into a long black jack such as scott describe it be a tankard make of black leather i should think half a yard deep he draw the beer from a large hogshead and offer we some in a glass it look very clear but on tasting i find it so exceedingly bitter that it strike I there would be small virtue for I in abstinence kenilworth -lrb- footnote : from scott 's kenilworth kenilworth be now the most stately ruin castle in

immense structure which now lie crusht under its own ruin the monument of its owner 's ambition the external wall of this royal castle be on the south and west side adorn and defend by a lake partly artificial across which leicester have construct a stately bridge that elizabeth might enter the castle by a path hitherto untrodden instead of the usual entrance to the northward over which he have erect a gate-house or barbican which still exist and be equal in extent and superior in architecture to the baronial castle of many a northern chief beyond the lake lay a extensive chase full of red-deer fallow-deer roe and every species of game and abound with lofty tree from among which the extend front and massive tower of the castle be see to rise in majesty and beauty we can not but add that of this lordly palace where prince feast and hero fight now in the bloody earnest of storm and siege and now in the game of chivalry where beauty deal the prize which valor win all be now desolate the bed of the lake be but a rushy swamp and the massive ruin of the castle only serve to show what they splendor once be and to impress on the muse visitor the transitory value of human possession and the happiness of those who enjoy a humble lot in virtuous contentment alnwick -lrb- footnote : from visit to remarkable place -rrb- by william howitt a visit to alnwick be like go back into the old feudal time the town still retain the moderate dimension and the quiet air of one that have grow up under the protection of the castle and of the great family of the castle other town that arise under the same circumstance have catch the impulse of modern commerce and manufacture and have grow into huge bustling and noisy city in which the old fortified wall and the old castle have either vanish or have be swallow up and stand as if in superannuated wonder amid a race and a wilderness of building with which they have nothing in common when however you enter alnwick you still feel that you be enter a feudal place it be as the abode of the percy have present itself to you imagination it be still quaint gray and old-worldish in fact the whole situation be fine without be highly romantic and worthy of its superb old fabric in the castle itself without and within i never see one on english ground that more delighted I because it more completely come up to the beau ideal of the feudal baronial mansion and especially of that of the percy the great chieftain of the british border -- the hero of otterburn and chevy chase nothing can be more striking than the effect at first enter within the wall from the town when through a dark gloomy gateway of considerable length and depth the eye suddenly emerge into one of the most splendid scene that can be imagine and be present at once with the great body of the inner castle surround with fair semi-circular tower finely swell to the eye and gaily adorn with pinnacle battlements etc the impression be still further strengthen by the successive entrance into the second and third court through great massy tower till you be land in the inner court in the very center of this great citadel a idea may be form of the scale of this brave castle when we state that it include within its outer wall about five acre of ground and that its wall be flank with sixteen tower which now afford a complete set of office to the castle and many of they retain not only they ancient name but also they original use the castle court except the center one be beautifully carpet with green turf which give they a very pleasant aspect in the center of the second court be a lion with he paw on a ball a copy of one of the lion of st mark at venice the inner court be square with the corner take off and on the wall opposite to the

the gateway you enter a octagon tower where the old dungeon still remain in the floor cover with its iron grate it be eleven foot deep by nine foot eight inch and a half square at the bottom in the court be two other dungeon now or formerly use for a force-pump to throw water up to the top of the castle and one now not use at all -- which could all be so close down as to exclude the prisoner from both sound and light have wander thus around this noble pile it be time to enter it of the interior however i shall not say much more than that it be at once a fitting modern residence for a nobleman of the high rank and ancient descent of the proprietor and in admirable keep with its exterior the room be fit up with light gothic tracery on the wall very chaste and elegant and the color be so delicate and subdue that you be not offend with that feeling of over-fineness that be feel at raby you ascend by a noble staircase surround with armorial escutcheon instead of a cornice to a suite of very spacious and handsome room of which the principal be the saloon dining-room breakfast-room library and chapel the ceiling be finely work into compartment with escutcheon and pendant the wall of the saloon be cover with crimson silk sprig with yellow flower those of the dining-room with pale buff and white molding rich tracery and elegant compartmented ceiling in the center of some of the arch you see the crescent the crest of the percy on the whole it be a noble and highly satisfactory mansion but still it be when you get without again that you feel the real antiquity and proud dignity of the place the fame of the percy and the dougla seem to be whisper by every wind that play around those old tower hampton court -lrb- footnote : from visit to remarkable place -rrb- by

many beautiful effect of light and shadow in these wood we see one or two herd of deer quietly feed a hundred yard or so distant they appear to be somewhat wilder than cattle but i think not much wilder than sheep they ancestor have probably be in a half-domesticated state receive food at the hand of man in winter for century there be a kind of poetry in this quite as much as if they be really

i think the whole length of the house about five hundred foot arch all the way and lengthen interminably by a looking-glass at the end in which i see we own party approach like a party of stranger but i have so often see this effect produce in dry-goods store and elsewhere that i be not much imprest there be family portrait and other picture and likewise piece of statuary along this arched corridor and it communicate with a chapel with a scriptural altar-piece copy from ruben and a picture of st michael and the dragon and two or perhaps three richly paint window everything here be entirely new

other renew house after all the utmost force of man can do positively very little toward make grand thing or beautiful thing the imagination can do so much more merely on shut one 's eye that the actual effect seem meager so that a new house unassociated with the past be exceedingly unsatisfactory especially when you have hear that the wealth and skill of man have here do its best besides the room as we see they do not look by any means they best the carpet not be down and the furniture be cover with protective envelop however room can not be see to advantage by daylight it be altogether essential to the effect that they should be illuminate by artificial light which take they somewhat out of the region of bare reality nevertheless there be undoubtedly great splendor -- for the detail

the wall grow out of the town as the trunk of a great tree shoot forth from the ground -- of a different growth but a integral part of it topographically arundel have only a few feature yet they be fine enough to form a rich ensemble there be the castle huge splendid impressive set like a great gray pearl on the crown of the hill on one side spread the town on the other the tall tree of the castle park begirt its tower and battlements at the foot of the hill run the river -- a beautiful sinuous stream which curve its course between the down hillside out through the plain to the sea whatever may have be the fate of the town in former time hold perhaps at a distance far below in the valley during troublous time when the castle must be free for the more serious work of assault or defense it no longer lie at the foot of its great protector in friendly confidence it seem to sit if not within its arm at least beside its knee there be no escape the conclusion that a duke when one be confront with he castle do seem a awfully real be the castle be a great catholic stronghold the duke of norfolk being among the few great family which have remain faithful since the conquest to the see of rome the present duke of norfolk by reason of the fervor of he piety he untiring zeal and magnificent generosity be recognize as the head of the catholic party in england to learn that he be at present on a pilgrimage to lourde and that such be he yearly custom seem to shorten distance for we it make the old -- its belief its superstition its unquestioning ardor of faith -- strangely new it invest the castle which appeal to we consciousness as something remote and alien with the reality of its relation to medieval life and manners the little cathedral which crown the hill -- the most prominent object for mile about after the castle -- be the gift of the present duke it be a pretty structure point gothic in style consciously reproduce with all the aid of fly buttress niche pinnacle and arch it be doubtless a splendid gift perhaps in the twenty-first century when the weather have do its architectural work on the exterior and when the interior have be finely dim with burned incense when stain glass and sculpture effigy of saint have be donate by future duke it will be a very impose edifice indeed but all the beauty of ecclesiastical picturesqueness lie across the way hide behind the lovely beech-arched gateway rest the old parochial church in spite of restoration the age of six century be write unmistakably on the massive square bell-tower the thirteenth-century tracery and the rich old glass it be guard by a high wall from the adjoining castle-wall as if the castle still fear there be something dangerously infectious in the mere propinquity of such heresy it have have its turn at the siege that have beset the castle from the old tower there come a rattle hail when waller 's artillery flash forth its fire upon the royalist garrison in the castle the old bell that peal out the Sunday chime seem to retain something of the jubilant spirit of that martial time there be a brisk military vigor in they clanging suggestive of command rather than of entreaty as if they be more at home when summon fighter than worshiper all be peace now the old church sit in the midst of its grave like a old patriarch surround by the dead whom he have survive in look up at the castle from the river as a foreground one have a lovely breastwork of tree the castle rest on the crown of the hill like some splendid jewel its grayness make its strong bold outline appear the more distinct against the melting background of the faint blue and white english sky and the shift sky scenery the earliest saxon who build he stronghold where the castle now stand must have have a eye for situation pictorially consider as well as that keen martial foresight which tell he that the warrior who command the first hill from the sea with that bastion of natural fortification behind he the downs have the god of battle already range on he side the god of battle have be call on in time past to preside over a number of military engagement which have come off on this now peaceful hillside there have be few stir event in english history in which arundel castle have not have its share as norman baron the earl of arundel could not do less than the other baron of they time and so quarrel with they king when the magna charta be go about to gain signer these feudal arundel gentleman figure in the bill so to speak the fine baron 's hall which commemorate this memorable signing in the castle yonder be build in honor of those remote but far-sighted ancestor the englishman of course have neither the vanity of the frenchman nor the pride of the spaniard but for a modest people it be astonishing what a number of monument be build to tell the rest of the world how free england be the other event which have in turn destroy or rent the castle -- its siege and surrender to henry i the second siege by king stephen and later the struggle of the cavalier and roundhead for its possession during the absence abroad of the then reign earl -- have be record with less boastful emphasis the recent restoration rebuilding and enlargement have obliterate all trace of these rude shock it have since rise a hundred time more beautiful from its ruin it be due to these modern renovation that the castle present such a superb appearance it have the air of careful preservation which distinguish some of the great royal residence -- such as windsor for instance to which it have often be compare its finish and completeness suggest the modern chisel it be this aspect of completeness as well as the unity of its fine architectural feature which make such a great castle as this so impressive as a feudal stronghold it can hardly fail to appeal to the imagination as the modern palatial home of a english nobleman it appeal to something more virile -- to the sense that behind the medieval wall the life of its occupant be still representative be still deep and national in importance and significance pictorially there be nothing -- unless it be a great cathedral which bring up quite a different order of impression and sensation -- that give to the landscape such pictorial effect as a castle penshurst -lrb- footnote : from visit to remarkable place -rrb- by william howitt

genius which seem to delight in hatch its offspring in by-corner the wall of its squalid chamber be cover with name and inscription in every language by pilgrim of all nation rank and condition from

smoker of sir walter raleigh the sword also with which he play hamlet and the identical lantern with which friar laurence discover romeo and juliet at the tomb there be a ample supply also of shakespeare 's mulberry-tree which seem to have as extraordinary power of self-multiplication as the wood of the true cross of which there be enough extant to build a ship of the line the most favorite object of curiosity however be shakespeare 's chair it stand in the chimney-nook of a small gloomy chamber just behind what be he father 's shop here he may many a time have sit when a boy watch the slowly-revolving spit with all the longing of a urchin or of a evening listen to the crone and gossip of stratford deal forth churchyard tale and legendary anecdote of the troublesome time in england in this chair it be the custom of everyone who visit the house to sit : whether this be do with the hope of imbibe any of the inspiration of the bard i be at a loss to say i merely mention the fact and mine hostess privately assure I that tho build of solid oak such be the fervent zeal of devotee that the chair have to be new-bottomed at least once in three year from the birthplace of shakespeare a few pace bring I to he grave we approach the church through the avenue of lime and enter by a gothic porch highly ornamented with carve door of massive oak the interior be spacious and the architecture and embellishment superior to those of most country church there be several ancient monument of nobility and gentry over some of which hang funeral escutcheon and banner drop piecemeal from the wall the tomb of shakespeare be in the chancel the place be solemn and sepulchral tall elm wave before the pointed window and the avon which run at a short distance from the wall

like a arch through which one might have reach into he grave no one however presume to meddle with the remains so awfully guard by a malediction and lest any of the idle or the curious or any collector of relic should be tempt to commit depredation the old sexton keep watch over the place for two day until the vault be finish and the aperture close again he tell I that he have make bold to look in at the hole but could see neither coffin nor bone nothing but dust it be something i think to have see the dust of shakespeare i have now visit the usual object of a pilgrim 's devotion but i have a desire to see the old family seat of the lucy 's at charlecot and to ramble through the park where shakespeare in company with some of the roisterer of stratford commit he youthful offense of deer-steal the old mansion of charlecot and its surrounding park still remain in the possession of the lucy family and be peculiarly interesting from be connect with this whimsical but eventful circumstance in the scanty history of the bard as the house stand at little more than three mile ' distance from stratford i resolve to pay it a pedestrian visit that i might stroll leisurely through some of those scene from which shakespeare must have derive he earliest idea of rural imagery my route for a part of the way lay in sight of the avon which make a variety of the most fanciful doubling and winding through a wide and fertile valley sometimes glitter from among willow which fringe its border sometimes disappear among grove or beneath green bank and sometimes ramble out into full view and make a azure sweep around a slope of meadow land this beautiful bosom of country be call the vale of the red horse a distant line of undulating blue hill seem to be its boundary while all the soft intervene landscape lie in a manner enchain in the silver link of the avon after pursue the road for about three mile i turn off into a foot-path which lead along the border of field and under hedgerow to a private gate of the park there be a stile however for the benefit of the pedestrian there be a public right of way through the grounds i delight in these hospitable estate in which everyone have a kind of property -- at least as far as the foot-path be concerned i now find myself among noble avenue of oak and elm whose vast size bespeak the growth of century the wind sound solemnly among they branch and the rook caw from they hereditary nest in the tree top the eye range through a long lessen vista with nothing to interrupt the view but a distant statue and a vagrant deer stalk like a shadow across the opening i have now come in sight of the house it be a large building of brick with stone quoin and be in the gothic style of queen elizabeth 's day have be build in the first year of she reign the exterior remain very nearly in its original state and may be consider a fair specimen of the residence of a wealthy country gentleman of those day a great gateway open from the park into a kind of courtyard in front of the house ornament with a grass-plot shrub and flower-bed the gateway be in imitation of the ancient barbican be a kind of outpost and flank by tower tho evidently for mere ornament instead of defense the front of the house be completely in the old style with stone shaft casement a great bow-window of heavy stone work and a portal with armorial bearing over it carve in stone at each corner of the building be a octagon tower surmount by a gilt ball and weathercock the avon which wind through the park make a bend just at the foot of a gently slope bank which sweep down from the rear of the house large herd of deer be feed or repose upon its border and swan be sail majestically upon its bosom after prowl about for some time i at length find my way to a lateral portal which be the every-day entrance to the mansion i be courteously receive by a worthy old housekeeper who with the civility and communicativeness of she order show I the interior of the house the greater part have undergo alteration and be adapt to modern taste and mode of live there be a fine old oaken staircase and the great hall that noble feature in a ancient manor-house still retain much of the appearance it must have have in the day of shakespeare the ceiling be arched and lofty and at one end be a gallery in which stand a organ the weapon and trophy of the chase which formerly adorn the hall of a country gentleman have make way for family portrait there be a wide hospitable fire-place calculate for a ample old-fashioned wood fire formerly the rally place of winter festivity on the opposite side of the hall be the huge gothic bow-window with stone shaft which look out upon the court-yard here be emblazon in stain glass the armorial bearing of the lucy family for many generation some be date in 1558 i regret to find that the ancient furniture of the hall have disappear for i have hope to meet with the stately elbow-chair of carve oak in which the country squire of former day be wont to sway the scepter of empire over he rural domain and in which might be presume the redoubted sir thoma sit enthrone in awful state when the recreant shakespeare be bring before he as i like to deck out picture for my entertainment i pleased myself with the idea that this very hall have be the scene of the unlucky bard 's examination on the morning after he captivity in the lodge i fancy to myself the rural potentate surround by he body-guard of butler page and the blue-coated serving-man with they badge while the luckless culprit be bring in forlorn and chapfallen in the custody of game-keeper huntsman and whipper-in and follow by a rabble rout of country clown i fancy bright face of curious housemaid peep from the half-opened door while from the gallery the fair daughter of the knight lean gracefully forward eye the youthful prisoner with that pity that dwell in womanhood who would have think that this poor varlet thus tremble before the brief authority of a country squire and the sport of rustic boor be soon to become the delight of prince the theme of all tongue and age the dictator to the human mind and be to confer immortality on he oppressor by a caricature and a lampoon i now bid a reluctant farewell to the old hall my mind have become so completely possest by the imaginary scene and character connect with it that i seem to be actually live among they everything bring they as it be before my eye and as the door of the dining-room open i almost expect to hear the feeble voice of master silence quaver forth he favorite ditty : ti merry in hall when beard wag all and welcome merry shrove-tide on return to my inn i could not but reflect on the singular gift of my poet to be able thus to spread the magic of he mind over the very face of nature to give to thing and place a charm and character not they own and to turn this working-day world into a perfect fairy land he be indeed the true enchanter whose spell operate not upon the sens but upon the imagination and the heart under the wizard influence of shakespeare i have be walk all day in complete delusion i have survey the landscape through the prism of poetry which tinge every object with the hue of the rainbow i have be surround with fancied being with mere airy nothing conjure up by poetic power yet which to I have all the charm of reality i have

believe have now become private property and be convert into fertile field except where the owner of estate have set out plantation the post-boy call the distance ten mile from nottingham he also aver that it be forbid to drive visitor within the gate so we leave the fly at the inn and set out to walk from the entrance to the house there be no porter 's lodge and the grounds in this outlying region have not the appearance of be very primly keep but be well wooded with evergreen and much overgrown with fern serve for cover for hare which scamper in and out of they hiding-place the road go wind gently along and at the distance of nearly a mile bring we to a second gate through which we likewise pass and walk onward a good way farther see much wood but as yet nothing of the abbey at last through the tree we catch a glimpse of its battlements and see too the gleam of water and then appear the abbey 's venerable front it comprise the western wall of the church which be all that remain of that fabric a great central window entirely empty without tracery or mullion the ivy clamber up on the inside of the wall and hang over in front the front of the inhabit part of the house extend along on a line with this church wall rather low with battlements along its top and all in good keep with the ruinous remnant we meet a servant who reply civilly to we inquiry about the mode of gain admittance and bid we ring a bell at the corner of the principal porch we ring accordingly and be forthwith admit into a low vaulted basement ponderously work with intersect arch dark and rather chilly just like what i remember to have see at battle abbey and after wait here a little while a respectable elderly gentlewoman appear of whom we request to be show round the abbey she courteously accede first present we to a book in which to inscribe we name i suppose ten thousand people three-fourths of they american have write description of newstead abbey and none of they so far as i have read give any true idea of the place neither will my description if i write one in fact i forget very much that i saw and especially in what order the object come in the basement be byron 's bath -- a dark and cold and cellar-like hole which it must have require good courage to plunge into in this region too or near it be the chapel which colonel wildman have decorously fit up and where service be now regularly perform but which be use as a dog ' kennel in byron 's time after see this we be lead to byron 's own bed-chamber which remain just as when he sleep in it -- the furniture and all the other arrangement be religiously preserve it be in the plainest possible style homely indeed and almost mean -- a ordinary paper-hanging and everything so commonplace that it be only the deep embrasure of the window that make it look unlike a bed-chamber in a middling-class lodging-house it would have seem difficult beforehand to fit up a room in that picturesque old edifice so that it should be utterly void of picturesqueness but it be effect in this apartment and i suppose it be a specimen of the way in which old mansion use to be rob of they antique character and adapt to modern taste before medieval antiquity come into fashion some print of the cambridge college and other picture indicate byron 's predilection at the time and which he himself have hang there be on the wall this the housekeeper tell we have be the abbot 's chamber in the monastic time adjoining it be the haunted room where the ghostly monk whom byron introduce into don juan be say to have he lurking-place it be fit up in the same style as byron 's and use to be occupy by he valet or page no doubt in he lordship 's day these be the only comfortable bedroom in the abbey and by the housekeeper 's account of what colonel wildman have do it be to be infer that the place must have be in a most wild shaggy tumble-down condition inside and out when he buy it it be very different now after show we these two apartment of byron and he servant the housekeeper lead we from one to another and another magnificent chamber fit up in antique style with oak paneling and heavily carve bedstead of queen elizabeth 's time or of the stuart hang with rich tapestry curtain of similar date and with beautiful old cabinet of carve wood sculpture in relief or tortoise-shell and ivory the very picture and reality these room be of stately comfort and they be call by the name of king -- king edward 's king charle ii 's king henry vii 's chamber and they be hang with beautiful picture many of they portrait of these king the chimney-piece be carve and emblazon and all so far as i could judge be in perfect keep so that if a prince or noble of three century ago be to come to lodge at newstead abbey he would hardly know that he have stray out of he own century and yet he might have know by some token for there be volume of poetry and light literature on the table in these royal bed-chamber and in that of henry vii i see the house of the seven gable and the scarlet letter in routledge 's edition certainly the house be admirably fit up and there must have be something very excellent and comprehensive in the domestic arrangement of the monk since they adapt themselves so well to a state of society entirely different from that in which they originate the library be a very comfortable room and provocative of studious idea tho lounging and luxurious it be long and rather low furnish with soft couch and on the whole tho a man might dream of study i think he would be most likely to read nothing but novel there i know not what the room be in monkish time but it be waste and ruinous in lord byron 's here i think the housekeeper unlock a beautiful cabinet and take out the famous skull which lord byron transform into a drinking-goblet it have a silver rim and stand but still the ugly skull be bare and evident and the naked inner bone receive the wine there be much more to see in the house than i have any previous notion of but except the two chamber already notice nothing remain the least as byron leave it yes another place there be -- he own small dining-room with a table of moderate size where no doubt the skull-goblet have often go its round colonel wildman 's dining-room be once byron 's shooting-gallery and the original refectory of the monk it be now magnificently arrange with a vaulted roof a music-gallery at one end suit of armor and weapon on the wall and mail arm extend hold candelabra we part with the housekeeper and i with a good many shilling at the door by which we enter and we next business be to see the private grounds and garden a little boy attend we through the first part of we progress but soon appear the veritable gardener -- a shrewd and sensible old man who have be very many year on the place there be nothing of special interest as concern byron until we enter the original old monkish garden which be still lay out in the same fashion as the monk leave it with a large oblong piece of water in the center and terraced bank rise at two or three different stage with perfect regularity around it so that the sheet of water look like the plate of a immense looking-glass of which the terrace form the frame it seem as if be there any giant large enough he might raise up this mirror and set it on end in the monk ' garden there be a marble statue of pan which the gardener tell we be bring by the wicked lord -lrb- great-uncle of byron -rrb- from italy and be suppose by the country people to represent the devil and to be the object of he worship -- a natural idea enough in view of he horn and cloven foot and tail tho this indicate at all event a very jolly devil there be also a female statue beautiful from the waist upward but shaggy and cloven-footed below and hold a little cloven-footed child by the hand this the old gardener assure we be pandora wife of the above-mentioned pan with she son not far from this spot we come to the tree on which byron carve he own name and that of he sister augusta it be a tree of twin stem -- a birch-tree i think -- grow up side by side one of the stem still live and flourish but that on which he carve the two name be quite dead as if there have be something fatal in the inscription that have make it for ever famous the name be still very legible altho the letter have be close up by the growth of the bark before the tree die they must have be deeply cut at first there be old yew-tree of unknown antiquity in this garden and many other interesting thing and among they may be reckon a fountain of very pure water call the holly well of which we drink there be several fountain besides the large mirror in the center of the garden and these be mostly inhabit by carp the genuine descendant of those which people the fishpond in the day of the monk come in front of the abbey the gardener show we the oak that byron plant now a vigorous young tree and the monument which he erect to he newfoundland dog and which be larger than most christian get be compose of a marble altar-shaped tomb surround by a circular area of step as much as twenty foot in diameter the gardener say however that byron intend this not merely as the burial-place of he dog but for himself too and he sister hucknall-torkard church -lrb- footnote : from gray day and gold by

summer day when have drive from nottingham i alighted in the market-place of the little town of hucknall-torkard on a pilgrimage to the grave of byron the town be modern and commonplace in appearance -- a straggle collection of low brick dwelling mostly occupy by collier on that day it appear at its worst for the widest part of its main street be fill with stall bench wagon and canvas-covered structure for the display of vegetable and other commodity which be thus offer for sale and it be throng with rough noisy dirty person intent on barter and traffic and not indispose to boisterous prank and mirth as they push and jostle each other among the crowded booth this main street terminate at the wall of the graveyard in which stand the little gray church wherein byron be bury there be a iron gate in the center of the wall and in order to reach this it be necessary to thread the maze of the marketplace and to push aside the canvas flap of a pedler 's stall which have be place close against it next to the churchyard wall be a little cottage with a bit of garden devote at that time to potato and there while wait for the sexton i talk with a aged man who say that he remember as a eye-witness the funeral of byron he state he age and say that he name be william callandyne point to the church he indicate the place of the byron vault i be the last man he say that go down into it before he be bury there i be a young fellow then and curious to see what be go on the place be full of skull and bone i wish you could see my son he be a clever lad only he ought to have more of the _ suaviter in modo _ thus with the garrulity of wander age he prattle on but he mind be clear and he memory tenacious and positive there be a good prospect from the region of hucknall-torkard church and point into the distance when he mind have be bring back to the subject of byron my aged interlocutor describe with minute specification of road and lane -- seem to assume that the name and the turning be familiar to I -- the course of the funeral train from nottingham to the church there be eleven carriage he say they do not go to the abbey -lrb- meaning newstead -rrb- but come directly here there be many people to look at they i remember all about it and i be a old man -- eighty-two you be a italian i should say he add by this time the sexton have come and unlock the gate and parting from mr callandyne we presently make we way into the church of st jame lock the churchyard gate to exclude rough and possibly mischievous follower a strange and sad contrast i think between this coarse turbulent place by a malign destiny ordain for the grave of byron and that peaceful lovely majestic church and precinct at stratford-upon-avon which enshrine the dust of shakespeare the sexton of the church of st jame and the parish clerk of hucknall-torkard be mr john brown and a man of sympathetic intelligence kind heart and interesting character i find he to be -- large dark stalwart but gentle alike in manner and feeling and considerate of he visitor the pilgrim to the literary shrine of england do not always find the neighbor inhabitant either sympathetic with he reverence or conscious of especial sanctity or interest appertaining to the relic which they possess but honest manly john brown of hucknall-torkard understand both the hallow charm of the place and the sentiment not to say the profound emotion of the traveler who now behold for the first time the tomb of byron the church have be considerably alter since byron be bury in it 1824 yet it retain its fundamental structure and its ancient peculiarity the tower a fine specimen of norman architecture dark ragged and grim give indication of great age it be of a kind often meet with in ancient english town you can see its brother at york shrewsbury canterbury worcester warwick and in many place sprinkle over the northern height of london but amid its tame surroundings in this little colliery settlement it loom with a peculiar frowning majesty a certain bleak loneliness both unique and impressive the edifice be of the customary crucial form -- a low stone structure have a peaked roof which be support by four great pillar on each side of the center aisle the ceiling which be make of heavy timber form almost a true arch above the nave there be four large window on each side of the nave and two on each side of the chancel which be beneath a roof somewhat lower than that of the main building under the pavement of the chancel and back of the altar rail -- at which it be my privilege to kneel while gaze upon this sacred spot -- be the grave of byron nothing be write on the stone that cover he sepulcher except the simple name of byron with the date of he birth and death in brass letter surround by a wreath of leaf in brass the gift of the king of greece and never do a name seem more stately or a place more hallowed the dust of the poet repose between that of he mother on he right hand and that of he ada -- sole daughter of my house and heart -- on he leave the mother die on August 1 1811 the daughter who have by marriage become the countess of lovelace in 1852 i bury she with my own hand say the sexton john brown when after a little time he rejoin I at the altar-rail i tell they exactly where he be lay when they want to put that brass on the stone i remember it well for i lower the coffin of the countess of lovelace into this vault and lay she by she father 's side and when presently we go into the vestry he produce the register of burial and display the record of that interment in the follow word : 1852 die at 69 cumberland pl london bury December 3 aged thirty-six -- curti jackson the byron be a short-lived race the poet himself have just turn thirty-six he mother be only forty-six when she pass away this name of curti jackson in the register be that of the rector or curate then incumbent but now depart a book have be keep for many year at the church of hucknall-torkard in which visitor desire to do so can write they name the first book provide for this purpose be a album give to the church by the poet sir john bowling and in that there be a record of visitation during the year from 1825 to 1834 the catalog of pilgrim to the grave of byron during the last eighty year be not a long one the votary of that poet be far less numerous than those of shakespeare custom have make the visit to stratford a property of easiness and shakespeare be a safe no less than a rightful object of worship the visit to hucknall-torkard be neither as easy nor as agreeable torkard be neither as easy nor as agreeable on the capital of a column near byron 's tomb i see two molder wreath of laurel which have hang there for several year one bring by the bishop of norwich the other by the american poet joaquin miller it be good to see they and especially to see they beside the tablet of white marble which be place on that church wall to commemorate the poet and to be she witness in death by he loving and beloved sister augusta mary leigh -- a name that be the synonym of noble fidelity a name that cruel detraction and hideous calumny have do they worst to tarnish that tablet name he the author of childe harold 's pilgrimage and if the conviction of thoughtful man and woman throughout the world can be accept as a authority no name in the long annals of english literature be more certain of immortality than the name of byron he reputation can afford the absence of all memorial to he in westminster abbey -- can endure it perhaps better than the english nation can -- and it can endure the neglect and censure of the precinct of nottingham that city rejoice in many interesting association but all that really hallow it for the stranger be its association with the name of byron the stranger will look in vain however for any adequate sign of he former connection with that place it be difficult even to find print or photograph of the byron shrine in the shop of

be give a livelier hue to the plaster in a corner-room of the basement where old michael johnson may be suppose to have sell book be now what we should call a dry-goods store or accord to the english phrase a mercer 's and haberdasher 's shop the house have a private entrance on a cross-street the door be accessible by several much worn stone-step which be border by a iron balustrade i set my foot on the step and lay my hand on the balustrade where johnson 's hand and foot must many a time have be and ascend to the door i knock once and again and again and get no admittance go round to the shop-entrance i try to open it but find it as fast bolt as the gate of paradise it be mortify to be so balk in one 's little enthusiasm but look round in quest of somebody to make inquiry of i be a good deal console by the sight of dr johnson himself who happen just at that moment to be sit at he ease nearly in the middle of st mary 's square with he face turn toward he father 's house of course it be almost fourscore year since the doctor lay aside he weary bulk of flesh together with the ponderous melancholy that have so long weigh he down -- the intelligent reader will at once comprehend that he be marble in he substance and seat in a marble chair on a elevated stone-pedestal in short it be a statue sculpture by luca and place here in 1838 at the expense of dr law the reverend chancellor of the diocese the figure be colossal -lrb- tho perhaps not much more so than the mountainous doctor himself -rrb- and look down upon the spectator from its pedestal of ten or twelve foot high with a broad and heavy benignity of aspect very like in feature to sir joshua reynold 's portrait of johnson but calmer and sweeter in expression several big book be pile up beneath he chair and if i mistake not he hold a volume in he hand thus blinking forth at the world out of he learn abstraction owl-like yet benevolent at heart the statue be immensely massive a vast ponderosity of stone not finely spiritualize nor indeed fully humanize but rather resemble a great stone-boulder than a man you must look with the eye of faith and sympathy or possibly you might lose the human be altogether and find only a big stone within you mental grasp on the pedestal be three bas-relief in the first johnson be represent as hardly more than a baby bestride a old man 's shoulder rest he chin on the bald head which he embrace with he little arm and listen earnestly to the high-church eloquence of dr sacheverell in the second tablet he be see ride to school on the shoulder of two of he comrade while another boy support he in the rear the third bas-relief possess to my mind a great deal of pathos to which my appreciative faculty be probably the more alive because i have always be profoundly imprest by the incident here commemorate and long ago try to tell it for the behoof of childish reader it show johnson in the market-place of uttoxeter do penance for a act of disobedience to he father commit fifty year before he stand bare-headed a venerable figure and a countenance extremely sad and wo-begone with the wind and rain driving hard against he and thus help to suggest to the spectator the gloom of he inward state some market-people and child gaze awe-stricken into he face and a aged man and woman with clapsed and uplifted hand seem to be pray for he these latter personage -lrb- whose introduction by the artist be none the less effective because in queer proximity there be some commodity of market-day in the shape of live duck and dead poultry -rrb- i interpret to represent the spirit of johnson 's father and mother lending what aid they could to lighten he half-century 's burden of remorse i have never hear of the above-described piece of sculpture before it appear to have no reputation as a work of art nor be i at all positive that it deserve any for I however it do as much as sculpture could under the circumstance even if the artist of the libyan sibyl have work it by revive my interest in the sturdy old englishman and particularly by freshen my perception of a wonderful beauty and pathetic tenderness in the incident of the penance the next day i leave lichfield for uttoxeter on one of the few purely sentimental pilgrimage that i ever undertake to see the very spot where johnson have stand boswell i think speak of the town -lrb- its name be pronounced yuteox ` eter -rrb- as be about nine mile off from lichfield but the county-map would indicate a greater distance and by rail pass from one line to another it be as much as eighteen mile i have always have a idea of old michael johnson send he literay merchandise by carrier 's wagon journey to uttoxeter afoot on market-day morning selling book through the busy hour and return to lichfield at night this could not possibly have be the case arrive at the uttoxeter station the first object that i see with a green field or two between they and I be the tower and gray steeple of a church rise among red-tiled roof and a few scattered tree a very short walk take you from the station up into the town it have be my previous impression that the market-place of uttoxeter lay immediately round about the church and if i remember the narrative aright johnson or boswell in he behalf describe he father 's book-stall as standing in the market-place close beside the sacred edifice it be impossible for I to say what change may have occur in the topography of the town during almost a century and a half since michael johnson retire from business and ninety year at least since he son 's penance be perform but the church have now merely a street of ordinary width pass around it while the market-place tho near at hand neither form a part of it nor be really contiguous nor would its throng and bustle be apt to overflow they boundary and surge against the churchyard and the old gray tower nevertheless a walk of a minute or two bring a person from the center of the market-place to the church-door and michael johnson might very conveniently have locate he stall and lay out he literary ware in the corner at the tower 's base better there indeed than in the busy center of a agricultural market but the picturesque arrangement and full impressiveness of the story absolutely require that johnson shall not have do he penance in a corner ever so little retired but shall have be the very nucleus of the crowd -- the midmost man of the market-place -- a central image of memory and remorse contrast with and overpower the petty materialism around he he himself have the force to throw vitality and truth into what person differently constitute might reckon a mere external ceremony and a absurd one would not have fail to see this necessity i be resolve therefore that the true site of dr johnson 's penance be in the middle of the market-place how strange and stupid it be that tradition should not have mark and keep in mind the very place how shameful -lrb- nothing less than that -rrb- that there should be no local memorial of this incident as beautiful and touch a passage as can be cite out of any human life no inscription of it almost as sacred as a verse of scripture on the wall of the church no statue of the venerable and illustrious penitent in the market-place to throw a wholesome awe over its earthliness its fraud and petty wrong of which the benumbed finger of conscience can make no record its selfish competition of each man with he brother or he neighbor its traffic of soul-substance for a little worldly gain such a statue if the piety of the people do not raise it might almost have be expect to grow up out of the pavement of its own accord on the spot that have be water by the rain that dript from johnson 's garment
