just be make plantation manager by he father well how be the honorable to-day say randolph approach from the doorway i do not think a congressman could be spare from washington but rarely especially when the papers say the country need such a lot of save oh this ` save the country ' talk go all right in the story book reply norton who exercise considerable influence over the youth through a long acquaintanceship and by frequently take he into he confidence but this country can take pretty good care of itself in congress we representative put the job of save it over on the senate and the senate hand back the job to we so what be everybody 's business be not anybody 's a fine scheme so long as we have a president who keep he hand off and do not -- but how about the speech and the bill break in randolph i think -- yes yes to be sure the congressman quickly add nearly all of we introduce these so-called reform bill when they be print at government expense we send copy carry free by the post-office department to we constituent and when we allow the bill to die in some committee we can always blame the committee but if there be a big fight by we constituent over the bill we let it pass the house but arrange to kill it in the senate then we do the same thing for the senator like in every other business my boy continue norton as he lead the way into the house it be a case of ` you tickle I and i 'll tickle you ' in politics and do not let any one fool you about the speech either they be pretty thing to mail to the voter but all the wise boy in washington know they be not mean seriously it be all play act and there be better actor in the senate than henry irving or edwin booth ever be i do not think my father look at thing in the way you do charlie no well maybe he do not now but he will later on when he take he seat in the senate if he be not wise enough to play around with the rest of the senator he will not get any bill pass especially any bill carry a appropriation or of any other particular importance what ejaculate the planter 's son do you mean to say that if father will not do what the other senator want he to do they will combine against he and destroy he usefulness make he powerless -- a failure the congressman smile patronizingly on the youth why of course they will that be politics practical politics the only kind that be know in washington you see -- but the leader of the great party cry the young plantation manager in amazement why do not they prevent this because they invent the system and because political party difference do not amount to a whole lot much of the time in washington the politician do most of they criticize of the other party away from washington where the voter can hear they but when circumstance sometimes force a man to rise to assail the other side in congress he afterward apologize in secret for he word or sometimes he apologize beforehand say : ` i have get to hand out some hot shot to you fellow just to please a crowd of sovereign voter from my district who have come up to washington to see I perform so of course i have get to make a show do not mind what i say you know i do not mean it but the old fogy will go back home and tell they neighbor what a rip-snortin ' reformer i be ' be that the way you represent you district norton ask planter langdon who at this juncture enter the room no no mr langdon -- i should say senator now i suppose i be merely tell randolph how some legislator conduct themselves the senator-elect pause momentarily gaze at the congressman who dark-visage tall black-haired broad-shouldered and athletic be visibly uneasy at have he conversation with randolph overhear by the father no doubt it will not be all plain sailing in washington for a old-fashioned man like I but i believe in the american people and the man they send to congress slowly speak the planter there be senator steven for instance he have always stand for the rights of the people i have read all he speech just why he bring about my election it be hard to tell for i have be a planter all my life except when i fight under beauregard i feel that he do it out of friendship and i simply can not say how much i appreciate the honor i be indebted to you too congressman tactfully disclaim any credit for he work only norton 's congressional training in repression enable he to refrain from smile at langdon 's innocence he belief in steven ' sincerity and he wonder over he election steven the keen cold and resourceful who force he officeholder to yield he part of they government salary steven who market to railway company he influence with the department of justice steven who be a republican in the committee room in washington and a democrat on the platform in mississippus steven who have consummate the deal with martin sander boss of seven county to elect langdon because of the planter 's trustfulness and simplicity of character which should make he easy to influence and to handle in the all-important matter of the gulf naval base project the entry of carolina langdon and she younger sister hope georgium give norton a welcome opportunity to shift the trend of conversation you lady will have a gay time in washington he begin after direct a particularly enthusiastic greet to carolina you will be in great demand at all the big affair and i do not

washington no charlie i could not forget you anyhow you will be there too i shall depend on you a great deal to take I about unless you be too busy make speech and fight you opponent again it be norton 's turn to be inwardly amuse at the political ignorance of the langdon family speech the first-term congressman do not make speech in washington because no one care what he think -- except the lobbyist whose business it be to provide new member with a complete set of thought neither do he have opponent -- he be not consider important enough by the veteran to be oppose skilfully approach the subject which next to carolina langdon have be uppermost in he mind during he visit norton ask the senator-elect on join he if he do not believe that the entire south would benefit if the plan to establish a naval base on the gulf be successfully carry through most certainly i do and as i say during the senatorial fight the whole country as well will be the gainer respond langdon do not you think the people who want altacoolum choose as the site have the best argument be the visitor 's next question the reply to which he anxiously await yes i do from what i have already hear but i have

the necessary qualification senator steven be in favor of altacoolum eagerly suggest norton yes and that be a pretty good argument in its favor respond langdon norton now excuse himself plead a appointment with a client at a neighbor village wave farewell to carolina and hope georgium who stand at a window he ride away the old man be sure to be all right he mutter he lean toward altacoolum and believe in steven he 'll lean some more until he fall over -- into the trap there be a fortune in sight -- within reach langdon have faith in he friend he will not suspect a thing still another

its first senator since 1885 no less a personage than the hon william h langdon of mississippus say to be a warm personal friend of senator steven one of the lead member of he party at the capital have engage a suit of room for himself and two daughter be not it the limit remark the chief clerk to bud haine correspondent of the new york _ star _ the senator write we that he be come here because he old friend the late senator moseley say back in '75 that this be the best hotel in washington and where all the prominent man ought to stay haine the ablest political reporter in washington have come to the international to interview the new senator to describe for he paper what kind of a citizen langdon be he glance around at the dingy woodwork the worn cushion the nick and uneven tile of the hotel lobby and smile at the clerk well if this be the new senator 's idea of princely luxury he will fit right into the senatorial atmosphere both laugh derisively by the way add haine i suppose you 'll raise you rate now that you have get a senator here the clerk bring he fist down on the register with a thud we could have they every day if we want they this fellow though we 'll have all winter i guess he son 's here now be break all record for drinking congressman norton of mississippus have be down here with he a few time there young langdon be now haine turn quickly just in time to bump into a tall slender young man who be walk unevenly in the direction of the café well can not you see what you be do mutter the tall young man thickly haine smile the chap who have play halfback four year on he college eleven and hold the boxing championship in he class be apt to be good-natured he do not have to take offense easily besides randolph langdon be plainly under the influence of whisky so haine smile pleasantly at the taller young man beg you pardon -- my fault haine say well do not let it occur again mumble langdon as he stroll with uneven dignity toward the door bud haine laugh i guess young langdon be go to be one of the boy be not he he be already one of they when it come to a question of fluid capacity laugh some one behind he and bud whirl to meet the gaze of he friend dick gullen representative of one of the big chicago daily you down here to see langdon too comment bud cullen nod queer roost where this senator be to hang out be not it he can not be a rich one then suggest haine cullen chuckle perhaps he be a honest one i have not think of that you always be original dickie comment haine dryly by the way what do you know about he nothing except that the _ evening call _ print a picture of he eldest daughter -- say she be the queen daughter of the south a famous beauty rich planter for a father mother leave she a fortune -- she 'll cut quite a social caper with this hotel 's name on she card will not she break in haine as he lead cullen to a seat to await the expect legislator whose train be late i do not know very much about he myself say haine all i have be able to discover be that steven say the word which elect he and that look bad great glory when i think what a senator of the right sort have a chance to do here in washington -- a nonpartisan straight-out-from-the-shoulder man he pause to shake he head in disgust you know these fellow here in the senate do not even see they chance why if you and i do not do any more to hold we job than they do we would be fire by wire the first day they know just the old political game that be all its a great game though bud sigh cullen longingly for like many newspaper man he have the secret feeling that he be cut out to be a great politician sure it be a great game as a game agree haine so be bridge and stud poker and three-card monte and flim-flam generally take this new man langdon for instance choose by steven he 'll probably be perfectly obedient perfectly easy go perfectly blind and -- perfectly useless what be want now be to get the work do not play the game thoroughly a cynic through he year of experience as a newspaper man which have show the inside workings of many important phase of the seemingly conventional life of this complex world cullen pretend unbounded enthusiasm hear hear he shout all you earnest citizen come vote for reformer haine i be for you bud what do i get in you cabinet i have join the reformer too and like all of they I for p-u-r-i-t-y as long as she give I a meal ticket but not even cullen could make haine consider he view on the necessity of political regeneration to be ridiculous he optimism could not be snuff out for he be a genuine believer that the natural tendency of humankind be to do right wrong he believe to be the outcome of unnatural cause this quality combine with he practical knowledge of the world and he courage make he a formidable man one who would one day accomplish big thing -- if he get the chance you know you can not shut I up dick be he response to cullen 's oratorical flight i be go to have my say i do not see why a senator should not be honest all i want they to do be to play a new game let 'em at least seem to be honest attend to they business forget politics the country send they here to work and if they do the work the people really do not care a hang what party they belong to come out of it bud you brain be wabbly yawn cullen wearily i 'll buy a drink if you 'll quiet down let 's be comfortable till this fellow langdon appear he catch he friend by the arm and in spite of protest drag he off to the café just as young langdon and congressman norton come down through the lobby though but few year older than randolph langdon charle norton have long exercise strong influence over he because of he wider experience in the world 's affair like he father young langdon have stay close to the plantation most of he life particularly after leave school devote he attention to study the business of conduct the family 's big estate norton bring he the atmosphere of the big outside world he yearn to see even as do he sister carolina and he imitate norton 's manners he dress and mode of speech the congressman 's habit of confide in randolph a subtle compliment be deeply appreciate by the lad who unconsciously become a continual advertiser of norton 's many virtue to carolina and to he father all of which the congressman know that norton 's political career be the outcome of carolina langdon 's ambition to shine in gay society be know to he friend as well as he family and he desire to win she and place she where she could satisfy every whim have develop almost to a frenzy see evidence of senator steven ' vast influence he do not hesitate to seek a close relationship with he and the senator be clever enough to lead norton to consider he he friend at the start of he political career norton have higher idea of honor than guide he action now that he have become a part of the political machine that control he native state of mississippus and of the bipartisan combination that dominate both house of congress in the interest of the great railway and industrial corporation senator steven and other power have so distorted norton 's view of the difference between public and private interest and they respective rights that he have come to believe captial to be the sacred heritage of the nation which must be protect at any cost the acceptance of a retainer from the c st and p railroad company for wholly unnecessary service in washington -- only another way of buy a man -- a transaction arrange by senator steven be but another stage in the disintegration of the young congressman 's character but it bring he just that much closer to the point where he could claim carolina langdon as he own and opportunity do not knock twice at a man 's door -- unless he be at the head of the machine norton the persevere young law student who love the girl who have be he boyhood playmate be now norton who covet she father 's land who boast that he be on the inside in washington who be on the way to fortune -- if the new senator from mississippus would or could be force to stand in favor of the altacoolum naval base he conversation with randolph langdon as haine and cullen see they pass through the hotel lobby illustrate the nature of the norton of the present and he interest in the altacoolum scheme there be no reason why you should not come in on the ground floor in this proposition randolph he be urge in continuance of the conversation begin over a table in the café no reason why you should not do it my boy why be you still a child or be you really a man you have now draft for $ 50000 have not you yeah agree langdon chagrin at norton 's insinuation of youthfulness and anxious to prove that he be really a man of affair i have get the fifty thousand charlie but -- but you see that be the money for improvement on the plantation as father have put I in as manager i want to make a show you can not make it until spring urge norton the money 's get to lie in the bank all winter now why do not you make a hundred thousand with it instead of let it lie idle be not that simple the younger man 's eye open wide and he imagination stimulate by the special brand of bourbon whisky norton have order for he take rapid bound one hundred thousand you mean i could make a hundred thousand with my fifty between now and spring sure as a nigger like gin reply norton confidently how asked langdon the young congressman lean over confidentially this be under you hat randolph you can keep quiet langdon nod eagerly then put it into altacoola land the naval base gasp langdon norton nod now you have hit it the government will select altacoolum for a naval base then land will jump ` way up to never and you 'll clean up a hundred thousand at the least be not it simple there be a thousand people with money who would just love to have this chance and i be give it to you because of we friendship i want to do you a good turn i have get my money in there young langdon be visibly impressed you have always -- treated I right charlie you have be for I i know but suppose the government do not select altacoolum gulf city 's in the run norton laugh sarcastically gulf city be a big bunch of mud flat besides i 'll tell you something else just between we remember he wait for the boy 's eager nod before he go on the big man be behind altacoola standard steel want altacoolum and what standard steel want from congress you can bet you bottom dollar standard steel get they know they business at no 10 broadway now then be you satisfied randolph be more than satisfied already he feel himself rich and honestly rich too for norton have convince he that there be no reason why he should not use the $ 50000 of he father 's when it have to lie in the bank anyhow all winter and he would have it back in time to use on the plantation in the spring when it be need how proud of he he father would be when he show he a clear profit of $ 100000 i 'll go get the draft at once charlie and i be mighty much oblige to you he say with gratitude in he voice norton 's smile be one of deep satisfaction that be all right randolph you know i want to do anything i can for you randolph be start for he room when haine and cullen turn sharply around the corner of the hotel desk again bud and the young southerner accidentally collide where be you go can not you look out blurt langdon haine grin guess it be you fault this time oh it be be it irritably reply randolph who as the young marse have be accustom to considerable deference on the plantation well take that he angrily cry aim a savage swing at haine the reporter 's athletic training prove of ready service dodge under the clenched fist he turn dexterously seize young langdon 's outstretch wrist and bent the arm down over he -lrb- haine ' -rrb- shoulder as though to throw the young attacker with the wrestler 's fly mare langdon be helpless as haine have also secure he free hand but instead of complete the throw the reporter walk away with he foe hold securely on he back -- to put he to bed a kindly service in view of randolph 's mental state from across the lobby charle norton have watch randolph 's discomfiting encounter with haine with amusement now that i have get the young fellow to sew up he old man 's money in altacoola land he chuckle reckon senator william h langdon will not see anything wrong with that same noble tract of universe when he come to vote for the naval base senator steven will be pleased chapter iv just the man we need as bud haine return from young langdon 's room where he have leave the latter in bed with a towel fill with crack ice around he head he see two familiar figure stand in a secluded corner of the lobby they be talk

other commercial organization meet with very little protest in washington that he deserve the title frequently use in refer to he boss of the senate none would deny who have knowledge of the inner workings of the senate and the various committee senator peabody be very affable to the reporter especially to those of haine ' stamp who have never accept any favor from he and who oppose he method he aim to win the friendship of these opponent by diplomacy -- as he have find that reporter of the haine sort could not be influence by money he consider a reporter who would take a bribe as a constructive conservative member of society and frequently regret that so many of the correspondent send to washington could not be buy nor have bill they want pass or defeat he extend he hand to haine as steven conclude and say warmly : of course i know the representative of the _ morning star _ how do you do haine i wonder if we be not all here on the same errand suggest the newspaper man

you i be for the naval base for altacoolum suggest steven langdon hesitate peabody and steven watch he as eagle watch they prey from the mountain crag well it look to I like altacoolum ought to be a fine site but the actual place be not so important to I i tell you gentleman he say in impressive seriousness that ring with sturdy american manhood -- i tell you that what be important be that the great sweeping curve of the gulf shall hold some of those white ship of ours to watch over the indy and the canal and to keep a eye on south america and right there on we own southern coast i want these ship build and equip and the gun cast and the man find to man they i want the south to have she part in the nation 's defense i want she to have this great naval city as the living proof that there be again just one country -- the united state -- and the north and the south both have forgive senator peabody clap the new member on the back good he exclaim you have get to make some speech like that we 'll have you as the orator for the naval base langdon 's eye open wide orator he gasp I a orator why that be oratory good oratory exclaim steven with enthusiasm huh grunt the planter you call that oratory why that be only the truth we 'll see that you do some more of it then laugh peabody remember we count on you for the naval base for rural simplicity he be perfection whisper peabody to steven as they leave the planter he be a living picture of innocence we 'll push he forward and let he do the talk for the naval affair committee hide behind he we could put through almost any kind of a proposition once more do the senior senator from mississippus acquiesce chapter vi new friend -- and a old enemy langdon gaze at the two depart senator with varied emotion he sit down to think over what they have say and to carefully consider what manner of man be peabody who show such a interest in he he realize that he would have considerable intercourse with peabody in the process of legislation and finally have to admit to himself that he do not like the senator from pennsylvanium just what it be langdon could not at this time make certain but he be mystify by trace of contradiction in the senator 's character -- slight trace true but trace nevertheless peabody 's cordiality and sympathy be to langdon 's mind partly genuine and partly false just what be the cause of or the necessity for the alloy in the true metal he could not fathom he talk with these famous lawmaker be unsatisfactory also in that it have convey to langdon the suggestion that the senate be not primarily a great forum for the general and active consideration of weighty measure and of national policy it have be he idea that the senate be primarily such a forum but the attitude of peabody and steven have hint to he that there be matter of individual interest that outweigh public or national consideration for instance they be anxious that altacoolum should have the naval base regardless of the claim or merit of any other section that be unusual puzzling to langdon moreover it be poor business yet there be able business man in the senate not one of they would for instance think of buy a site for a factory until he have investigate many possible location and then select the most favorable one why be it he ponder that the business of the great united state of america be not conduct on business line he must study the whole question intelligently that be imperative he must have advice help to whom be he to go for it steven yes he old friend who know all the rope yet even steven seem different in washington than steven in mississippus here he play second fiddle he be even obsequious langdon have observe to peabody in mississippus he be a leader and a strong one too but senator langdon have not yet learn of the many fount from which political strength and political leadership may be gain what he finally decide on be the engaging of a secretary but he must be one with knowledge of political operation one who combine wisdom with honesty such a aid could prevent langdon from make the many mistake that invariably mark the new man in politics and he could point out the most effective mode of procedure under give circumstance it might prove difficult to find a man of the necessary qualification who be not already employ but in the meantime langdon would watch the playing of the game himself and make he own deduction as best he could the senator start toward the hotel desk to ask regard the whereabouts of he son randolph when he attention be catch by the sight of three powerful negro porter endeavor to thrust outdoors a threadbare old man the victim 's flow white hair white mustache and military bearing receive short shrift come along colonel yo ' can not

well i start up there with general lee once respond langdon reminiscently but we change we mind and come back you may have hear about that trip haine admit that he have since that time go on langdon i

well sir you have something to live for i 'll make it my special business to personally conduct you through one mardi gra with a special understanding of course that you do not print anything in the paper i be a vestryman in my church but since misfortune have come upon we state i have to be careful haine search he brain he know of no grave calamity that have happen recently in mississippus misfortune he question senator langdon nod -lrb- illustration : from new york eh the vicksburg of the north -rrb- yes sir the great old state of mississippus go prohibition at the last election i do

the country mr haine suddenly to find that you state have call on you -- a flavor of sarcasm come into haine ' reply the office seek the man he could not help the slight sneer be a man never to admit that he have seek the office haine know only too well of the arduous work necessary to secure nomination for high office in convention and to win a election to the senate from a state legislature in almost every case he know the candidate must make a dozen different deal to secure vote might promise the same office to two or three different leader force other into line by threat send a trust agent to another with a roll of bank bill -- the recipient of which would immediately conclude that this candidate be the only man in the state who could save the nation from destruction have not haine see man who have sell they unsuspecting delegate for cash to the highest bidder rise in the convention hall and in impassioned dramatic voice exclaim in praise of the buyer gentleman it would be a cry shame a crime against civilization if the choose representative of we grand old state of -- do not go on record in favor of such a man such a true citizen such a inspired patriot as he whose name i be about to mention so the reporter may be forgive for the ironical tinge in he hasty interruption of the new senator 's remark langdon could not suppress a chuckle at the doubt note in haine ' attitude i think the man would be pretty small potato who would not seek the office of united state senator mr haine he say if he could get it when i be a young man sir politics in the south be a career for a gentleman and i still can not see how he could be better engage than in the service of he state or he country that be right agree the reporter further impress by the frank sincerity of the mississippian the only condition in my mind mr haine be that the man should ask himself searchingly whether or not he be competent to give the service but i seem to be talk a good deal suppose we get to the interview expect you time be short we would better begin i think we be in the interview smile the correspondent in it exclaim langdon well if this be it it be not so bad i see you use a painless method when i be down in vicksburg a reporter back I up in a corner slip he hand in he hip pocket and pull out a list of question just three foot four inch long he want to know what i think concern the tariff on aluminium hydrate and how i stand about the opening of the tento pu reservation of the comanche indian and what be my idea about the differential rate of haul from the missourus river he be a wonder that fellow kinder out of place on a mississippus paper i start to offer he a job but he be so proud i be afraid he would not accept it however it give you my idea of a reporter if you have be against that i ought to thank you for talk to I laugh haine then you do not want to know anything about that sort of stuff say langdon with a huge sigh of relief no senator be the amuse reply i think generally if i know what sort of a man a man be i can tell a great deal about what he will think on various question langdon start interestedly you mean mr haine if you know whether i be honest or not you can fit I up with a set of view be that the idea seem to I you be the sort of man i be look for the other smilingly shake he head i would not dare fix up a united state senator with a set of view he say i only mean that i think what a man be be important i have be do washington for a number of year i have have a exceptional opportunity to see how politics work i do not believe in party politics i do not believe in party but i do believe in man langdon nod approvingly then a twinkle shone in he eye we do not believe in party in mississippus he drawl we have only one -- the democratic party -- and a few kicker haine grin broadly at this description of southern politics what be this you be say about national politics continue the mississippian i be a beginner you know and i be always ready to learn this be a new thing -- a reporter teach a senator politics laugh haine senator langdon join in the merriment i reckon reporter could teach united state senator lot of thing mr haine if the senator have sense enough to go to school now i come up here on a platform the chief principle of which be the naval base for the gulf now how be we go to put that through my state want it you be probably sure it will be a wonderful thing for the country and the south suggest haine of course but why do you think most of the congressman and senator will vote for it the southerner take off he hat lean back and gaze across the lobby thoughtfully seem to I the benefit to the south and country would be sufficient reason mr haine he finally reply the newspaper man 's brain work rapidly go over the entire conversation with langdon and what he have see of he he be certain that the mississippian believe what he say -- that moreover the belief be deeply root he long newspaper training have educate haine in the way of man they action and mental process -- what naturally to expect from a give set of circumstance he feel a grow regard a affection for this unassuming old man before he who do not know and probably would be slow to understand the hypocrisy the cunning trickery of lawmaker who unmake law sufficient reason for you senator haine add you have not be in politics very long have you he query dryly a wry smile wrinkle the mississippian 's face be in long enough to learn some unpleasant thing i do not know before he remember martin sander will you allow I to tell you a few more ask haines langdon incline he head in acquiescence reckon i would better know the worst and get through with it well then senator somebody from nebraska will vote for what you want in the way of the naval base because he 'll think then you 'll help he demand money to dredge some muddy creek that he have a interest in somebody in pennsylvanium will vote for it because he owe a grudge and want to hurt the philadelphium ship people you 'll get the democrat because it be for the south but if you bill be for the west coast they might fight it tooth and nail even with the japanese fleet cruise dangerously near and the republican may vote for it because they see a chance to claim glory and perhaps break the solid south in the next presidential campaign you catch the idea what exclaim the astounded langdon well who in hade will vote for it because it be for the good of the united state he gasp i believe you will senator reply haine with ready confidence chapter viii how senator langdon get a secretary langdon lean over and seize the arm of he interviewer see here young man why be not you in politics he say too busy senator reply haine besides i like the newspaper game game query langdon oh i use the word in a general sense senator reply haine pretty much everything be a ` game ' -- society politics newspaper work business of every sort man and woman

here and listen to what a hard task you old father have get say the mississippian to he daughter whom he present to haine with a picturesque flourish reminiscent of the pride and chivalry of the old south he have the idea that those new yorker who read he paper would actually like to know something about I hope georgium steal many glance at the reporter as he talk with she father he make a deep impression on she young mind she have spend almost all she life on the plantation she father provide she with a private tutor instead of send she to boarding-school where she elder sister have be educate owe to the death of she mother the planter have desire to keep hope georgium at home for companionship this good-looking clean-cut well-built young man who be take so big and so active a part of the world 's work bring to she the atmosphere that she spirit crave he give one a impression of ability of earnestness of sincerity and she be glad that she father approve of he hope georgium by the same token do not escape the attention of the interviewer she appealing charm of face and figure be accentuate by she daintiness and a fleeting suggestion of naïveté in poise and expression when she be amuse he first glance reveal to haine that she eye be gray the gray that people say indicate the possessor to have those priceless quality -- the quality that make the sweetest woman true that make the maiden 's eye in truth the window of she soul the quality that make woman womanly she sit close to she father she hand in he listen intently to the unfold of a story of what to she be a mysterious world -- the man 's world the strong man 's world -- which many a woman would give she all to enter and play a part therein what else have you against a political career mr haine go on the senator take up they conversation well my age for one thing i have not any gray hair langdon wave this objection aside i might arrange to pool age with you sometimes i think we want young man in politics like you the reporter shake he head old in age and young in politics like you senator langdon he reply politics i sometimes think be pure hypocrisy and sometimes something worse a man get disgusted with the trickery and dishonesty and corruption then drawl langdon the thing to do be to jump in and stop it i read in the newspaper a great deal about corruption the gentleman in national politics whom i have have the honor of know -- senator moseley a intimate friend of thirty year my present colleague senator steven and other -- have be as honest as the day be long but the day do get short in November when congress meet do not they laugh haine rise i be afraid i have take too much of you time and i seem to have talk a lot langdon be amuse do look like i would be interview you i

it be a splendid idea dad just great will not you come mr haine we -- eh -- i -- i know my father would like to have you as he stand before he two new-found friend -- for such haine now consider the mississippian and he daughter -- he could not suppress feeling of surprise tinge with uncertainty he have like other newspaper man receive offer of employment from politician who desire to increase they influence with the press sometimes the salary offer have be large the work so light that the reporter could earn the money and yet retain he newspaper position a scantily disguised species of bribery which have wreck the career of several promising reporter well know to haine young man who have be thus lead into sell they column by unscrupulous machine dictator haine know that the mississippian have no ulterior purpose to serve in he offer yet he must have time to think over the proposal i thank you senator he finally say i appreciate the opportunity come from you but i have never think of give up the newspaper profession it be a fascinating career one that i be too fond of to leave langdon start to reply when a delightfully modulate southern voice interrupted : father i have be out with mr spangler to look for some other room i do not like this hotel and i find some that i do like haine turn to see a handsomely gown young woman who have the stamp of a patrician 's daughter in she bearing and she countenance -- a brunette with delicate feature though determination shone in she eye and appear in the self-contained poise of she head she be the imperious type of beauty and suggest to haine the dry point etching of paul helleu he instinctively conceive she to be intensely ambitious and of this haine be soon to have unexpected evidence gaze at she with a sense of grow admiration haine give a involuntary start as senator langdon speak my daughter miss carolina langdon mr haine say the senator carolina be interested be you the newspaper man who be interview father i hope you 'll do a nice one we want he to be a successful and popular senator we would like to help he if we could the correspondent bow i should say you certainly would help he to be a popular senator he declare emphatically fail to notice that hope georgium be somewhat annoyed at the enthusiasm display over she elder sister in fact hope georgium be suffer a partial if not total eclipse i be leave it to mr haine to put down the thing i ought to say break in the senator he know yes he know everything about washington carolina exclaim hope georgium spiritedly the older girl speak eagerly i wish you would interview I mr haine ask I how i like washington i feel as though i must tell some one just how much i do like it it be too wonderful i would like mighty well to interview you miss langdon enthusiastically exclaim haine i hope you will some time mr haine remark carolina as she say good-by watch she as she turn away haine see she extend a warm greet to congressman charle norton who have advance toward the group -lrb- illustration : strange how the langdon treat he as a friend -rrb- strange how the langdon treat he as a friend -- intimate one too he think what if they should learn of norton 's questionable operation at the capitol of he connection with two unsavory ` deal ' one of which result in a amendment to the pure food law so that manufacturer of a valueless ` consumption cure ' could continue to mislead the victim of the ` white plague ' norton who have utter a epigram now celebrate in the tap-room of washington ` the path of glory lead but to the graft ' miss langdon be very beautiful and attractive sir say haine resume with the senator yes drawl the mississippian girl in the south generally be well i must be go i 'll think about you secretaryship senator langdon perhaps i can find some one wish you would think about it for yourself observe the senator while hope georgium again nod approval it would be a hard job there be so many matter of political detail about which i be sadly inexperienced that really most of the work would fall on the secretary bud haine pause again he think over langdon 's offer its genuineness appeal to he suddenly there dawn on he a idea of just what it might mean to be associate with this honest old citizen who have ask for he help -- who need it as haine know only too well he would be the senator 's guide and confidant -- he adviser in big matter why he would practically be unite state senator himself he know the inside as few other in washington here be a chance to match he wit against that of peabody the boss of the senate a chance to spoil some of the dishonest scheme of those who be adroitly play the game he could bother too the intriguing member of the third house as the lobbyist be call he could direct a lightning bolt into the camp of andy corrigan who claim the honor of be speaker of the third house these thought crowd into he mind then too he would become practically a member of the langdon family and have association with the two charming daughter -- with carolina langdon it would be a great chance he murmur half aloud next thing to be a senator the old mississippian hear the young man 's word i reckon it would he drawl in agreement you feel sure you want I urge the other langdon chuckle i ask you he say haine come abruptly to decision i have think it over senator and it seem to I it will be a great chance in every way i 'll accept we 'll fix it up to-morrow and i 'll try to make you a good secretary langdon hold forth he hand and i 'll try to make you a good senator my boy fix up nothing to-morrow you duty begin to-night you be to come to dinner with I and my daughter chapter ix a new kind of political partnership the combination of the force of langdon and haine do not find much favor among the power that be -- at the capitol senator peabody peremptorily demand a explanation from steven as to how he have allow he senator to engage as he secretary this inquisitive man haine a reporter who do not know he place here we have put langdon on naval affair because we know he do not understand what be go on and you steven suppose to be the finish product of the political mill _ you _ fall asleep and let he take up a man whom nobody can control one who know the inside workings of washington and who will take par-tic-u-lar pleasure in teach you fellow mississippian far too much for we good steven ' reply to effect that probably haine would consent to be take care of if judiciously approach be deride by the observant peabody a young reformer grow fat on notoriety he laugh and think what a scandal he would have for he newspaper if we take a chance on disclose we hand to he no no steven we must have he watch and try to discredit he in some way perhaps we can make langdon believe that he secretary be dishonest congressman norton be another man who be dismay at the formation of the firm of langdon and haine young randolph too could not forget the defeat and humiliation he have previously suffer at haine ' hand and grow more bitter as the reporter 's influence over he father grow stronger but haine ' most effective enemy have arise in the person he would be the last to suspect one whom he unceasingly admire one whose very word he have come to cherish and possibly it be not all she own fault that carolina langdon have enlist she service subtle and quite overwhelming -lrb- owe to haine ' fervent worship of she -rrb- against the secretary perhaps the social system of which she have become a part in washington have something to do with the craving to become a leader in that fascinating world whose dazzling variety and infinite diversion seem to fill she soul with all that it yearn for love she have for she have now promise to wed congressman norton she love he fondly she have confess to he and gradually she come to work desperately against haine who she have be convince by norton and randolph would prove a stumbling-block to they to she father to herself in she career at the capital if he influence over the senator should be permit to exist or to increase and so on the surface carolina langdon be most amiable to the secretary encourage he in he attention to she lead he surely into she power norton have prevail on she to keep the knowledge of they engagement secret from every one even she father the day and night become fill with important work for senator langdon and he secretary together they go over the important measure outline what appear to be the best course of procedure and carry it into effect as far as possible langdon become a prominent figure in the senate owe to he consistent support of measure that fit in with the public policy or what should be the public policy of the nation he have learn that the only practicable way to outwit or to cope with the member of the dominate machine make up he be surprise to see of member of both the party -- the only two in washington -- be to oppose what the machine want with enough power to force it to grant he what he believe the public ought to have he be describe by some of the hide-bound insider on capitol hill as the only brainy man who have fight the machine in thirty year at the home he have later establish in washington as preferable to the international hotel be frequently see a small coterie of senator and congressman who have become know to the sarcastic party boss in both house of congress as the langdon crowd which crowd be admit to be somewhat a factor when it finally prevail on the president to take over 11000 postmaster from the appointment class and put they under the control of the civil service commission result in the necessity of a competitive examination for these postmaster instead of they secure position through political favoritism those who do not know langdon intimately suggest that this fellow ought to be ` take care of ' what in god 's name do he want a committee chairmanship a ambassadorship for some mississippus charcoal burner a couple of federal judgeship for he friend well whatever it be give it to he and get he in with the rest of we again it be peabody who have the decide say there be only one thing worse than a young reformer and that be a old one he laugh bitterly at a secret conclave at he apartment in the luxurious loui napoleon hotel the young one think he be go to live and want we future profit for himself the old one think he be go to die and he be sore at leave so much graft behind he head and heart think and throb together langdon and he secretary have learn to lean on each other the young gain inspiration from the old the old gain strength from the young they love each other and more than any love they trust one another and hope georgium watch it all and rejoice for she believe with all the accrue erudition of eighteen year of innocent girlhood that mr bud haine be quite the finest specimen of young manhood this world have ever produce how could he have happen she be sure that she have never meet he equal not even in that memorable week she have spend in jackson the pass week teach haine that he be deeply in love with carolina and though he have endeavor to keep the knowledge of this from she she woman 's intuition have tell she he secret and she stifle the momentary regret that flit into she mind because she be now in the game herself the washington game that ensnare the woman as well as the man and make she a slave to its fancy no one but herself and norton know how deeply she have plunge on a certain possible turn of the political card she must not she could not lose if life itself be to remain of value to she and on she sway over this secretary she be tell it all depend a subject that for some unexplained reason frequently lodge in haine ' mind be that of the apparent assiduity with which mrs spangler cultivate senator langdon 's friendship for several year she have occupy a high social position at the capital he well know but various indefinite intangible rumor he have hear he could not state exactly where have make he regret she grow intimacy with the girl and with the senator they have meet she through letter of introduction of the most trustworthy and assure character from people of highest social rank in virginium where the langdon have many friend but even so haine realize people who write introductory letter be sometimes thoughtless in consider all the circumstance of the party they introduce and resident of virginium who have not be in the capital for year might be forgive for not know of all the more recent development in the life of those they know in washington while not wish to have the senator know of he intention the secretary determine to investigate mr spangler and she present mode of life at he first opportunity hope the while that he quest would reveal she to be what the langdon consider she -- a widow of wealth fashion and reserve who reside at the capital because the memory of she late husband a former congressman of high standing be associate with it call at the langdon ' house one evening in February to receive direction regard important work for the next day haine be somewhat puzzle at the peculiar smile on the senator 's face answer the secretary 's look of inquiry the mississippian say : i have be tell that i can name the new holder of a five-thousand-dollar-a-year position in the department of commerce and labor and that if i have no one in particular from my state to name -- that -- that you would be a good man for the job first i be glad for you sake my boy for if you want it you could have the position but on think it over it seem there might be something behind it not show on the surface it be a trick say haine who make the offer senator steven i might have know hotly respond the secretary there be a crowd that want you and I separated thought this bait too much for I to resist do they then he pause rub he finger through he hair in a perplexed manner strange be not it senator that a man of you party be offer this desirable piece of patronage entirely unsolicited on you part from the administration of another a different political party especially when that other party have so many hungry would-be ` tax eater ' clamoring to enter the ` land of milk and honey ' i think steven deliberately -- there there bud break in langdon you must not say anything against senator steven to I true he associate with some folk i do not approve of but that do not necessarily mean anything wrong and i myself have always find he thoroughly honest yes mutter the secretary follow the senator into the library you have always find he honest because you think everybody 's honest -- but steven be just the doctor who will cure you of this ailment -- this chronic trustfulness haine laugh softly when peabody 's little stevie get through hacking at the prostrate body of political purity he two-handed sword of political corruption will need new edge thus far neither the senator nor he secretary have suspicion of any questionable deal in regard to the gulf naval base the rush of other event particularly the fight over the reduction of the tariff have push this project temporarily into the background so far as they be concern though the boss of the senate and he satellite have be lose no time in perfect they plan regard the choice of altacoolum as the site peabody and steven have ingeniously exploit langdon at every possible opportunity in relation to the naval base ask about new development in the committee on naval affair the ready answer be : better see senator langdon he know all about the naval base have the matter in full charge i really know little about it so by hide behind the unsuspecting old hero of crawfordsville they divert from themselves any possible suspicion and place langdon where he would have to bear the brunt of the great scandal that would they well know come out at some future time -- after they foul conspiracy against the nation have be consummate after the fruit of they betrayal have be secure what after all the schemer conclude be the little matter of a investigation among senator to guilty senator who deeply verse in the law have destroy every compromise document that could be admissible as evidence why the senate would appoint a investigate committee and investigate itself would it not when the ridiculous scandal come and what senator would fear himself or for himself as he investigate himself when the blame have already be put publicly on some one else some simple-minded old soul who could go back to he cotton field in mississippus and forget all about it strong in he innocence even though shear of reputation and desire to live chapter x when senator disagree the wiseacre of washington have nightly predict that the site of the hundred-million-dollar gulf naval base would be decide on in march after the excitement and gayety attend the presidential inauguration have subside on the morning of the day before this action of the committee on naval affair be to be take secretary haine sit at he desk in senator langdon 's committee room in the capitol richard cullen the favorite associate of haine in he journalistic day out earlier than usual on he daily round of the department for news for he chicago paper have stroll in and attempt a few of he characteristic cynicism haine usually find they entertaining but these be direct at senator langdon now let I tell you something dick the secretary answer firmly do not you work off all you dyspeptic idea in this neighborhood my senator be a great man they can not appreciate he up here because he be honest -- crystal clear i use to think i know what a decent citizen a real man ought to be but he be teach I some new thing he 'll teach they all something before he get through cullen hang one leg over haine ' desk you be a nice quiet gentlemanly little optimist and i like you old fellow retort cullen but do not deceive yourself too much you senator langdon be personally one of the best ever but he be bear a mark and a mark he 'll be to the end of time he look good now sure i like he speech and all that but just wait when some of those old fox in the senate want to put he head in the bag and tie it down they will not have any trouble at all smile haine look up at he cynical friend the bag 'll have to go over my head too he say with a nod well i do not know that peabody would have to strain himself very much to get such a awful big bag to drop you both in if it come right down to that old chap you be make a mistake you be as bad as you old man you be a beautiful pair of optimist and you a good newspaper man too -- it be a shame after momentary hesitation cullen continue thoroughly serious but my old friend he say in low tone glance quickly about there be one thing that you have get to put a stop to it be hurt you the secretary 's face show he bewilderment what do you mean he snap abruptly out with it i mean reply cullen that rumor be go around that you be keep langdon away from the crowd of ` insider ' in the senate for you own purpose -- that in short you plan to -- i understand be the quick interruption i be accuse of want to ` deliver ' senator langdon guarantee he vote on some graft proposition so that i can get the money and not he himself consequently i be tip he off on what measure be honest so that he 'll vote for they until -- until i be offer my price then influence he to vote for some big crooked scheme tell he it be all right he vote as i suggest and i get the money that be what ` deliver a man ' mean in washington dryly answer the chicago correspondent it mean win a man 's confidence he support he vote through friendship and then sell it for cash -- but you dick you have -- of course old man i have deny the truth of this i know you too well to doubt you still the yarn be hurt you remember that western senator who be ` deliver ' twice both way on a graft bill he laughingly ask the secretary should say i do dick that be the record for that game it be a corporation measure one railroad want it another oppose it the senator innocently tell a eastern senator that he be go to vote for the bill then the easterner go to the railroad want the bill pass and get $ 7000 on he absolute promise that he would get senator x to vote for it who of course do vote for it yes say cullen and later when senator x hear that senator z have get money for he vote he be wild then when another effort be make to pass the bill -lrb- which have be defeat -rrb- the ` deliver ' senator say to z as he meet he unexpectedly : ` you scoundrel here 's where i get square with you to some extent anyway i be go to vote against that bill this time and make a long speech against it too ' senator z then hustle to the lobbyist of the railroad that want the bill kill and guarantee he that for $ 10000 he could get senator x to change he vote to vote against the bill and he get the money too both way add haine as cullen conclude and both railroad to this day think that x receive the money from z of course say cullen but x be to blame though he do not know enough to keep to himself how he be go to vote any man that talk that way will be ` deliver ' i know how to stop those rumor for i be sure it be peabody 's work he think langdon will hear the talk and mistrust I begin haine when in come senator langdon himself he face beam contentedly little do the junior senator from mississippus realize that he be soon to face the severest trial the most vital crisis of he entire life cullen respond to the senator 's cheery greet of mornin ' everybody senator he ask my paper want you opinion on the question of the election of senator by popular vote do you think the system of elect senator by vote of state legislature should be abolish the mississippian cock he head to one side i reckon that be a question that concern future senator and not those already elect he chuckle haine laugh at cullen who thrust he pad into he pocket and hurry away it be to-day that i appear before the way and mean committee be not it langdon query of he secretary yes say haine consult he memorandum book at 11 o'clock you go before way and mean to put forward the need of you state on the matter of the reduction of the tariff on aluminium hydrate the people of mississippus believe it have actually put back life into the exhaust cotton land in virginium they hope to use it on the tobacco field where do the pesky stuff come from ask the senator from south america coach the secretary the south be in a hurry for it so the duty must come down you 'll have to bluff a bit because peabody and he crowd will try to make a kind of bargain -- want you to keep up iron and steel duty but you do not believe that iron and steel need help you will tell they do not you see so that they will feel the necessity of give you what you want for the south in order to gain you support for the iron and steel demand the office door open and senator peabody appear peabody whisper the secretary instantly the mississippian have he cue he back to peabody he rise bring down he fist heavily upon the desk and expound oratorically to haine : what we can produce of aluminium hydrate my boy be problematical but the south be in a hurry for it and the duty must come down it be get to come down and i be not go to do anything else until it do the secretary stretch across the desk excuse I senator senator peabody be here he say loudly and surprisedly as though he have just sight the boss of the senate the mississippian turn oh good-morning senator i be just talk with my secretary about that hydrate clause peabody bow slightly yes i know it be come up he say so i just drop over i be not oppose to it or any southern measure but it make it more difficult for I when you southern people oppose certain pittsburg interest that i have to take care of langdon smile i have never be in pittsburg but they tell I it look as if it could take care of itself the visitor shrug he shoulder that be true enough but give and take be the rule in political matter langdon this remark bring a frown to langdon 's face i do not like bargaining between gentleman peabody more important still i do not believe american politics have to be run on that plan why can not we change a lot of thing now that we be here langdon become so enthused that he pace up and down the room as he speak peabody you and steven and i continue langdon could get we friend together and right now start to make this great capital of we great country the place of the ` square deal ' the place where give and take bargain and sale be unknown we could start a movement that would drive out all secret influence -- the secretary notice peabody 's involuntary start the newspaper would help we go on langdon public opinion would be with we and both house of congress would have to join in the work if we go out in front lead the way and show they they plain duty and i tell you senator peabody that the principle that give birth to this country the principle of truth honesty justice and independence would rule in washington -- if washington care anything about they langdon interject the pennsylvanian that be my point cry the mississippian -- let we teach washington to care about they langdon langdon say peabody patronizingly you have seize on a bigger task than you know after you reform washington you will have to go on and reform human nature human instinct every human be in the country if you want to make politics this angelic thing you describe it be not politics it be humanity that be wrong wave aside a protest from langdon anyway you idea be not constitutional langdon continue peabody you want everybody to have a share in the national government that would not meet the theory of centralization weave into we political system by its founder they intend that we government should be control by a limited number of representative so that authority can be fix and responsibility ascertain you distort my meaning cry langdon and senator i would like to ask why so many high-priced constitutional lawyer who enter congress spend so much time in place the constitution of the united state between themselves and they duty sir between the people and they government sir between the nation and its destiny i want to know if in you opinion the constitution be design to throttle expression of the public will of course not that be the reason you and i langdon and the other be elect to the senate add peabody start to leave then he halt by the way senator he say i 'll do my best to arrange what you want regard aluminium hydrate for the sake of the south and i 'll also stand with you for altacoolum for the naval base we committee be to make its report to-morrow langdon observe the penetrate gaze that peabody have fix on he it seem to betray that the pennsylvanian 's apparently careless manner be assume h be cough langdon glance at haine i be not absolutely commit to altacoolum until i be sure it be the best place i 'll make up my mind to-day definitely and i _ think _ it will be for altacoolum the boss of the senate go out glare venomously at haine slam the door a moment later a page boy bring in a card colonel jd telfer gulf city read the senator bud he remark to the secretary i be go to send my old acquaintance telfer mayor of gulf city in here for you to talk to he 'll want to know about he town 's chance for be choose as the naval base i must hurry away as i have a appointment with my daughter and mr spangler before go before way and means -lrb- illustration : the senator accept a invitation to tea -rrb- chapter xi on the trail of the insider colonel jd telfer -lrb- jd standing for jefferson davi he explain proudly to haine -rrb- prove a warm advocate of the doubtful merit of gulf city as a hundred-million-dollar naval base he flushed face grow redder he long white hair become disorder and he tug at he white mustache continually as he wax warmer in he effort to impress the senator 's secretary i tell you mr haine gulf city sah lead all the south when it come to choosin ' ground fo ' a naval base she vast expanse of crystal sea she mile upon mile of silvah sand sah protect by a natural harbor and th ' island of mississippus sound make she th ' only spot to be consider she be god 's own choice and the people 's too for a naval base but unfortunately congress also have something to say about choose it speak haine to be shuah they do say gulf city 's mayor but -- and there be a man here from altacoolum yesterday again interrupt the secretary who say that gulf city be fit only to be the state refuge for aged and indigent frog say they be not a man in altacoolum wot can speak th ' truth indignantly shriek the old colonel almost lose control of himself because they head be always a-buzzin ' and a-hummin ' from th ' quinine they have to take to keep th ' fever away sah the mayor sit directly in front of haine at the opposite side of he desk regain he composure he suddenly lean forward and half whisper to the secretary : mah young friend do not let senator langdon get switch away from gulf city by they cheap skate from altacoolum now if you 'll get th ' senator to vote fo ' gulf city we 'll see -- i 'll see sah as a officer of th ' gulf city lan ' company -- that you get take ca-ah of haine ' eye open wide go on colonel go on with you offer he say well i 'll see that a block of stock sah -- a big block -- be set aside fo ' senator langdon a ' another fo ' you too we have make this ah-rangomont else-wheah we 'll outbid altacoolum overall time they be po ' sport a ' hate to give up so altacoolum be bid too excitedly ask haine why of co ` se it be ah yo ' as blind as that o ' ah yo ' foolin ' with I question telfer suspiciously seem to I yo ' ought to know more about that end of it than a fellah clear from th ' gulf certainly certainly mumble haine impatiently as he endeavor to associate coherently intelligently in he mind those startling new revelation of telfer with certain incident he have previously note in the operation of the committee on naval affair then he look across at the mayor and smile apparently he have hear nothing to amaze he colonel he return calmly drop into a voice that sound of pity for the gray hair of the lobbyist about fifty man a day come to I with proposition like that there be nothing do colonel i could not possibly interest senator langdon because he have the faculty of judge for himself and he would be prejudice against either town that come out with such a proposition lan ' speculation be legitimate protest the colonel cunningly haine agree certainly -- by outsider but it be d -- d thievery when engage in by any one connect with put a bill through if i be to tell senator langdon what you have tell I it would decide he unalterably in favor of altacoolum senator langdon sir be one of the few man in washington who would rather be think a fool than a grafter if it come down to that the mayor of gulf city jump to he foot he face blaze in rage not in shame seem to I yo be mighty fresh young man he bluster what kind of politics be langdon playin ' not fresh colonel only friendly i be just tip you off how not to be a friend to

thing some day and yo 'll drop to it all i guess i be too late with yo ' that be about the size of it i guess altacoolum 'll talk to yo ' go on the mayor if that feller fairbrother of altacoolum have be able to hold he tongue maybe i would not know so much but now i know what be what i know this -- that yo be either a big fool or -- a insider yo be a nice young feller i have kind-a take a fancy to yo ' i like to see yo ' young feller get along and not miss yo ' r chance come my boy get wise to yo ` rself get wise to yo ` rself climb on to the band wagon with yo ' friend bud conclude that he might be able to get more definite information out of telfer if he humor he a bit i tell you colonel he finally say these be pretty grave charge you be make but i 'll tell you confidentially owe to

place he be for until to-morrow i promise you that he will not decide until after i have my talk with you yo ' see say telfer i ask that question because as yo ' probably know congressman norton and he crowd be pretty close to senator langdon -- haine cut he short with a gasp of surprise norton telfer wrinkle he forehead incredulously look at haine surest thing you know my boy bud turn he head away in think oh leave the norton outfit to I i 'll fool they he finally say good telfer shake the secretary 's hand heartily yo be no fool my boy anybody can see that -- after they get to know yo '

she well realize as she be enact a carefully plan part with the unfortunate secretary he frankness and the sincere admiration that shine in he eye cause she to falter momentarily almost make she weaken in she purpose but she make a effort and secure a firmer grip on herself for she must play a rôle that would crush to earth the air castle this young secretary be build a rôle that would crush the ideal of this young optimist as well chapter xii the cure of a woman 's love carolina have come to find out from haine if possible how she father be go to vote on the naval base and to induce the secretary to persuade he to stand for altacoolum -- if there seem danger that he would vote for another site that be she scheme for carolina have put $ 25000 into altacoola land -- money leave by she

with a blandness that add fuel to peabody 's irritation do not trifle with I sir cry the boss of the senate this letter you send it explain it i be in no mood to joke langdon look at he calmly i think the letter be quite plain senator he say you can read then he turn to he daughter this discussion can not possibly interest you my dear will you go to the drawing-room to receive we guest carolina

peabody i be consider gulf city agree langdon peabody bring down he fist on the table it be too late to consider anything langdon he cry we be commit to altacoolum and altacoolum it be i do not care what you hear of gulf city now i would like to settle this thing in a friendly manner langdon i like always for every member of the senate to have he share of the power and the patronage we have be glad to put you forward in this naval base matter we appreciate the straightforwardness the honesty of you character you look well you be the kind of politician the public think it want nowadays but you have be in the senate long enough to know that bill have to pass and you know you can not get through anything without my friend and i tell you now i 'll throttle any gulf city plan you bring up then if you be as sure of that you can not object to my be for gulf city ask langdon be you financially interested in gulf city demand peabody senator peabody exclaim langdon do not flare up langdon retort peabody that sort of thing have happen in the senate there be often perfectly legitimate profit to be make in some regular commercial venture by a man who have inside information as to what be do up on capitol hill senator peabody ask langdon why be you so strong for altacoolum the pennsylvanian hesitate its natural advantage he say at last the southerner shake he head oh that be all well if natural advantage be go to settle it and not influence go ahead and vote and i 'll just bring in a minority report for gulf city the boss of the senate be in a corner now confound it langdon if you will have it i be interested in altacoolum langdon nod that be all i want to know he say now you see why it be get to be altacoola persist the boss i do not mind tell you then senator peabody answer langdon calmly that my be for gulf city be a bluff i have be try to draw you out gulf city be a mud bank and no more fit to be a naval base than keokuk ia altacoolum it be get to be for the good of the country and the honor of mississippus and one thing more senator i would just like to add that not a single man connect with that committee be go to make a cent out of the deal you get that straight chapter xxi if you can not buy a senator threaten he senator peabody be the most surprised man in washington when he hear the junior senator from mississippi state that no one be to enrich himself out of the government naval base project he heap a mental anathema on the head of steven for saddle such a man on the senate machine for langdon would of course never have be put on naval affair -lrb- just now very important to the machine -rrb- without the ok of steven who have win a heretofore thoroughly reliable reputation as a judge of man or of what purported to be man the thought that at this time of all time there should be a man on the committee on naval affair that could not be handle be sufficient to make he who revel in the title of boss of the senate determine that he must get another chief lieutenant to replace steven who have prove so trustworthy in the past steven have lose he cunning as the vote of langdon could not be secure by humbug or in exchange for favor and as it could not be deliver peabody of course be willing to pay in actual cash for the vote this be the final step but one in political conspiracy of this nature -- cash but langdon would not take cash so peabody have to resort to the last agency of the trained and corrupt manipulator of legislation he would threaten moreover he know that to make threat effective if it be possible to do so they must be lead up to systematically -- that be they should be make at the right time the scene must be set as in a play senator peabody glare at langdon as though to convince the latter that to stand in he way would mean political destruction so nobody be go to make a cent eh well i suppose you want all the profit for yourself turn to steven who have just enter the pennsylvanian cry : do you but listen to we suddenly good friend langdon he want to be the only man to make money out of the naval base he will not listen to any other member of the naval committee make a cent out of it why he -- great god sir exclaim langdon you be go too far peabody you state what be false and you know it you -- you -- then you be willing that other should have they rightful share put in steven oh i understand now senator no no no cry langdon you do not understand senator steven and i must say i be ashamed to speak of you by the honorable title of senator sir i will not listen to any person enrich himself at the government 's expense and i be you enemy you peabody and you steven beyond recall you both know you misrepresent I langdon walk over to steven and face he do you remember steven lorimer hawkslee back in wartime yes say steven puzzle i remember he -- a very fine gentleman the old planter sneer yes a very fine gentleman you remember he get rich out of contract for supplies furnish to the confederate government when it be not any too easy for the confederate government to pay and when he be in that government himself i never quite think that the act of a gentleman steven it seem to I to be very like dishonesty i refuse to speak to lorimer hawkslee in the carroll hotel at vicksburg and when the people there ask I why i tell they i want to warn you steven that i be likely to meet you some time in the carroll hotel at vicksburg steven back away angrily i catch you insinuation but -- he receive a warning glance from peabody and break into a pleasant smile calculate to deceive the old planter -- this once i will overlook it because of we old friendship and the old day in mississippus you be a fine talker langdon say peabody come to steven ' rescue but i can readily see what you be drive at you want a investigation you think you will catch some of we with what you reformer call ` the goods ' but forget evidently the entirely simple fact that you family have invest in altacoolum land more heavily probably than any one else among we you want to raise a scandal do you well go on and raise it but remember that you will have to explain how it happen that there be $ 50000 invest in the name of you son and $ 25000 in the name of you daughter miss carolina not to mention a few thousand put in by the gentleman who i be give to understand be to be you son-in-law congressman norton how about that norton peabody ask turn to the congressman who have follow steven i corroborate all you have say remark norton i can state positively that senator langdon know that he money be go into altacoola land i will swear to it if necessary and he glare bitterly at carolina 's father feeling certain that the girl would cling to he as oppose to she parent langdon make a threatening move at the congressman i consider my riddance of you mighty cheap at the price he cry come come langdon fume peabody i must get away from here to catch the midnight train let 's get through with this matter you must realize that you can not fight I in washington you must know that man call I the ` king of the senate ' i can beat any measure you introduce i can pass any measure you want pass i can make you a laughing-stock or a power why my friend from mississippus i can even have you election to the senate contest have a committee appoint to investigate the manner of you election have that committee decide that you buy you way into the honorable body the senate of the united state and on the strength of that decision have you forfeit you seat what a pretty heritage to hand down to posterity such a disgrace will be why the very school child of the future will hear about you as ` looter langdon ' and they parent will tell they how particularly degrade it be for a man of you reputation to drag into you dishonest scheme you son sir and you daughter for who will believe that this money be not put in these land without you consent without you direction you order do you not sign the mortgage on which this $ 50000 be raise senator langdon wave he hand deprecatingly i be learn the under-handed way of you professional politician i be get wise i be learn ` the game ' so i know you be bluff I peabody but you forget that the game of poker be invent in mississippus -- my native state press a button langdon summon a servant and say : send in mr haine i guess i have get to have a witness for my side it be no bluff speak steven as haine enter peabody can and will break you like a pipestem he be do it to other man before you who -- who try to dispute he power but i 'll try to save you i 'll ask he to be merciful you be not of any importance in the senate we do not need to deal with you -- then why do you both spend so much time on I ask langdon innocently why do not peabody go to philadelphium langdon say peabody you know my control of the senate be no piece of fiction but i will forgive you obstinacy even forget it i -- look here cry langdon just because i be a fat man do not think that i can not lose my temper he stop and gaze at he two colleague now you two man stay still one moment and i 'll tell you what really will happen to-morrow he explode and i be only a beginner in the game that be you specialty the naval base be go to altacoolum -- good simultaneously cry both peabody and steven you be come in with we no i be not but i 'll pass the bill so that nobody make a cent just as i say i would i 'll fool you both and make you both honest for once in spite of you natural disposition steven and the pennsylvanian stare at each other in disgust furthermore continue langdon altacoolum must have the base because i have know for some time that gulf city be impossible but some crooked senator would have make money if they would know it so they do not learn it altacoolum that proud arm of we great gulf will have those battleship float on she broad bosom and the country will be the better off and so will the sovereign state of mississippus -- god bless it -- but neither senator peabody of pennsylvanium nor senator steven of mississippus be go to be any better because of it no and if you man come to my committee room at 12:30 to-morrow noon you 'll have a chance to hear how all that be come about if you be not there by that time i 'll bring in a minority report in favor of gulf city just to show you that i know how to play the game -- this washington game -- come let 's go we can do nothing with he say peabody to the senior senator from mississippus well senator in the name of goodness what be you go to do how can you win for altacoolum without let these grafter make money out of it ask haine in astonishment as the other two walk away what be you go to do at 12:30 to-morrow langdon turn to he and roll he eye toward the ceiling despairingly i be blame if i know he exclaim -lrb- illustration : to-morrow at 12:30 -rrb- chapter xxii lobbyist -- and one in particular washington have know many lobbyist in its time and it keep on know they the striking increase in legislation that aim to restrict unlawful or improper practice in business the awakening of the public conscience have cause a greater demand than ever for influence at the national capital for these restrictive measure must be either kill or emasculate to a point of uselessness by that process which be the salvation of many a corrupt manipulator the process of amendment predatory corporation predatory business association of different sort and predatory individual have they representative on the field at washington to ward off attack by any means that brain can devise or money procure and to obtain desire favor at a cost that will leave a profitable balance for the purchaser when commercial trickster believe in the lobbyist ' favorite maxim the people forget feel that they have outlive the latest reform movement and see the good old day return the professional politician introduce a few reform measure themselves most stringent measure they push these measure ahead until somebody pay up then the bill die the lobbyist know all about these strike bill but do not frown on they no no per-hap he help draw up one of these bill so that with the aid of he inside knowledge of he employer 's business the measure be make to give a greater scare than might otherwise have result the bigger the scare the bigger the fund advance of course for the lobbyist to handle all this also help the lobbyist to secure and retain employment not all the washington lobbyist be outside of congress the senator or congressman have unequaled facility for oiling or block the course of a bill sometimes he confines himself to the interest of he own client whoever they may be but sometimes he notice a bill that promise to be a pretty good thing for the client of some other member if it pass then he begin to fight this bill so actively that he must be let in on the deal himself this be very annoying to the other member but the experience be worth something he have learn the value of observe other people 's legislation the outsider -lrb- member of the third house -rrb- and the insider have a bond of freemasonry unite they they exchange information as to what member of both house can be reach how they can be get to -lrb- through whom -rrb- and how much they want this information be carefully tabulate and now price for pass or defeat legislation can be quote to interested party just as the price of a carload of pork can be ascertain at a give time and place perhaps it be this system that lead graft member of short experience to wonder how knowledge of they take what be term the sugar get out and become know to they associate do they not have pledge of absolute secrecy yes but the purchaser never intend to keep the information from those of he kind lobbyist must be honest with each other not all lobbyist be man the woman legislative agent have be know to occupy a important position in washington and she do yet she be hard to detect and frequently more unprincipled than the man similarly engage if that be possible a woman with a measure of social standing would naturally prove the most successful as a lobbyist in washington because of the opportunity she position would afford she to meet people of prominence and just such a one be mrs cora spangler with whom the langdon have be throw in contact quite intimately since they arrival at the capital pretty and vivacious mr spangler bear she thirty-seven year with uncommon ease aid possibly by the makeup box and the modiste she dinner and reception be attend by people of acknowledged standing always a lavish spender of money this be explain as possible because of a fortune leave she by she late husband congressman spangler of pennsylvanium that this fortune have consist largely of stock and bond of a bankrupt copper smelting plant in michigan remain unknown except to she husband 's family one or two of she own relative and senator peabody who come from pennsylvanium have know she husband intimately he it be who have suggest to she that she might make money easily by cultivate the acquaintance of the new member of both house and they family exert she influence in various perfectly legitimate way he argue for or against matter pend in legislation the standard steel corporation keep mr spangler well supply with fund deposit monthly to she account in a philadelphium trust company she avoid suspicion by reason of she sex and she many acquaintance of undisputed rank senator peabody be never invite to she home have never attend a single dinner reception or musicale she have give all of which be a part of the policy they have mutually agree on to deaden any suspicion that might some time arise as to she relation to the standard steel company it be well know that peabody have be put into the senate by standard steel to look after its interest he have find mr spangler chiefly valuable thus far as a source of information regard the member of congress which she obtain largely from they family he be thus able to gain a idea of they association they particular interest and they aspiration in come to congress which prove of much use to he in form and promote acquaintance all for the glory of standard steel senator holcomb of missourus tell mr spangler at a afternoon tea confidentially that he be go to vote against the ship subsidy bill senator peabody be inform of this two hour later by a note write in cipher when the vote be call two day later senator holcomb vote for the bill standard steel supplies

revision when president ander of the federal silk company hear from senator peabody that windsor favor lower the tariff on silk a way be find to convince the congressman that the american silk industry be a weakling and many investor would suffer if the foreign goods should be admit any cheaper than at present president ander would be willing to do senator peabody a favor some day sometimes cora spangler shudder at the thought of what would become of she if she should make some slip some fatal error and be discover to she friend as a betrayer of confidence for money a secret agent of standard steel what a newspaper story she would make -- society favorite a pay spy woman lobbyist flee capital the sensational headline flit through she mind then she would grit she tooth and dig she finger nail into she palm she have to have money to carry on the life she love so well she must continue as she have begin after all she reason nothing definite could ever be prove regard the past let the future care for itself she might marry again and free herself from this mode of life -- who know so reason cora spangler for the hundredth time during the last two year as she sit in she boudoir at she home she have spend part of the day with carolina and hope langdon and in the evening have attend the musicale at they house but she have be force to leave early owing to a severe headache now

-- to save walk downstairs unnecessarily she explain to she woman friend but the number of this upstairs telephone be not in the public book it have a private number know to but two people except

worried -- something unusual for the cold flinty gentleman from pennsylvanium and he ` friend s ' of course mean steven great heaven then steven must now have knowledge of my -- my -- business she calm herself and straighten a dainty slender finger against she cheek it must be something about that naval base bill i be sure that be be worry peabody all session she muse as she press a button to summon she maid chapter xxiii the boss of the senate gain a new ally mr spangler would have flatter herself on guess correctly as to senator peabody 's uneasiness have she hear and see all that have take place in he apartment at the loui napoleon hotel where he have hurriedly take senator steven on leave the langdon house not only would the two senator lose they immense profit on the altacoolum transaction if langdon persist in he opposition but they would lose as well the thousand of dollar spend by they agent in purchase option on hundred of acre and where they could not get option the land itself this land would be on they hand unsalable if the base go somewhere else moreover they fear that langdon 's revolt would bring unpleasant newspaper publicity to they operation there be only one course to pursue steven snap peabody as they take off they overcoat that be to be prepare as best we can for the very worst and meet it in some way yet to be determine but first we must try to figure out what langdon be go to do -- what it can be that he say he will tell we to-morrow at 12:30 if we appear he must have something very startling up he sleeve if he make good he assertion i can not see how -- nor i frown steven and my political eyesight be far better than that fool langdon 's under ordinary circumstance we could let he go ahead with he minority report for gulf city but as thing stand he 'll have every newspaper reporter in washington buzz around and ask impertinent question -- yes and you and i would have to go to pari to live with we life insurance friend from new york would not we laugh peabody sarcastically i be go to send for jake steinert he add steinert steven ejaculate what -- oh that be all right maybe he can suggest something say peabody go to the telephone we have too much at stake to make a mistake and jake may see a point that we have overlook luckily i see he downstairs in the grill-room as we come through to the elevator steinert be all right himself continue steven but he method -- can not be too particular now about he method -- or ours steven when a bull like langdon break loose in the political china shop fortune and reputation be both fragile a ring of a bell announce the arrival of jake steinert whose reputation as a lobbyist of advance ability have spread wide in the twenty year he have spend in washington of medium height sallow complexion dark hair and dark eye he broad shoulder fill the doorway as he enter a illy keep mustache almost hide a thin-lipped forceful mouth almost as forceful as some of the language he use he eye dart first to peabody and then to steven wait for either of they to open the conversation the highest class lobbyist those who swing the biggest deal concern themselves only with man who can handle or who control lawmaker they get regular report and outline the campaign like crafty spider they hide in the center of a great web a web of bribery threat cajolery and intrigue intent on every victim that be lure into the glisten mesh only the small fry mingle freely with the legislator in the open in the hotel and cafés and in the capitol corridor jake steinert do not belong in either of these class he rank somewhere between the biggest and the smallest he couple colossal boldness with the most expert knowledge of all the intricate workings of the congressional mechanism give money to spend among member to secure the defeat of a bill he would frequently put most of the money in he own pocket and for a comparatively small sum defeat it by influence the employee through whose hand it must pass sit down jake something to drink asked peabody reach for a decanter no grunt the lobbyist do not drink durin ' business hour only durin ' the day well jake say the pennsylvanian you probably know something of what be go on in the naval affair committee you mean the biggest job of the session yes sure thing senator it be the work of a artist the boss of the senate smile grimly now suppose a committeeman name langdon absolutely refuse to be take care of and insist on hand in a minority report to-morrow with a speech that read like the declaration of independence steinert jerk he head forward quickly you mean what would i do if i be -- er -- if i be runnin ' the job yes steinert lean toward peabody where do i come in on this he ask suspiciously come come man be the irritable retort i never let a few dollar stand between myself and my friend all right senator the lobbyist thrust himself down in he chair puff slowly at a cigar and gaze thoughtfully at the ceiling few year ago he begin after a minute or two there be a feller who be goin ' to squeal about a bond issue he have he speech all really to warn the country that he think a crowd of the plutocracy be goin ' to get the bond to resell to the public at advanced rate well sir i arrange to have a carriage a closed carriage call that night to take he to see the president for he be tell the president send the carriage for he when he get out he be at the insane asylum a ' i can tell you he be bundle into a padded cell in jig time where he stay for three day ` he think he be a member of congress ' i tell the two husky that handle he a ' give 'em each a twenty-case note the doctor that sign the necessary papers get considerable more steven ' gasp of amazement cause the narrator genuine enjoyment i know of a certain senator who be drunk a ' lay away in a turkish bath when the roll be call on a certain bill he be a friend of peabody 's laugh the lobbyist to the mississippian but in this case say steven we must be very careful possibly some of you method in handle the man you go after -- say interpose steinert you know i do not do all pursuin ' all the goin ' after any more than other in my business why senator some of these congressman worry the life out of we folk that sprinkle the sugar they accuse we of not lettin ' 'em in on thing when they have not be feed in some time they come down the trail like greyhound coursin ' a coyote the speaker pause and glance across at peabody who however be too busily engage in write in a memorandum book to notice he why senator steven go on the lobbyist only to-day a down east member hold I up to tell I that he be strong for that proposition to give the ak and l railroad grant of government timber land in oregon he say to I he say : ` what 'n h -- l do my constituent in new england care about thing ` way out on the pacific coast i would give 'em yellowstone national park for a freight sidin ' if 'twa any use to 'em ' he say so you see -- i must go break in steven rise and glance at he watch it will soon be daylight if you must have sleep go but you must be here at 9 o'clock sharp in the morning say peabody steinert will sleep here with I we 'll all have breakfast together here in my room and a final consultation you will not plan anything really desperate peabody will you i think i would rather -- nonsense steven of course not we game will be to try to weaken langdon to prove to he in the morning that he alone will suffer because we name do not appear in the land deal the option be sign and the deed sign by we agent do not you see whereas he daughter and son and future son-in-law actually take land in they own name how clumsy yes such amateurism lower the dignity of the united state senate peabody answer dryly but suppose langdon do not weaken asked steven anxiously as he pick up he hat and coat then we will go into action with we gun load be the reply chapter xxiv the honeybird in the african jungle dwell a pretty little bird that live on honey the saccharine dainty be there find in the hollow of tree and under the bark where what be know as the carpenter bee bore and deposit he extract from the bud and blossom of the tropical forest the bird be call the honeybird because it be a sure guide to the deposit of the delicacy the bird dislike the laborious task of peck its way through the bark to reach the honey and so wise in the way of man it procure help it locate a nest of honey then fly about until it see some native or hunter to whom it show itself they know the honeybird and know that it will lead they to the treasure store follow the bird which flit just in advance they reach the cache of drip sweetness and readily lay it open with hatchet or knife take what they want there be always enough leave cling to the tree and easily accessible to satisfy the appetite of the clever little bird senator steven of mississippus bear a marked resemblance to the honeybird -- so much so that he have well win the bird 's appellation for himself abnormally keen at locate possibility for extract honey from the governmental affair in washington he invariably lead peabody represent the hunter with the ax to the repository he would then rely on the pennsylvanian 's superior force to break down the barrier steven would flutter about and gather up the leavings equally as mercenary as the boss of the senate he lack peabody 's iron nerve determination resourcefulness and daring he need many hour of sleep peabody could work twenty hour at a stretch he have to have he meal regularly or else suffer from indigestion peabody sometimes do a day 's work on two boil egg and a cup of coffee the senior senator from mississippus have be the first to point out to peabody the possibility for profit in the gulf naval base project but the morning follow the conference with steinert when he rejoin they for breakfast at the loui napoleon he be far from comfortable he do not mind fight brain against brain even though unprincipled method be resort to but indication be that more violent agency would be call into play owe to the complication that have arise steven eat heartily to strengthen he courage steinert eat hugely to strengthen he body peabody eat scarcely anything at all -- to strengthen he brain wave away the hotel waiter who have bring the breakfast to he apartment senator peabody outline the probable campaign of the day if we best effort to weaken and scare off langdon fail to-day he say it will naturally develop that we must render it impossible in some way for he to appear in the senate at all or we must delay he arrival until after the report of the committee on naval affair have be make in either event he would not have another opportunity to speak on that subject of course later at 12:30 we will know he plan of action then we can act to the very point but we must be prepare for any situation that can arise can not the president of the senate be persuade not to recognize langdon on the floor then we could adjourn and shut he off ask steven no respond peabody he have already promise langdon to recognize he and the president of the senate can not be persuade to break he word i be painfully aware of this fact but steven be not yet dissuade from the hope of defeat the junior senator from mississippus by wit alone can we not have a speaker get the floor before langdon and have he talk for hour -- tire out the old kicker -- and await a time when he leave the senate chamber to eat or talk to some visitor we could have call on he then shove the bill through summarily he suggest i have go over all that answer peabody quickly it would only be delay the evil hour you would not be able to move that old codger away from the senate chamber with a team of ox -- once he get to he seat he secretary raine -- another oversight of yours steven -- the latter wince -- will warn he langdon would stick pin through he eyelid to keep from fall asleep i have be thinkin ' put in steinert slowly that a little fine-esse like this might keep he away : when langdon be in he committee room before goin ' to the senate send he a telegram sign by one of he frien 's ' name that one of he daughter be dyin ' from injury in a automobile collision a few mile out o ' town that ` ud -- ridiculous snorted peabody he would know where they be they be always -- huh then put in more fine-esse how what hev some ` un take 'em out a-autoin ' -- no no man snap peabody they would stick in town to hear they father 's wonderful speech well go on the lobbyist i 'll hev langd 'n watch by a careful pick man a nigger that will not talk he 'll pick a row with the colonel on some street say w ` en he be comin ' from he home after lunch the coon kin bump into langd 'n a ' call he name then w ` en ole firework sail into ` im yellin ' about what ` e would do in mississippus the coon pull a gun on the colonel a ' fire a couple o ' shot random cop come up a ' we pertickeler copper 'll lug langd 'n away as a witness refusin ' to believe ` e 's a senator i kin arrange to hev he keep in the cooler a couple o ' hour without gettin ' any word out or i 'll hev ` im enter up as drunk a ' disorderly he 'll look drunk he 'll be so mad but the negro -- how could you get a man to undergo arrest on such a serious charge attempt murder exclaim steven there there say steinert patronizingly coon have more genteel home life in jail than they do out a ' do not forget the district of columbium be govern by folk that be not resident of it only durin ' the session th ' politician do not leave they frien 's in the cooler very long say senator steven be you kiddin ' I be it any different down in you -- the mississippian choke and splutter over a gulp of unusually hot coffee and peabody again decide steinert to be on the wrong tack that proceeding would attract too much attention from the newspaper he add well i think you want to win grunt steinert i have be offerin ' you good stuff too -- new stuff none of yer druggin ' with chloroform or ticklin ' with blackjack why i have go from fine-esse to common sense but come to think of it how about some woman i c 'n get one to introduce to -- this be the wrong kind of a man interrupted peabody unless you get the right kind of a woman go on steinert senator steven choke some more the boss of the senate sink down in he chair cross one knee over the other and drum he finger lightly on the table he gaze thoughtfully at steven yes he observe slowly unless you have get the right sort of a woman rise he lead the mississippian to one side the lobbyist hear the southerner give a short exclamation of astonishment as peabody whisper to he it be all right it be all right he then hear the pennsylvanian say irritably she 'll understand she can be trust _ she expect you _ steven give a violent start at the last assurance but he colleague hurriedly help he into he coat go in a closed carriage be peabody 's final warning be sure to tell she to get hold of he two daughter on some pretext at once she know they well maybe we can influence the old man through he girl do not you see and while senator peabody and jake steinert recur to a previous discussion concern one jd telfer mayor of gulf city senator steven start on the most memorable drive of he career on

shrug he shoulder and now i 'll tell you honorable senator go on langdon thoroughly arouse something to surprise you i have discover that you be not work for yourselve alone in the altacoolum deal but that you intend to turn you land over to the standard steel company at a big profit as soon as this naval base bill be pass then that company will squeeze the government for the best part of the hundred million that be to be spend the senator sink back in he chair and gaze at he two opponent those two statesman jump to they foot come steven let he do what he will we can not stay here to be

up and deny a word the boss of the senate and he satellite be dumfounded firmly believe that langdon could find no way to pass the bill for altacoolum and yet spoil they crooked scheme they be totally unprepared for any such dénoûement to think that a simple old-fashioned planter from the cotton field of mississippus could originate such a plan to outwit the two ablest political trickster in the senate langdon eye he colleague triumphantly peabody however be think quickly he be never beat until the last vote be count on a roll call he know that no matter how apparently insurmountable a opposition be a way to overcome it might often be find by the man who exercise strong self-control and a trained brain this corrupt victor in score of bitter political engagement on the battlefield of washington be now in he most dangerous mood he would marshal all he force the man to defeat he now must defeat the entire senate machine and the ally it could gain in a emergency he must overcome the power of standard steel he must fight the resourceful brain of the masterful peabody himself peabody whisper to steven we must pretend to be beat -lrb- illustration : after i have finish i dare one of you to deny a word -rrb- then the pennsylvanian advance smile to langdon and hold out he hand senator langdon he say i be beat you have beat the leader of the senate something difficult to believe
