next morning and she sit up in bed with the feeling that it must be very late she glance at the little clock on the dresser and see that its hand point to half past eight oh i 'll be late to school be she first thought then she check herself and laugh school she say stretch she arm above she head with a delicious sense of freedom as the old man say : ` they be not no sech animile ' i guess i might just as well get up though for i feel as if i be starve to death she be just put she foot into very pretty bedroom slipper when she remember the tragedy -- or so it seem to she -- of the day before the long night 's rest have drive from she mind all thought of the statue be it really only yesterday that she have break it the thing seem to have be on she conscience forever ` girl read a book ' she say disdainfully as she begin to brush she hair vigorously horrid old thing i suppose she be a grind anyway like amanda peabody the thought of amanda do not serve to lift she spirit any and it be in a rather gloomy mood that she finally descend to the breakfast table to make thing worse she find that all the rest of she family include chet have breakfast bright and early which mean that she would have to eat she breakfast in lonely state the room be cheerful with sunlight for mr bradley have often say that a bright dining-room have more to do with make a happy home than any other one thing but this morning billie do not even notice it she open the swing door to the kitchen and peep in cautiously to see whether debbie they black and much pampered cook be in a good enough mood to

chet and as she watch she see he fling he racket high in the air my set tom he cry that put we even play you the rubber this afternoon so long and with he tennis ball in he hand and he racket under he arm he saunter over toward home dear old chet murmur billie fondly then come the thought of that hundred dollar she must get some way or other and suddenly there flash into she mind a little ray of hope maybe chet could help she think and then laugh at herself for think it chet have just about as much chance of get that hundred dollar as she have herself at that moment debbie come in with she fruit and cereal and she turn from the window with a sigh i might as well eat she think resignedly for if i starve myself to death or die of worry there will not be anybody leave to pay for that old book worm then she irrepressible imp of mischief reassert itself and she laugh hello look at the grand lady a fresh young voice call to she from the doorway she turn with a spoon half way to she mouth

altogether keep out the vision of three tower hall the board school to which she have want to go ever since -- well almost since she have want anything laura and violet would go without she they would have to go even in spite of they loyal determination not to they parent would have something to say about that and chet be in just as bad a fix for boxton military academy have be he dream even as three tower hall have be billie 's oh if only they could all go what a wonderful time they could have oh well -- and mr and mr bradley sense something of all this be very unhappy and cast about desperately for some way to give they boy and girl the advantage that the other would have but money be very tight mr bradley have all he cash tie up in several real estate transaction so for a little while the bradley be not a happy family -- although they try bravely not to show it even to each other then one morning come a long businesslike envelope with a typewritten address that cause a stir in the family circle mr bradley open it with a puzzle frown between she brow then utter a startled exclamation what be it dear ask mr bradley while billie and chet crowd closer to she chair aunt beatrice powerson be dead mr bradley announce with a look more of shocked surprise than of grief she die in canada quite suddenly and this be from she attorney ask we she look across at she husband to

you know she be queer and as tight as a clam when it come to talk about she personal affair the only thing we be sure of be that she have plenty of money to travel anywhere she want to and that be say

she leave you something in she will chet he mother chide gently do not you think it be rather heartless to be count on what aunt beatrice have leave when we have just hear of she death i suppose so say chet rather abashed but then you know we only see she about once in every three year and then she be not very friendly be you really go mother you and dad ask billie for it seem impossible to she that she father and mother should go off on such a long journey and leave she and chet behind be you she ask again anxiously yes i suppose we must say mr bradley look across at she husband who answer

debbie will be here as usual to do the cooking and of course she add to billie put a arm about she and draw she close debbie will help you with anything you want to know we probably will not be go more than a week anyway so it be arrange and a couple of day later with a wildly beat heart and a rueful smile upon she lip billie stand with chet upon the station platform and wave good-bye to she father and mother when the train have round the curve and disappear with one last challenging blast of the whistle billie and chet turn to each other feeling as lose and forlorn as the babe in the wood now what do we do next breathe billie break the silence at last i feel helpless chet well i do not think you have anything on I admit chet slangily i suppose the most sensible thing to do would be to go home and see how debbie be get on with the lunch goodness that be the first time i ever have to be remind that i be hungry say billie and with that they laugh and feel more natural the rest of that day go off beautifully and billie be begin to feel very confident when suddenly debbie throw a suggestion bomb-like in the midst of she contentment i hate to bother you miss say the black cook

awful impo ` tant in-gagement fo ' dis aft ` noon a ' i could not break it -- no be much as i want to she add that last in the evident hope of appease she young mistress who be still regard she with horrify eye but debbie gasp billie when she could find she voice i do not know a thing in the world about cooking have you -- have you -- order anything ya indeed debbie assure she go on to explain that the meal be virtually prepared anyway i do make a salad for you and chet a ' the butter bean be in de pan dere be some stew too which all you have to do be to warm up miss billie a ' i do make a big peach pie a ' dere 's some whip cream in de ` frig ` rater so i reckon you-all will not starve to death she add with a broad smile that show all she strong white tooth back to the last molar as

alone debbie you be a darling and i love you she cry joyfully but you know you really should not have scare I so -- it be not fair for answer debbie grin again and begin to get she bulky figure up the stair preparatory to dress for the in-gagement with she young man billie watch she go and then with a little chuckle resume she dust i would like to see debbie 's young man she muse a smile twist the corner of she mouth he ought to be a giant anyway i feel sorry for he if he be not dear funny old debbie -- will not chet and i have a picnic to-night and as she have predict they do have the time of they life chet refuse to sit in the dining-room in lonely state and in masterly fashion invade the kitchen say that smell good billie old girl and he sniff hungrily at the stew give I a apron and i 'll help oh look who want to help cry billie find a apron nevertheless and tie it around he waist so that he look like a butcher 's assistant you will probably only get under my foot and bother I to

obey grumblingly and be finally reward by be give a steam dish of stew to carry in chet scream billie follow he in and check he just as he be in the act of put the hot dish on the tablecloth put a protector under it do not you know as chet start and look reproachfully at she that you be apt to ruin the table and it be almost a brand new one at that well you need not scare a fellow to death grumble chet i think i would step on the cat but he obey instruction my but do not everything look good cry billie sniff hungrily hurry up chet take off you apron and dish up the stew while i pour the coffee what do you know about that _ i _ make the coffee and do not it smell good it be the jolliest of meal and finish up in royal fashion with the peach pie and whip cream in a very gale of merriment chet and billie clear away the dinner dish and then be tire by the unusual exertion decide to go early to bed for the first part of the night billie sleep soundly but just as the clock downstairs be striking two she awaken suddenly and lay still in bed listen she be frightened though she could not have tell why rigidly she lay there hardly daring to breathe chapter vii a strange burglar what be it that have awaken billie bradley hardly have the girl ask herself that question when she hear it -- a padding stealthy creep noise that make she clutch the bed clothes and draw they tighter about she then in a panic she realize that whatever it be have start upstairs nearer nearer come the stealthy padding till billie realize it have reach the landing she scalp creep and she hair begin to stand on end she door be the nearest to the stair and she be all alone in the house with chet swiftly she throw off the cover jump out of bed and with she limb tremble under she run to the door and softly turn the key in the lock then she lean weakly against the door and listen for the noise but it have stop evidently the burglar if burglar it be have pause to get he bearing then another horrible thought strike she chet be sleep in the next room and chet 's door be unlock on foot that seem too weak to hold she she creep into chet 's room -- luckily there be a connect door between -- and softly turn the key in he door also evidently she be just in time for as she listen the stealthy noise begin again and it be come toward the very door she have just lock she utter a little involuntary sound and chet sit up in bed with a start wh-what 's up he demand sleepily oh hush cry billie scurry to he bed and lean over she whisper the awful word : there be a burglar in the house chet a burglar repeat chet wide awake by this time who say so do not be foolish do not i hear he myself cry billie in a desperate whisper oh chet he be on the stair outside well why do not he come in be he bashful query chet seem not in the least alarmed billie shake he impatiently he probably would have come in if i have not lock the door she tell he impatiently for goodness ' sake chet wake up and tell I what to do he may have steal everything we own by this time hush cry chet grasp she arm and in a tense silence they listen yes they could not be mistake -- something be surely brushing against the door thank heaven she have lock it think billie as she begin to feel she hair stand on end again once more come that brushing sound and then very distinctly a sniff oh chet cry billie clutch she brother 's arm spasmodically nervy beggar mutter chet if i have a gun i would know what to do but say he add as a happy thought strike he there be dad 's he be out of bed and across the room before billie could do more than gasp fearfully she follow after luckily chet have elect to sleep in he parent ' room during they absence so as to be nearer billie and he have happen to remember the secret hiding place that he father have show he not long before where he keep he revolver always load and ready for action oh chet do be careful whisper billie as chet draw the ugly-looking thing out of the hidden drawer and examine it i -- i think i be more afraid of that than i be of the b-burglar chet 's only answer be a grim come on from between set young lip fearfully they make they way over to the door they burglar seem to have go on to some other room for they could hear the stealthy padding at the other end of the hall but now he have turn in they direction very carefully chet turn the key in the lock and then while billie press both hand over she heart to quiet its pound chet fling open the door and step into the hall billie be right at he heel and then the impossible thing happen a dark shape come slowly toward they stop at sight of they and utter a low bark yes the sound that issue from they suppose burglar be a very distinct and friendly canine bark for a minute chet and billie just stare speechlessly then slowly the revolver in chet 's hand drop to he side and he begin to laugh it be a weak laugh at first but it gradually swell into a roar as he take in the full humor of the situation and billie after a moment during which she seem undecided whether to laugh or cry presently join he a dog gasp chet when he could get he breath come here old man and let 's have a look at you the dog that have cause all the disturbance come forward at chet 's command and stand look up at they he handsome brush wave genially as the light of a street lamp shine through the window fall upon he billie utter a exclamation why it be bruce -- nellie bane 's collie she cry how in the world do he ever get in come here bruce old boy and explain yourself obediently bruce go over to she and lay a cold muzzle in she hand he soft eye look lovingly into she face for billie have make much of bruce on she frequent visit to nellie bane and the dog with the instinct of he kind have develop a great liking for she -- though the first in he loyal dog 's heart be nellie bane he mistress you be a great one chet scoff you get a fellow all work up to catch a burglar and then you produce a dog i think you do it on purpose yes and i suppose i scared myself half to death on purpose too say billie sarcastically as she pat the dog 's great head where be you go she ask as chet start back into he room to put this thing where i get it he explain hold up the pistol from which billie shrink back do not imagine we 'll have any further need of it to-night wait a minute order billie and chet turn back surprise we have not find out yet how bruce get in she explain look fearfully over she shoulder for the effect of she fright have not quite leave she yet do not you think we would better take that along while we look through the house we must have leave a door or a window open somewhere bruce could not have come through the wall you know something -- i do not know what it can be -- make I agree with you return chet sarcastically but he turn to the stair nevertheless come on he say if we have leave a window open it be high time that that window be shut go ahead bruce and show we where you get in -- that be a good old boy at the best it be rather a eerie business -- search through the empty house at that time of night -- and it be especially nerve-trying for billie after the fright she have have and then they find it the french window that open from the dining-room upon the porch be swing wide open -- a wonderful invitation to enter for any sneak thief who might happen to pass that way billie shiver again as chet with a final pat put bruce outside and closed and lock the window there i guess we will not have any more visitor to-night he say as they start through the dark living-room to the stair let 's hope not return billie fervently when they reach they room upstairs they feel too excite for sleep and sit for a long time talk over the incident they could laugh now at they surprise in meeting friendly bruce instead of a very unfriendly house-breaker but more than once both of they catch themselves listen for sound in the silent house below it be just luck say billie as she rise at last to go to bed that it be bruce that happen to find that open window instead of -- of some one else chapter viii startling development chet and billie be very careful to leave neither door nor window unlock and the rest of the week pass without further mishap then one morning come a telegram from they parent say that they would be home the next day goodness now i have to get busy cry billie jump up from the table in such a hurry that she very nearly upset chet 's coffee cup thereby considerably surprising that boy say do you think it be catch he ask with a smile what be the matter with you billie oh of course you would not understand -- you be a boy remark he sister condescendingly as she put on the become dust cap and pull some glove on she hand do not you see she add as chet continue to stare at she that this house have to be immaculate before mother get back i have simply get to live up to my reputation never know you have one remark chet cruelly as he turn back to he bacon and egg with a relieved sigh if you need any help he offer graciously as billie sweep out of the room just call on I thank you i do not call back billie make a face at he over she shoulder and then follow such a whirlwind of sweeping and dust and throw about of furniture that poor chet be dismayed and be force to take refuge on the porch however when billie flush and breathless and very very pretty take he by the arm and lead he about to admire she handiwork he tell she that she be some wonder now how about lunch he ask and billie appetite sharpen by work enthusiastically agree it seem a eternity to wait until the next morning but somehow the time come at last finding brother and sister on tip-toe with excitement long before it be time to go to meet the train they be ready and wait billie be swing back and forth in the porch swing grasp a cushion in each hand to keep she from jump out while chet walk restlessly up and down if you do not sit down say billie so suddenly that she brother jump i 'll just scream well go ahead if it will make you feel any better invite chet amiably however for the sake of peace he seat himself in one of the broad armed chair be not it train time yet ask billie as she have ask many time during the last fifteen minute here say chet handing over he watch take this and keep look at it my voice be get hoarse say ` no ' but i do not see why we can not go down to the station anyway argue billie only that it be about a hundred time more comfortable to wait here but we might miss the train wail billie and chet jump to he foot with a chuckle oh come on he cry we have miss the train several time accord to you in a minute you will almost have I worried you be a dear old bear say billie snuggle she arm into he as they set off you certainly do have a way with you billie that get you what you want he admit add meaningly : besides i be think i would better keep on the right side

arm severely what be the use of raise hope she say dolefully as a vision of the broken girl read a book rise reproachfully before she and she think longingly of how happy she could be if it be only possible to replace it and there be three tower hall -- but she shake off the thought and have open she mouth to speak when the sharp blast of a engine whistle make they jump chet she gasp it be the train we must not miss it we can make it if we run say chet as he take hold of she arm come on no not that way -- the short cut that be the idea warm and panting they come out upon the station platform just as the train draw in they watch the passenger eagerly but not at first see those they seek have almost decide that they be come on a later train when away down at the end of the platform billie espy a familiar hat there they be mother she cry as they come within hail distance we think you be not on the train oh what a fright we have after the greeting be over chet and billie both notice that they parent seem to be in a state of suppress excitement and both of they wonder however they have too much to talk about just then to do much wonder about anything and they walk slowly toward home ask and answer a very flood of question mr bradley want to know how billie have get along without she at which both chet and billie try to tell the story of nellie bane 's collie at the same time and in the same breath when they have finish mr bradley chuckle but mr bradley look grave it happen to be funny she say but it might have be very serious i hope you be careful after that be we they cry and billie add with a laugh : we lock and double lock all the window and door and if it have not be for chet i would have pile furniture against the door but we want to know what you have

house he say but _ i _ can not protest billie anybody would think you really expect to hear something chuckle mr bradley who seem to be enjoy himself immensely over something oh please begged billie almost beside herself with impatience by this time -- and chet in he quiet way be just as bad there be something about they mother 's and father 's manner that tell they something be in the wind i be just die by inch go on billie but this time it be mrs bradley who interrupt here we be at home dear she say can not you give dad and I a chance to rest and give we perhaps a cup of tea -- oh i be a selfish old beast say billie penitently i might have know you would be terribly tire after that long train ride and still scold herself she hurry they before she into the house and fly to find debbie she have not far to go however for debbie be just lumber like a good-natured elephant through the hall to greet she master and mistress as soon as the greeting be over she lumber back again to make the necessary tea billie and chet control they impatience answer the question they mother have to ask they about all that have happen while they have be away for mr bradley have be anxious when they finally leave the table and mr bradley lead the way back into the library billie utter a long sigh of relief well say mr bradley and they lean forward eagerly we find that what we always suppose about the amount of money aunt beatrice have be right she leave only a few thousand and that -- queer soul that she be -- she leave to a missionary society oh cry billie and it must be admit that she both feel and look horribly disappointed she have not know just how much she have hope both for herself and for chet until this moment and chet poor fellow feel just as bad although he show it less then she do not leave anything either to you or dad chet ask no but she do leave something to you and billie be mrs bradley 's startling announcement billie and chet look at one another as if to be sure that they have hear aright you say she leave we something cry billie breathlessly yes but do not let you hope run away with you mr bradley warn they for it be not very much oh tell we the two command eagerly and in unison she leave a gold watch to chet mr bradley tell they it be really a very beautiful watch chet and worth a good deal of money and to billie -- she pause for emphasis and billie wriggle impatiently and to billie she leave she rambling old homestead at cherry corner a homestead at cherry corner gasp billie unable to believe she ear while chet look interested what sort of a house be it mother i have not be there for a number of year reply she mother knit she brow in a effort to recall the detail of billie 's queer inheritance as i remember it it be a old-fashioned rambling affair it must have be consider rather handsome in its palmy year and it have be in the powerson family for generation in fact i believe it date back to revolutionary day it have great large room and rather spooky dark hallway i be afraid i be not very much impressed with it the first time i see it she finish with a smile wh-what a funny thing to leave I say billie she eye big and round with wonder then she add without think -- as billie always do : oh do not i wish she have leave I a hundred dollar instead it would have be much more useful chapter ix ghost and thing billie be instantly sorry for she speech as she see the old troubled expression cross she father 's face forgive I please she plead i think i must be the most ungrateful girl alive well i should say so cried chet to whom the description of the queer old house while dismaying he sister have appeal immensely say i would like nothing better than to go out right now and look you property over billie big room and spooky hall and -- say mother it must have a cellar and a attic what be they like i suppose say he mother smile at he enthusiasm that since you seem to like the ghostly part you would be more than ever please with the attic and cellar as i remember it the cellar be the most peculiar part of the whole queer place aunt beatrice take I through it and seem immensely proud of the funny old tunnel and store-room that be tuck away in all sort of odd corner the only thing i like about it she finish with a reminiscent smile be the shelf-lined icy room where she keep she fruit preserve this get better and better fairly crow chet a damp gloomy old cellar with tunnel and storeroom in queer corner and -- but you be go to tell we about the attic yes the attic cry billie for by this time chet have make she as much interested in she strange inheritance as he be do it have trunk in it mother -- and cobweb trunk yes but not cobweb smile she mother for aunt beatrice be a excellent housekeeper -- when she be at home then the attic be not spooky query chet disappointed i should say it be return he mother with a emphasis that set all he fear at rest it be the creepiest place i have ever be in and i be never gladder in my life than when we leave it for the more cheerful lower floor -- though goodness know that be dreary enough say when be we go cry chet jump to he foot he face flush with eagerness where ask mrs bradley to cherry corner of course answer chet in a tone which very plainly mean why ask such a foolish question to the ghost that inhabit the garret and cellar of billie 's new house hold on hold on there cry mr bradley who have be listen to the proceedings in amuse silence do you happen to know how far cherry corner be from here very far ask billie a whole day 's ride that be all they father answer say dad cry chet suddenly what do you suppose the old place be worth i can not say chet answer mr bradley be so far from good road and the railroad i be afraid the land be not worth much but it must be worth something persist the boy mr bradley smile faintly for billie 's sake let we hope so but you must remember in this state there be thousand of abandon farm folk simply can not make a living on they and so they move away but the building must be worth something to live in yes but that be all you can not move a old stone house to some other spot why do they call it ` cherry corner ' ask billie for she have be follow a little train of think all she own it be a very queer name oh they come by it naturally enough she mother answer it be surround by a grove of cherry tree and be near a cross of two rocky road so you see the reason for ` cherry corner ' goodness that sound as if it be away off in the wilderness cry billie add : but would not it be awful to have to live in that spooky old house all alone be there any house near it mother not one for more than a mile say mr bradley they be almost as isolate now as they use to be in the old indian day indian cry chet prick up he ear again do you say something about indian mother why i have hear aunt beatrice say answer mr bradley begin to share in she child 's enthusiasm that the powerson who originally build the house build it especially for the purpose of resist indian attack now that i come to think of it she add she eye begin to shine with excitement that be the reason for the wind tunnel and secret room as the last resort the family could take refuge in they oh boy cry chet spring to he foot for the second time do you hear that do you indian raid and -- oh gosh word fail he and he sink back in he chair with a sigh of joy be not it wonderful breathe billie at first i be disappointed but now -- be that all she leave mother be not that enough she father interject with a laugh i suppose so but i think -- why yes that be all say she mother add the next moment surprise that she should have forget the most important part of all : oh i forget to tell you -- aunt beatrice leave you the house with all its contents oh breathe billie again now i know we be go to have a wonderful time what do the old house contain question chet he mind be on get some money out of the inheritance for billie i be sure i do not know answer he mother it may be completely furnish or it may be quite bare i imagine though that aunt beatrice leave it furnished but everything be very old and maybe the rat and moth have play sad havoc there they talk for a little while more about this strange thing that have happen then mr bradley go off to pick up the loose end of he business and mr bradley adjourn to the kitchen to discuss supper preparation with the mountainous debbie leave alone billie and chet look at each other wonderingly well say billie in a slightly awed tone we expect something to happen and it certainly do but we do not expect she to leave you a old stone mansion crow chet say billie he add stop before she in he excited pacing of the room to gaze at she eagerly be not you crazy to go out and see it i would like say billie fervently to start for cherry corner on the very next train but i be not so sure i would like to stay in that place after nightfall she add on second thought why you be not afraid of the ghost be you he ask with intense scorn do not you know that ghost be all in the imagination of course i do who say i be afraid of ghost retort billie with spirit you know that i do not believe in they any more than you do well then what be you afraid of insist chet oh thief and thing tramp maybe say billie thoughtfully then she add with spirit as chet smile a superior sort of smile : i just guess you would not be able to spend a night in that sort of a gloomy old house away off from everybody without feel nervous goodness i would be expect every minute to have the ghost of dead and go indian rise up and scalp I think you do not believe in ghost gibe chet i do not flare billie add rather weakly : but i be not go to take any chance anyway but oh she add after a few minute of thoughtful silence i can not help it if it be ungrateful but i do wish aunt beatrice have leave I a few hundred dollar instead we have still get that old statue to worry about and three tower hall and the military academy chet be silent for a minute then he say with sudden inspiration : there be the watch aunt beatrice leave I you know mother say it be very valuable billie 's face light for a moment then fall again but you know uncle bill always say that you never could get anything like the value for old gold and anyway she rise and put a loving arm about he i could not let you do that for I chet dear i think you be the dearest brother in the world a few hour later laura jordon and violet farrington come over try they best not to look curious they have wait as long as they could but know about the death of billie 's queer old aunt and know also that billie as she namesake might expect some share of the fortune -- if there be one -- they have be fill with excitement and now as they run up the step to billie 's porch it be all they could do to keep from blurt out the question for both laura and violet have be perfectly certain that billie 's aunt beatrice have be some sort of miser who have pile up a immense fortune simply for they chum 's benefit just think violet have say in one of they excited conference on the subject what a wonderful thing it will be for billie just now when she be so worried about that miserable old statue and for chet too yes it would mean they could both go to school and we would all have such a good time laura have chime in goodness she have add with a chuckle i feel almost as much oblige to aunt beatrice as billie will but now that the great moment have come they sit decorously in billie 's porch swing and try to appear not at all curious as to whether billie have gather in a fortune since they last have see she or not and billie she little imp of mischief at work again guess the object of they visit and decide with a inward chuckle to keep they guess she manage to accomplish she purpose for just about five minute then laura unable to stand the suspense a moment more take the bit in she tooth and bolt for goodness ' sake billie she cry desperately why do not you tell we tell you what ask billie try to look innocent have not i be tell you -- yes about the way debbie make potato salad cry laura disgustedly you know well enough why we come why you come billie repeat look still more surprised why naturally i think you come to see I billie bradley if you do not tell we what we want to know this instant cry laura jump to she foot and make a threatening movement toward billie 's mischievous head i 'll -- i 'll -- oh i do not know what i 'll do be you go to be good be you yes yes cry billie pretend immense fright while she eye dance with mischief tell I what it be you want to know and i 'll do my best you highness this last in such a very humble tone that laura chuckle all right go ahead then she say while violet lean forward eagerly what do you aunt leave you straight from the shoulder billie murmur then as laura make another threatening gesture toward she add hurriedly : all right do not shoot and i 'll tell you everything only it will take time billie pause to allow the proper amount of emphasis then say in a deep whisper : she leave I a -- haunt house chapter x old furniture laura scream and violet jump clear out of she seat they stare at billie wide-eyed and open-mouthed wh-what do you say ask laura when she could get she breath i say say billie speak very distinctly and enjoy the sensation she have cause that aunt beatrice leave I a haunt house th-then i be not dream stammer violet while laura just continue to stare be th-that all billie be not that enough ask billie just as she father have do a few hour before it be either not enough or it be too much reply violet if i have to have the ghost i should want some very substantial compensation to make up for such housemate as those airy and playful lady and gentleman be say to make but it be a house persist billie and you know it be not everybody who can own a haunt house a haunt house say laura speaking in a hushed tone be it a real haunt house billie or be you fool well i do not know that it be a regular honest-to-goodness one admit billie reluctantly you see it be the house aunt beatrice use to live in when she be at home and she leave it to I with everything in it how perfectly glorious cry laura clap she hand with delight tell we about it billie what make you say it be haunt then do billie tell they all that she mother have tell she about she inheritance and if the truth be tell even add a few detail of she own however that may have be the fact remain that when she have finish the girl be as perfectly wild as chet have be to visit the queer old place and if need be even confront its ghost think cry laura clasp she hand rapturously just think of be able to roam all over that romantic old place and pry into corner -- and get you hand dirty interrupted billie drily why billie laura stop in she transport to regard she friend with wide eye be not you simply wild about the place too oh i suppose so say billie add as a shadow cross she face : the folk think i be awful all ` cept chet and i suppose i be -- but i would give the whole place tunnel spooky hallway ghostly attic and everything for just a few little hundred dollar bill the girl be silent for a few minute realize that billie 's strange inheritance do not do a thing toward solve the old problem of the broken statue and of go to board school then violet who be always think up some happy way out of a difficulty give a little bounce in the swing how do we know she cry as the girl look at she half hopefully but what you could sell some of the furniture in the old house and get enough to pay for the statue we might at that say billie she face light up again but mother say it must all be awfully old she add doubtfully all the better cry violet grow more and more enthusiastic you say that the old house date back to revolutionary time billie how do we know but what some of the old furniture would be very valuable as antique violet you be a wonder cry billie hug she so hard that she gasp for breath i would never have think of that in a thousand year now you speak of it she add thoughtfully i remember some antique furniture that uncle bill have in he library he say it be worth all sort of money but i would not give two cent for it well as long as somebody will what should we care cry laura flippantly maybe you 'll make a fortune for yourself after all billie oh and think what it would mean cried violet she eye shine it would mean that you could pay for that beastly old statue billie and it would mean that you could go to three tower with we and chet could go to the military academy with teddy and ferd laura add for goodness ' sake cry poor billie wildly you make I feel dizzy what be the use of get my hope all raise probably aunt beatrice 's furniture will be old fallen-to-piece stuff that nobody would give two cent for goodness what a wet blanket cry laura reproachfully well i would rather be a wet blanket retort billie desperately than to plan for a lot of fun and then be disappointed i -- i have be disappoint enough goodness know there be a quiver in billie 's brave little mouth and instinctively violet and laura put a arm about she we know what you mean say violet soothingly and if you do not want we to we 'll try not to hope too hard or if we do we 'll keep it to ourselves add laura and billie hug they fondly i do not want you to stop hope she cry plaintively and i do not want to be a wet blanket either i be just afraid that be all the girl swing back and forth in silence for a few minute then it be laura who speak when be you go out to look over you property billie why i do not know answer billie thoughtfully as soon as we can arrange it i suppose dad say it be a full day 's trip to get there so we would have to make some arrangement to stay over night could not you spend the night in the house suggest violet we might billie answer doubtfully although i must say i would not like to -- not the first night anyway i would want time to become acquaint with the place first if you will promise on you word of honor not to laugh at I say violet after another short silence i 'll tell you that i have another idea we will not laugh they promise and billie add eagerly : tell we about it violet even if we do laugh at you idea at first we generally end by follow they but you say you would not laugh this time violet remind she add as the worst threat she could think of : if you do i will not let you follow out my idea all right say billie as chet would say -- ` shoot ' why i be just think say violet look at they intently that we have not a plan in the world for spend we vacation -- vi cry laura joyfully not wait for she to finish you _ have _ a good idea this time you be go to say why not spend we vacation there at cherry corner ask billie surprised add with a demure glance : nobody seem to think of ask I about it and it be my property you know gracious be not she stick up cry laura flippantly i 'll have you know you be not the only property holder in the community billie bradley dad give I the deed to three lot in some outlandish place i do not even know where it be probably do not have anything else to do with they so wish they on you say billie cruelly should not wonder say laura add with a rueful little smile : i have never be able to find out whether it be a April fool 's present or not well i do not see what all that have to do with my proposition put in violet patiently now own up -- do not you think it be a great idea wonderful say billie unenthusiastically i do not know when i have ever hear of anything so brilliant there be something wrong with billie say violet begin to look anxious do not you think we would better send for a doctor laura i think you be the one who need a doctor retort billie who ever think of spend a vacation out in the wilderness a million mile or so from nowhere in a old tumbled-down house that make you flesh creep and the hair rise on you head just to look at it my but that must feel funny say laura the irrepressible that be one experience i never do have what ask billie have my hair rise on my head please excuse I billie as billie in she turn look threaten what be it you be about to say goose comment billie and then turn to violet do you really mean that about spend we vacation there she ask of course i do say violet and i do not see what be so very funny about it anyway we could take a chaperone and maybe the boy could come along too oh that would be fun cry billie then flush as she meet laura 's laughing eye i mean she add angry because of the blush that the place would not be quite so lonesome and horrid with the boy around oh yes we know say laura with a aggravating twinkle that make billie long to shake she we know all about it honey why think billie as she ignore the remark pretend not to hear it would laura always be such a goose as to make a joke of the very real friendship between she and teddy jordon she like teddy immensely and she be not go to stop like he even if laura would persist in be foolish then you will admit it be a good idea violet ask eagerly i like it all but billie only like the last part -- about the boy say laura and again billie have a wild desire to shake she it will be lot of fun she say begin to see the possibility in a vacation spend at cherry corner mother say the room be large and there be plenty of they so we could have as big a party as we want but i do not know how comfortable you would be she warn they who care about be comfortable on a lark like that cry laura airily the more uncomfortable we be the more fun we 'll have i say billie do not you think we would better take gyp along gyp be a thoroughbred bull terrier of which laura be the proud owner he might come in handy if any ghost show up the girl laugh at she as if gyp would be any good against ghost scoff violet why they would walk right through he well say laura with a little chuckle he could at least bark and let we know when they be come chapter xi billie win out but whom shall we get for a chaperone ask laura jordon after they have thoroughly discuss these new and startling plan for a vacation we do not want to get any one who be too old and grouchy and yet the folk probably would not let we go unless we do billie and violet laugh for they realize the truth of what she say we do seem to be ` up against it ' as ted say laura be always use she brother for a excuse for she own slang i can not think of a single person jolly enough to please we and dull enough to please the folk how about one of we mother violet suggest i know my mother would not do it say billie the last time i ask she to chaperone we girl she say she would as soon chaperone a trio of eel and when i ask mother laura add she say she would have nervous prostration in a week my we must have a terrible reputation sigh violet i never know we be as bad as all that oh i have a idea cry laura suddenly clap she hand well do not let it bite you murmur billie wait till you hear and you will not be so sarcastic retorted laura i be sure i have just the very person that we want oh who cry violet marium gilligan we housekeeper laura announce and then sit back with a air that say just as plainly as word : there how 's that for a inspiration marium gilligan you housekeeper billie repeat i think it be a rather good idea laura say violet be not mrs gilligan the one who be always play joke on she husband yes she be the funniest thing you ever see laura answer she eye begin to twinkle at the memory of some of mr gilligan 's escapade why one April fool 's day she set the clock back a hour and mr gilligan get up grumble that it be awfully dark for six o'clock then when he be all ready and be start out to work she tell he about it what do he do ask violet interested i know what i would have do if i would be in he place sniff billie i would have tie she in a chair and gag she and leave she there all day billie how barbaric cry violet what would you have do that for just so she could have think over she sin say billie with a chuckle i never do believe in practical joke and then another time say laura she eye twinkle she be upstairs straighten up the store-room when she pretend to have a tumble you know she weigh about two hundred pound -- at a rough guess i should say three hundred murmur billie for billie be in a very contrary mood that day and she come down with a thump that shake the chandelier laura go on ignore the interruption and when mr gilligan -- you know he weigh only a hundred and fifty and be about half she size -- now i _ know _ she weigh three hundred interpose billie again it be just a matter of arithmetic there she be with she head in she hand go on laura too much amuse by she story to notice the interruption sob as if she heart would break and when he get down on he knee to comfort she she just look at he with a grin and say : ` April fool ' well i should say he be say billie with another sniff and not only a April fool either she would try a trick like that just about once with I well anyway laura conclude i think she would be just the one to take on we trip with we she be jolly and full of fun and yet she be old enough and fat enough to please we father and mother what do you say do you suppose she be fat enough to scare away the ghost ask billie with a chuckle my but i would be sorry for any mistaken ghost that try to have a set-to with she laugh laura she have just laugh at they and say : ` shoo ghost do not bodder I ' all right let 's ask she decide billie now that we have make up we mind to change cherry corner into a summer resort i can not wait to get start if only the folk will be willing say violet look worried mother be funny about let I go anywhere away from home without she i guess all we parent be say billie then add with a sudden inspiration : i tell you what let 's all go together and ask they three be always stronger than one you do have a good idea once in awhile billie exclaimed laura jump out of the swing and hold out a hand to each of they come on we can not afford to waste any time where shall we go first ask violet to laura 's billie decide if we can get she mother and father to consent and then can get mr gilligan to go with we as chaperone we 'll have a pretty good argument to give we folk eh what gaily the girl set off to win laura 's parent over to they side and they be lucky enough to find mr jordon at home also teddy be there sit beside she on the veranda at sight of billie the boy jump to he foot and come run down to she hello he cry i be just come over you way to see if chet do not want to fight out we singles tournament he be two set ahead of I now and i be thirst for r-revenge i think he 'll give it to you all right laugh billie as violet and laura run up the step in front of they i have never see the time yet when chet refuse a tennis game all right i be off then he cry and be start away when she call he back do not you want to know about my -- inheritance she ask he with a demure little glance you what he cry then suddenly he grasp she two hand and swing they joyfully back and forth do you mean to say he cry that you aunt really leave you something what be it billie go on tell I if you want to hear all about it just stay around for a little while she laugh lead he toward the group at the other end of the porch two member of which be already in animated conversation may we get in on this she call interrupt a eloquent appeal on laura 's part oh yes come here do cry laura clutch at she dress and drag she into the circle mother 's begin to shake she head and you must not let she billie she 'll do anything for you mr jordon laugh and make room for billie on the divan beside she now perhaps you 'll tell I she say what this crazy daughter of mine be talk about so far i have get a sort of confused jumble of a haunt house and vacation and mr gilligan i must confess i do not see how the three can possibly be connect then billie tell all over again the story of she strange inheritance while mr jordon and teddy listen with interest and violet and laura now and then put in a word to plead they cause as for teddy he be so busy watch billie 's flush excited and altogether charming face that he more than once lose the trend of the conversation i do not wonder laura say mother could not refuse she anything he think i do not see how any one could refuse she when she talk and look that way billie 's a wonder that be all and in this case billie do indeed prove herself to be a wonder within half a hour she have not only win mr jordon over to they side but have persuade she to let the girl borrow mr gilligan for the time of they vacation of course mr jordon warn they as the girl be hug each other triumphantly we be not at all sure that mr gilligan will want to undertake such a expedition i could not blame she very much if she do not she add with a rueful little smile know you girl as she do i 'll get she cried laura and promptly put she word into action she appear the next minute drag a very much astonished housekeeper after she and proudly present she prize to she mother she say she be busy mother and could not stop laura say add with a bright smile : but i tell she it be something awfully important you want to say to she sure and i suppose the young girl be up to some of she trick say mr gilligan beam fondly upon she captor but i come with she thinking it possible you might really have something to say to I mrs jordon yes i have mr gilligan sit down will not you please it may take some time to persuade you -- and then and there begin another campaign however with mr jordon as a powerful ally the girl have little trouble in overcome mr gilligan 's objection and in the end come off with color fly now to see billie 's mother cry laura the girl hug mr jordon wave to they new chaperone and run gayly down the step teddy with a whisper word to he mother follow they say wait for a fellow can not you he cry and they turn to wait for he come on vi cry laura catch hold of violet 's arm and hurry forward ted and billie will get there some time we can not wait for they how do you like we new plan ask billie look up at he with sparkling eye i think you ought to have all sort of fun he tell she add with a funny little smile : but i can not quite make out yet where we fellow come in oh do not i tell you she ask surprised why you be go with we chapter xii great plan after permission for the outing be gain from all the parent concern everything be bustle and excitement for a week the girl spend the whole of every day at each other 's house plan they vacation talk about the clothes they would need to take with they and generally enjoy themselves as the time draw near they could hardly contain they excitement and the boy who have decide they would follow the girl some day later be almost as bad i do not see why you do not come with we billie pout one night when the entire crowd of young folk have assemble at she home it would be lot more fun on the train if you boy be with we but there be the tennis match we promise to play with the fellow of the south end chet point out for perhaps the hundredth time we could not back out of it at the last minute you know they would think we be afraid now how do you know violet point out but what we will all have be eat up by the ghost by the time you get there ghost scoff ferdinand stowing who be to go with chet and teddy i do not see where you girl get this ghost stuff just because a house happen to be old do not say it be haunt gosh listen to he cry chet indignantly some one be always take the joy out of life say you do not think it be haunt do you ask ferd in surprise of course not answer chet add with a chuckle : but i have my hope well so have i speak up laura promptly if there be not a family ghost or two about the place we just will not have any fun what be the use of go off into the wilderness to a spooky house if we be not go to meet a ghost well you know i do not promise any ghost say billie look up from a piece of fancy work she be embroider if you be disappointed you need not blame it on I laura or you either chet well i do not see why we should not have a good time without ghost put in violet in fact i do not think i would particularly enjoy meet somebody 's great-great-ancestor in the dark oh vi you give I the creep say laura with a little shiver billie do you think half a dozen middy ' would do we will not want to dress up very much no the ghost probably would not know the difference say teddy wickedly by the way boy he go on imitate laura 's tone to perfection that be one important thing we have not decide yet what be we go to wear you poor fish cry ferd throw a cushion at he who let you in stop wreck the furniture exclaim billie from she corner and do stop talk all at once you make my ear ache and besides i want to say something silence cry chet in a dramatically deep voice the queen be about to speak he say something that time whisper teddy in she ear and a little pink flush mount to billie 's face make she look prettier than ever it be so nice to have one 's friend like you why i be just think about the cooking she say do any of you boy know how to cook heaven listen at she cried ferd in alarm be she go to set we to work already -- before we get there what be the idea billie well reply billie bite off she thread calmly we have to eat while we be there you know no cry chet sarcastically you may sweet sister but not we we be too ethereal say be he insulting we cry ferd indignantly say that again i dare you -- oh for goodness ' sake keep still cry laura clap she hand to she ear you make I deaf dumb and blind now billie what be you go to say simply that since we do have to eat chet or anybody else to the contrary she look at she brother and dimpled adorably we will have to decide who be go to do the cooking why i suppose we 'll take we turn at it as we have do before when we have be camp say laura in surprise i know but what i want to find out be be the boy go to do any of the work good land be she ask we to cook asked ferd why billie we do not know a thing about it and do not want to learn added chet fervently oh you big fibber billie 's eye dance as she look at they i remember -- oh i have a very good memory and she glance sideways at teddy who be begin to look uncomfortable i remember a certain person tell I how beautifully you boy cook while you be at camp say billie that be not fair cry teddy with a guilty note in he voice that make he two comrade look at he accusingly aha we see the villain cry ferd threateningly what 'll we do with he chet nothing 's bad enough for such a crime say chet ruefully what do you make such a break for ted i think i would bring you up better gee billie do you see what you have let I in for say ted miserably but billie only regard he with laugh eye while laura and violet seem to be enjoy the situation immensely i do not see what i do billie reply innocently i think i be pay you boy a compliment by say that you could cook well but we can not cry ferd seize the opportunity eagerly gee billie you could not eat the awful mess we make why you be a good cook -- billie raise a cushion threateningly in the air none of that none of that she warn he we see through you villain say she must think you be one of the cherry corner ghost break in teddy whimsically it be pretty hard on a fellow when you can see through he billie but honest you could not ferd insist not to be defeat in this one last hope really i do not know enough about a egg to take the shell off when i fry it idiot cry billie throw the pillow at he in earnest who ever hear of fried egg in the shell i do cry ferd unabashed by the laughter and the scornful glance turn he way lady and gentleman you see before you to-night the man that invent it well but nobody have answer my question say billie demurely after the laughter have subside be the boy go to help cook or be they not i tell you what say chet desperately we 'll cook if you will promise to eat it billie cry laura in alarm do not make any rash promise they would probably put some awful thing into the food on purpose laura that be some idea cry ferd look at she admiringly while teddy and chet chuckle thanks we never would have think of that ourselves well say billie with a little chuckle i imagine we would rather eat we own cooking anyway so you need not worry only she add warningly as they sigh with relief there be one thing you _ will _ have to do and what be that they cry fearfully help wash the dish she say and in she tone be no relent and so even to the impatient girl the time pass quickly until at last the great day arrive it be a wonderful day sunshiny and warm without be too hot and all three of they be up with the bird they be to catch the eight o'clock morning train and so they have no time to waste in bed billie be in a joyful mood as she get herself into the pretty new dress she be to wear on the trip she run around the room hum to herself and every once in a while do a little dance step as she realize that they be at last to embark upon they adventure and a adventure she somehow feel sure it be to be for even though contrary to chet 's hope and she smile as she think of he they do not meet with ghost at cherry corner there would be the fun of see for the first time she inheritance it might be a queer old house and the contents and the grounds about it might be of small value but there be a wonderful thrill nevertheless in be the owner of it and there be the fact that it date back to revolutionary time it be really historic and -- it all belong to she no wonder she sing as she give a last fond pat to the pretty dress and tuck a wander little strand of hair into place she eye dance and she face be flush but billie never notice how pretty she be she be the first in the dining-room that morning but she mother soon come in scatter advice as she come and all through the meal billie try hard to listen dutifully to all the must not and do not do but all the time she eye be on the clock and she mind be say over and over again : in just half a hour we 'll be on the train in just half a hour we 'll be on the train then chet come in and she father and finding that it be almost train time postpone they breakfast to see she off a few minute later they start off to pick up the girl on the way to the station they find they wait impatiently and wildly eager to be off about a block from the station they hear the whistle of the train and the girl would run for it though they really have plenty of time at last they be in the train with the boy and they parent wave to they then suddenly they realize that they be move they be actually on they way give my regard to the ghost cry chet as the train move off and do not scare they all off before i get there chapter xiii cherry corner as the train draw out of the station

look curiously at billie do you brother mean by say not to scare away the ghost before he get there oh laugh billie he have a sort of idea that the house at cherry corner be inhabit by spirit -- just because mother say that the hall and room be spooky he will be terribly disappoint if he do not see half a dozen ghost well i would not say violet with a shudder for now that they be on the way to they adventure she courage be begin to fail ghost repeat mr gilligan with a fun-loving light in she eye better not any ghost come around I or i 'll give 'em a taste of the rolling pin the girl laugh the picture of mr maria gilligan assault a ghost with a rolling pin be indeed a funny one well say billie a little later as she start to unpin she hat i do not know about you girl but i be go to be comfortable we have a long ride before we i suppose we might as well take off we hat and stay awhile agree laura follow suit say girl she add as she stick she hat up in the rack above she head i just think of something last night be it anything important ask billie with a wicked little look i do not know whether you would think so laura retorted calmly i be wonder why we do not take the night train that reach roland the nearest station to cherry corner in the morning that would have be a good idea would not it say billie now we will reach the house after dark when all the spook be roam add laura in a ghostly voice goodness cry violet turn uncomfortably in she seat if you girl do not stop talk about ghost i 'll just get out and go home get you car fare ask laura no but i could always walk return violet and i would almost rather do it than spend the night in the company of ghost well you would better decide in a hurry say billie with a chuckle because the longer you take to make up you mind the farther you will have to walk back all right say violet suddenly goad into a unusual firmness you promise I this minute that you will not say another word about ghost until we get there or i 'll get off at the very next station and walk back it be ten mile laura warn she i do not care if it be twenty she return stoutly and laughingly the girl promise it would be a crime to wear out those perfectly good shoe say laura look at violet 's trim suede footgear especially with price go up billie groan i think i 'll have to try violet 's trick she say if anybody mention the high cost of live to I while we be away on this vacation i 'll get out and walk home i do not care if it be a hundred mile go up laugh laura but they promise just the same for underneath billie 's lightness they know that she be still puzzling she wit for some way to pay for that broken statue here come a man with magazine say laura we have better get a couple to pass the time away a all-day trip be pretty tiresome at least i have hear mother say so they buy the magazine but they might just as well not have do so for when they reach roland late that afternoon they have hardly peep inside the cover the scenery be so beautiful and wild the whole trip be so wonderfully novel that the time fly and before they realize it they have reach the station next to roland goodness i do not think we be anywhere near there yet cry violet as she begin to gather up she thing i never know a day to go so quickly in my life billie be these you candy you would better not leave they on the seat who say i be go to cry billie rescue she sweet just as laura be in the act of sit on they here there be just room for they in the corner of my grip mr gilligan have you get the trunk check i hope so say the woman open

powerson that first build the house must have expect to entertain lot of company exclaim violet look with wonder at the row of curtained cupboard i wonder if there be dish in all of they we have not time to look now say mr gilligan stop she as she be about to peep inside a closet we can do all that to-morrow when we have daylight ah here be the kitchen she add as she step into a huge room -- the regular type of a very old kitchen that could be use as sitting-room as well gracious it be a house cry billie move she candle about in a effort to light up the corner of the place there be not any end to it i be glad i do not have to keep it clean as a steady job say mr gilligan grimly now girl let 's go back and find we two friend with the provision i do not know how you feel about it but as

fellow would clear out and of course the young one would not stay alone i should not have trust they out of my sight she begin pick up bag and package and the girl follow suit before very long they have gather up all the provision and be stagger back arm laden toward the house they find they way back to the kitchen again and drop the thing thankfully on the table now for something to eat cry laura what shall we have mr gilligan i suppose it will have to be a cold supper she add look about for some means of cooking and discover only a immense coal stove i suppose it would take forever to make a fire in that say billie indicate the stove and think longingly of hot steak and potato even if they have any coal here 's plenty of coal say mr gilligan who have be find thing out in she own practical and efficient way and here be plenty of wood and old newspaper to start it go indeed and we be not go to have any cold supper she add while in imagination the girl already be sniff the aroma

cry laura come on girl let 's see if we can find enough dish to set the table so they go gayly to work set the table and peel potato which mr gilligan proceed to fry and enjoy themselves immensely shall we eat in the kitchen ask violet pause with a pile of plate in she hand or shall we be very proper and eat in the dining-room oh the kitchen 's a lot more cheerful say billie shiver a little in spite of herself as she think of the dark rather dreary room just the other side of the door besides what we want we want in a hurry say laura take the dish from violet and set they decidedly on the table to-morrow will be time enough to put on air just now all i want to do be to eat while they be wait for the supper to cook and after they have do as much as they could toward its preparation the girl look about the kitchen and the gloomy dining room a bit the latter room be dark and cheerless and they wonder that any one should have select it for a dining room the woodwork be all of black walnut and there be much of it the window frame and door frame be heavy and ornate and the room be wainscote with the same dark wood the room be large too and there be window at one end only and that toward the north oh come let we get out of here finally cry laura grabbing each of the other girl by a arm and run with they out into the more cheerful kitchen oh that steak cry billie longingly as she drift over to the stove be not it nearly do mr gilligan this be cruelty to animal mr gilligan chuckle and turn the steak on the other side almost ready now she say add another piece of butter to the golden browned potato have you girl cut the cake it be in one of the package i bring in -- on the end of the table do not cut it all now she warn as there be a joyful rush for the cake we want some of it leave for to-morrow the girl do not cut it all -- quite but they do cut a good two-third of it -- and eat it all too it be a strange sort of meal -- the candle-lit kitchen the hastily set table the face of the girl and mr gilligan bring out in bold relief by the flicker candle light the meal be delicious and the girl eat ravenously but from time to time one of they would shift uneasily in she seat and look nervously over she shoulder into the dark corner of the room instead of the dinner make they more courageous it seem to be have the opposite effect for when they have finish they cake and the steam hot coffee they find themselves talk in whisper as if they be afraid of the sound of they own voice billie suddenly realize this speak aloud and laura and violet jump nervously what be the matter with we billie ask she voice sound strangely loud and unnatural even to herself in the hushed stillness all about we never use to be so awfully quiet and i be sure we do not have to whisper about it i -- i suppose shivered violet that it be because everything else be so quiet it sort of have its effect on we i wish she add with a sudden little outburst unusual in violet that that horrid old driver have not tell we that horrid story i catch myself listen for noise all the time but that be foolish say mr gilligan in that every-day matter-of-fact tone that never fail to give the girl courage there be not one of we who believe anything he say so why let it worry we come on she say rise and begin to gather together the dish we 'll get these thing put away in a hurry and then go up to bed i think a good night 's rest be what you need oh but i do not want to go up in the spooky upstairs part whisper violet to billie as she scrape some odds and end off on a plate oh why do not

shadow on the wall the house after that noise be as still as a tomb and despite the comforting presence of they valiant chaperone the girl keep close together for protection d-do you suppose it be only a s-suitcase stammer violet do not whisper in my ear -- you tickle hiss billie and again they laugh hysterically look out now go slow mr gilligan be caution they we do not want to stumble over this luggage and get a broken leg or two ouch she exclaim as she stub she toe against something hard i guess i be the first casualty she bent down to find what she have stumble against while the girl glance nervously into the corner of the hall which the flicker candle light only seem to make more dark goodness if we feel like this now i do not see how we be ever go to spend the night here cry laura shiver a little i do not believe i 'll be able to sleep a wink oh yes you will say billie try hard to make she voice sound natural and unconcerned we be all so tired we could not help sleep

delight the girl discover that it also be ready for occupancy goodness i wonder who could have do it muse violet as she drop down on the edge of the bed and regard the girl wonderingly maybe it be a

remark violet as she be arrange she hair before a elaborately frame old mirror and it surely be quite clean but it be horribly gloomy just as mother say billie be regard the dingy woodwork now almost black with age and the huge four-poster with its funereal canopied top and the large picture of dead and go ancestor that adorn the wall the only really good thing in the whole room be the table and chair they look she add hopefully as if they might bring in a little money perhaps i 'll be able to pay for the statue after all oh and i be just crazy to see the rest of the house by daylight say laura clap she hand come on you slow poke be not you ever go to be ready we be ready now say billie put a arm about violet and hurry she to the door oh be that bacon i smell -- and coffee she ask as

minute before i taste that same bacon and egg when they reach the lower hall they be surprise to see that it look almost as gloomy and forbid as it have the night before in spite of the fact that the front door be open and sunlight be streaming through ugh say laura with a shudder i do not wonder that they have gloomy disposition in the old day if they have to live in house like these it be enough to give one the creep i be glad you like my property so much say billie with a demure little smile i have not hear you say one nice thing about it yet we have treat we hostess rather rudely have not we laugh violet put a arm about billie and draw she out into the sunshine but really billie we be quite sure that you do not like it any better than we do and you be quite right billie assure she then

would be big enough to make the noise they have hear the night before the plot thicken say laura as they start back to the house to eat the bacon and egg and biscuit we hear a car but see no trace of it it must have be a spirit car say violet add with a plaintive little sigh that make the girl laugh : in spite of all my perfectly good training i be begin to believe in ghost after breakfast the girl roam around the big house nose into corner call each other 's attention to this and that queer ornament or article of furniture -- and there be plenty of they -- and otherwise thoroughly enjoy themselves but as yet they do not venture into the gloomy cellar with its mysterious tunnel in the drawing-room they find a queer old piano which violet declare must date back farther than revolutionary day and which billie amid gibe and laughter from she chum try to play after she have try and fail on half a dozen different composition she give up the attempt and they roam upstairs look through one room after another until billie accidentally open the door that lead to the attic here 's where we want to go girl she cry mother say this be the spookiest place in the whole house -- except the cellar have not we better get mr gilligan to go with we ask violet hold back after last night i have have enough spooky experience to last I a week oh come on cried laura run ahead of they

ghost around here without laura what be that if you be go to scare I again begin laura but it be billie this time who command silence hush i do hear something queer she say and all three listen intently it come again a weird little noise like the brushing of wing against some hard object and the girl scarcely dare to breathe then out into the hot open attic flutter a tiny little object with webbed wing and the body of a mouse a bat cry laura sink down weakly and shake with hysterical laughter oh girl if i have to stay here another week i 'll just die of heart failure -- i know i will chapter xviii a fish story the day pass without further scare until the time finally come when the boy be to arrive during those day the girl roam around the farm attach to cherry corner they find it for the most part a rocky place with here and there dense patch of wood there be a brook and in this they see some small fish dart about maybe the boy will want to go fishing when they come suggest billie the cherry tree also interest the chum -- there be so many of they the late cherry be ripe and they spend a day in pick they don overalls for that purpose mr gilligan take the fruit and make several delicious pie and also a number of tart the place be certainly a lonesome one only once do they see two man tramp by the man eye the girl curiously but tramp on without speak certainly not very sociable be violet 's comment at last come the time when the boy be to arrive the girl be in a fever of excitement and anticipation for they know that they would have just about twice as much fun with the boy as without they we can go on picnic say laura put on she hat over one eye as she have a habit of do when unusually excite and long tramp in the wood and -- oh all sort of thing i wonder if that old wagon will ever come say violet look anxiously down the road if it do not hurry we 'll be too late to meet the train the boy who daily bring they provision from the village have be commission to send the antiquated carriage after the girl so that they could get down to the village in time to meet the early train but the girl with no confidence in the country lad 's memory have be sure he would forget all about it if he do not come pretty soon the boy will get off the train with no one to meet they violet go on worry they will not know where to go goodness they 'll know where to go just as well as we do say billie regard herself sideways in the mirror to be sure she have not forget anything they be not infant you know here it come here it come sing out laura from she place at the window be you ready girl the answer be a concerted rush for the stair and in another minute the girl be out in the bright sunlight run to meet the stage the driver who have be nod in he seat look up as if surprise at so much energy so early in the morning oh please hurry cry billie exasperate at the stupid look on the boy 's face do not you know that we be late already no be you be not late he assure she in a voice that match he manner the ten-thirty train 's always ` bout half a hour late anyways well that be just the reason it will probably be on time this morning remark billie scramble in after the girl when i be late the train be always early please hurry she add and the driver cluck half-heartedly to he team all the way down they worry for fear they would be late but when they reach roland at last they find that they rural driver know the habit of train in that part of the country better than they do for they have a full thirty-five minute to wait however they rouse from they despondent attitude when they hear a familiar whistle in the distance and begin automatically to straighten they hat suppose they make up they mind not to come on this train violet suggest but laura cut in hastily if you be go to start worry all over again about something different she say i 'll put you on the track and let the train run over you at this dire threat violet stop worry vocally at least and they stand first on one foot then on the other eagerly watch the train as it round a curve and come pound down toward they it have hardly draw up to the station with a screech of brake and come to a standstill before a cyclonic trio of boy leap from one of the rear car and come dash toward the girl wave hat and bag and various other personal article high in the air as they come i say but it be bully of you girl to come to meet we shout ferd stowing as they come within hail distance it be more than we expect eh fellow sure do not think you would be up yet answer teddy look exceedingly handsome -- at least to billie up yet cry billie try to look angry which she could not do because she be altogether too happy and excited i do not know where you boy get you idea anyway out of we brilliant cranium say ferd modestly i say girl where do we go from here there be a old carriage that look as if it be on its last leg laugh violet lead the way back to where the antiquated vehicle and its sleepy driver await they we come up in it but i do not know how we be all go to squeeze into it go back say fellow we forget to get we trunk say chet interrupt himself in the midst of a earnest conversation with he sister give I you check and i 'll go back and see about they but if there be not room for we how be we ever go to get we baggage to the house teddy ask we 'll get the wagon that take ours up laura answer we have get to get some provision anyway so with a great deal of fun and laughter they look up the ancient wagon and go to the general store to get a formidable supply of provision look as if you be buy the store out teddy remark as billie pull out a long list of item what be the big idea you boy say billie dimple at he we know what kind of appetite you would bring along with you so we decide on safety first now we know you girl be bright say ferd admiringly and billie make a face at he the ride to the house be one big lark the boy sit on the trunk among the provision and the girl go off into gale of merriment at they comical effort not to step on the egg or fall among the fruit they be have such a awfully good time that even the solemn old driver have to join in the fun at last they reach billie 's house and with much ceremony the boy jump down from the wagon and run to the carriage to help the girl out and all they get for they pain be scorn and derision on the part of the girl get out of the way before i step on you little speck of dust laura cry haughtily to ferd who turn up he collar and slunk along toward the house as though he humiliation be more than he could bear amid shout of laughter from the merry crowd that follow he that be the way to treat 'em laura chet cry but at that ferd turn upon he say you would better look out he say belligerently i can not hit a lady -- a which murmur billie with a wicked glance in laura 's direction for call I name continue ferd glaring at chet who begin to tremble in mock fright but there be nothing to keep I from wipe the ground up -- yes there be it be my ground and i will not have it wipe up say billie decidedly at which ferd have to laugh and the mock war come to a close say this be some classy place what say chet stop in front of the rambling old house and regard it admiringly have you meet with any ghost yet girl oh half a dozen say laura indifferently and he be just about to ask some more question when mr gilligan meet they at the door and begin give instruction after that there be nothing to do but obey and the boy and girl do not meet again until lunch time then they regard each other across the table joyfully i say let 's go for a tramp in the wood this afternoon ferd suggest after he and the other lad have take a look around the house this be the prettiest wildest country i have ever see and i would like to nose about a little but we think you would like to see what the attic and cellar look like say billie we have the afternoon all plan let 's do that to-morrow ferd beg boyishly this be too nice a day to spend indoors so it be decide to go outside and as soon as the dinner dish be clear away -- at which the boy assist without so much as a grumble -- the young folk start out on they tour of discovery the girl have spend much of they time in the old house since they arrival for they have find a almost inexhaustible supply of strange corner and unexpected room and peculiar ornament that have fascinate they but to-day as they feel the warm sunshine on they head as the wind caress they face and the scent of the woodland bath they in perfume they be glad they have let the boy have they way and have decide to spend the glorious afternoon in the open do you win the tennis singles billie ask of teddy as she stop to smell a bunch of strange flower i be root for you be you ask teddy eagerly for you -- and chet she add demurely and laugh to see he face fall but do you she ask what win the tennis singles silly can not you remember a thing two seconds why yes we do he answer absently he gray eye on billie 's lovely mischievous face in fact we just run ring around they i guess -- he stop short as they come upon the other young people a couple of bearded man have come out of the wood and confront the crowd each man carry a heavy club they be the fellow who have once pass the girl without speak you can not go any further this way one of they say in a rather gruff tone we be grow a new variety of corn and want to keep the seed to ourselves what be that demand chet in astonishment you hear what i say you can not stay here and you can not go that way you want to get out of here growl the second man come move on you can not steal any of we corn-growing secret move on and the first man shake he club suggestively the strange man look ugly and the boy and girl after a pause turn off in another direction humph grunt ted with a curious glance at the place where the man have be they make a mistake that be not a corn story it be a fish story maybe return billie but what do it mean chapter xix in the dead of the night there be so much of interest about the house and outside of it that a week pass almost before the young folk know it the boy be for explore the cellar and do so one fine day take the girl along they have a flashlight a lantern and some candle and all these combine give they quite a illumination but the girl keep close to the boy for the cellar be certainly a creepy place with its many nook and corner and dark closet they manage to find two tunnel one about fifty foot long and the other close to a hundred cave in cried chet in disgust he be right dirt and rock fill the opening both of which be quite wet i 'll bet they lead to the brook remark teddy when the indian make a raid the settler could crawl through one tunnel or the other and so hide in the brook i think ted must be right say ferd there be but little of value in the cellar old tool rust with age and some empty bottle and jug and that be about all it be awfully musty say billie presently i be go upstairs and out into the sunshine and she go and the other soon follow billie have receive the address of miss begg the school-teacher it have be send to she address at home and forward by mr bradley now i guess i 'll have to write that letter to the teacher and explain all about the broken statue say billie dismally oh dear i wish i do not have to do it it be too bad we have not the money to pay for the old thing come from chet can not we sell some of this stuff it must be worth something but who will buy it i do not know there be a long consultation among the girl and at last billie manage to write the letter there she say when she have give it to the store boy to post now i feel better the confession part of it be off my mind anyway if i can only pay for the old statue -- or buy another one like it -- i 'll be happy -- or nearly happy she add the nearly happy as the thought come to she that even with the broken statue pay for and off she mind she have still another ordeal before she in a couple of week they vacation would be up at cherry corner and soon after that she would have to see violet and laura and the boy except poor chet go off to board school while she and she brother would be leave behind oh well she would not think of that just yet they could at least enjoy the time they be to spend at cherry corner and they do enjoy it there be never a minute of the day for which something interesting be not plan then one night when they have almost forget that the house be suppose to be haunt they have a experience that bring back all they old fear of the place -- and then some as teddy say billie sit up in bed suddenly with the familiar chilly feeling up and down she spine and she hair show a tendency to pull away from she prickly scalp the piano be sound -- all the way from treble to bass and it be the middle of the night with everybody in bed she put out a hand and shake laura and violet to consciousness oh girl it _ be _ the ghost this time she say in a scared whisper that make they wide awake in a instant it -- it be play the piano a -- a musical ghost giggle laura hysterically but billie pinch she into silence keep still she cry there it be again the girl listen to the eeriest weirdest music they have ever hear and violet slip shiver under the cover and hide she face with the sheet c-come out of that cry billie pull at the sheet what g-good do you suppose it be go to do to put the sheet over you head come on i be go to investigate with sudden determination she slip out of bed and stand up billie gasp laura you be never go to go down there i be go to call the boy say billie who despite all she determination could hardly stand up she knee tremble so we 'll all go and rout that old ghost he be get to she add with a hysterical giggle that match laura 's get off my piano fearfully the girl watch she start into mr gilligan 's room then laura push down the cover and get to she foot if billie be not afraid she say stoutly i do not see why i should be be you come vi i s-suppose so say poor violet more afraid of be leave alone than of face the ghost in company with the other if you be go i -- i have get to so it be that mr gilligan be startle to find three ghostly scared figure stand by she bed call nervously to she to please wake up for goodness ' sake what be the matter she say rub she eye and stare at they sleepily have you hear you ghostly motor again oh much worse cry violet we hear a ghost play a piano say laura listen command billie there it go again oh mrs gilligan i be f-frightened mr gilligan listen and even she matter-of-fact humorous irishwoman that she be feel that same strange tendency on the part of she hair to stand up straight in the air well here be the time for my roll pin she say jump out of bed and wrap a kimono hastily about she we 'll call the boy and see what that piano think it be do anyway so they call the boy the three lad be on tiptoe with excitement at the thought of a actual encounter with a ghost and a musical ghost at that crow ferd as they start down the stair with the girl follow cautiously and hold they candle over they head say do not make so much noise cry chet in a stage whisper you 'll frighten he ghostship away i would not miss see a real ghost for anything you could offer I in here fellow here be the piano ferd direct and they heart in they mouth the girl watch they go into the dark room ouch hang that chair they hear ferd cry out come on with those light girl i be ruin all the furniture nervously the girl follow they in throw the light of the candle on the old piano but as far as they could see nothing have be disturb the ancient instrument stand as dignified and aloof as ever and in the whole room not a chair be out of place nothing here say chet look disappointed say the girl promise we a regular show fellow and they have not come across what shall we do to 'em ask teddy look almost equally disappointed but we hear it say billie shiver with excitement it be just as if somebody have take the back of he finger laura add and run it all the way down the keyboard from the top note of the treble to the last note of the bass oh you must have be dream say ferd open the piano to examine it inside no they be not dream say mr gilligan seriously because i be very much awake when i hear it you hear it too ask chet begin to be interested again i certainly do say mr gilligan with a grimness that leave no room for doubt and i be not give to imagine thing either well i move we look around a bit suggest ferd who be always eager for action the ghost may have retreat to the dining-room or something -- no siree say violet decidedly if the rest of you want to go roam all over this gloomy old place at night you can do it but you 'll have to leave I out vi 's right say mr gilligan just as the boy be about to protest there be not any use go into this thing any further to-night and get the girl all upset i 'll stay down here awhile and see what i can see let I stay with you ask chet eagerly and I and I ferd and teddy speak almost in the same breath no i want you all to go up and get into bed say mr gilligan decidedly if i see anything she add with a grim smile anything that look like a ghost that be i 'll call you that be a promise say chet look back over he shoulder as he reluctantly follow the other upstairs because if i should miss get a look at that ghost i would be disappoint for life well i have have enough of spook to last _ I _ forever say laura with a shivery glance over she shoulder as the boy leave the girl at they door and start off down the hall if that piano begin to play itself again to-night i 'll just die that be all there be to it the girl creep into bed careful to leave they candle burn you know billie say violet in a awed little voice this thing be really get serious i should say so agreed laura draw the bed clothes a little tighter about she well it be not my fault be it ask billie i do not ask aunt beatrice to leave I a haunt house and anyway she add very truthfully it be you laura who first suggest come here yes go on violet accusingly and it be you who say you would be disappoint if you do not see a ghost or two laura groan what be the use of hold thing up against I that i say when i be young and foolish she ask anyway i do not think we would really see anything well we have not say billie all we have do be to hear thing -- but we have hear plenty sigh violet there what be that the girl listen feeling almost ready to scream but could hear nothing but the sighing of the wind in the tree top only the wind silly say laura then add with a almost comfortable feeling at the thought : mr gilligan 's on guard anyway yes say violet add with a sigh that seem to come from she very toe : i only hope the piano do not swallow she up before morning i have come to expect almost anything chapter xx the motor again the piano do not swallow mr gilligan up and as a matter of fact the good woman do not stand guard until morning half a hour of sit alone in that gloomy room watch a piano that have play itself be enough to ruin even she seasoned nerve once back in she room she scold herself for be such a idiot laugh at she fear and be a normal healthy woman fall almost instantly to sleep in the morning the girl themselves feel somewhat incline to laugh at the fright they have have and yet they know that what have happen have be no figment of they imagination the sound though weird and eerie have be real -- even mr gilligan would testify to that well i tell you what we ought to do say ferd as he sit down to a huge plateful of breakfast we fellow ought to take turn and turn about keep watch there must be some reason for the noise the girl hear and i will not be happy until we find out what it be i think you have the right idea reply chet decidedly the only condition i make be that i be allow to stand the first watch you 'll do nothing of the kind any of you break in mr gilligan with that slight tightening of she upper lip that the girl and boy have come to know -- and respect that be a fine way to see all sort of thing that be not and hear all sort of thing that never happen sit up in the dark wait for something to happen i guess not but we can not just sit back and let the piano perform like that every night can we ask ferd in a argumentative tone i would rather stay awake part of the night than all of it do not you even want to solve the mystery ask chet in a aggrieved voice mystery -- humph grunt mr gilligan feeling very brave and disdainful in the bright sunshine i do not believe there be a bit of mystery in the whole thing then what make the piano play teddy insist you say yourself that you hear it oh i hear it all right say mr gilligan help herself to more jam there be not any doubt about that but i have a idea what cause it all right oh tell we they cry eagerly but they chaperone shake she head determinedly while she lip become still tighter no indeed i will not tell you she say add with a little chuckle : i want to try it out myself first for i know that if i tell you young one about it you would only laugh and i do not like be laugh at but we would not laugh billie assure she earnestly really mr gilligan we 'll promise on we word of honor not to so much as even smile get out with you promise say mr gilligan relapse into she brogue i do be know you better i 'll try it to-night she add graciously and if it do not work i 'll tell you about it in the morning i suppose here 's where i spend another sleepless night say violet dolefully help herself to more biscuit oh well i be get so i can do without sleep now well you do not look as if you would ever lose a wink in you life say chet glancing at she admiringly for it be a open secret with the boy and girl of north bend that chet rather especially like tall dark peace-loving violet farrington -- perhaps because she be so much like himself violet blush prettily at this complimentary remark and the girl look at she teasingly who be it that say something or other be blind ask laura wickedly and violet kick she under the table peace my child say billie we be have enough trouble with ghost and thing without start a war among ourselves who 'll have some more jelly there be a simultaneous shout of approval and the jelly dish begin its fourth round of the table however they do at last get through eating and wander out on the front porch where mr gilligan could not scoff at they idea to discuss the doings of the night before but it be only a little while later that mr gilligan put another damper on they fun by announce that some one would have to go to town for more provision the boy have fail to come that morning and they supply of can goods be run dangerously low let 's all go chet suggest we could walk down and ride back but oh chet it be so frightfully hot billie object i be sure we would get sunstroke or something yes it be a terribly long walk add violet well we could wait till toward evening say ferd it would not be so scorching then i admit he add take a slanting squint at the sun that even i be not eager to take a long hike just now but toward evening we 'll be prepare supper object laura and the boy throw up they hand in despair well then we 'll just have to go without you say teddy but it would be lot more fun if you would come this last be say to billie and for she ear alone that afternoon the girl watch the boy down the road till they be out of sight then turn back to the house with a strangely lonesome feeling you know say violet pause on the doorstep and look back at the girl with a rather sober face i have a sort of feeling that something 's go to happen well you would better get rid of it right away retort laura we do not want anything more to happen -- especially when the boy be away this time violet prove to be right something do happen it be after dark the boy have not yet get back from the village and the girl be set the table in the kitchen -- they have never find the courage to eat in the gloomy dining-room -- when violet set a dish down on the table with a bang that make the girl start and look at she in surprise as for violet she be too scared to speak for a moment then she stammer out : the strange motor car she say while billie and laura stare at she i think i hear it before -- sh-h cry billie and they listen hardly daring to breathe there be the same strange humming sound that have so startled they on they first night in the house only this time instead of come from a distance and pass by the noise seem to get louder then softer louder and softer as if whatever it be be approach and retreat at regular interval at that moment mr gilligan come into the room and the girl call to she to listen also that she ask with a little laugh why that be a automobile of course and start for the front door only i must say it be behave mighty queer but when they open the door and look out into the rocky road there be no sign of a automobile and yet the hum sound still keep on as they listen wide-eyed the noise grow softer and softer and gradually die away in the distance the girl look at each other wonderingly then it be billie who offer a solution might not it be a aeroplane a aeroplane in this part of the country laura be incline to scoff at the idea but mr gilligan and violet both stand up for billie they be about to enter into a heated argument when they see the wagon that have by this time become familiar to they come down the road with the boy seat in it or hang to it in characteristic attitude the girl run out to they and deluge the lad with question before they have time to learn what it be all about a motor car ask chet no we do not pass a soul on the way up here when the girl have pour into they interested ear the story of the queer hum sound that have just repeat itself they agree to one man to billie 's suggestion that it be very probably a aeroplane i 'll tell you what we 'll do next time we hear it say teddy as the boy pick up the provision they have bring and start toward the house we 'll go up on the roof then we 'll pretty soon see whether it be a ghost or the real thing and in the meantime suggest chet sniff the air hungrily how about some supper chapter xxi both at once it be not long before there come a recurrence of the strange humming noise which have so disturbed the girl it be only a few night later that chet sit up in bed with the joyful feeling that here at last be a chance to investigate at least one of the ghost that haunt the homestead at cherry corner ferd teddy wake up what be the matter be you dead he call to the boy the latter reluctantly open they eye and look at he reproachfully can not you let a fellow sleep teddy ask but chet with no ceremony whatever haul he bodily out of bed and set he on he foot do not talk he order run as fast as you can to the roof before we miss it what be you rave about ask ferd although both he and teddy start obediently toward the attic stair if you would not talk so much you could hear it chet answer push up a trap door that lead to a small square platform on the roof it be the motor sound the girl hear and that scared they so it be for a fact cry teddy in a joyful whisper and it be come right near fellow too it be a aeroplane all right say ferd with conviction nothing else ever make a noise like that say what be you do up there a girl 's voice hail they from the bottom of the step and chet think he recognize it as billie 's be you walk in you sleep or have you go crazy come down here quick we need you keep still chet yell back we be look for you aeroplane ghost can not you hear it yes but oh chet billie 's voice be tremulous the piano be play itself again will not you come down we be afraid to stay here all alone great scott all the spirit be roam at once cry teddy strain he eye to see through the darkness as the humming of the motor come nearer there be not that it cry ferd point eagerly through the tree toward a little patch of sky palely illumine with star i think i see it say chet rub he eye impatiently it be so confoundedly dark -- oh will not you please come down wail billie 's voice from the spooky depths of the attic i 'll die of fright if i have to stay here another minute this appeal move the boy and they begin reluctantly to descend the ladder keep they eye all the time on the pale patch of sky where be the other ask teddy as he reach billie 's side they be down look for the ghost answer billie as she run down the stair in front of they they send I to get you boy and i find you go mr gilligan she add with a hysterical giggle have the broom and laura have the poker maybe we would better stop on the way and gather up a few bedpost suggest ferd as they take the last flight of stair on a run and land in the lower hall hello do you find anything sing out chet as the girl look scared but valiant come out to meet they where 's mr gilligan inside say violet there be not a thing to be see any more than there be the other night i be absolutely positive now that it must be a ghost well if it be he be get a sense of humor say mr gilligan rise from she knee where she have be peer into the corner behind the piano i have hear of all sort of spirit but i never hear of one who insist upon play the piano in the dead of night he must have be a musician in he life time suggest chet that be the reason he come and haunt the piano well i do not see why he do not choose a regular piano to haunt say billie feeling irritable because she be very sleepy and have be very much frighten it be bad enough for a live person to play let alone a ghost and where could it have go wonder laura she eye big and dark with excitement the minute we hear the noise -- i guess we be sort of listen for it even in we sleep -- we jump up and come down here while billie go to call you boy it be play almost up to the minute we come into the room and maybe we be not afraid to go in say violet with a shudder i do not know how we ever get the courage well you only come because mr gilligan and i go ahead with the broom and the poker sniff laura be it play when you come down the stair ask chet interested and do it stop as soon as you enter the room yes it be mrs gilligan who answer this time and it be good for he he do i have lose enough sleep through the miserable rascal and i be just ripe for a tussle i do not blame he for run say teddy with a chuckle but where do he go ask laura again we be sure that we would see something -- goodness know what -- when we turn the corner of the room and all we see be a -- a large amount of nothing at all add violet wide-eyed perhaps suggest ferd with a chuckle the aeroplane we hear belong to he -- a ghost 's aeroplane murmur billie smother another hysterical chuckle and when you girl come in he just soar skyward and go off in it it be funny we never think of that say teddy scornfully well i wish we could find out what it be sigh billie as they start upstairs again this stay awake all night be not very much fun but be not it strange ask laura stop on the landing and look back at they that both the piano and the motor should start again on the same night yes it be rather say chet add seriously : i wonder if there could really be any connection between the two there be no use wonder that i can see say mr gilligan prepare to send they off to they respective bedroom i think the best thing we can do be not to notice they any more perhaps the ghost will get tire if they find they do not worry we this last with a chuckle well but they do worry we say violet plaintively every time i hear that piano i just about die of fright listen command billie and as they listen they hear it again the ghost or whatever it be be surely make a joke of they that night as

the room there be nothing to be see or hear say this thing be make I mad cry ferd glaring at the old piano as though it be the offender i do not mind meet a honest-to-goodness ghost but i 'll be hang if i 'll let he laugh at I i do not see how you be go to help it say teddy come on fellow it be pretty nearly morning and we can decide then what we 'll do to catch mr ghost i be so sleepy i be apt to

o'clock before the girl finally come down and it be still later before the boy appear mr gilligan and billie have have breakfast together and billie have confide to the older woman she suspicion in regard to the ghostly player of the old piano but we will not tell the boy and girl billie have say with a delightful sense of conspiracy we 'll wait and see if it work as the young people come in

what be inside when you girl call I for something here it be indicate a small door the top of which be only on a level with they shoulder i never see so many queer thing in one place in my life say laura peer down as billie open the door i do not know they grow that way we 'll have to stoop down to get in here say billie poke she head into the stuffy dark hole disclose and look girl she exclaim

impatient little push we can not find anything by stand here billie what be the matter for billie have start back so suddenly that she have almost throw laura off she balance it be another of those horrid old bat she gasp bend down as a indistinct little shape flutter past she i should not think they could live in the closet without air or anything to eat it probably fly in when you open the door the other day violet suggest once more billie bent down and feel she way into the narrow closet do not try to stand up girl she caution you be apt to get a awful bump on the head i have already have one say violet rub the bump spot tenderly goodness it smell musty in here girl it be a trunk cry billie lean down to examine the bulky object she have see at the other end a pretty big one too

wonder if you girl would have to help by pull I my but it be heavy however after much haul and pull billie finally succeed in back out of the closet pull the trunk after she then stand up and brushing the hair out of she eye she regard it gleefully everything in the house be mine she remind they as she stoop down again to examine the lock so i have a perfect right to look in anything i find well nobody 's argue about that say laura sit down on the floor regardless of a fine coating of dust and help billie in she examination have not it any key ask violet eagerly of course not silly laura answer what would be the use of a lock trunk if you keep the key around where everybody could see it well i do not even know it be lock violet say rather heatedly for she billie jump to she foot and give the trunk a sudden jerk girl she cry do you hear that hear what they chorus eagerly but do not you hear it rattle when we pull it out of the closet i think so then now i be sure oh girl what be the matter billie i jerk the trunk explain billie while the color tinge she face and it jingle yes it do it actually jingle billie cry laura look wide-eyed and awed do you mean it sound like _ money _ for answer billie reach down and give the trunk another jerk sure enough there be the unmistakable jingle of metal against metal as though the trunk be fill with coin they heart beat fast hardly able to speak with excitement the girl stand and stare down at this new discovery i -- i feel like captain kidd gasp billie she cheek crimson now like captain kidd when he find the treasure girl do you really think it _ be _ money it certainly sound like it say violet in a voice tremulous with excitement as she reach down and give the trunk another jerk just for the fun of hear its contents jingle well let 's get it downstairs suggest laura wildly impatient to see the treasure if treasure it be we certainly can not open it ourselves without a key oh if the boy be only at home she add with a impatient little stamp of she foot it seem to I they be never around when you want they maybe we can call they back they have not have time to go far say billie stir to instant action by the think come on laura you take one end vi can steady it at the side and we 'll at least get the trunk downstair that be the way now then after a good deal of push and lug and a spasm of fright when the trunk almost fall on laura they finally succeed in get they burden down to the second floor there the girl leave it and start hastily down the stair in pursuit of the boy they have go only half the way however when they be startle by a tremendous crash and explosion outside and stand still they heart in they mouth oh now what have happen cry violet as they rush down the rest of the step and start for the front door half way to the door mr gilligan meet they hold a rat trap in she hand from which hang suspend a dead rat where do you get that the girl cry in chorus it be mr rat the piano player say mr gilligan add as she push past they and run to the door : do you hear that awful noise outside girl do we hear it they cry follow she oh mr gilligan what do you suppose it be ask violet press close to she somebody be probably hurt answer the woman add as though to herself : terribly hurt hope it be not the boy chapter xxiii the wreck aeroplane the girl never remember very clearly what happen after that they have a vague and confused recollection of see the boy gather around something in the bush at the brook that groan a little and make queer sputter noise then the boy bent down and begin extricate the groan thing from the wreck of something chet what be it cry billie with a impression that she be live a dream she try to push past he but she brother stop she stay away sis he order the poor fellow 's hurt -- we do not know how badly -- and i would rather you would go back to the house but if he be hurt there be all the more need for we insist billie sudden decision in she voice we know first aid let we past boy not exactly know why they obey she the boy draw aside and she run to the side of the prostrate figure on the ground the other girl follow half reluctantly the boy have succeed in remove the man from the wreckage -- one glance about they tell the girl that the wreck have once be a aeroplane -- and the man who be elderly lay quite still look up at they with sick eye oh can not we get he up to the house cry billie clasp she hand in pity and look appealingly at mr gilligan then we can send for a doctor -- but it be the hurt man himself who interrupt i -- i be all in he say speaking with great effort it will not do any good to move I -- but it might cry violet come down and lean compassionately over he while she eye fill with tear do you think -- it would hurt -- too much -- come on let 's try it fellow say teddy speaking with sudden decision we can not leave he here to die perhaps he add softly we can at least make a attempt to save he life he bent down and put a hand under each of the man 's arm lift he slightly elicit a moan of pain you take he foot chet and ferd you support he back he direct now then -- the boy start to obey but at the first touch the man cry out in such pain that they be force to put he down again it be something in here say the old fellow while the girl and boy stand look helplessly at he not know what to do he put a hand over he left side something 's broken i -- i be try to -- invent a new kind of aeroplane he go on jerkily and in spite of the tragic circumstance the young folk feel a thrill of excitement as they realize that here perhaps be the secret of that strange humming noise that have so badly frightened and bewilder they the second ghost murmur teddy softly as though to himself but billie standing close beside he hear a new kind of aeroplane chet prompt gently but with a unusual light in he eye yes and this be its -- trial flight the old man say with a world of bitterness in he voice the engine explode i guess it show that i be pretty much of a failure -- in every way i do not see why cry billie she warm heart eager to give he comfort there may have be just some little thing the matter that you -- what be that that be the sound of run foot and a crackling of bush and the next minute two man burst out into the clearing they be red of face and breathless and when they see the old man and the wreck machine they stand stock still and stare in consternation with a start the girl and boy recognize the man as those whom they have meet in the wood that other day not so long ago -- the man who have so curtly order they to go the other way so the corn story be a fish story after all and the old inventor 's vain attempt to make a new kind of fly machine be the key to all the mystery be you very much hurt dad cry the younger of the two man lean anxiously over the old man again the young folk be startle so one of the bearded man be the old man 's son all in son i guess answer the old man with a sigh he lay he hand over he left side and whisper : i be all smash to piece the engine explode well let 's see about that say the second of the two man push the younger aside and begin to rip open the old man 's shirt up to that time neither of the man have throw a glance in the direction of the wonder boy and girl -- in fact they give every impression of not have see they at all the older of the two man be work feverishly -- he seem to be a doctor judge from the skill with which he tap here and press there evidently try to find out what bone be break if any and all the time the old inventor keep up a feeble moan he must be very much hurt indeed or very very old thought billie as with one hand clasp tightly in laura 's and the other gripping violet 's arm she watch intently why this be not so bad after all announce the man at last look up from he patient with a light in he eye that make he look very boyish in spite of the beard on he face you father 's terribly bruised and batter up stanton he say address the old man 's son who have be look on with strained attention but as far as i can see the only bone break be a rib or two we 'll soon fix you up as good as new he go on turn again to the old man the latter look surprised and leave off moan you mean i be go to live he ask incredulously add with a faint little attempt at a smile : why -- why i be sure i be -- do for no indeed say the doctor-person -- as billie have already dub he rise briskly to he foot you 'll live to fly many another aeroplane mr parson now will you let you son and I take you home such be the power of mind over matter the inventor hardly make any outcry at all when he son and the doctor-person lift he between they and start off through the wood as he turn about the doctor 's eye rest on the boy and girl and he stop short apparently really see they for the first time hello he say i beg you pardon but i scarcely notice you add more by way of explanation than excuse : you see i be very much occupy oh we do not mind say billie truthfully add as the doctor turn toward she : be there anything we can do to help the -- the inventor oh so he tell you then say the doctor with a vex frown no thanks there be nothing you can do we 'll be back for the piece of the aeroplane later and without another glance the strange trio disappear into the wood for a long minute the boy and girl stand stare after the strange man dazedly then they turn to each other with a sigh well say laura explosively if everything be not happen to we at once then my name be not laura jordon to think that we ghost turn out to be a inventor after all you look as if you be disappointed gibe ferd begin to recover from he bewilderment we 'll manufacture a brand new ghost if you say so but it may take time -- goodness you need not bother say violet go over to the wreck machine and regard it wonderingly we have have enough of ghost to last we a lifetime my that poor old inventor must have have a terrible fall it be a miracle say teddy who have join she and be look down at the wreck soberly that he ever come out alive i agree with he at first that he be all in well let it be a lesson to you say chet with mock gravity never to let you ambition soar to aeroplane invent if that be mean to be a joke say laura bitingly i must say it be as much of a failure as we old inventor himself well girl she add turn back to they i do not suppose there be any use stay around here any longer let 's go back to the house it be not till they be enter the grim old door of the grim old house that they think again of billie 's new discovery -- the trunk that jingle goodness how could we ever have forget it cry billie as she with violet and laura fairly fly up the stair leave the bewildered boy to follow they now what be up ask teddy as he come into the room where the girl have leave they treasure so many thing be happen all at once that it be enough to make a fellow 's brain reel it all depend on the brain say billie look up at he with a twinkle in she eye and all teddy do be to look sad and reproachful say what shall i be doin ' with this ask mrs gilligan and they turn to see she great bulk loom in the doorway in she hand she hold the rat trap with the dangling rat gee where do you get it cry chet jump to he foot from where he have be kneel with billie examine the shabby trunk mr gilligan pause a moment and a gleam of humor shot into she eye you have be askin ' to see ghost mr chet she say with a chuckle and you sure have get you wish this day that airman be the first here be the second one chapter xxiv coin and postage stamp chet look bewildered for a minute -- then disgust a expression that be faithfully reflect on the face of the other boy a ghost that he say point scornfully at the dead rat what do you mean oh chet cry billie spring to she foot in she turn that be another thing we forget this be mr rat the piano player have you all go crazy or have i cry poor chet look still more bewildered but suddenly teddy saw light you mean the musical ghost he cry laughter in he voice the one that have have we chase down flight of stair on dark night with the chill run up and down we spine and we hair standing on end add ferd follow he lead the very same respond mr gilligan the gleam deepen in she eye but how do you catch it ask violet for the girl all except billie who have originate the idea be as much in the dark as the boy with a trap say billie she own eye begin to sparkle but who think of it violet insist ignore the sarcasm you see before you the girl who invent it say billie with a chuckle great pumpkin another inventor groan ferd and send they off into a spasm of laughter oh tell we about it billie laura entreated you can be the most aggravating thing stop call I name or i 'll never tell you threaten billie at which laura look as meek as laura could ever look thereupon billie recount to a interested audience the event that have lead to she idea that it might be a rat that be make a joke of they all and how she have decide to put she idea to the test say think of get excited about a mouse cry ferd incredulously when she have finish it be not a mouse -- it be a rat correct billie but it might have be a mouse ferd protest but billie break in again no it might not she say decidedly a mouse could never have make noise enough for we to hear when we be upstairs in bed right you be say ferd take off a imaginary cap to billie i have to hand it to you billie -- you be right there you say it that time old man murmur teddy very softly but billie hear he and look up at he with laugh eye come help we open we trunk she say turn away suddenly whose trunk be it where do you get it look as if it have come out of noah 's ark these and many more comment pile one on top of the other as the boy look at the old trunk which do indeed appear old enough to have satisfy the most ardent collector of antique why it be my trunk say billie when she could make herself hear above the babble we find it in the attic but i do not see what difference it make where we get it she add impatiently get down on she knee once more and shake the trunk as if it be to blame will not you please get busy and open it boy be not you a bit curious to see what be inside be there a key asked ferd and billie look up at he in despair of course not silly she say do not you suppose we would have have it open age ago if there have be a key you 'll have to break it open or pick the lock or something say she be insulting we think we be thug murmured ferd as he with the other boy get down on the floor and begin to examine the trunk eagerly yes where do you suppose we get we experience in pick lock add chet look aggrieved goodness i do not care whether you pick the lock or what you do as long as you get it open cry billie half wild with impatience now that the fateful moment have arrive you can use dynamite for all i care maybe that be what be in it suggest teddy and the girl scream teddy of all the wet blanket well you never can tell say teddy add wickedly as ferd start to set the trunk on end : be careful there ferd she may explode as the aeroplane do somebody give I something to throw at he cry laura indignantly anyway she add triumphantly we know there be not dynamite in it or we would have be blow to bit long ago we drag it down stair yes and we do not do it very gently either add violet it have a pretty strong lock say chet get to he foot and rumple up he hair thoughtfully i 'll have to get a hammer and a wedge of some sort oh there be all sort of tool down in the tool-house billie cry eagerly and chet look at she as though she have say she have discover a gold mine in the back yard tool he repeat he eye shine be they good one i do not know anything about tool say billie but it look as if there be hundred of they -- chet wait to hear no more like a streak of lightning he be out of the room and race down the stair tool he be say gloatingly to himself hundred of they upstairs billie turn and look at teddy in dismay now what have i do she cry if he once get among those tool we will not see he for hour teddy and she look appeal enough even to melt teddy 's hard heart will not you go after he you will have to just tear he away -- however the two boy be back sooner than the girl expect for they be very curious about the contents of the small shabby trunk which have so evidently be hide away in the darkest corner of a dark closet in the attic say those be some tool billie say chet jubilantly as he pry away at the lock you could do just about anything with they -- anything from make a house to break into one i say he add stop work to look at she entreatingly do not you remember mother say that aunt beatrice leave you the house and I -- the tool the girl and boy laugh and billie pat he shoulder fondly no i do not remember anything of the sort she say imitate he tone to perfection but if you be a good boy and open the trunk in a hurry i 'll deed they to you chet -- every last tool in the tool-house honest to goodness cry chet he eye beam honest to goodness brother mine then chet fall to work with fresh enthusiasm on the lock it be a stubborn old lock and require a good deal of patience -- which the girl have not -- and tinker to make it give way but it give at last and girl and boy lean forward with sigh of pure excitement open it cry laura impatiently but billie put she hand on the lid and face they with shine eye we 'll each have just one guess she say and see who come nearest to guess right i bet it be money cry chet that be not fair i be go to bet that too so be i -- and i -- billie throw up she hand in despair of course if you be all go to guess the same thing it be all ruin she say then add as she bent forward and start to lift the cover : i do not know that i blame you though for i be go to guess the very same thing oh billie hurry you be so slow cry laura jump up and down with excitement do get at it shall i do it ask violet feel a almost irresistible desire to push billie away and fling back the lid why be she so slow one -- two -- three cry billie and then the lid be off and they be stare down into the contents of the trunk for a minute they stand motionless then as though move by one impulse they drop to they knee and bury they hand in something that jingle at they touch the trunk be full to the brim with old coin many quite rare while scatter here and there be postage stamp on sheet and loose queer foreign look thing that make billie 's eye glisten as she look at they it must have all belong to uncle henry she say in a awed voice aunt beatrice once say he have a hobby for collect postage stamp and old coin -- but it _ be _ money cry laura find she voice at last she blue eye dark with excitement why billie these old coin must be worth a big lot of money you bet it be a treasure say teddy soberly then with a little smile he turn to billie -- billie who be vivid and breathless with the great discovery allow I to present to you lady and gentleman we old friend captain kidd chapter xxv large fortune billie it be worth a small fortune i 'll bet the stuff be worth several thousand dollar yes every bit of it oh boy as much as that question billie half hysterically of course come from teddy he be on he knee in front of the treasure box see these coin gold every one of 'em -- and as big as ten dollar piece too count 'em cry chet then begin a hasty move on the part of both girl and boy to count the gold and silver poor billie 's hand tremble so she could scarcely help i make it the gold and silver alone be worth at least three thousand dollar declare teddy and do not forget the copper coin add ferd and remember too they be old coin and worth something extra from a collector 's point of view say chet from the coin the young folk turn to the postage stamp chet and teddy have do a little stamp collect once and know that some of the stamp be rare i think they be worth at least fifteen hundred dollar more say teddy and maybe they be worth twice that some stamp be worth a hundred dollar apiece it be not until they be call below by mr gilligan that they give up speculate about the value of the trunk the boy go off leave the girl to themselves it be too good to be true murmured billie over and over again both of the other girl put they arm about she you deserve it say laura i be awfully glad billie really i be beam violet why i 'll be able to go to three tower hall cry billie a little later when think it all over and i can send chet to boxton military academy will not that be fine and you can have enough leave to pay for that old statue add laura with a smile i know something good would come out of this queer old house at cherry corner well you need not take all the credit to yourself say billie the lilt of happiness and excitement in she voice just remember young lady that it be little billie bradley who discover the trunk you stick up thing cry violet put a fond arm again about she billie dear she go on in the serious voice that be violet 's very own i be just exactly as glad for myself that you find the money as i be for you because if laura and i have have to go to three tower without you we would not have enjoy a single thing yes we have be worry terribly about that sigh laura and affectionately billie pat a hand of each there never be a girl have such wonderful friend she say and something in she throat tighten a little and it make the trunk three time as valuable she add in a lighter tone because it make three people happy instead of one which remind I -- she stop short and put she hand over she mouth in consternation now what be the matter violet survey she anxiously be there a pin sticking you or something of course not deny billie absently add as she rise hastily to she foot : it just strike I that i have know this wonderful thing for hour and i have not write home about it yet well you would better read these first sing out a cheery voice from the door and they turn to find teddy come toward they with some letter in he hand letter be the joyful cry give they to we teddy before we take they from you oh do you really think you could he ask hold they behind he back by way of challenge just come on and try i 'll guarantee to hold off the three of you with one hand but it be billie 's plead face that make he change he mind please teddy she beg i have just be die for some letter from home do not keep I wait all right you word be law say teddy gallantly remember that he have read the phrase somewhere and it have sound very good here you be and here be one for vi and two for laura goodness what have i do to get only one cry violet feeling very much abused well you one look fat enough to make up for we two billie assure she diplomatically then settle back to enjoy she own letter while teddy run out to join the boy downstairs one of she letter be from she mother and with a loving smile she lay it aside to be read last -- she always save the best till the last the write on the other envelope puzzle she now who be write to I from mayport long island she demand and the girl look up inquiringly from they letter another mystery ask laura for there be not enough mystery in the world to satisfy laura it do not look very mysterious answer billie turn the envelope around and around in she hand and finally hold it up to the light to see if she could get any clew to its contents that way but i surely never do see that handwriting before i wonder -- well why do not you open it violet inquire impatiently it seem to I that be the best way to find out be not she the bright child sniff laura as billie tear open the envelope and pull out the letter inside hastily she look for the signature at the end then give a little excited exclamation girl she say it be from miss begg and she look at they with wide eye forget for the moment that she have no more reason to fear a letter from the teacher then she remember and a joyful smile dawn on she face girl i have be sort of dread this letter all summer she say she eye sparkling and now when it be come i do not mind a bit be not it just wonderful i have money enough of my own to replace that horrid ` girl read a book ' and two or three more like it now she say settle down with a satisfied little sigh if you 'll allow I i 'll read my letter the girl watch she as she read and be amaze to see she expression change from satisfaction to surprise and from surprise to something like chagrin well if that be not the limit she cry lay down the letter and regard the girl disgustedly here i have be worry myself -- and chet -- sick all summer about that horrid old statue and now when i have get the money to pay for it i find out that i probably would not have have to replace the old thing anyway what do you mean the other ask more puzzle than ever by this flow of word why billie go on to explain glance at the letter again miss begg say that the statue have be break before and she have attempt to mend it she say that i be not to worry over it for it would have be only a matter of time before it have fall to piece itself anyway now what do you think of that i think say violet with a sigh that we have waste a good deal of time and worry over nothing at all well i do not see any use of look doleful about it say laura briskly i should think you would be glad billie that you will not have to buy a statue it will give you that much more money to have for yourself oh but i 'll buy a little statue anyway say billie decidedly it be awfully nice of miss begg to tell I not to bother about it but the fact be that i _ re_broke the statue whether it be break before or not and anyway i 'll be glad to do it now she add with a little gleam in she eye just to show amanda peabody that i can i say up there be not you ever come down call chet 's voice from the bottom of the stair and laura go out into the hall to see what he want we be make plan for the fall chet add and in he voice be a little joyous thrill that make billie 's heart sing dear old chet -- if ever a boy deserve to get what he want he do and if you do not come down and help we we be go to leave you out he add challengingly better come up here suggest laura add decidedly we can not come down you know i would like to know why not we can not leave the trunk laura explain patiently as if she be address a particularly stupid child it be too precious so in the end the girl have they way and the boy join they in the upstairs room which come the nearest to be cheerful of any room in the house except the kitchen at first the boy talk and the girl listen but gradually the bit of fancy work be lay aside the girl join in the conversation while eye shine bright and face glow with anticipation of what the autumn hold in store for they and while laura and violet and the two boy be talk happily and all at once teddy take the opportunity to whisper in billie 's ear : i suppose be a young lady with a large fortune he say teasingly delight in the color that rise to she face you will not find time to recognize you
