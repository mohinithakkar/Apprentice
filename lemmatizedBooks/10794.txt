what interest these occasion be improve with whatever favor this little work may be receive it be a most please reflection to I that the object in publish it be to excite attention to the moral want of the dahcotah will be kindly appreciate by the friend of humanity and by none more readily than yourself very truly yours mary h eastman new london march lst 1849 preface my only title to the office of editor in the present case be some practice in such matter with a very warm interest in all whether relate to past or present that concern we western country mr eastman -- wife of captain eastman and daughter of dr henderson both of the u s army -- be thoroughly acquaint with the custom superstition and lead idea of the dahcotah whose vicinity to fort snelling and frequent intercourse with its inmate have bring they much under the notice of the officer and lady of the garrison she have no occasion to present the indian in a theatrical garb -- a mere thing of paint and feather less like the original than he own rude delineation on birch-bark or deer-skin the reader will find in the follow page live man and woman whose feeling be in many respects like he own and whose motive of action be very similar to those of the rest of the world though far less artfully cover up and disguise under pleasant name envy hatred and malice and all uncharitableness stand out unblushing in indian life the first be not call emulation nor the second just indignation or merit contempt nor the third zeal for truth nor the fourth keen discernment of character anger and revenge be carry out honestly to they natural fruit -- injury to other among the indian this take the form of murder while with we it be oblige to content itself with slander or cunning depreciation in short the study of indian character be the study of the unregenerate human heart and the writer of these sketch of the dahcotah present it as such with express and solemn reference to the duty of those who have the word of eternal life to apply they to the wretched condition of the red man who be perhaps with all he ignorance quite as well prepare to receive they as many of those who be already wise in they own eye the very degradation and misery in which he live and of which he be not unable to perceive some of the cause prepare he to welcome the instruction which promise better thing evil which be cover up under the smoothness of civilization stand out in all they horrible deformity in the _ abandon _ of savage life the indian can not get even one gleam of light without instantly perceive the darkness around he here then be encouragement to paint he as he be that the heart of the good may be move at he destitute and unhappy state to set forth he want and he claim that ignorance may no longer be plead as a excuse for withhold from the original proprietor of the soil the compensation or atonement which be demand at once by justice honor and humanity authentic picture of indian life have another and a different value in a literary point of view in the history and character of the aborigine be envelop all the distinct and characteristic poetic material to which we as american have a unquestioned right here be a peculiar race of most unfathomable origin possess of the quality which have always prompt poetry and live life which be to we as shadowy as those of the ossianic hero we own and pass away -- while we take no pain to arrest they fleeting trait or to record they picturesque tradition yet we love poetry be ambitious of a literature of we own and sink back deject when we be convict of imitation why be it that we lack interest in thing at home sismondus have a passage to this effect : -- the literature of other country have be frequently adopt by a young nation with a sort of fanatical admiration the genius of those country have be so often place before it as the perfect model of all greatness and all beauty every spontaneous movement have be repress in order to make room for the most servile imitation and every national attempt to develop a original character have be sacrifice to the reproduction of something conformable to the model which have be always before its eye this be certainly true of we since we not only adopt the english view of everything but confine ourselves to the very subject and imagery which have become consecrate to we by love and habit not to enter into the general subject of we disposition to parrotism we neglect of indian material in particular may be in part account for by we have become acquaint with the aborigine after the most unpoetical fashion in try to cheat they out of they land or shoot they when they decline be cheat they in they turn drive to the resource of the weak and the ignorant counterplot we and take by means of blood and fire what we would not give they in fair compensation this have make we business relation very unpleasant and everybody know that when this become the case it be hard for party to do justice to each other 's good or available quality if we have only read about the indian as a people live in the mountain-fastness of greece or the broad plain of transylvanium we should without difficulty have discover the romantic element of they character but as the effect of remoteness be produce by time as well as distance it be surely worth while to treasure up they legend for we posterity who will justly consider we very selfish if we throw away what will be a treasure to they merely because we can not or will not use it ourselves a prominent ground of the slight regard in which the english hold american literature or at least one of the most plausible reason give for it be we want of originality particularly in point of subject matter it be say that we imitativeness be so servile that for the sake of follow english model at a immeasurable distance we neglect the new and grand material which lie all around we in the sublime feature of we country in we new and striking circumstance in we peculiar history and splendid prospects and above all in the character superstition and legend of we aborigine who to eye across the water look like poetical being we be continually reproach by british writer for the obtuse carelessness with which we be allow these people with so much of the heroic element in they life and so much of the mysterious in they origin to go into the annihilation which seem they inevitable fate as civilization advance without a effort to secure and record all that they be able to communicate respect themselves and the reproach be just in we hurry of utilitarian progress we have either forget the indian altogether or look upon he only in a business point of view as we do almost everything else as a thriftless treacherous drunken fellow who know just enough to be troublesome and who must be cajole or force into leave he hunting-grounds for the occupation of very orderly and virtuous white people who sell he gunpowder and whiskey but send he now and then a missionary to teach he that it be wrong to get drunk and murder he neighbor to look upon the indian with much regard even in the light of literary material would be inconvenient for the moment we recognize in he a mind a heart a soul -- the recollection of the position in which we stand towards he become thorny and we begin dimly to remember certain duty belong to we christian profession which we have sadly neglect with regard to the son of the forest whom we have drive before we just as fast as we have require or desire they land a few effort have be make not only to bring the poetry of they history into notice but to do they substantial good the public heart however have never respond to the feeling of those who from live in contact with the indian have feel this interest in they to most american the red man be to this day just what he be to the first settler of the country -- a be with soul enough to be blameable for do wrong but not enough to claim christian brotherhood or to make it _ very _ sinful to shoot he like a dog upon the slightest provocation or alarm while this feeling continue we shall not look to he for poetry and the only imaginative writing in which he be likely to be generally use as material will be kindred to that know by the appropriate title of pirate literature mr cooper and miss sedgwick be perhaps alone among we writer in they attempt to do the indian justice while make he the poetical machine in fiction missionary however as well as other who have live among the aborigine for purely benevolent purpose have discover in they capability and docility which may put to the blush many of the whites who despise and hate they not only in individual case but in more extended instance the indian have be find susceptible of religious and moral instruction he heart have warm to kindness like any other man 's he have be able to perceive the benefit of regular industry he head have prove as clear in the apprehension of the distinction between right and wrong as that of the more highly cultivate moralist and he receive the fundamental truth of the gospel with a avidity and apply they -- at least to the life and character of he neighbor -- with a keenness which show he to be not far behind the rest of mankind in sensibility and acuteness without refer to the testimony of the elder missionary which be abundant i remember a most touching account by rev george duffield jr of piety in a indian wigwam which i would gladly transfer to these page do they limit admit it could be prove by overwhelming testimony that the indian be as susceptible of good as he white brother but it be not necessary in this place to urge he claim to we attention on the ground of he moral and religious capability set they aside he have many qualification for the heroic character as ajax or even achille he be as brave daring and ruthless as passionate as revengeful as superstitious as haughty he will obey he medicine man though with fury in he heart and injurious word upon he lip he will fight to the death for a wife whom he will afterwards treat with the most sovereign neglect he understand and accept the law of spoil and carry they out with the most chivalric precision he torture of prisoner do not exceed those which form part of the triumph of old he plan of scalping be far neater and more expeditious than that of drag a dead enemy thrice round the camp by the heel he love splendor and get all he can of it and there be little essential difference in this regard between gold and red paint between diamond and wampum he have great ancestral pride -- a feeling much in esteem for its ennobling power and the _ totem _ have all the meaning and use of any other armorial bearing in the endurance of fatigue hunger thirst and exposure the forest hero have no superior in military affair he fully adopt the orthodox maxim that all stratagem be lawful in war in short nothing be want but a homer to build we iliad material into lofty rhyme or a scott to weave it into border romance and as we be encourage to look for scott and homer at some future day it be manifestly we duty to be record fleeting tradition and describe peculiar custom before the wave of time shall have sweep over the retreat footstep of the salvage man and leave we nothing but lake and forest mountain and cataract out of which to make we poetry and romance the indian themselves be full of poetry they legend embody poetic fancy of the highest and most adventurous flight they religious ceremony refer to thing unseen with a directness which show how bold and vivid be they conception of the imaginative the war-song -- the death-song -- the song of victory -- the cradle-chant -- the lament for the slay -- these be the overflowing of the essential poetry of they untaught soul they eloquence be proverbially soar and figurative and in spite of all that render gross and mechanical they ordinary mode of marry and give in marriage instance be not rare among they of love as true as fiery and as fatal as that of the most exalted hero of romance they indeed live poetry it should be ours to write it out for they mr eastman 's aim have be to preserve from destruction such legend and trait of indian character as have come to she knowledge during long familiarity with the dahcotah and nothing can be fresher or more authentic than she record take down from the very lip of the red people as they sit around she fire and open they heart to she kindness she have even catch they tone and she language will be find to have something of a ossianic simplicity and abruptness well suit to the theme sympathy -- feminine and religious -- breathe through these page and the unaffected desire of the writer to awaken a kindly interest in the poor soul who have so twine themselves about she own best feeling may be say to consecrate the work in its character of aesthetic material for another age it appeal to we nationality while as the effort of a reflect and christian mind to call public attention to the need of a unhappy race we may ask for it the approbation of all who acknowledge the duty to teach all

u-mi-ne-wah-chippe or to dance around introduction the material for the follow page be gather during a residence of seven year in the immediate neighborhood -- nay -- in the very midst of the once powerful but now nearly extinct tribe of sioux or dahcotah indian fort snelling be situate seven mile below the fall of st anthony at the confluence of the mississippus -- and st peter 's river -- build in 1819 and name after the gallant colonel snelling of the army by whom the work be erect it be construct of stone be one of the strongest indian fort in the united state and be place on a commanding bluff have somewhat the appearance of a old german castle or one of the stronghold on the rhine the then recent removal of the winnebago be render troublesome by the interference of wabashaw the sioux chief whose village be on the mississippus 1800 mile from its mouth the father of wabashaw be a note indian and during the past summer the son have give some indication that he inherit the father 's talent and courage when the winnebago arrive at wabashaw 's prairie the chief induce they not to continue they journey of removal offer they land to settle upon near he and tell they it be not really the wish of they great father that they should remove he bribe and eloquence induce the winnebago to refuse to proceed although there be a company of volunteer dragoon and infantry with they this delay occasion much expense and trouble the government agent apply for assistance to the command at fort snelling there be but one company there and the commanding officer with twenty man and some friendly sioux go down to assist the agent there be a indian council hold on the occasion the sioux who go from fort snell promise to speak in favor of the removal during the council however not one of they say a word -- for which they afterwards give a satisfactory reason wabashaw though a young man have such influence over he band that he order invariably receive implicit obedience when the council commence wabashaw have place a young warrior behind each of the friendly sioux who he know would speak in favor of the removal with order to shoot down the first one who rise for that purpose this stratagem may be consider a characteristic specimen of the temper and habit of the sioux chief whose tribe we bring before the reader in they most conspicuous ceremony and habit the winnebago be finally remove but not until wabashaw be take prisoner and carry to fort snell wabashaw 's pike-bearer be a fine look warrior name many lightning the village of little crow another able and influential sioux chief be situate twenty mile below the fall of st anthony he have four wife all sister and the youngest of they almost a child there be other village of the tribe below and above fort snell the scenery about fort snelling be rich in beauty the fall of st anthony be familiar to traveller and to reader of indian sketch between the fort and these fall be the little fall forty foot in height on a stream that empty into the mississippus the indian call they mine-hah-hah or laughing water in sight of fort snelling be a beautiful hill call morgan 's bluff the indian call it god 's house they have a tradition that it be the residence of they god of the water whom they call unk-ta-he nothing can be more lovely than the situation and appearance of this hill it command on every side a magnificent view and during the summer it be carpet with long grass and prairie flower but to those who have live the last few year at fort snelling this hill present another source of interest on its top be bury three young child who be model of health and beauty until the scarlet fever find its way into region hitherto shield from its approach they live but long enough on earth to secure they a entrance into heaven life which ought to be a blessing to all be to they one of untold value for it be a short journey to a better land -- a translation from the yet unfelt care of earth to the bright and endless joy of heaven opposite the fort be pilot knob a high peak use as a burial-place by the indian just below it be the village of mendota or the meeting of the water but to I the greatest object of interest and curiosity be the original owner of the country whose teepee could be see in every direction one could soon know all that be to be know about pilot knob or st anthony 's fall but one be puzzle completely to comprehend the character of a indian man woman or child at one moment you see a indian chief raise himself to he full height and say that the ground on which he stand be he own at the next beg bread and pork from a enemy a indian woman will scornfully refuse to wash a article that might be need by a white family -- and the next moment declare that she have not wash she face in fifteen year a indian child of three year old will cling to its mother under the wall of the fort and then plunge into the mississippus and swim half way across in hope of find a apple that have be throw in we may well feel much curiosity to look into the habit manners and motive of a race exhibit such contradiction there be a great deal say of indian warrior -- and justly too of the sioux they be as a race tall fine-looking man and many of those who have not be degrade by association with the frontier class of white people nor have they intellect destroy by the white man 's fire-water have mind of high order and reason with a correctness that would put to the blush the power of many a educate logician yet be these man call savage and morally associate with the tomahawk and scalping knife few regard they as reasonable creature or as being endow by they creator with soul that be here to be fit for the responsibility of the indian hereafter good man be send the bible to all part of the world sermon be preach in behalf of fellow-creature who be perish in region know only to we in name and here within reach of comparatively the slightest exertion here not many mile from church and school and all the moral influence abound in christian society here in a country endowed with every advantage that god can bestow be perish body and soul we own countryman : perish too from disease starvation and intemperance and all the evil incident to they unhappy condition white man christian man be drive they back root out they very name from the face of the earth ah these man can seek the country of the sioux when money be to be gain : but how few care for the suffering of the dahcotah how few would give a piece of money a prayer or even a think towards they present and eternal good yet be they not altogether neglect doctor williamson one of the missionary among the sioux live near fort snelling he be exert himself to the utmost to promote the moral welfare of the unhappy people among whom he expect to pass he life he have a school for the indian child and many of they read well on the sabbath divine service be regularly hold and he have labor to promote the cause of temperance among the sioux christian exertion be unhappily too much influence by the apprehension that little can be do for the savage how be it with the man on he fire-water mission to the indian do he doubt do he fail as a great motive to improve the moral character of the indian i present the condition of the woman in they tribe a degraded state of woman be universally characteristic of savage life as she elevated influence in civilized society be the conspicuous standard of moral and social virtue the peculiar sorrow of the sioux woman commence at she birth even as a child she be despise in comparison with the brother beside she who be one day to be a great warrior as a maiden she be value while the young man who want she for a wife may have a doubt of he success but when she be a wife there be little sympathy for she condition how soon do the oppressive storm and contention of life root out all that be kind or gentle in she heart she must bear the burden of the family should she husband wish it she must travel all day with a heavy weight on she back and at night when they stop she hand must prepare the food for she family before she retire to rest she work be never do she make the summer and the winter house for the former she peel the bark from the tree in the spring for the latter she sew the deer-skin together she tan the skin of which coat mocassin and leggin be to be make for the family she have to scrape it and prepare it while other care be press upon she when she child be bear she have no opportunity for rest or quiet she must paddle the canoe for she husband -- pain and feebleness must be forget she be always hospitable visit she in she teepee and she willingly give you what you need if in she power and with alacrity do what she can to promote you comfort in she look there be little that be attractive time have not cause the wrinkle in she forehead nor the furrow in she cheek they be the trace of want passion sorrow and tear she bent form be once light and graceful labor and privation be not preservative of beauty let it not be deem impertinent if i venture to urge upon those who care for the wretched wherever they lot may be cast the immense good that might be accomplish among these tribe by school which should open the mind of the young to the light of reason and christianity even if the elder member be give up as hopeless with the young there be always encouragement many a bright little creature among the dahcotah be as capable of receive instruction as be the child of civilization why should they be neglect when the water of benevolence be move all around they it be not pretend that all the incident relate in these story occur exactly as they be state most of they be entirely true while in other the narrative be vary in order to show some prevalent custom or to illustrate some sentiment to which these indian be devote the sioux be as firm believer in they religion as we be in ours and they be far more particular in the discharge of what they conceive to be the obligation require by the object of they faith and worship there be many allusion to the belief and custom of the dahcotah that require explanation for this purpose i have obtain from the sioux themselves the information require on matter of faith there be difference of opinion among they -- but they do not make more point of difference on religion or on any other subject than white people do the day of the dahcotah be far spend to quote the language of a chippeway chief the indian 's glory be pass away they seem to be almost a god-forgotten race some few have give the missionary reason to hope that they have be make subject of christian faith -- and the light that have as yet break in faint ray upon they darkness may increase he who take account of the fall of a sparrow will not altogether cast away so large a portion of he creature all christian mind will wish success to the indian missionary and assuredly god will be true to he mercy where man be find true to he duty the first impression create by the sioux be the common one -- fear in they look they be so different from the indian i have occasionally see there be nothing in they aspect to indicate the success of effort make to civilize they they tall unbending form they savage hauteur the pierce black eye the quiet indifference of manner the slow stealthy step -- how different be they from the eastern indian whose association with the white people seem to have deprive they of all native dignity of bearing and of character the yell hear outside the high wall of the fort at first fill I with alarm but i soon become accustomed to they and to all other occasional indian excitement that serve to vary the monotony of garrison life before i feel much interest in the sioux they seem to have great regard for I my husband before he marriage have be station at fort snelling and at prairie du chien he be fond of hunting and roam about the prairie and leave many friend among the indian when he obey the order to return to a eastern station on go back to the indian country he meet with a warm welcome from he old acquaintance who be eager to shake hand with eastman 's squaw the old man lay they bony hand upon the head of my little boy admire they light hair say they skin be very white and although i could not then understand they language they tell I many thing accompany with earnest gesticulation they bring they wife and young child to see I i have be tell that indian woman gossip and steal that they be filthy and troublesome yet i could not despise they : they be wife and mother -- god have implant the same feeling in they heart as in mine some indian visit we every day and we frequently see they at they village captain e speak they language well and without take any pain to acquire it i soon understand it so as to talk with they the suffering of the woman and child especially during the winter season appeal to my heart they humility in ask for assistance contrast strongly with the pompous beg of the man late in a winter 's afternoon wenona wife of a chief name the star come to my room undoing a bundle that she take from under she blanket she approach and show it to I it be a infant three day old closely strap to a indian cradle the wretched babe be shrivel and already look old from hunger she warm it by the fire attempt to still its feeble cry do you nurse you baby well wenona i ask it look so thin and small how can i be the reply when i have not eat since it be bear frequently we have hear of whole family perish during severely cold weather the father absent on a winter 's hunt the mother could not leave she child to apply to the fort for assistance even have she strength leave to reach there the frozen body would be find in the lodge the improvident character of the indian be well know they annuity be soon spend supplies receive from government be use in feast and no provision be make for winter that be always long and severe though they receive frequent assistance from the public at the fort the want of all can not be supply the captain of the post be generous towards they as be always my friend mr f whom they highly esteem yet some heart be close against appeal daily make to they humanity a indian woman may suffer from hunger or sickness because she look be repulsive and she garment unwashed : some will say they can bear the want of warm clothing because they have be use to privation the woman of the sioux exhibit many striking peculiarity of character -- the love of the marvellous and a profound veneration for any and every thing connect with they religious faith a willingness to labor and to learn patience in submit to insult from servant who consider they intruder in family the evident recognition of the fact that they be a doomed race and must submit to indignity that they dare not resent they seem too so unused to sympathy often compare they life of suffering and hardship with the ease and comfort enjoy by the white woman it must be a hard heart that could withhold sympathy from such poor creature they home be mine -- and such a home the very sunset more bright and glorious than i have ever see seem to love to linger over the scene amongst which we live the high bluff of the father of many water and the quiet shore of the minesota the fairy ring on the prairie and the spirit lake that repose beside they the bold peak pilot knob on whose top the indian bury they dead with the small hill rise gradually around it -- all be dear to the sioux and to I they believe that the rock and hill and water be people with fairy and spirit whose power and anger they have ever be teach to fear i know that god whose presence fill all nature be there in fancy they behold they deity in the blacken cloud and fearful storm i see mine in the brightness of nature the type of the unchanging light of heaven they evince the warmest gratitude to any who have ever display kind feeling towards they when we little child be ill with scarlet fever how grieve they be to witness they suffering especially as we watch virginium wait as we expect to receive she parting breath how strongly they be contrast that fair child unconscious even of the presence of the many kind friend who have watch and weep beside she -- and the aged sioux woman who have creep noiselessly into the chamber i remember they well as they lean over the foot of the bed they expressive and subdue countenance full of sorrow that small white hand that lay so powerless have ever be outstretch to welcome they when they come weary and hungry they tell I afterwards that much water fall from they eye day and night while they think she would die that the servant make they leave the sick room and then turn they out of the house -- but that they would not go home wait outside to hear of she during she convalescence i find that they could rejoice with those that rejoice as well as weep with those that weep the fearful disease be abate in we family and old harper as she be call in the fort offer to sit up and attend to the fire we allow she to do so for the many who have so kindly assist we be exhaust with fatigue joy have take from I all inclination to sleep and i lay down near my little girl watch the old sioux woman she seem to be review the history of she life so intently do she gaze at the bright coal on the hearth many strange thought apparently engage she she be of she own accord a inmate of the white man 's house wait to do good to he sick child she have weep bitterly for day lest the child should be lose to she -- and now she be full of happiness at the prospect of she recovery how shall we reconcile this with the fact that harper or harpstinah be one of the sioux woman who wear as long as she could endure it a necklace make of the hand and foot of chippeway child here in the silence of night she turn often towards the bed when the restless sleep of the child break in on she meditation she fancy i sleep but my mind be busy too i be far away from the home of my childhood and a sioux woman with she knife in she belt be assist I in the care of my only daughter she think dr t be a wonderful medicine man to cure she in which opinion we all cordially coincide i always listen with pleasure to the woman when allusion be make to they religion but when they speak of they tradition i feel as a miser would have he discover a mine of gold i have read the legend of the maiden 's rock and of st anthony 's fall i ask checkered cloud to tell they to I she do so -- and how differently they be tell with my knowledge of the language and the aid of my kind and excellent friend mr prescott all the dark passage in she narration be make clear i think the indian tone of feeling be not rightly appreciate -- they custom not clearly state perhaps not fairly estimate the red man consider generally as a creature to be carry about and exhibit for money be in very truth a be immortally endowed though under a dispensation obscure to the more highly-favored white race as they affirm a belief in the tradition of they tribe with what strength and beauty of diction they clothe they thought -- how energetic in gesture alas for the people who have no higher creed no surer trust for this and for another world however they may have be improve no one could have have better opportunity than i to acquire all information of interest respect these indian i live among they seven year the chief from far and near be constantly visit the fort and be always at we house not a sentiment be in the legend that i do not hear from the lip of the indian man or woman they look on my husband as they friend and talk to he freely on all subject whether of religion custom or grievance they be frequently tell that i be write about they that every body might know what great warrior they be the man be sometimes astonish at the boldness with which i reprove they though it raise I much in they estimation i remember take bad hail one of they chief to task frequently and on one occasion he tell I by way of show he gratitude for the interest i take in he character that he have three wife all of whom he would give up if i would leave eastman and come and live with he i receive he proposition however with indian indifference merely reply that i do not fancy have my head split open every few day with a stick of wood he laugh heartily after he fashion conscious that the cap fit for he be in the habit of expend all he surplus bad temper upon he wife i have sometimes think that if when a warrior be he chief or commoner throw a stick of wood at he wife 's head she be to cast it back at he he might perhaps be teach better behavior but i never dare to instil such insubordinate notion into the head of my sioux female friend lest some ultra brave in a desperate rage might substitute the tomahawk for the log these opinion too might have make I unpopular with sioux and turk -- and perchance with some of my more enlighten friend who be self-constituted lord of creation i notice that indian like white people instead of confess and forsake they sin be apt to excuse themselves by tell how much worse they neighbor be when tell how wicked it be to have more than one wife they defend themselves by declare that the winnebago have twice or thrice as many as the sioux the attempt to make one right of two wrong seem to be instinctive i wish to learn correctly the indian song which they sing in celebrate they dance i send for a chief little hill who be a famous singer but with little perseverance as a teacher of music he soon lose all patience with I refuse to continue the lesson declare that he could never make I sing like a sioux squaw the low guttural note create the difficulty he very quickly become tired of my piano and singing the chief and medicine man always answer my question readily respect they law and religion but to insure good humor they must first have something to eat all the scrap of food collect in the kitchen cold beef cold buckwheat cake nothing go amiss especially as to quantity pork be they delight -- apple they be particularly fond of -- and in the absence of fire-water molasses and water be a most acceptable beverage then they have to smoke and nod a little before the fire -- and by and by i hear all about the great spirit and hookah the giant and the power of the sacred medicine all that be say in this book of they religion law and sentiment i learn from themselves and most of the incident occur precisely as they be represent some few have be varied but only where it might happily illustrate a peculiar custom or opinion they medicine man priest and juggler be proverbially the greatest scamp of the tribe my dear father must forgive I for reflect so harshly on he brother practitioner and be reconcile when he hear that they belong to the corps of quack for they doubt they own power and be constantly impose on the credulity of other on return from a evening walk we meet near the fort a notable procession first come a old medicine man whose indian name i can not recall but the child of the garrison call he old sneak -- a most appropriate appellation for he always look as if he have just commit murder and be afraid of be find out on this occasion he look particularly in character what a representative of the learn faculty after he in indian file come he wife and child a most cadaverous look set to use a western phrase they all look as if they be just dig up they appearance be account for in the follow ludicrous manner -- the story be doubtless substantially true there be a quantity of refuse medicine that have be collect in the hospital at the fort and old sneak happen to be present at a general clearing out the medicine be give to he and away he go to he home hug it up close to he like a veritable old miser it be too precious to be share with he neighbor the medicine of the white man be wahkun -lrb- wonderful -rrb- -- and carry out the principle that the more of a good thing the better he with he wife and child take it all i feel assure that the infant strap to its mother 's back be die at that time the dog dance be hold by the sioux in great reverence and the first time it have be celebrate near the fort for many year be about five summer ago the chippeway with they chief hole in the day be down on a visit and the prairie outside the fort be cover with indian of both tribe the chippeway sit on the grass at a little distance watch the sioux as they dance to show how brave they be and how they could eat the heart of they enemy most of the officer and lady of the garrison be assemble on the hospital gallery to witness the dance the sioux warrior form a circle in the center be a pole fasten in the ground one of the indian kill a dog and take out the heart and liver hold they for a few moment in a bucket of cold water and then hang they to the pole after awhile one of the warrior advance towards it bark he attitude be irresistibly droll he try to make himself look as much as possible like a dog and i think he succeed to admiration he retreat and another warrior advance with a different sort of bark more join in until there be a chorus of bark next one become very courageous jump and bark towards the pole bite off a piece of the flesh another follow and do the same feat one after another they all bark and bite let dog delight would have be a appropriate melody for the occasion they have to hold they head back to swallow the morçeau -- it be evidently hard work several dog be kill in succession when see some of the warrior look pale and deadly sick captain e determine to try how many of they enemy ' heart they could dispose of he go down among the indian and purchase another dog they could not refuse to eat the heart it make even the bravest man sick to swallow the last mouthful -- they be pale as death i see the last of it and although john gilpin 's ride might be a desirable sight yet when the sioux celebrate another dog feast may i not be there to see we intercourse with the sioux be greatly facilitate and we influence over they much increase by the success attend my husband 's effort to paint they portrait they think it supernatural -lrb- wahkun -rrb- to be represent on canvas some be prejudice against sit other ' esteem it a great compliment to be ask but all expect to be pay for it and if anything be want to complete we opportunity for gain all information that be of interest we find it in the daguerreotype captain e know they be about to celebrate a feast he wish to paint in group take he apparatus out and when they least expect it transfer the group to he plate the awe consternation astonishment and admiration surpass description ho eastman be all wahkun the indian be fond of boast and communicate they exploit and usage to those who have they confidence while my husband have delineate they feature with the pencil i have occupy pleasantly many a hour in learn from they how to represent accurately the feeling and feature of they heart -- feeble though my pen be we never fail to gain a point by provide a good breakfast or dinner with the rev mr pond and dr williamson both missionary among the sioux i have many a pleasant interview and talk about the tribe they kindly afford I every assistance -- and as they be perfectly acquaint with the language of the sioux and have study they religion with the view to introduce the only true one i could not have apply to more enlighten source or better authority the day we leave fort snelling i receive from mr pond the particulars of the fate of the sioux woman who be take prisoner by the chippeway and who be represent in the legend call the wife soon after she return to she husband he be kill by the chippeway and the difficulty be settle by the chippeway pay to the sioux what be consider the value of the murder man in goods such as calico tobacco & c after he death the widow marry a sioux name scarlet face they live harmoniously for a while -- but soon difficulty arise and scarlet face in a fit of savage rage beat she to death a most unromantic conclusion to she eventful life how vivid be we recollection of the grief the sioux show at parting with we for although at the time it add to the pain naturally feel at leave a place which have so long be we home yet the sincere affection they evince towards we and we child be most gratifying they wish we to remember they when far away with kindness the farewell of my friend checker cloud can never be forget she be my constant visitor for year and although a poor and despise sioux woman i learn to look upon she with respect and regard nor do my interest in she and she nation cease because in the chance of life we may never meet again it will still be my endeavor to depict all the custom feast and ceremony of the sioux before it be too late the account of they may be interesting when the people who so long believe in they will be no more we can see they be pass away but who can decide the interesting question of they origin they tell I that they nation have always live in the valley of the mississippus -- that they wise man have assert this for age past some who have live among they think they cross over from persium in ship -- and that they once possess the knowledge of building large vessel though they have now entirely lose it this idea bear too little probability to command any confidence the most general opinion be the often tell one that they be a remnant of god 's ancient and chosen people be this as it may they be as the setting sun or as the autumn leave trample upon by powerful rider they be recede rapidly and with feeble resistance before the giant stride of civilization the hunting grounds of a few savage will soon become the haunt of densely people civilized settlement we should be better reconcile to this manifest destiny of the aborigine if the inroad of civilization be worthy of it if the last year of these in some respects noble people be light up with the hope-inspiring ray of christianity we be not to judge the heathen yet universal evidence give the melancholy fact that the light of nature do not lead the soul to god : and without judge of they destiny we be bind to enlighten they mind we know the great being of whom they be ignorant and well will it be for they and for we in a day that await we all if yet though late sadly late -- yet not too late we so give countenance and aid to the missionary that the light of reveal truth may cheer the remaining period of they national and individual existence will it be say that i be regard with partial eye and sentimental romance but one side of the sioux character have they no fault as a people and individually they be savage -- and that go far to answer the question perhaps the best answer be the woman have fault enough and the man twice as many as the woman but if to be a savage be to be cruel vindictive ferocious -- dare we say that to be a civilized man necessarily imply freedom from these trait want of truth and habitual dishonesty in little thing be prevalent trait among the sioux most of they will take a kitchen spoon or fork if they have a chance -- and they think it fair thus to return the peculation of the whites they probably have a idea of make up for the low price at which they land have be value by maintain a constant system of petty theft -- or perhaps they consider kitchen utensil as curiosity just as the whites do they mocassin and necklace of bear 's claw yes -- it must be confess however unsentimental they almost all steal the man think it undignified for they to steal so they send they wife thus unlawfully to procure what they want -- and will be to they if they be find out the husband would shame and beat he wife for do what he certainly would have beat she for refuse to do as regard the honesty of the man i give you the opinion of the husband of checkered cloud who be a excellent indian every sioux say he will steal if he need and there be a chance the best indian that ever live have steal i myself once steal some powder i have thus perhaps tediously endeavor to show that what be say in this work have be learn by intimate association and that for year with the indian this association have continue under influence that secure unreservedly they confidence friendship -- and i may say -- truly in many instance -- they affection if the perusal of the legend give pleasure to my friend -- how happy be i to do more than this i hardly dare hope m h e preliminary remark on the custom of the dahcotah i sioux ceremony scalp dance & c the sioux occupy a country from the mississippus river to some point west of the missourus and from the chippewa tribe on the north to the winnebago on the south the whole extent be about nine hundred mile long by four hundred in breadth dahcotah be the proper name of this once powerful tribe of indian the term sioux be not recognize except among those who live near the whites it be say to have be give by the old french trader that the dahcotah might not know when they be the subject of conversation the exact meaning of the word have never be ascertain dahcotah mean a confederacy a number of band live near each other on term of friendship they custom and law be the same they mean by the word dahcotah what we mean by the confederacy of state in we union the tribe be divide into a number of band which be subdivide into village every village be govern by its own chief the honor of be chief be hereditary though for cause a chief may be depose and another substitute and the influence the chief possess depend much more upon he talent and capacity to govern than upon mere hereditary descent to every village there be also a _ war-chief _ and as to these be ascribe supernatural power they influence be unbounded lead every military excursion the war-chief 's command be absolute with he party there be many clan among the sioux and these be distinguish from each other by the different kind of medicine they use each clan take a root for its medicine know only to those initiate into the mystery of the clan the name of this root must be keep a secret many of these root be entirely destitute of medicinal power the clan be govern by a sort of free-masonry system a dahcotah would die rather than divulge the secret of he clan the clan keep up almost a perpetual warfare with each other each one suppose the other to be possess of supernatural power by which they can cause the death of any individual though he may live at a great distance this belief be the cause of a great deal of bloodsh when a dahcotah die it be attribute to some one of another clan and revenge be seek by the relative of the decease all they suppose supernatural power be invoke to destroy the murderer they first try the power of they sacred medicine imagine they can cast a fatal spell on the offender if this fail they have recourse to more destructive weapon and the axe knife or gun may be fatally use after the suppose murderer be kill he relation retaliate and thus successive feud become perpetual the dahcotah though a reckless be a generous people usually kind and affectionate to they aged though instance to the contrary frequently occur among the e-yankton there be a man so feeble and decrepit from age as to be totally unable to take care of himself not be able to walk he occasion great trouble when the band go out hunting he entreat the young man to drag he along that he might not fall a prey to the chippeway or to a fate equally dreaded cold and starvation for a time they seem to pity he and there be always those among the hunting party who be willing to render he assistance at last he fall to the charge of some young man who weary with carry he from place to place tell he they would leave he but he need not die a linger death they give he a gun and place he on the ground to be shoot at tell he to try and kill one of the young warrior who be to fire at he and thus he would have so much more honor to carry with he to the land of spirit he know it be useless to attempt to defend himself in a few moment he receive he death-wound and be no longer a burden to himself or to other the sioux have a number of superstitious notion which particularly influence the woman they be slavishly fearful of the spirit of the dead and a thousand other fancy priest and juggler be venerate from they suppose supernatural power little be generally know of they religion or they custom one must live among they to induce they to impart any information concern they mode of life or religious faith to a stranger they be always reserve they dance and feast be not amusement they all have a object and meaning and be celebrated year after year under a belief that neglect will be punish by the great spirit by means of disease want or the attack of enemy all they fear of punishment be confine to what they may suffer in this world they have no fear of the anger of they deity be continue after death revolting as the ceremony of dancing round a scalp seem to we a indian believe it to be a sacred duty to celebrate it the dancing part be perform by the old and young squaw the medicine man sing beat the drum rattle the gourd and use such other instrument as they contrive anything be consider a musical instrument that will assist in create discordant sound one of these be a bone with notch on it one end of which rest on a tin pan the other be hold in the left hand while with a piece of bone in the right which a medicine man draw over the notch sound as discordant and grating as possible be create the squaw dance around the scalp in concentric circle in group of from four to twelve together press they shoulder against each other and at every stroke of the drum raise themselves to they utmost height hop and slide a short distance to the left singing all the time with the medicine man they keep time perfectly in the center the scalp be attach to a pole stick in the ground or else carry on the shoulder of some of the squaw the scalp be stretch on a hoop and the pole to which it be attach be several foot long it be also cover with vermilion or red earth and ornament with feather ribbon bead and other trinket and usually a pair of scissors or a comb after dance for a few minute the squaw stop to rest during this interval one of the squaw who have have a son husband or brother kill by a warrior of the tribe from which the scalp she hold be take will relate the particulars of he death and wind up by say whose scalp have i now on my shoulder at this moment there be a general shout and the dance again commence this ceremony continue sometimes at interval for month usually during the warm weather after the dance be do the scalp be bury or put up on the scaffold with some of the decease of the tribe who take the scalp so much for the scalp dance -- a high religious ceremony not as some suppose a mere amusement the sacred feast be give in honor of the sacred medicine and be always give by medicine-men or woman who be initiate into the mystery of the medicine dance the medicine man be invariably the greatest rascal of the band yet the utmost respect be show they every one fear the power of a medicine man when a medicine man intend give a feast he go or send to the person whom he wish to invite when all be assemble the giver of the feast open the medicine bag with some formality the pipe be light and smoke by all present but it be first offer to the great spirit after the smoking food be place in wooden bowl or other vessel that visitor may have bring for it be not a breach of etiquette to bring dish with you to the feast when all be serve the word be give to commence eating and those that can not eat all that be give they must make a present to the host besides hire some one present to eat what they fail to consume to waste a morsel would offend the great spirit and injure or render useless the medicine every one have finish eat the kettle in which the food be cook be smoke with cedar leave or grass before the cooking be commence all the fire within the wigwam be put out and a fresh one make from flint and steel in the celebration of the sacred feast the fire and cooking utensil be keep and consecrate exclusively to that purpose after the feast be over all the bone be carefully collect and throw into the water in order that no dog may get they nor a woman trample on they the sioux worship the sun the _ sun dance _ be perform by young warrior who dance at interval of five minute for several day they hop on one foot and then on the other keep time to the drum and make indescribable gesture each have a small whistle in he mouth with he face turn towards the sun the singing and other music be perform by the medicine man the drum use be a raw hide stretch over a keg on which a regular beating of time be make with a short stick with a head to it woman pretend to foretell future event and for this reason be sometimes invite to medicine feast ii indian doctor when a indian be sick and want the doctor as we say or a medicine man as they say -- they call they also priest doctor and juggler -- a messenger be send for one with a pipe fill in one hand and payment in the other which fee may be a gun blanket kettle or anything in the way of present the messenger enter the wigwam -lrb- or teepee as the house of the sioux be call -rrb- of the juggler present the pipe and lay the present or fee beside he have smoke the doctor go to the teepee of the patient take a seat at some distance from he divest himself of coat or blanket and pull he leggin to he ankle he then call for a gourd which have be suitably prepare by dry and put small bead or gravel stone in it to make a rattle noise take the gourd he begin to rattle it and to sing thereby to charm the animal that have enter the body of the sick sioux after singing _ hi-he-hi-hah _ in quick succession the chorus _ ha-ha-ha hahahah _ be more solemnly and gravely chant on due repetition of this the doctor stop to smoke then sing and rattle again he sometimes attempt to draw with he mouth the disease from a arm or a limb that he fancy to be affect then rise apparently almost suffocate groan terribly and thrust he face into a bowl of water he make all sort of gesture and noise this be to get rid of the disease that he pretend to have draw from the sick person when he think that some animal fowl or fish have possession of the sick man so as to cause the disease it become necessary to destroy the animal by shoot it to accomplish this the doctor make the shape of the animal of bark which be place in a bowl of water mixed with red earth which he set outside of the wigwam where some young man be stand who be instruct by the doctor how and when to shoot the animal when all be ready the doctor pop he head out of the wigwam on he hand and knee at this moment the young man fire at the little bark animal blow it to atom when the doctor jump at the bowl thrust he face into the water grunt groan and make a vast deal of fuss suddenly a woman jump upon he back then dismount take the doctor by the hair and drag he back into the teepee all fragment of the bark animal be then collect and burn the ceremony there cease if the patient do not recover the doctor say he do not get the right animal the reader must be convince that it be not for want of the most strenuous exertion on the part of the physician these be some of the custom of the dahcotah which however absurd they may appear to we be hold in sacred reverence by they there be some animal bird and fish that a indian venerate and the creature thus sacred he dare neither kill nor eat the selection be usually a bear buffalo deer otter eagle hawk or snake one will not eat the right wing of a bird another dare not eat the left : nor be the woman allow to eat any part that be consider sacred the sioux say it be lawful to take revenge but otherwise it be not right to murder when murder be commit it be a injury to the decease not a sin against the great spirit some of they wise man say that the great spirit have nothing to do with they affair present or future they pretend to know but little of a future state they have dreamy idea of large city somewhere in the heaven where they will go but still be at war with they enemy and have plenty of game a indian woman 's idea of future happiness consist in relief from care oh that i be dead they will often say when i shall have no more trouble veneration be much regard in all indian family thus a son-in-law must never call he father-in-law by he name but by the title father-in-law and vice versa a female be not permit to handle the sac for war purpose neither do she dare look into a looking-glass for fear of lose she eyesight the appearance of a brilliant aurora-borealis occasion great alarm the indian run immediately for they gun and bow and arrow to shoot at it and thus disperse it iii indian name and write the name of the sioux band or village be as fanciful as those give to individual near fort snelling be the men-da-wahcan-ton or people of the spirit lake the wahk-paton or people of the leave the wahk-pa-coo-tah or people that shoot at leaf and other band who have name of this kind among those chief who have be well-known around fort snelling be wah-ba-shaw the leaf wah-ke-on-tun-kah big thunder wah-coo-ta red wing muzza hotah gray iron ma-pe-ah-we-chas-tah the man in the cloud tah-chun-coo-wash-ta good road sha-ce-pee the sixth wah-soo-we-chasta-ne bad hail ish-ta-hum-bah sleepy eye these fanciful name be give to they from some peculiarity in appearance or conduct or sometimes from a occurrence that take place at the time that they usually receive the name that be ascribe to they for life there be a sioux living in the neighborhood of fort snelling call the man that walk with the woman it be not customary for the indian to show much consideration for the fair sex and this young man exhibit some symptom of gallantry unusual among they receive the above name the sioux have ten name for they child give accord to the order of they birth the oldest son be call chaskè second haparm third ha-pe-dah fourth chatun fifth harka the oldest daughter be call wenonah second harpen third harpstenah fourth waska fifth we-barka these name they retain until another be give by they relation or friend the dahcotah say that _ meteor _ be man or woman fly through the air that they fall to piece as they go along finally fall to the earth they call they wah-ken-den-da or the mysterious passing fire they have a tradition of a meteor which they say be pass over a hill where there be a indian asleep the meteor take the indian on he back and continue he route till it come to a pond where there be many duck the duck see the meteor commence a general quack which so alarm he that he turn off and go around the pond and be about to pass over a indian village here he be again frighten by a young warrior who be play on the flute be afraid of music he pass around the village and soon after fall to the earth release he burden the indian then ask the meteor to give he he head strap which he refuse the indian offer he a feather of honor for it and be again refuse the sioux determine to gain he point tell the meteor if he would give he the strap he would kill a big enemy for he no reply from the meteor the indian then offer to kill a wigwam full of enemy -- the meteor still mute the last offer be six wigwam full of dead enemy for the so much coveted strap the meteor be finally bribe give up the head-strap and the sioux go home with the great glory of have outwit a meteor for as they meet no more the debt be never pay the _ language _ of the sioux would with proper facility be easily acquire it be say in many respects to resemble the ancient greek even after have acquire considerable knowledge of the language by study it be necessary to live among the people in order to understand they fanciful mode of speak one of the chief sleepy eye visit a missionary not many week since and on be ask why he do not come at the time appoint reply how could i come when i have no mocassin mean that he have no horse the horse have recently be kill by a man who owe he a grudge and he way of allude to the loss be the mocassin on another occasion this same chief have do what he consider a favor for the missionary at _ traverse des sioux _ tell they that he coat be wear out and that he have neither cloth nor thread to mend it the fact be that he have no coat at all no cloth nor thread he brawny neck and arm be entirely bare and this be he way of beg for a new coat in indian warfare the victor take the scalp of he enemy if he have time he take the entire scalp include the ear but if hurry a smaller scalp-piece be take as a inducement to be foremost in battle the first four that touch the dead body of a enemy share the honor that be pay to the one who slew the foe and take the scalp but the victor in indian fight frequently suffer in this way a wounded savage feign death and as some warrior approach to take he scalp he will suddenly rise discharge he gun and fight desperately with the tomahawk until kill deed of valor perform by indian be as often do from desperation as from any natural bravery they be educate to warfare but often show great disinclination to fight strategy go farther with they than manly courage do at fort snell the sioux have more than once crouch under the wall of the fort for protection and on one occasion a chief who come in to give information of the approach of some chippeway tremble so as to shake the ornament about he dress indian writing -lrb- illustration : no i and 3 prisoner capture by no 2 -lrb- no hand

indifference upon the suffering or death of a person they hate a few year ago a battle be fight quite near fort snell the next day the sioux child be play foot-ball merrily with the head of a chippeway one boy and a small boy too have ornament he head and ear with curl he have take the skin peel off a chippeway who be kill in the battle wound it around a stick until it assume the appearance of a curl and tie they over he ear another child have a string around he neck with a finger hang to it as a ornament the infant instead of be amuse with toy or trinket be hold up to see the scalp of a enemy and they learn to hate a chippeway as soon as to ask for food after the battle the mother of a sioux who be severely wound find she way to the fort she enter the room weep sadly

but for a moment for it be sure to break in terror over you head you name be you history you life have be a checkered cloud but the storm of the day have yield to the influence of the setting sun the thunder have cease to roll the wind have die away and the golden streak that bind the horizon promise a brighter morning so with checkered cloud the storm and strife of the earth have cease the battle of life be fight and she have conquer for she hope to meet the beloved of earth in the heaven of the dahcotah and who will say that we heaven will not be hers the god of the dahcotah be ours though they less happy than we have not be teach to know he christian be you without blame have you think of the privation the want of those who once own you country and would own it still but for the strong hand have you remember that they soul be dear in he sight who suffer for they as well as for you have you give bright gold that they child might be educate and redeem from they slavery of soul checkered cloud will die as she have live a believer in the religion of the dahcotah the tradition of she tribe be write on she heart she worship a spirit in every forest tree or every run stream the feature of the favored israelite be hers she be perchance a daughter of they lose tribe when she be young she would have listen to the missionary as he tell she of gethsemane and calvary but age yield not like youth to new impression the one look to the future the other cling to the past see she have put by she pipe and be go but she be come oft again to talk to I of she people that i may tell to my friend the bravery of the dahcotah warrior and the beauty of the maiden the legend of they river and sacred isle -- the tradition of they rock and hill if i can not in recount the wild story of this prophetess of the forest give she own striking word i shall at least be faithful to the spirit of she recital i shall let indian life speak for itself these true picture of its course will tell its whole simple story better than any labored exposition of mine here we may see not the red man of the novel or the drama but the red man as he appear to himself and to those who live with he he better characteristic will be find quite as numerous as ought to be expect under the circumstance he fault and he suffering should appeal to the heart of those who hold the means of he salvation no intelligent citizen of these unite state can without blame forget the aborigine of he country they wrong cry to heaven they soul will be require of we to view they as brute be a insult to he who make they and we may this little work do something towards exciting a interest in a single tribe out of the many whose only hope be in the mercy of the white man red earth or mocka-doota-win good road be one of the dahcotah chief -- he be fifty year old and have two wife but these two have give a deal of trouble although the chief probably think it of no importance whether he two wife fight all the time or not so that they obey he order for what would be a calamity in domestic life to we be a every day affair among the dahcotah good road 's village be situate on the bank of the st peter 's about seven mile from fort snelling and like other indian village it abound in variety more than anything else in the teepee the farthest from we right on the edge of the shore there be three young man carouse one be incline to go to sleep but the other two will not let he they spirit be raise and excite by what have make he stupid who would suppose they be human being see they bloodshot eye hear they fiendish laugh and horrid yell probably before the revel be close one of the friend will have bury he knife in the other 's heart we will pass on to the next teepee here we witness a scene almost as appalling iron arm one of the most valiant warrior of the band be stretch in the agony of death old spirit killer the medicine man be gesticulate by he side and accompany he motion with the most horrid noise but all in vain the spirit of iron arm the man of strength be go the doctor say that he medicine be good but that a prairie dog have enter into the body of the dahcotah and he think it have be a mud-hen magnanimous doctor all honor that you can allow yourself in error while the friend of the dead warrior be rend the air with they cry we will find out what be go on in the next wigwam what a contrast the whirlpool be seat on the ground smoking gaze as earnestly at the bright coal as if in they he could read the future or recall the past and he young wife whose face now merry now sad bright with smile at one moment and lose in think the next gain for she the name of the change countenance be hush she child to sleep but the expression of she feature do not change now -- as she look on she child a mother 's deep and devoted love be picture on she face in another the dancing woman be wrap in she blanket pretend to go to sleep in vain do the fly cloud play that monotonous court tune on the flute the maiden would not be he wife if he give she all the trinket in the world she love and be go to marry iron lightning who have go to bring she -- what a brooch -- a new blanket no a chippeway 's scalp that she may be the most graceful of those who dance around it she mother be mend the mocassin of the old man who sleep before the fire and we might go round the village and find every family differently employ they have no regular hour for eat or sleep in front of the teepee young man be lie on the ground lazily play checkers while they wife and sister be cut wood and engage in laborious household duty i say good road have two wife and i would now observe that neither of they be younger than himself but they be as jealous of each other as if they have just turn seventeen and they lord and master be twenty instead of fifty not a day pass that they do not quarrel and fight too they throw at each other whatever be most convenient and stick of wood be always at hand and then the son of each wife take a part in the battle they first fight for they mother and then for themselves -- so that the chief must have be reduce to desperation long ago if it be not for he pipe and he philosophy good road 's second wife have chippeway blood in she vein she mother be take prisoner by the dahcotah they adopt she and she become the wife of a dahcotah warrior she love she own people and those who have adopt she too and in course of time she daughter attain the honorable station of a chief 's second wife good road hate the chippeway but he fall in love with one of they descendant and marry she she be a good wife and the white people have give she the name of old bet last summer old bet narrowly escape with she life the dahcotah have nothing else to do be amusing themselves by recall all the chippeway have ever do to injure they and those who be too lazy to go out on a war party happily recollect that there be chippeway blood near they -- no farther off than they chief 's wigwam and eight or ten brave vow they would make a end of old bet but she hear of they threat leave the village for a time and after the dahcotah have get over they mania for shed blood she return and right glad be good road to see she for she have a open good humored countenance the very reverse of that of the first wife whose vinegar aspect would frighten away a army of small child after old bet return good road could not conceal he satisfaction he wife 's trip have evidently improve she good look for the chief thought she be the handsomest squaw in the village she child be always taunt the son of the first wife and so it go on until at last good road say he would stand it no longer he tell he oldest wife to go -- that he would support she no longer and for she child he tell they the prairie be large there be deer and other game -- in short he disinherit they -- cut they off with they last meal for the discard wife life have now but one hope the only star that shine in the blackness of she heaven be the undefined prospect of see she rival 's blood flow she would greatly have prefer take she life herself and as she leave the wigwam of the chief she grasp the handle of she knife -- how quick she heart beat it might be now or never but there be too many around to protect old bet the time would come -- she would watch for she -- she would tear she heart from she yet the son of the old hag do not leave the village they would keep a watch on they father and he chippeway wife they would not easily yield they right to the chieftainship while they hunt and smoke and play at card they be ever on the look-out for revenge chapter ii red earth sit by the door of she father 's teepee while the village be alive with cheerfulness she do not join in any of the amusement go on but seem to be occupy with what be pass in she own mind occasionally she throw a pebble from the shore far into the river and the copper-colored child spring after it as if the water be they own element strive to get it before it sink from they view have she be attentive to what be pass around she she would not have keep she seat for shine iron the son of good road 's second wife approach she and she love he too little to talk with he when it can be avoid why be you not help the woman to make the teepee red earth say the warrior they be laugh while they sew the buffalo-skin together and you be sit silent and alone why be it so be you think of ` fiery wind ' there be enough woman to make the teepee reply red earth and i sit alone because i choose to do so but if i be thinking of ` fiery wind ' i do right -- he be a great warrior tell I if you love fiery wind say the young man while he eye flash fire and the vein in he temple swell almost to burst i do not love you say the girl and that be enough and you need never think i will become you wife you spell can not make I love you -lrb- footnote : the sioux have great faith in spell a lover will take gum and after put some medicine in it will induce the girl of he choice to chew it or put it in she way so that she will take it up of she own accord it be a long time before a indian lover will take a refusal from the woman he have choose for a wife -rrb- where be fiery wind and he relation drive from the wigwam of the chief by you and you chippeway mother but they do not fear you -- neither do i and red earth look calmly at the angry face of she lover for shine iron do love she and he have love she long he have load she with present which she always refuse he have relate he honor he brave act to she but she turn a deaf ear to he word he promise she he would always have venison in she teepee and that he never would take another wife she be the only woman he could ever love but he might as well have talk to the wind and he think so himself for find he could not gain the heart of the proud girl he determine she should never be the wife of any other man and he tell she so you may marry fiery wind say the angry lover but if you do i will kill he red earth hear but do not reply to he threat she fear not for herself but she tremble at the prospect of danger to the man she love and while she turn the bracelet on she small wrist the warrior leave she to she own thought they be far from be pleasant she must warn she lover of the threat of he rival for a while she almost determine she would not marry fiery wind for then he life would be safe but she would not break she promise besides it be hard for she to destroy all the air-built castle which she have build for she happy future she know shine iron 's bravery and she doubt not he would fulfil he promise for a moment prudence suggest that she have better marry he to avoid he revenge but she grasp the handle of she knife as if she would plunge it into she own bosom for harbor the dark thought never should she be unfaithful when fiery wind return she would tell he all and then she would become he wife and she feel that she own heart be true enough to guard he she own arm strong enough to slay he enemy \* \* \* \* \* all woman be wilful enough but dahcotah woman be particularly so slave as they be to they husband they lord it over each other and it be only when they become grandmother that they seem to feel they dependence and in many instance yield implicit obedience to the will of they grandchild they take great delight in watch over and instruct they child 's child give they lesson in morality -lrb- footnote : the idea be ridicule by some that a indian mother trouble herself about the moral of she child but it be nevertheless true that she talk to they and accord to she own idea of right and wrong try to instil good principle into they mind the grandmother take a great deal of care of they grandchild -rrb- and worldly wisdom thus while red earth be make she determination she old grandmother belong to the village be act upon hers this old woman be a perfect virago -- a embody storm in she time she have cut off the hand and foot of some little chippeway child and string they and wear they for a necklace and she feast yet at the pleasant recollection this honorable exploit induce but so tender be she of the feeling of she own flesh and blood that the thought of they suffer the slightest pain be death to she she son rule he household very well for a dahcotah he have a number of young warrior and hunter grow up around he and he sometimes get tire of they disturbance and would use not the rod but a stick of wood to some purpose although it have the good effect of quell the refractory spirit of the young it invariably fire the soul of he aged mother the old woman would cry and howl and refuse to eat for day till find this have no effect upon she hard-hearted son she tell he she would do something that would make he sorry the next time he strike one of he child but the dutiful son pay no attention to she he have always consider woman as be inferior to dog and he would as soon have think of give up smoking as of mind he mother 's threat but while red earth be think of she absent lover two star be beat he son again -- and when the maiden be leave alone by shine iron after the warning he have give she she be attract by the cry of one of the old woman of the village who be struggle ` mid earth and heaven while old and young be run to the spot some to render assistance other to see the fun and glorious fun it be the grandmother have almost hung herself -- that be she seriously intend to do it but she evidently do not expect the operation to be so painful when she son in defiance of she tear and threat commence settle he household difficulty in he own way she take she head-strap -lrb- footnote : the head-strap be make of buffalo skin it be from eight to ten or sometimes twenty-four foot long the woman fasten they heavy burden to this strap which go around the forehead the weight of the burden fall upon the head and back this occasion the figure of the indian woman to stoop since they necessarily lean forward in order to preserve they balance -rrb- go to a hill just above the village and deliberately make she preparation for hang as coolly too as if she have be use to be hang for a long time but when after have double the strap four time to prevent its break she find herself choke she courage give way -- she yell frightfully and it be well that she son and other run so fast for they have well nigh be too late as it be they carry she into the teepee where the medicine man take charge of she case and she be quite well again in a hour or two report say -lrb- but there be a sad amount of scandal in a indian village -rrb- that the son have never offend the mother since so like many a wilful woman she have gain she point red earth witness the cut down of the old woman and as she return to she teepee she quick ear warn she of come footstep she linger apart from the other and soon she see the eagle feather of she warrior as he descend the hill towards the village gladly would she have go to meet he to welcome he home but she know that shine iron be watch she motion and she bent she step homeward she be quite sure that it would not be long before he would seek she and then she would tell he what have pass and make arrangement for they course of conduct for the future fiery wind be the nephew of good road but he like the son be in disgrace with the chief and like they he have vow vengeance against old bet chapter iii the gun be now generally use among the dahcotah as a weapon of warfare but those band in the neighborhood of fort snell consider it as a necessary part of they war implement before the distant band be at all acquaint with its use some time ago one of the mun-da-wa-kan-ton give a gun to a sisse-ton who proud of the gift go out immediately to use it on he return to he village he come up with a drive of buffalo he first impulse be to use he bow and arrow but a moment 's thought remind he of the gift of he friend he load the gun say at the same time to it now the dahcotah call you ` wah-kun ' -lrb- supernatural -rrb- kill I the fattest cow in the drive he wait a few moment to see he order execute but the gun be not wah-kun enough to fire by order alone see that it do not go off the sisse-ton fly into a rage and break the gun into piece i suppose say he that if a mun-da-wah-can-ton have tell you to kill a buffalo you would have do it but you do not regard what a sisse-ton say so he throw the piece of the gun away and find he bow and arrow of far more service however naturally the usage of warfare may come to the indian they be also make a part of they education the child be teach that it be wicked to murder without a cause but when offence have be give they be in duty bind to retaliate the day after the return of fiery wind the boy of the village be to attack a hornet 's nest this be one of the way of train they son to warfare one of the old warrior have see a hornet 's nest in the wood and he return to the village and with the chief assemble all the boy in the village the chief order the boy to take off all they clothes and give they each a gun he then tell they how brave they forefather be -- that they never fear pain or danger -- and that they must prove themselves worthy son of such ancestor one of these day you will be man and then you will go on war party and kill you enemy and then you will be fit to join in the dog feast be brave and do not fear the sting of the hornet for if you do you will be coward instead of warrior and the brave will call you woman and laugh at you this be enough to animate the courage of the boy -- some of they not more than five year old push ahead of they elder brother eager to show to they father who accompany they how little they fear they enemy as they term the hornet and formidable enemy they be too -- for many of the little fellow return sadly sting with swollen limb and close eye but they bear they wound as well as brave man would have endure they pain on a battle-field after leave they village they enter the wood farther from the bank of the river the guide who have see the nest lead the way and the miniature warrior tread as lightly as if there be danger of rouse a sleep foe at last the old man point to the nest and without a moment 's hesitation the young dahcotah attack it out fly the hornet in every direction some of the little boy cry out with the pain from the sting of the hornet on they unprotected limb -- but the cry of shame shame from one of the old man soon recall they to they duty and they march up again not a whit discomfited good road cheer they on fight well my warrior say he you will carry many scalp home you be brave man it be not long before the nest be quite destroy and then the old man say they must take a list of the kill and wound the boy force a loud laugh when they reply that there be no scalp take by the enemy but they could not deny that the list of the wound be quite a long one some of they limp in spite of they effort to walk upright and one little fellow have to be assist along by he father for both eye be close and although sting in every direction and evidently suffer agony the brave boy would not utter a complaint when they approach the village the young warrior form into indian file and enter as triumphantly as they father would have do have they bear twenty chippeway scalp with they the mother first applaud the bravery of they son and then apply herb to they swollen limb and the mimic war furnish a subject of amusement for the village for the remainder of the day chapter iv it would be well for the dahcotah if they only seek the life of they enemy but they be waste in number far more by they internal dissension than from other cause murder be so common among they that it be even less than a nine day ' wonder all that be think necessary be to bury the dead and then some relative must avenge he quarrel red earth tell she lover of the threat of shine iron and the young man be thus put on he guard the son of good road 's first wife be also tell of the state of thing and they tell fiery wind that they would take up he quarrel glad of a opportunity to avenge they own and they mother 's wrong it be in the month of April or as the dahcotah say in the moon that goose lay that red earth take she place by the side of she husband thus assert she right to be mistress of he wigwam while she occupy herself with she many duty she never for a moment forget the threat of shine iron but she care and anxiety for she husband 's safety be soon over she have not long be a wife before she enemy lay a corpse he life be a forfeit to he love for she and red earth have a woman 's heart although she could but rejoice that the fear which have torment she be now unnecessary yet when she remember how devotedly the dead warrior have love she how anxiously he have try to please she she could not but shed a few tear of sorrow for he death but they be soon wipe away -- not for the world would she have have she husband see they the oldest son of good road be true to they word -- and the son of old bet be not the only subject for they vengeance he sister be with he at the moment that they choose to accomplish they purpose and when a indian commence to shed blood there be no know how soon he will be satisfied shine iron die instantly but the sister 's wound be not fatal -- she be slowly recover it be but yesterday that we visit the grave of the dead warrior on a hill near the st peter he body be bury the indian have enclose the grave and there be a wah-kun stone to which they sacrifice at he head no one repose near he alone he lie undisturbed by aught except the wind that sigh over he the first flower of spring be bloom on the spot where he play in childhood and here where he repose he often sit to mourn the unkindness of red earth and vow vengeance on he successful rival but he be not unwatched he spirit be ever near and perhaps he will again live on earth -lrb- footnote : the sioux believe in the transmigration of soul many of the indian near fort snelling say they have live before on earth the juggler remember many incident that occur during some former residence on earth and they will tell they to you with all the gravity imaginable -rrb- he friend believe that he may hold communion with unk-ta-he -- that from that god he will learn the mystery of the earth and water and when he live again in another form he will instruct the dahcotah in they religion and be a great medicine man good road be quite reconcile to he son for he say it be a brave deed to get rid of a enemy in vain do old bet ask for vengeance on the murderer good road remind she that shine iron have make a threat and it be not proper he should live and the chief insist more upon this when he add that these child of she 's be by a former husband and it be natural he son should resent they father 's preference for they so after all old bet doubt whether she or the chief 's first wife have get the best of it and as she dress the wound of she daughter she wish that the dahcotah have kill she mother instead of adopt she -- lament too that she should ever have attain to the honor of be good road 's wife wenona or the virgin 's feast never do the sun shine brighter than on a cold day in December when the indian at little crow 's village be prepare to go on a deer hunt the mississippus be freeze and the girl of the village have the day before enjoy one of they favorite amusement -- a ball-play on the ice those who own the bright cloth and calico which be hang up before they eye as a incentive to win the game be still rejoice over they treasure while the disappointed one be look sullen and muttering of partiality be show to this one because she be beautiful and to that because she be the sister of the chief look at my head say harpstenah wenona know that i be the swiftest runner in the band and as i stooped to catch the ball she strike I a blow that stun I so that i could not run again but the head be so ugly and the face too that there be no pity feel for she those dirty wrinkled feature bear witness to she contempt for the cleanse quality of water she uncombed hair be hang in mass about she ear and face and she countenance express cruelty and passion but harpstenah have nothing to avenge when she be young she be pass by as there be nothing in she face or disposition that could attract and now in the winter of life she be so ugly and so desolate so cross and so forlorn that no one deem she worthy even of a slight but for all that harpstenah could hate and with all the intensity of she evil heart do she hate wenona the beautiful sister of the chief yesterday have be as bright as to-day and gray eagle the medicine man have hang on a pole the prize that be to be give to the party that succeed in throw the ball into a space mark off the maiden of the village be all dress in they gayest clothing with ornament of bead bracelet ring and ribbon in profusion they care not half so much for the prize as they rejoice at the opportunity of display they graceful person the old woman be eager to commence the game for they long to possess the cloth for they leggin and the calico for they okendokenda -lrb- footnote okendokenda this be the sioux word for calico it be use as the name for a kind of short gown which be worn by the sioux woman make generally of calico sometimes of cloth -rrb- the woman young and old be divide into two party but as one party throw the ball towards the space mark off the other throw it back again far over they head and then all run back each party endeavor to reach it first that they might succeed in place the ball in the position which be to decide the game but the ball be not throw by the hand each woman have a long stick with a circular frame at the end of it this they call a bat stick and simple as it look it require great skill to manage it wenona be the swiftest runner of one party and harpstenah old and ugly as she be the best of the other how excited they be the snow-covered hill majestic and silent look coldly enough upon they sport but what care they the prize will soon be win the old medicine man cheer they on run fast wenona take care that harpstenah do not win the game ho harpstenah if you and you leggin be old you may have the cloth yet now wenona 's party be get on bravely but the ball have be catch and throw back by the other party but at last it be decide in the struggle for the ball harpstenah receive a blow from a old squaw as dismal look as herself and wenona catch the ball and throw it into the appoint place the game be end and the medicine man come forward to distribute the prize the warrior have look on admire those who be beautiful and graceful and laugh at the ugly and awkward but wenona care little for the prize she be a chief 's sister and she be young and beautiful the handsomest present be give she and she hardly look at the portion of the prize which fall to she lot smart with pain from the blow she have receive -lrb- and she speak falsely when she say wenona have strike she -rrb- sting with jealousy at the other party have win the game harpstenah determine on revenge if i be old she say i will live long enough to bring misery on she ugly as i may be i will humble the proud beauty what do i eat the worthless head of bird be give to the old woman for whom nobody care but my food will be to see the eye of wenona fall beneath the laugh of scorn i will revenge the wrong of my life on she commend I to a dahcotah woman 's revenge have she be slight in love blood must be shed and if she be not able to accomplish the death of she rival she own life will probably pay the forfeit have disgrace or insult be heap upon she a life of eighty year be not long enough to bring down vengeance on the offender so with harpstenah she life have not be a blessing to herself -- she would make it a curse to other chapter ii in the preparation for the deer hunt the ball-play have be forget the woman be put together what will be necessary for they comfort during they absence and the man be examine they gun and bow and arrow the young girl anticipate amusement and happiness for they will assist they lover to bring in the deer to the camp and the jest and merry laugh and the word of love be speak too the ball-play have be forget by all but harpstenah but it be late in the afternoon and as they do not start till the morning something must be do to pass the long evening if this be full say a young hunter kick at the same time a empty keg that have once contain whiskey if this be full we would have a merry night of it yes say gray iron whose age seem to have bring he wisdom the night would be merry but where would you be the day after do you not after drink that very whiskey strike a white woman for which you be take to the fort by the soldier and keep as a prisoner the young man 's look of mortification at this reproof do not save he from the contemptuous sneer of he companion for all despise the dahcotah who have thus be punish no act of bravery can wipe away he disgrace but wenona sit pale and sad in she brother 's wigwam the bright and happy look of yesterday be all go she sister-in-law have hush she child to sleep and she be rest from the fatigue of the day several old man friend of little crow 's father be sit round the fire one have fall asleep while the other talk of the wonderful power of they sacred medicine why be you sad wenona say the chief turn to she why should the eye of a chief 's sister be fill with tear and she look bent on the ground you need not ask why i be not happy say wenona : red cloud bring present to you yesterday he lay they at the door of you wigwam he want to buy I and you have receive he gift why do you not return they you know i do not love he red cloud be a great warrior reply the chief he wear many feather of honor you must marry he the girl wrap herself in she blanket and lay down for a time she sigh be hear -- but at length sleep come to she relief and she grief be forget in dream but morn have come and they be to make a early start be ever such confusion look at that old hag knock the very sens out of she daughter 's head because she be not ready and the girl in order to avoid the blow stumble over a unfortunate dog who commence a horrible bark and whine tempting all the dog of the village to outbark and outwhine he there go white buffalo with he two wife the first wife with the teepee on she back and she child on the top of it no wonder she look so cross for the second wife walk leisurely on now be she time but let she beware for white buffalo be think seriously of take a third but they be all off at last mother with child and corn and teepee and child with dog on they back they be all go and the village look desolate and forsake chapter iii the party encamp about twenty mile from the village the woman plant the pole of they teepee firmly in the ground and cover they with a buffalo skin a fire be soon make in the center and the corn put on to boil they bread be knead and put in the ash to bake but flour be not very plenty among they the next day party be out in every direction track of deer be see in the snow and the hunter follow they up the beautiful animal fly in terror from the death which come surer and swifter than she own light footstep the hunter 's knife be soon upon she and while warmth and even life be leave the skin be draw off after the fatigue of the day come the long and pleasant evening a bright fire burn in the wigwam of the chief and many of the indian be smoke around it but wenona be sad and she take but little part in the laughter and merriment of the other red cloud boast of he bravery and he deed of valor even the old man listen to he with respect for they know that he name be a terror to he enemy but wenona turn from he she hate to hear the sound of he voice the old man talk of the mighty giant of the dahcotah he who need not to take he gun to kill the game he want the glance of he eye would strike with death the deer the buffalo or even the bear the song the jest the legend by turn occupy they until they separate to sleep but as the warrior step into the open air why do the light of the moon fall upon face pale with terror see say the chief how flash the mysterious light there be danger near some dreadful calamity be threaten we we will shoot at they say red cloud we will destroy they power and the indian discharge they gun in quick succession towards the northern horizon which be brilliantly illuminate with the aurora boreali thus hope to ward off come danger the brother and sister be leave alone at the door of the teepee the stern warrior 's look express superstitious terror while the maiden 's face be calm and fearless do you not fear the power of the woman who sit in the north wenona she show those flash of light to tell we of come evil what should i fear say wenona i who will soon join my mother my father my sister in the land of spirit listen to my word my brother : there be but two of we strife and disease have lay low the brave the good the beautiful we be the last of we family you will soon be alone before the leaf fall from the tree as i sit on the bank of the mississippus i see the fairy of the water the moon be rise but it be not yet bright enough for I to see she figure distinctly but i know she voice i have often hear it in my dream ` wenona ' she say -lrb- and the wave be still that they might hear she word -rrb- ` wenona the land of the dahcotah be green and beautiful -- but there be fairer prairie than those on earth in that bright country the forest tree be ever green and the wave of the river flow on unchilled by the breath of winter you will not long be with the child of the earth even now you sister be call you and you mother be tell they that a few more month will bring you to they side ' the word be true my brother but i know not that you harshness would hasten my go you say that i shall marry red cloud sooner will i plunge my knife into my heart sooner shall the wave of the mississippus roll over I brother you will soon be alone speak not such word my sister say the chief it shall be as you will i have not promise red cloud i think you would be happy if you be he wife and you shall not be force to marry he but why should you think of death you see we brave as they shoot at the light in the north they have frighten they away look they flash no more go in and sleep and to-morrow i will tell red cloud that you love he not and the cloudless moon shone on a happy face and the bright star seem more bright as wenona gaze upon they but as she turn to enter the wigwam one star be see fall in the heaven and the light that follow it be lose in the brightness of the other and she dream be not happy for the fairy of the water haunt they even as that star wenona thou shalt pass from all that thou lovest on earth but weep not thy course be upward \* \* \* \* \* the hunter be so successful that they return to they village soon the friend of wenona rejoice in she happy look but to harpstenah they be bitterness and gall the angry countenance of red cloud find a answering chord in she own heart ha say she to he as he watch wenona and she lover talk together what have happen do you not say you would marry the chief 's sister -- why then be you not with she red cloud be a great warrior why should he be sad because wenona love he not be there not maiden among the dahcotah more beautiful than she she never love you she brother too have treat you with contempt listen to my word red cloud the virgin 's feast be soon to be celebrate and she will enter the ring for the last time when she come forward tell she she be unworthy be she not a disgrace to the band have she not shame a brave warrior will you not be despise when another be prefer to you the word of the tempter be in he ear -- madness and hatred be in he heart i say i would take she life but my revenge will be deeper wenona would die rather than be disgraced and as he speak harpstenah turn to leave he for she see that the poison have enter he soul chapter iv among the dahcotah woman be not exclude from join in they feast or dance they dance the scalp dance while the man sit round and sing and they join in celebrate many of the custom of they tribe but the virgin 's feast have reference to the woman alone its object be not to celebrate the deed of the warrior but rather to put to the test the virtue of the maiden notice be give among the indian that the virgin 's feast be to be celebrate at little crow 's village the time be mention and all who choose to attend be welcome to do so the feast be prepare in the neighborhood of the village the boil corn and venison be put in wooden bowl and the indian sit round form a ring those who be to partake of the feast be dress in they gayest apparel they long hair plait and fall over they shoulder those who be conscious of error dare not approach the feast for it be a part of the ceremony that they shall be expose by any one present neither rank nor beauty must interpose to prevent the punishment nay sometimes the power of innocence and virtue itself be not sufficient to guard the dahcotah maiden from disgrace and be wenona unworthy the white snow that cover the hill be not more pure than she but red cloud care not for that she have refuse to be the light of he wigwam and thus be he avenge wenona advance with the maiden of the village who can describe she terror and dismay when red cloud advance and lead she from the sacred ring to whom shall the maiden turn for help to she brother he angry countenance speak not of comfort she friend the smile of scorn be on they lip she lover he have leave the feast she determination be soon make she form be see as she fly to the wood death be the refuge of the friendless and the wrong but as night come on the relative of wenona wonder that she do not return they seek she and they find she lifeless body the knife be deep in she heart she know she be innocent but what do that avail she she be accuse by a warrior and who would believe she if she deny the charge and why condemn she that she deprive herself of life which she deem worthless when embittered by unmerited contempt she know not that god have say thou shall do no murder the command have never sound in she ear she trust to find a home in the house of spirit -- she may have find a heaven in the mercy of god the fever of the follow summer spare neither age nor youth and red cloud be its first victim as the die harpstenah see he body carry out to be place upon the scaffold -- he be dead she cry and wenona be innocent he hate she because she slight he i hate she because she be happy he have he revenge and i mine but wenona be falsely accuse and i tell he to do it and the eye be close -- the voice be hush in death wenona be innocent and when the virgin 's feast shall be celebrate in she native village again how will the maiden tremble as they approach the sacred ring can they forget the fate of they beautiful companion and when the breath of summer warm to life the prairie flower -- when the long grass shall wave under the scaffold where repose the mortal remains of the chief 's sister -- how often will the dahcotah maiden draw near to contrast the meanness the treachery the falsehood of red cloud with the constancy devotion and firmness of wenona the dahcotah convert tell I say hiatu-we-noken-chah or ` woman of the night ' the great spirit whom you have teach I to fear why have he make the white woman rich and happy and the dahcotah poor and miserable she speak with bitterness when she remember the year of sorrow that have make up the sum of she existence but how with the missionary 's wife have she life be one bright dream -- have she day be always full of gladness -- she night quiet and free from care have she never long for the time of repose that darkness might cover she as with a mantle -- and when ` sleep forsake the wretched ' do she not pray for the breaking of the day that she might again forget all in the performance of the duty of she station could it be that the creator have balance the happiness of one portion of he child against the wretchedness of the rest let she story answer she home be now among the forest of the west as a child she would tremble when she hear of the savage whose only happiness be in shed the blood of he fellow creature the name of a indian when utter by she nurse would check the boisterous gayety of the day or the tedious restlessness of the night as she gather flower on the pleasant bank of the sciota would it not have bring paleness to she cheek to have whisper she that not many year would pass over she before she would be far away from the scene of she youth and as she utter the marriage vow how little do she think that soon would she broken spirit devote time energy life to the good of other as a act of duty and but for the faith of the christian of despair for several year she only weep with other when they sorrow fair child follow she footstep and it be happiness to guide they voice as they like the morning star sing together or to listen to they evening prayer as they fold they hand in childlike devotion ere they sleep and when the father return from beside the bed of death where he skill could no longer alleviate the parting agony of the sufferer : how would he hasten to look upon the happy face of he child in order to forget the scene he have just witness but man of god as he be there be not always peace in he soul yet none could see that he have cause for care he be follow by the blessing of those who be ready to perish he essay to make the sinner repent and to turn the thought of the die to he who suffer death on the cross but for month the voice of the spirit spake to he heart he could not forget the word -- go to the wretched dahcotah they body be suffer and they soul immortal like thine be perish soothe they temporal care and more tell they the triumph of the redeemer 's love but it be hard to give up friend and all the comfort with which he be surround : to subject he wife to the hardship of a life in the wilderness to deprive he child of the advantage of education and good influence and instead -- to show they life as it be with those who know not god but the voice say remember the dahcotah vainly do he struggle with the conflict of duty against inclination the time have come when the parent must weep for themselves no longer do the foot of they child tread among the flower fever have paralyze they strength and vainly do the mother call upon the child whose eye wander in delirium who know not she voice from a stranger 's nor do the destroyer depart when one have sink into a sleep from which there be no awakening until the morn of the resurrection he claim another and who shall resist that claim as the father look upon the still form of he child as he see the compress lip the closed eye of the being who be but a few day ago full of life and happiness the iron enter he soul but as the christian remember who have afflict he he spirit rise above he sorrow nor be there now any obstacle between he and the path of duty the one child that remain must be put in charge of those who will care for she and he will go where god direct but will the mother give up the last of she child it matter not now where she live but she must part with husband or child self have no part in she scheme secure in she trust in god she yield up she child to she friend and listen not to the suggestion of those who would induce she to remain where she would still enjoy the comfort of life nothing should separate she from she husband entreat I not to leave thee where thou goest i will go where thou diest i will die and there will i be bury and as the dahcotah woman inquire of the justice of god the face of she child rise up before she -- first in health with bright eye and lip part with smile and then as she last see they -- they hand white to transparency the hue of death upon they feature the shroud the little coffin the cold lip as she press they for the last time the dahcotah look in astonishment at the grief which for a few moment overcome the usual calmness of she kind friend and as she wonder why like she she should shed bitter tear she hear herself thus address -- do not think that you alone have be unhappy god afflict all he child there be not a spot on the earth which be secure from sorrow have i not tell you why this world be not you home or mine soon will we body lie down in the earth -- and we would forget this if we be always happy and you should not complain though you sorrow have be great do not forget the crown of thorn which press the brow of the savior the cruel nail that pierce he hand and foot the desertion of he friend he fear that god he father have forsake he and remember that after death the power of those who hate he cease the grave receive but could not keep he body he rise from the dead and go to heaven where he have prepare a place for all who love he for I and mine i trust and for you too if you be careful to please he by serve he yourself and by endeavor to induce you friend to give up they foolish and wicked superstition and to worship the true god who make all thing chapter ii the dahcotah believe in the existence of a great spirit but they have very confused idea of he attribute those who have live near the missionary say that the great spirit live forever but they own mind would never have conceive such a idea some say that the great spirit have a wife they say that this be create all thing but thunder and wild rice and that he give the earth and all animal to they and that they feast and custom be the law by which they be to be govern but they do not fear the anger of this deity after death thunder be say to be a large bird the name that they give to thunder be the generic term for all animal that fly near the source of the st peter be a place call thunder-track -- where the footprint of the thunder-bird be see in the rock twenty-five mile apart the dahcotah believe in a evil spirit as well as a good but they do not consider these spirit as oppose to each other they do not think that they be tempt to do wrong by this evil spirit they own heart be bad it would be impossible to put any limit to the number of spirit in whom the dahcotah believe every object in nature be full of they they attribute death as much to the power of these subordinate spirit as to the great spirit but most frequently they suppose death to have be occasion by a spell have be cast upon they by some enemy the sun and moon be worship as emblem of they deity sacrifice be a religious ceremony among they but no missionary have yet be able to find any reference to the one great atonement make for sin none of they custom or tradition authorize any such connection they sacrifice to all the spirit but they have a stone paint red which they call grandfather and on or near this they place they most valuable article they buffalo robe dog and even horse and on one occasion a father kill a child as a kind of sacrifice they frequently inflict severe bruise or cut upon they body think thus to propitiate they god the belief in a evil spirit be say by some not to be a part of the religion of the dahcotah they perhaps obtain this idea from the whites they have a far greater fear of the spirit of the dead especially those whom they have offend than of wahkon-tun-kah the great spirit \* \* \* \* \* one of the punishment they most dread be that of the body of a animal enter theirs to make they sick some of the medicine man the priest and the doctor of the dahcotah seem to have a idea of the immortality of the soul but intercourse with the whites may have originate this they know nothing of the resurrection they have no custom among they that indicate the belief that man 's heart should be holy the faith in spirit dream and charm the fear that some enemy earthly or spiritual may be secretly work they destruction by a spell be as much a part of they creed as the existence of the great spirit a good dream will raise they hope of success in whatever they may be undertake to the highest pitch a bad one will make they despair of accomplish it they religion be a superstition include as few element of truth and reason as perhaps any other of which the particulars be know they worship they know not what and this from the lowest motive when they go out to hunt or on a war party they pray to the great spirit -- father help we to kill the buffalo let we soon see deer -- or great spirit help we to kill we enemy they have no hymn of praise to they deity they fast occasionally at the time of they dance when they dance in honor of the sun they refrain from eat for two day the dahcotah do not worship the work of they hand but they consider every object that the great spirit have make from the highest mountain to the smallest stone as worthy of they idolatry they have a vague idea of a future state many have dream of it some of they medicine man pretend to have have revelation from bear and other animal and they thus learn that they future existence would be but a continuation of this they will go on long hunt and kill many buffalo bright fire will burn in they wigwam as they talk through the long winter 's night of the tradition of they ancient they woman be to tan deer-skin for they mocassin while they young child learn to be brave warrior by attack and destroy wasp ' or hornet ' nest they will celebrate the dog feast to show how brave they be and sing in triumph as they dance round the scalp of they enemy such be the heaven of the dahcotah almost every indian have the image of a animal or bird tattoo on he breast or arm which can charm away a evil spirit or prevent he enemy from bring trouble or death upon he by a secret shot the power of life rest with mortal especially with they medicine man they believe that if a enemy be shooting secretly at they a spell or charm must be put in requisition to counteract they power the medicine man or woman who be initiate into the secret of they wonderful medicine -lrb- which secret be as sacred with they as free-masonry be to its member -rrb- give the feast which they call the medicine feast they medicine man who profess to administer to the affair of soul and body be nothing more than juggler and be the worst man of the tribe : yet from fear alone they claim the entire respect of the community there be numerous clan among the dahcotah each use a different medicine and no one know what this medicine be but those who be initiate into the mystery of the medicine dance whose celebration be attend with the utmost ceremony a dahcotah would die before he would divulge the secret of he clan all the different clan unite at the great medicine feast and from such error as these must the dahcotah turn if he would be a christian and the heart of the missionary would faint within he at the work which be before he do he not remember who have say lo i be with you always and it be long before the indian woman could give up the creed of she nation the mark of the wound in she face and arm will to the grave bear witness of she belief in the faith of she father which influence she in youth yet the subduing of she passion the quiet performance of she duty the neatness of she person and the order of she house tell of the influence of a better faith which sanctify the sorrow of this life and rejoice she with the hope of another and a better state of existence but such instance be rare these people have resist as encroachment upon they rights the effort that have be make for they instruction kindness and patience however have accomplish much and during the last year they have in several instance express a desire for the aid and instruction of missionary they seem to wish they to live among they though formerly the life of those who feel it they duty to remain be in constant peril they depend more too upon what the ground yield they for food and have seek for assistance in plough it there be four school sustain by the dahcotah mission in all there be about one hundred and seventy child the average attendance about sixty the missionary feel that they have accomplish something and they be encourage to hope for still more they have induce many of the dahcotah to be more temperate and although few comparatively attend worship at the several station yet of those few some exhibit hopeful sign of conversion there be five mission station among the dahcotah at lac quus parle on the st peter 's river in sight of the beautiful lake from which the station take its name at traver des sioux about eighty mile from fort snelling at xapedun oak-grove and kapoja the last three be within a few mile of fort snelling there be many who think that the effort of those engage in instruct the dahcotah be throw away they can not conceive why man of education talent and piety should waste they time and attainment upon a people who can not appreciate they effort if the missionary reason on worldly principle they would doubtless think so too but they devote the energy of soul and body to he who make they for he own service they be pioneer in religion they show the path that other will walk in far more easily at some future day they undertake what other will carry on -- what god himself will accomplish they have willingly give up the advantage of this life to preach the gospel to the degraded dahcotah they be translate the bible into sioux many of the book be translate and to they exertion it be owe that the praise of god have be sing by the child of the forest in they own language chapter iii however absurd may be the religion of the dahcotah they be zealous in they devotion to it nothing be allow to interfere with it be they woman plant corn which be to be in a great measure depend upon for food during the next winter whatever be the consequence they stop to celebrate a dance or a feast either of which be a part of they religion how many christian satisfy they conscience by devote one day of the week to god feeling themselves thus justified in devote the other six entirely to the world but it be altogether different with the dahcotah every act of they life be influence by they religion such as it be they believe they be a great people that they country be unrivalled in beauty they religion without fault many of the dahcotah now live near fort snelling say that they have live on the earth before in some region far distant that they die and for a time they spirit wander through the world seek the most beautiful and delightful country to live in and that after examine all part of the earth they fix upon the country of the dahcotah in fact dream spell and superstitious fear constitute a large part of the belief of the dahcotah but of all they superstitious notion the most curious be the one which occasion the dance call ho-saw-kah-u-tap-pe or fish dance where the fish be eat raw some day since a indian who live at shah-co-pee 's village dream of see a cormorant a bird which feed on fish he be very much alarmed and direct he friend to go out and catch a fish and to bring the first one he catch to he the indian do so and the fish which be a large pike be paint with blue clay preparation be immediately make to celebrate the fish dance in order to ward off any danger of which the dream might have be the omen a circle be form of brush on one side of which the indian pitch a wigwam the war implement be then bring inside the ring and a pole stick up in the center with the raw fish paint blue hang upon it the man then enter the ring almost naked they body paint black except the breast and arm which be vary in color accord to the fancy of each individual inside the ring be a bush for each dancer in each bush a nest make to resemble a cormorant 's nest and outside the ring be a indian metamorphose for the occasion into a wolf -- that be he have the skin of a wolf draw over he and hoop fix to he hand to enable he to run easier on all fours and in order to sustain the character which he have assume he remain outside lurk about for food all be ready the medicine man inside the wigwam commence beat a drum and singing this be the signal for all the cormorant -lrb- indian -rrb- inside the ring to commence quack and dance and use they arm in imitation of wing keep up a continual flap thus for some time they dance up to and around the fish -- when the bravest among they will snap at the fish and if he have good tooth will probably bite off a piece if not he will slip he hold and flap off again another will try he luck at this delicious food and so they continue until they have make a beginning in the way of eat the fish then each cormorant flap up and take a bite and then flap off to he nest in which the piece of fish be conceal for fear the wolf may get it after a while the wolf be see emerge from he retreat paint so hideously as to frighten away the indian child the cormorant perceive the approach of the wolf and a general quacking and flap take place each one rush to he nest to secure he food this food each cormorant seize and try to swallow flap he wing and stretch out he neck as a young bird will when feed by its mother after the most strenuous exertion they succeed in swallow the raw fish while this be go on the wolf seize the opportunity to make a snap at the remainder of the fish seize it with he tooth and make he way out of the ring as fast as he can on all four the whole of the fish bone and all must be swallow not the smallest portion of it can be leave and the fish must only be touch by the mouth -- never with the hand this dance be perform by the man alone -- they war implement must be sacred from the touch of woman such scene be witness every day at the dahcotah village the missionary sigh as he see how determine be they belief in such a religion be it not a source of rejoice to be the means of turn one fellow-creature from a faith like this a few year ago and every dahcotah woman reverence the fish-dance as holy and sacred -- even too sacred for she to take a part in it she believe the medicine woman could foretell future event and with a injustice hardly to be account for she would tell you it be lawful to beat a girl as much as you choose but a sin to strike a boy she glory in dance the scalp dance -- aye even exult at the idea of take the life of a enemy herself but there be instance in which these thing be all lay aside beneath the light of christianity instance in which the poor dahcotah woman see the folly the wickedness of she former faith bless god who incline the missionary to leave he home and take up he abode in the country of the savage and sing to the praise of god in she own tongue as she sit by the door of she wigwam she smile as she tell you that she face be dark but that she hope she heart have be change and that she will one day sing in heaven where the voice of the white people and of the convert dahcotah will mingle in a song of love to he ` who die for the whole world ' wabashaw chapter i wabashaw -lrb- or the leaf -rrb- be the name of one of the dahcotah chief he village be on the mississippus river 1800 mile from its mouth the teepee be pitch quite near the shore and the many bluff that rise behind they seem to be they perpetual guard the present chief be about thirty-five year old -- as yet he have do not much to give he a reputation above the dahcotah about he but he father be a man whose life and character be such as to influence he people to a great degree wabashaw the elder -lrb- for the son inherit he father 's name -rrb- be say by the dahcotah to have be the first chief in they tribe many year ago the english claim authority over the dahcotah and a english traveller have be murder by some dahcotah of the band of which wabashaw be a warrior the english claim hostage to be give up until the murderer could be find the affair of the nation be settle then by man who have more mind than the other naturally influence they inferior they bravest man they war chief too no doubt exercise a control over the rest wabashaw be one of the hostage give up in consequence of the murder and the governor of canada require that these dahcotah should leave the forest of the west and remain for a time as prisoner in canada little as be the regard for the feeling of the savage now there be still less then wabashaw often speak of the ill treatment he receive on he journey it be bad enough to be a prisoner and to be leave home it be far worse to be strike for the amusement of idle man and child -- to have the war eagle 's feather rudely tear from he head to be trample upon -- to have the ornament even the pipe of the nation take away and destroy before he eye but such insult often occur during they journey and the prisoner be even fetter when at last they reach quebec here for a long time they sigh to breathe the invigorating air of the prairie to chase the buffalo to celebrate the war dance but when should they join again in the ceremony of they tribe when alas they could not even ask they jailer when or if they have he would only have laugh at the strange dialect that he could not comprehend but the dahcotah bear with patience they unmerited confinement and wabashaw excel they all he eye be not as bright as when he leave home and there be a unusual weakness in he limb -- but never should he enemy know that he suffer and when those high in authority visit the prisoner the haughty dignity of wabashaw make they feel that the dahcotah warrior be a man to be respect but freedom come at last the murderer be give up and a interpreter in the prison tell wabashaw that he be no longer a prisoner that he would soon again see the father of many water and that more he have be make by the english a chief the first chief of the dahcotah it be well nigh too late for wabashaw he limb be thin and he strength have fail for want of the fresh air of he native hill little do the prisoner care to look around as they retrace they step they know they be go home but when the water of the mississippus again shine before they when the well-known bluff meet they eager gaze when the bend river give to view they native village then indeed do the new-made chief cast around he the quiet of a loving eye then too do he realize what he have suffer he strain he sight -- for perhaps he wife might have weary of wait for he -- perhaps she have go to the land of spirit hope to meet he there he child too -- the young warrior who be wont to follow he and listen to he voice would they welcome he home as he approach the village a cloud have come between he and the sun he could see many upon the shore but who be they the canoe sweep over the water keep time to the thought of those who be wanderer no longer as they near the shore the cloud pass away and the brightness of the setting sun reveal the face of they friend they cry of joy rent the air -- to the husband the son the brother they speak a welcome home wabashaw by the command of the english governor be acknowledge by the dahcotah they first chief and he influence be unbounded every band have a chief and the honor descend from father to son but there have never be one more honor and respect than wabashaw chapter ii wabashaw 's village be sometimes call keusca this word signify to break through or set aside it be give in consequence of a incident which occur some time ago in the village sacred wind be a daughter of one of the most powerful family among the dahcotah for although a chief live as the meanest of he band still there be a great difference among the family the number of a family constitute its importance where a family be small a member of it can be injure with little fear of retaliation but in a large family there be sure to be find some who will not let a insult pass without revenge sacred wind 's father be live a stalwart old warrior slightly bent with the weight of year though he face be literally seam with wrinkle he could endure fatigue or face danger with the youngest and hardiest of the band she mother a fearfully ugly old creature still mend mocassin and scold bidding fair to keep up both trade for year to come then there be tall brother brave hardship and danger as if a dahcotah be only bear to be scalp or to scalp uncle cousin too there be in abundance so that sacred wind do belong to a powerful family now among the dahcotah a cousin be look upon as a brother a girl would as soon think of marry she grandfather as a cousin i mean a ordinary girl but sacred wind be not of that stamp she be destine to be a heroine she have many lover who wear themselves out play the flute to as little purpose as they braid they hair and paint they face sacred wind do not love one of they she mother be always try to induce she to accept some one of she lover urge the advantage of each match but it would not do the girl be eighteen year old and not yet a wife though most of the dahcotah woman be mother long before that she friend could not imagine why she do not marry they be weary with argue with she but not one of they ever suspect the cause of she seeming coldness of heart she grandmother be particularly officious she could not do as sacred wind wish she -- attend to she own affair for she have none to attend to and grandmother among the sioux be as loving and devoted as they be among white people consequently the old lady beset the unfortunate girl day and night about she obstinacy why be you not now the mother of warrior she say and besides who will kill game for you when you be old the ` bear ' have be to the trader he have buy many thing which he offer you parent for you marry he and then you will make you old grandmother happy i will kill myself she reply if you ask I to marry the bear have you forget the maiden 's rock i there be more high rock than one on the bank of the mississippus and my heart be as strong as wenona 's if you torment I so to marry the bear i will do as she do -- in the house of spirit i shall have no more trouble this threat silence the grandmother for the time but a young girl who have be sit with they and listen to the conversation rise to go out and as she pass sacred wind she whisper in she ear tell she why you will not marry the bear tell she that sacred wind love she cousin and that last night she promise he she never would marry any one but he have she be strike to the earth she could not have be paler she think she secret be hide in she own heart she have try to cease thinking of the shield keep away from he dread to find true what she only suspect she do not dare acknowledge even to herself that she love a cousin but when the shield give she he handsomest trinket when he follow she when she leave she laughing and noisy companion to sit beside the still water -- when he tell she that she be the most beautiful girl among the dahcotah -- when he whisper she that he love she dearly and would marry she in spite of mother grandmother custom and religion too -- then she find that she cousin be dearer to she than all the world -- that she would gladly die with he -- she could never live without he but still she would not promise to marry he what would she friend say and the spirit of the dead would torment she for infringe upon the sacred custom of she tribe the shield use many argument but all in vain she tell he she be afraid to marry he but that she would never marry any one else sooner should the wave cease to beat against the shore of the spirit lake than she forget to think of he but this do not satisfy she cousin he be determine she should be he wife he trust to time and he irresistible person to overcome she fear the shield 's name be give to he by he father 's friend shield be formerly use by the sioux and the eyankton and sisseton still use they they be make of buffalo skin of a circular form and be use as a protection against the arrow of they enemy you need not fear you family sacred wind say she cousin nor the medicine man nor the spirit of the dead we will go to one of the village and when we be marry we will come back let they be angry i will stand between you and they even as my father 's shield do between he and the foe that seek he life but she be firm and promise nothing more than that she would not marry the bear or any one else and they return to she father 's teepee little think that any one have overhear they conversation but the swan have hear every word of it she love the shield and she have see he follow he cousin after hear enough to know that she case be a hopeless one she make up she mind to make sacred wind pay dearly for the love which she herself could not obtain she do not at once tell the news she want to amuse herself with she victim before she destroy she and she have hardly yet make up she mind as to the way which she would take to inform the family of sacred wind of the secret she have find out but she could not resist the temptation of whisper to sacred wind she knowledge of the true reason why she would not marry the bear this be the first blow and it strike to the heart it make a wound which be long keep open by the watchful eye of jealousy the grandmother however do not hear the remark if she have she would not have sit still smoking -- not she she would have tremble with rage that a dahcotah maiden and she grandchild should be guilty of the enormous crime of love a cousin a eruption of vesuvius would have give but a faint idea of she fury most fortunately for herself the venerable old medicine woman die a few day after have she live to know of the fatal passion of she granddaughter she would have long to seize the thunderbolt of jupiter -lrb- if she have be aware of they existence -rrb- to hurl at the offender or like niobe have weep herself to stone indeed the cause of she death show that she could not bear contradiction there be a war party form to attack the chippeway and the eagle that scream as she fly -lrb- for that be the name of sacred wind 's grandmother -rrb- want to go along she wish to mutilate the body after they be scalp yes though near ninety year old she would go through all the fatigue of a march of three hundred mile and think it nothing if she could be repay by tear the heart from one chippeway child there be however two old squaw who have apply first and the scream eagle be reject there be no bound to she passion she attempt to hang herself and be cut down she make the village resound with she lamentation she call upon all the spirit of the lake river and prairie to torment the war party nothing would pacify she two day after the war party leave the eagle that scream as she fly expire in a fit of rage when the war-party return the shield be the observe of all observer he have take two scalp sacred wind sigh to think he be she cousin how could she help love the warrior who have return the bravest in the battle the swan see that she love in vain she know that she love the shield more in absence why then hope that he would forget sacred wind when he see she no more when she see he enter the village she heart beat fast with emotion she press she hand upon it but could not still its tumult he have come she say to herself but will he eye seek mine will he tell _ I _ that the time have be long since he see I woman he love she follow he footstep -- she watch he every glance as he meet he relation alas for the swan the wound bird feel not so acutely the arrow that pierce as she that look of recognition between the cousin but the unhappy girl be rouse from a sense of she grief to a recollection of she wrong with all the impetuosity of a loving heart she think she have a right to the affection of the shield as the water reflect she feature so should he heart give back the devoted love of hers but while she live she be determine to bring sorrow upon she rival she would not sing in die that very evening do she repeat to the family of sacred wind the conversation she have overhear add that the love of the cousin be the true cause of sacred wind 's refuse to marry time would fail I to tell of the consequent suffering of sacred wind she be scold and watch shame and even beat the medicine man threaten she with all they power no punishment be severe enough for the dahcotah who would thus transgress the law of they nation the shield be proof against the machination of he enemy for he be a medicine man and could counteract all the spell that be exert against he sacred wind bear everything in patience but the sight of the bear she have be buy and sell over and over again and the fear of she killing herself be the only reason why she friend do not force she to marry one evening she be miss and the cry of she mother break upon the silence of night canoe be fly across the water friend be wander in the wood all seek the body of the girl but she be not to be find in the river or in the wood sacred wind be not dead she be only married she be safe in the next village tell the shield how much she love he and how cordially she hate the bear and although she tremble when she speak of the medicine man she husband only laugh at she fear tell she that now that she be he wife she need fear nothing but where be the swan she friend be assist in the search for sacred wind the father have forget he child the brother he sister and the mother who would have first miss she have go long ago to the land of spirit the swan have know of the flight of the lover -- she watch they as they canoe pass away until it become a speck in the distance and in another moment the water close over she thus be strangely blended marriage and death the swan fear not to take she own life sacred wind with a nobler courage a more devoted love break through the custom of she nation lay aside the superstition of the tribe and have thus identify she courage with the name of she native village the dahcotah bride the valley of the upper mississippus present many attraction to the reflect mind apart from the admiration excite by its natural beauty it be at once a old country and a new -- the home of a people who be rapidly pass away -- and of a nation whose strength be ever advance the white man tread upon the footstep of the dahcotah -- the war dance of the warrior give place to the march of civilization -- and the saw-mill be hear where but a few year ago be sing the deed of the dahcotah brave year ago the dahcotah hunt where the mississippus take its rise -- the tribe claim the country as far south as st loui but difficulty with the neighbor tribe have diminish they number and drive they farther north and west the white people have need they land and they course be onward how will it end will this powerful tribe cease to be a nation on the earth will they mysterious origin never be ascertain and must they religion and superstition they custom and feast pass away from memory as if they have never be who can look upon they without interest hardly the philosopher -- surely not the christian the image of god be deface in the heart of the savage cain-like do the child of the forest put forth he hand and stain it with a brother 's blood but be there no deed of darkness do in we own favored land but the country of the dahcotah -- let it be new to those who fly at the beckon of gain -- who would speculate in the blood of they fellow-creature who for gold would aye do sell they own soul -- it be a old country to I what say the boundless prairie how many generation have roam over they when do the buffalo first yield to the arrow of the hunter and look at the worn basis of the rock that be wash by the father of water hear the dahcotah maiden as she tell of the lover 's leap -- and the warrior as he boast of the victory of he forefather over he enemy long long before the hate white man have intrude upon they land or teach they the fatal secret of intoxicate drink the dahcotah feel they own weakness -- they know they can not contend with the power of the white man yet there be time when the passion and vehemence of the warrior in the neighborhood of fort snelling can hardly be bring to yield to the necessity of control and be there a possibility of success how soon would the pipe of peace be throw aside and the yell and whoop of war be hear instead and who would blame they have not the blood of we bravest and best be pour out like water for a small portion of a country -- when the whole could never make up for the loss sustain by one desolate widow or fatherless child the sky be without a cloud when the sun rise on the mississippus the morning mist pass slowly away as if they love to linger round the hill pilot knob rise above they proud to be the burial place of she warrior child while on the opposite side of the mine soto -lrb- footnote : mine soto or whitish water the name that the sioux give to the st peter 's river the mud or clay in the water have a whitish look -rrb- the frown wall of fort snelling tell of the power of they enemy not a breath disturb the repose of nature till the voice of the song bird rise in harmony singing the praise of the creator but a few hour have pass away and how change the scene number of canoe be see rapidly pass over the water and the angry savage that spring from they as hastily ascend the hill from the gate of the fort hundred of indian be see collect from every direction and all approach the house of the interpreter we will follow they few have witness so wild a scene the house of the interpreter employ by government be near the fort and all around it be assemble the excited indian in front of the house be a piazza and on it lay the body of a young dahcotah he black hair plait and fall over he swarthy face the closed eye and compress lip proclaim the presence of death life have but recently yield to the sway of the stern conqueror a few hour ago beloved hail have eat and drink on the very spot where he body now repose bend over he head be he wife tear fall like rain from she eye and as grief have again overcome she effort at composure see how she plunge she knife into she arm : and as the warm blood flow from the wound call upon the husband of she youth my son my son burst from the lip of he aged mother who weep at he foot while she bleeding limb bear witness to the wound which she have inflict upon herself in the agony of she soul nor be these the only mourner a crowd of friend be weep round he body but the mother have turn to the warrior as they press through the crowd tear enough have be shed it be time to think of revenge look at you friend she say look how heavily lie the strong arm and see he be still though he wife and aged mother call upon he who have do this who have kill the brave warrior bring I the murderer that i may cut he on piece it need not to call upon the warrior who stand around they be excite enough bad hail stand near he eye bloodshot with rage he lip quiver and every tremble limb tell of the tempest within shah-co-pee the orator of the dahcotah and the nest they most famous hunter the tall form of the aged chief man in the cloud lean against the railing he sober countenance strangely contrast with the fiend-like look of he wife gray iron and little hill with brave after brave all cry vengeance to the foe death to the chippeway chapter ii but yesterday the dahcotah and chippeway foe from time immemorial feast and dance together for there be peace between they they have promise to bury the hatchet the chippeway dance near the fort and the dahcotah present they with blanket and pipe gun and powder and all that the savage deem valuable afterwards the dahcotah dance and the generous chippeway exceed they in the number and value of they gift as evening approach the band mingle they amusement -- together they contend in the foot-race or stretch themselves upon the grass play at checkers the chippeway have pay they annual visit of friendship at fort snelling and have spend they time happily they be about to return to they home they wise man say they rejoice that nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of the two tribe but they vicinity to the fort prevent any outbreak have there be no such restraint upon they action each would have seek the life of he deadly foe hole in the day be the chief of the chippeway he owe he station to he own merit he bravery and firmness have win the respect and admiration of the tribe when he be but a warrior and they exalt he to the honor of be they chief deed of blood mark he course yet be he manners gentle and he voice low there be a dignity and a courtesy about he every action that would have well befit a courtier he watch with interest the trial of strength between the young man of he own tribe and the dahcotah when the latter celebrated one of they national feast when they eat the heart of the dog while it be warm with life just tear from the animal with what contempt do he gaze upon they -lrb- illustration : fall of st anthony -rrb- the amusement of the dog feast or dance have close and the chippeway chief have signify to he warrior that they be to return home on the follow day he express a wish to see several of the chief of the dahcotah and a meeting have be obtain he thus address they -- warrior it have be the wish of we great father that we should be friend blood enough have be shed on both side but even if we prefer to continue at war we must do as we great father say the indian 's glory be pass away they be as the setting sun while the white man be as the sun rise in all he power we be the fall leave the whites be the powerful horse that trample they under foot we be about to return home and it be well that nothing have happen to occasion strife between we but i wish you to know that there be two young man among we who do not belong to my band they be pillager belong to another band and they may be troublesome i wish you to tell you young man of this that they may be on they guard after smoking together the chief separate hole in the day have thus do all that he deem proper return with he warrior to he teepee early in the morning the chippeway encamp near st anthony 's fall the woman take upon themselves all the fatigue and labor of the journey the man carry only the implement of war and hunting the chippeway chief be the husband of three wife who be sister and strange to say when a indian fancy more than one wife he be fortunate if he can obtain sister for they generally live in harmony while wife who be not relate be constantly quarrel and the husband do not often interfere even if word be change to blow in the mean time the two pillager be lurk about now remain a short time with the camp of the chippeway now absent themselves for a day or two but while the chippeway be prepare to leave the fall the pillager be in the neighborhood of fort snell they have accompany hole in the day 's band with the determination of kill a enemy the ancient feud still rankle in they heart as yet they have have no opportunity of satisfy they thirst for blood but on this morning they be conceal in the bush when red boy and beloved hail two dahcotah be pass on horseback it be but a moment -- and the deed be do both the chippeway fire and beloved hail fall red boy be wound but not badly he hurry in to tell the sad news and the two chippeway be soon out of the power of they enemy they flee it be suppose to missouri the friend of the dead warrior immediately seek he body and bring it to the house of the interpreter there he friend come together and as they enter one by one on every side press forward to see the still calm feature of the young man they throw on the body they blanket and other present accord to they custom of honor the dead troops be keep at fort snelling not only as a protection to the whites in the neighborhood but to prevent if possible difficulty between the different band of indian and as every year bring the chippeway to fort snell either to transact business with the government or on a visit of pleasure the chippeway and dahcotah must be frequently throw together the command officer of the garrison notify the two band on such occasion that no hostility will be permit so there be rarely a occurrence to disturb they peace but now it be impossible to restrain the excited passion of the dahcotah capt b -- who be then in command at fort snelling send word to the chippeway chief of the murder that have be commit and request he to bring all he man in as the murderer must be give up but this do not satisfy the dahcotah they long to raise the tomahawk which they hold in they hand they refuse to wait but insist upon follow the chippeway and reveng themselves the argument of the agent and other friend of the dahcotah be unavailing nothing would satisfy they but blood the eye even of the woman sparkle with delight at the prospect of the scalp they would dance round while the mother of beloved hail be hear to call for the scalp of the murderer of she son see the chief determine on war capt b -- tell they he would cease to endeavor to change they intention but as soon say he as you attack the chippeway will i send the soldier to you village and who will protect you wife and child this have the desire effect and the warrior see the necessity of wait for the arrival of the chippeway become more calm hole in the day with he man come immediately to the fort where a conference be hold at the gate there be assemble about three hundred dahcotah and seventy chippeway with the officer of the garrison and the indian agent it be ascertain that the murder have be commit by the two pillager for none of the other chippeway warrior have be absent from the camp hole in the day however give up two of he man as hostage to be keep at fort snelling until the murderer should be give up the dahcotah be oblige for the time to defer the hope of revenge return to they village to bury they dead chapter iii we rarely consider the indian as a member of a family -- we associate he with the tomahawk and scalping-knife but the very strangeness of the custom of the dahcotah add to they interest and in they mourning they have all the horror of death without a attendant solemnity all the agony and grief that a christian mother feel when she look for the last time at the form which will so soon moulder in the dust a indian mother feel also the christian know that the body will live again that the life-giving breath of the eternal will once more re-animate the helpless clay that the eye which be brilliant and beautiful in life will again look brightly from the now close lid -- when the dead shall live -- when the beloved child shall rise again the dahcotah woman have no such hope though she believe that the soul will live forever in the city of spirit yet the infant she have nurse at she bosom the child she love and tend the young man whose strength and beauty be she boast will soon be ash and dust and if she have not the hope of the christian neither have she the spirit for as she cut off she hair and tear she clothes throw they under the scaffold what joy would it bring to she heart could she hope herself to take the life of the murderer of she son beloved hail be bear by the indian to he native village and the usual ceremony attend the dead perform but with more than usual excitement occasion by the circumstance of the death of they friend the body of a dead dahcotah be wrap in cloth or calico or sometimes put in a box if one can be obtain and place upon a scaffold raise a few foot from the ground all the relation of the deceased then sit round it for about twenty-four hour they tear they clothes run knife through the fleshy part of they arm but there be no sacrifice which they can make so great as cut off they hair the man go in mourning by painting themselves black and they do not wash the paint off until they take the scalp of a enemy or give a medicine-dance while they sit round the scaffold one of the nearest relation commence a doleful cry when all the other join in and continue they wail for some time then for awhile they tear be wipe away after smoking for a short time another of the family commence again and the other join in this be continue for a day and night and then each one go to he own wigwam the dahcotah mourn thus for beloved hail in the evening the cry of he wife be hear as she call for she husband while the rock and the hill echo the wail he will return no more -- and who will hunt the deer for he wife and she young child the murderer be never find and the hostage after be detain for eighteen month at fort snelling be release they bear they confinement with admirable patience the more so as they be punish for the fault of other when they be release they be furnish with gun and clothing for fear they would be kill by the dahcotah they release be keep a secret and the dahcotah know not that the two chippeway be release until they be far on they journey home but one of they never see he native village again the long confinement have destroy he health and be feeble when he set out he soon find himself unequal to the journey he die a few day before the home be reach and the welcome that he companion receive be a sad one for he bring the intelligence of the death of he comrade chapter iv but we will do as the dahcotah do -- turn from the sadness and horror of a indian 's death to the gayety and happiness of a indian marriage the indian be philosopher after all -- they know that they could not go after the chippeway so they make the best of it and smoke beloved hail be dead but they could not bring he to life and they smoke again : besides walk wind be to be marry to the war club whereupon they smoke harder than ever there be two kind of marriage among the dahcotah buy a wife and steal one the latter answer to we runaway match and in some respects the former be the ditto of one conduct as it ought to be among ourselves so after all i suppose indian marriage be much like white people 's but among the dahcotah it be a understood thing that when the young people run away they be to be forgive at any time they choose to return if it should be the next day or six month afterwards this save a world of trouble it prevent the necessity of the father look dagger at the son-in-law and then love he violently the mother be spare the trial of tell she daughter that she forgive she though she have break she heart and what be still better there be not the slightest occasion whatever for the bride to say she be wretched for have do what she certainly would do over again to-morrow be it undo so that it be easy to understand why the dahcotah have the advantage of we in runaway match or as _ they _ say in steal a wife for it be the same thing only more honestly state when a young man be unable to purchase the girl he love best or if she parent be unwilling she should marry he if he have gain the heart of the maiden he be safe they appoint a time and place to meet take whatever will be necessary for they journey that be the man take he gun and powder and shot and the girl she knife and wooden bowl to eat and drink out of and these she intend to hide in she blanket sometimes they merely go to the next village to return the next day but if they fancy a bridal tour away they go several hundred mile with the grass for they pillow the canopy of heaven for they curtain and the bright star to light and watch over they when they return home the bride go at once to chop wood and the groom to smoking without the least form or parade sometimes a young girl dare not run away for she have a miserly father or mother who may not like she lover because he have not enough to give they for she and she know they will persecute she and perhaps shoot she husband but this do not happen often just as once in a hundred year in a christian land if a girl will run away with a young man she parent run after she and in spite of religion and common sense bring she back have she divorce and then in either case the party must as a matter of course be very miserable but the marriage that we be about to witness be a marriage in high life among the dahcotah and the bride be regularly buy as often occur with we walk wind be not pretty even the dahcotah who be far from be connoisseur in beauty do not consider she pretty she be however tall and well make and she foot and hand -lrb- as be always the case with the dahcotah woman -rrb- be small she have a quantity of jet-black hair that she braid with a great deal of care she eye be very black but small and she dark complexion be relieve by more red than be usually see in the cheek of the daughter of she race she tooth be very fine as everybody know -- for she be always laugh and she laugh be perfect music then walk wind be generally speak so good temper she be never know to be very angry but once when harpstenah tell she she be in love with the war club she throw the girl down and tear half the hair out of she head what make it seem very strange be that she be over head and ear in love with the war club at that very time but she do not choose anybody should know it war club be a flirt -- yes a male coquette -- and he have break the heart of half the girl in the band besides be a flirt he be a fop he would plait he hair and put vermilion on he cheek and after see that he leggin be properly arrange he would put the war eagle feather in he head and folding he blanket round he would walk about the village or attitudinize with all the air of a broadway dandy war club be a great warrior too for on he blanket be mark the red hand which show he have kill he worst enemy -- for it be he father 's enemy and he have hang the scalp up at he father 's grave besides he be a great hunter which most of the dahcotah be no one then could for a moment doubt the pretension of war club or that all the girl of the village should fall in love with he and he like a downright flirt be naturally very cold and cruel to the poor creature who love he so much walk wind besides possess many other accomplishment such as tan deer-skin make mocassin & c be a capital shoot on one occasion when the young warrior be shoot at a mark walk wind be pronounce the best shot among they and the war club be quite subdue he could bear everything else but when walk wind beat he shooting -- why -- the point be settle he must fall in love with she and as a natural consequence marry she walking wind be not so easily win she have be torment so long herself that she be in duty bind to pay back in the same coin it be a duncan gray affair -- only reverse at last she yield she lover give she so many trinket true they be brass and tin but dahcotah maiden can not sigh for pearl and diamond for they never even hear of they and the philosophy of the thing be just the same since everybody be outdo by somebody besides she lover play the flute all night long near she father 's wigwam and not to speak of the pity that she feel for he walk wind be confident she never could sleep until that flute stop play which she know would be as soon as they be marry for all the world know that no husband either white or copper-colored ever trouble himself to pay any attention of that sort to he wife however devotedly romantic he may have be before marriage sometimes the dahcotah lover buy he wife without she consent but the war club be more honorable than that : he love walk wind and he want she to love he when all be settle between the young people war club tell he parent that he want to marry the old people be glad to hear it for they like they ancient and honorable name and house to be keep up just as well as lord and duke do so they collect everything they own for the purpose of buy walk wind gun and blanket powder and shot knife and trinket be in requisition instead of title-deed and settlement so when all be ready war club put the present on a horse and carry they to the door of walk wind 's wigwam he do not ask for the girl however as this would not be dahcotah etiquette he lay the present on the ground and have a consultation or as the indian say a talk with the parent conclude by ask they to give he walk wind for he wife and what be worthy to be notice here be that after have go to so much trouble to ask a question he never for a moment wait for a answer but turn round horse and all and go back to he wigwam the parent then consult for a day or two although they from the first moment have make up they mind as to what they be go to do in due time the present be take into the wigwam which signify to the lover that he be a happy man and on the next day walk wind be to be a bride chapter v early in the morning walk wind commence she toilet -- and it be no light task to deck the indian bride in all she finery she mocassin be work with porcupine and fit closely she small foot the leggin be ornament with ribbon of all color she cloth shawl shape like a mantilla be work with row of bright ribbon and the sewing do honor to she own skill in needle-work she breast be cover with brooch and a quantity of bead hang round she neck heavy ear-ring be in she ear -- and on she head be a diadem of war eagle 's feather she have a bright spot of vermilion on each cheek and -- behold a indian bride when she be ready as many present as be give for she be collect and put on a horse and the bride accompany by three or four of she relation take the road to the wigwam of the bridegroom when they arrive within a hundred yard of the wigwam walk wind 's father call for the war club to come out he do not come but send one of he relation to receive the bride do not suppose that walk wind 's father take offence at the bridegroom 's not come when he be call for it be as much a part of the ceremony among the dahcotah for one of the bride 's relation to call for the bridegroom and for the groom to refuse to come as it be for we to have the ring put upon the third finger of the left hand as soon as the warrior depute by the husband elect to receive the bride make he appearance the indian raise a shout of applause and all run towards he as he approach they and while they be run and shout they be firing off they gun too but the ceremony be not over yet walk wind in order to complete the ceremony to be a wife must jump upon the back of she husband 's relative and be thus carry into the wigwam of which she be to be the mistress what a situation for a bride walk wind seriously think of rebel she hesitate -- while the man stand ready to start for the wigwam so soon as the luggage be on the bride draw back and pout a little when some of she friend undertake to reason with she and she as if to avoid they spring upon the back of the dahcotah who carry she into the wigwam but where on earth be the bridegroom seat on the ground in the teepee look as placid and unconcerned as if nothing be go on of course he rise to receive he bride not he but walk wind be on she foot again and she take she seat without any invitation by the side of he who be literally to be she lord and master -- and they be man and wife as much so as if there be a priest and a ring pearl and bride-cake for the dahcotah revere the ceremony of marriage and he think with solemn awe of the burial rite of he nation as we do these rite have be preserve from generation to generation tell from father to son and they will be hand down until the dahcotah be no more or until religion and education take the place of superstition and ignorance -- until god we god be know and worship among a people who as yet have hardly hear he name shah-co-pee the orator of the sioux shah-co-pee -lrb- or six -rrb- be one of the chief of the dahcotah he village be about twenty-five mile from fort snelling he belong to the band that be call men-da-wa-can-ton or people of the spirit lake no one who have live at fort snelling can ever forget he for at what house have he not call to shake hand and smoke to say that he be a great chief and that he be hungry and must eat before he start for home if the hint be not immediately act upon he add that the sun be die fast and it be time for he to set out shah-co-pee be not so tall or fine look as bad hail nor have he the fine roman feature of old man in the cloud he face be decidedly ugly but there be a expression of intelligence about he quick black eye and fine forehead that make he friend notwithstanding he many troublesome quality at present he be in mourn he face be paint black he never comb he hair but wear a black silk handkerchief tie across he forehead when he speak he use a great deal of gesture suit the action to the word he hand which be small and well form be black with dirt he do not descend to the duty of the toilet he be the orator of the dahcotah no matter how trifle the occasion he talk well and assume a air of importance that would become he if he be discourse on matter of life and death some year ago we government wish the chippeway and dahcotah to conclude a treaty of peace among themselves frequently have these two band make peace but rarely keep it any length of time on this occasion many promise be make on both side promise which would be break by some inconsiderate young warrior before long and then retaliation must follow shah-co-pee have great influence among the dahcotah and he be to come to fort snell to be present at the council of peace early in the morning he and about twenty warrior leave they village on the bank of the st peter for the fort when they be very near so that they action could be distinguish they assemble in they canoe draw they close together that they might hear the speech which they chief be about to make they they raise the star and stripe and they own flag which be a staff adorn with feather from the war eagle and the noon-day sun give brilliancy to they gay dress and the feather and ornament that they wear shah-co-pee stand straight and firm in he canoe -- and not the less proudly that the wall of the fort tower above he my boy he say -lrb- for thus he always address he man -rrb- the dahcotah be all brave never have a coward be know among the people of the spirit lake let the woman and child fear they enemy but we will face we foe and always conquer we be go to talk with the white man we great father wish we to be at peace with we enemy we have long enough shed the blood of the chippeway we have dance round they scalp and we child have kick they head about in the dust what more do we want when we be in council listen to the word of the interpreter as he tell we what we great father say and i will answer he for you and when we have eat and smoke the pipe of peace we will return to we village the chief take he seat with all the importance of a public benefactor he intend to have all the talk to himself to arrange matter accord to he own idea but he do it with the utmost condescension and he warrior be satisfied besides be a orator shah-co-pee be a beggar and one of a high order too for he will neither take offence nor a refusal tell he one day that you will not give he pork and flour and on the next he return nothing daunted shake hand and ask for pork and flour he always gain he point for you be oblige to give in order to get rid of he he will take up he quarter at the interpreter 's and come down upon you every day for a week just at meal time -- and as he be always bless with a ferocious appetite it be much better to capitulate come to term by give he what he want and let he go and after he have once start ten to one if he do not come back to say he want to shoot and bring you some duck you must give he powder and shot to enable he to do so that will probably be the last of it chapter ii it be a beautiful morning in June when we leave fort snelling to go on a pleasure party up the st peter in a steamboat the first that have ever ascend that river there be many drawback in the commencement as there always be on such occasion the morning be rather cool think some and as they hesitate about go of course they toilet be delay to the last moment and when all be fairly in the boat wood be yet to be find then something be the matter with one of the wheel -- and the mother be almost sorry they have consent to come while the child frantic with joy be in danger of be drown every moment by the energetic movement they make near the side of the boat by way of indicate they satisfaction at the state of thing in the cabin extensive preparation be make in case the excursion bring on a good appetite everybody contribute loaf upon loaf of bread and cake pie coffee and sugar cold meat of every description with milk and cream in bottle now and then one of these be break or upset by way of add to the confusion which be already intolerable champaigne and old cogniac be bring by the young gentleman only for fear the lady should be sea-sick or perhaps in case the gentleman should think it positively necessary to drink the lady ' health when we think all be ready there be still another delay shah-co-pee and two of he warrior be see come down the hill the chief make a animated appeal to some one on board the boat and as he reach the shore he give we to understand that he business be conclude and that he would like to go with we but it be very evident that he consider he company a favor the bright sun bring warmth and we sit on the upper deck admire the beautiful shore of the st peter 's not a creature be to be see for some distance on the bank and the bird as they fly over we head seem to be the fit and only inhabitant of such a region when tire of admire the scenery there be enough to employ we the table be to be set for dinner the child have already find out which basket contain the cake and they be cast admire look towards it when we be all assemble to partake of some refreshment it be delightful to find that there be not enough chair for half the party we borrow each other 's knife and fork too and etiquette that petty tyrant of society retire from the scene shah-co-pee find he way to the cabin where he manifest strong symptom of shake hand over again in order to keep he quiet we give he plenty to eat how he seem to enjoy a piece of cake that have accidentally drop into the oyster-soup and with equal gravity would he eat apple-pie and ham together and then he cry of wakun -lrb- footnote : mysterious -rrb- when the cork fly from the champaigne bottle across the table how happily the day pass -- how few such day occur in the longest life as shah-co-pee 's village appear in sight the chief address col d -- who be at that time in command of fort snelling ask he why we have come on such a excursion to escort you home be the ready reply you be a great chief and worthy of be

occasion when shah-co-pee be absent from the village the lover meet they have to look well around they for the two old wife be always on the look out for something to tell of the young one but there be no one near the wind whistle keenly round the bend of the river as the dahcotah tell the weep girl to listen to he when have she refuse how have she long to hear the sound of he voice when weary to death with the long boasting of the old chief but how do she heart beat when red stone tell she that he love she still -- that he have only be wait a opportunity to induce she to leave she old husband

it would have kill he if it have he wife moan all through the night bruise and bleed for the fault of they rival while the chief have recourse to the pipe the never-failing refuge of the dahcotah i think say the chief that some calamity be go to happen to I -lrb- for be more compose he begin to talk to the other indian who sit with he in he teepee somewhat after the manner and in the spirit of job 's friend -rrb- i see unk-a-tahe the great fish of the water and it show its horn and we know that that be always a sign of trouble ho reply a old medicine man i remember when unk-a-tahe get in

fever be make great havoc among they and to deprive they of they flour and other article of food be only enfeeble they constitution and render they a easy prey for disease the dahcotah think this very hard at the time they have not forget the circumstance and they think that they ought to be consult before they land be make a thoroughfare by they enemy they accordingly assemble and accompany by the

in feast and carouse they canoe together fly over the water of the mississippus the young sioux warrior find strange beauty in the oval face of the chippeway girl and the chippeway discover -lrb- what be actually the case -rrb- that the woman of the dahcotah be far more graceful than those of they own nation but as the time of the departure of the chippeway approach many a chippeway maiden weep when she remember how soon she would bid adieu to all she hope of happiness and fly shadow be saddest of they all she would gladly have give up everything for she lover what be home and friend to she who love with all the devotion of a heart untrammeled by form fresh from the hand of nature she listen to he flute in the still evening as if she spirit would forsake she when she hear it no more she would sit with he on the bluff which hang over the mississippus and envy the very water which would remain near he when she be far away but she lover love he nation even more than he do she and though he would have die to have save she from sorrow yet he know she could never be he wife even be he to marry she she life would ever be in danger a chippeway could not long find a home among the dahcotah

all thy spirit will flee tremble from the shriek of the die mother the suffering child death will come to thee as a terror not as a refuge chapter ii when the chippeway break up they camp near fort snelling they divide into two party one party return home by the mississippus the other by way of the st croix they part on the most friendly term with the sioux give present and receive they in return some pillager who acknowledge no control have accompany the chippeway these pillager be in fact highwayman or privateer -- have no law and act from the impulse of they own fierce heart after the chippeway have leave the pillager conceal themselves in a path near lake calhoun this lake be about seven mile from fort snelling before they have be conceal one hour two dahcotah pass father and son the pillager fire and the father be kill instantly but the son escape and make he way home in safety the boy enter the village call for he mother to tell she the sad news she cry of grief give the

have never see she but it be no time to think of she duty call upon he to avenge the death of he friend chapter iii woe to the unsuspecting chippeway ignorant of the murder that have be commit they be leisurely turn they step homeward while the pillager make they escape with the scalp of the dahcotah the sioux travel one day and night before they come up with the chippeway nothing could quench they thirst but blood and the woman and child must suffer first the savage suffer a twofold death before he own turn come he young child lie breathless around he they mother all unconscious by they side the chippeway continue they journey fear nothing they have camp between the fall of st anthony and rum river they be refresh and the man proceed first leave they woman and child to follow they be all look forward with pleasure to see they home again the woman go leisurely along the infant sleep quietly -- what should it fear close to its mother 's heart the young child laugh as they hide themselves behind the forest tree and then emerge suddenly to frighten the other the chippeway maiden rejoice when they remember that they rival the dahcotah girl would no longer seduce they lover from they allegiance fly shadow weep there be nothing to make she happy she would see the track-maker no more and she look forward to death as the end of she care she conceal in she bosom the trinket he have give she every feature of he face be write on she heart -- that heart that beat only for he that so soon would cease to beat at all but there be a fearful cry that banish even he from she thought the war-whoop burst suddenly upon the defenceless woman hundred of dahcotah warrior rise up to blind the eye of the terror-stricken mother they child be scalp before they eye they infant be dash against the rock which be not more insensible to they cry than they murderer it be a battle of strength against weakness stern warrior it need not to strike the mother that blow she die in the death of she child -lrb- footnote : the dahcotah believe or many of they believe that each body have four soul one wander about the earth and require food a second watch over the body the third hover round its native village while the fourth go to the land of spirit -rrb- the maiden clasp they small hand -- a vain appeal to the merciless wretch who see neither beauty nor grace when rage and revenge be in they heart it be blood they thirst for and the young and innocent fall like grass before the mower fly shadow see she lover he be advance towards she what do he countenance say there be sadness in he face and she hope -- aye more than hope -- she know he will save she with all a woman 's trust she throw herself in he arm save I save I she cry do not let they slay I before you eye make I you prisoner -lrb- footnote : when the sioux be tire of kill they sometimes take they victim prisoner and generally speak treat they with great kindness -rrb- you say that you love I spare my life who shall tell he agony for a moment he think he would make she he prisoner another moment 's reflection convinced he that that would be of no avail he know that she must die but he could not take she life she eye be trustingly turn upon he she soft hand grasp he arm but the sioux warrior be press upon they he give she one more look he touch she with he spear -lrb- footnote : when a dahcotah touch a enemy with he spear he be privileged to wear a feather of honor as if he have take a scalp -rrb- and he be go and fly shadow be dead she feel not the blow that send she reel to the earth she lover have forsake she in the hour of danger and what could she feel after that the scalp be tear from she head by one of those who have most admire she beauty and she body be trample upon by the very warrior who have so envied she lover the shriek of the die woman reach the ear of they husband and brother quickly do they retrace they step and when they reach the spot they bravely stand they ground but the dahcotah be too powerful for they -- terrible be the struggle the dahcotah continue the slaughter and the chippeway be oblige at last to give way one of the chippeway seize he frightened child and place he upon he back he wife lay dead at he foot with he child cling to he he fight he way through two of the dahcotah follow he for he be fly fast and they fear he would soon be out of they power they think as they nearly come up to he that he would loose he hold on he child but the father 's heart be strong within he he fly and the sioux be close upon he heel he fire and kill one of they the other sioux follow : he have nothing to encumber he -- he must be victor in such a unequal contest but the love that be stronger than death nerve the father 's arm he keep firing and the sioux retreat the chippeway and he young son reach they home in safety there to mourn the loss of other whom they love the sun set upon a bloody field the young and old lay pile together the heart that have welcome the breaking of the day be all unconscious of its close the sioux be avenge and the scalp that they bring home -lrb- nearly one hundred when the party join they from the massacre at saint croix -rrb- bear witness to they triumph the other party of sioux follow the chippeway who have go by way of the st croix while the chippeway sleep the war-cry of the sioux arouse they and though they fight bravely they suffer as do they friend and the darkness of night add terror to the scene the dahcotah return with the scalp to they village and as they enter triumphantly they be greet with shout of applause the scalp be divide among the village and joyful preparation be make to celebrate the scalp-dance the scalp be stretch upon hoop and cover with vermilion ornament with feather ribbon and trinket on the woman 's scalp be hang a comb or a pair of scissors and for month do the dahcotah woman dance around they the man wear mourning for they enemy as be the custom among the dahcotah when the dancing be do the scalp be bury with the deceased relative of the sioux who take they and this be indian but what be christian warfare the wife of the hero live to realize she wretchedness the honor pay by he countryman be a poor recompense for the loss of he love and protection the life of the child too be safe but who will lead he in the path of virtue when he mother have go down to the grave let we not hear of civilized warfare it be all the work of the spirit of evil god do not make man to slay he brother and the savage alone can present a excuse the dahcotah dream not that it be wrong to resent a injury to the death but the christian know that god have say vengeance be mine chapter iv the track-maker have add to he fame he have take many scalp and the dahcotah maiden welcome he as a hero -- as one who would no longer refuse to acknowledge the power of they charm they ask he eagerly of the fight -- whom he have kill first -- but they derive but little satisfaction from he reply they find he resist they advance and they leave he to he gloomy thought every scene he look upon add to he grief memory cling to he recall every word and look of fly shadow but that last look could he ever forget it he try to console himself with the thought of he triumph alas she smile be sweeter than the recollection of revenge he have wade in the blood of he enemy he have trample upon the heart of the man he hate but he have break the heart of the only woman he have ever love in the silence of the night she death-cry sound in he ear and he would start as if to flee from the sound in he dream he see again that trustful face that look of appeal -- and then the face of stone when she see that she have appeal in vain he follow the chase but there he could not forget the battle scene save I save I forever whisper every forest leaf or every flow wave often do he hear she call he and he would stay he step as if he hope to meet she smile the medicine man offer to cure he disease but he know that it be beyond they art and he care not how soon death come nor in what form he meet the fate he seek a war party be form among the dahcotah to seek more scalp more revenge but the track-maker be weary of glory he go with the party and never return like _ she _ he die in battle but the death that she seek to avert be a welcome messenger to he he feel that in the grave all would be forget eta keazah or sullen face \* \* \* \* \* wenona be the light of she father 's wigwam -- the pride of the band of sisseton whose village be on the shore of beautiful lake traver however cheerfully the fire might burn in the dwelling of the aged chief there be darkness for he when she be away -- and the mother 's heart be always fill with anxiety for she know that wenona have draw upon she the envy of she young companion and she fear that some one of they would cast a spell -lrb- footnote : the indian fear that from envy or jealousy some person may cast a fatal spell upon they to produce sickness or even death this superstition seem almost identical with the obus or obeat of the west indium negro -rrb- upon she child that she loveliness might be dim by sorrow or sickness the warrior of the band strove to outdo each other in noble deed that they might feel more worthy to claim she hand -- while the hunter try to win she good will by present of buffalo and deer but wenona think not yet of love the clear stream that reflect she form tell she she be beautiful yet she brother be the bravest warrior of the sisseton and she aged parent too -- be not they love enough to satisfy she heart never do brother and sister love each other more they feature be the same yet man 's sternness in he be change to woman 's softness in she the glance of the falcon in he eye be the gaze of the dive in hers but at time the expression of he face would make you wonder that you ever could have think he like he twin sister when he hear the sisseton brave talk of the hunt they have in they youth before the white man drive they from the hunting-grounds of they forefather -- when instead of the blanket they wear the buffalo robe -- when happiness and plenty be in they wigwam -- and when the voice of weak woman and famished child be never hear call for food in vain -- then the longing for vengeance that be write on he countenance the imprecation that be breathe from he lip the angry scowl the lightning from he eye all make he unlike indeed to he sister the pride of the sisseton when the gentle breeze would play among the prairie flower then would she win he from such bitter thought come my brother we will go and sit by the bank of the lake why should you be unhappy the buffalo be still to be find upon we hunting-grounds -- the spirit of the lake watch over we -- we shall not want for food he would go because she ask he the quiet and beauty of nature be not for he rather would he have stand alone when the storm hold its sway when the darkness be only relieve by the flash that lay the tall tree of the forest low when the thunder bird clap she wing as she sweep through the cloud above he but could he refuse to be happy when wenona smile alas that she gentle spirit should not always have be near to soften he but as the beauty and warmth of summer pass away so do wenona 's strength begin to fail the autumn wind that sweep rudely over the prairie flower so that they could not lift they head above the tall grass seem to pass in anger over the wigwam of the old man -- for the eye of the dahcotah maiden be lose its brightness and she step be less firm as she wander with she brother in she native wood vainly do the medicine man practice they cherish rite -- the great spirit have call -- and who could refuse to hear he voice she fade with the leaf -- and the cry of the mourner be answer by the wail wind as they sing she requiem a few month pass away and she brother be alone the winter that follow he sister 's death be a severe one the mother have never be strong and she soon follow she daughter -- while the father 's age unfit he to contend with sorrow infirmity and want spring return but winter have settle on the heart of the young sisseton she be go who alone could drive away the shadow from he brow what wonder then that he countenance should always be stern the indian call he eta keazah or sullen face but after the lapse of year the boy who brood over the wrong of he father eagerly seek a opportunity to avenge he own he sister have never be forget but he remember she as we do a beautiful dream and she be the spirit that hover round he while he eye be close in sleep but there be other who hold a place in he heart he wife be always ready to receive he with a welcome and he young son call upon he to teach he to send the arrow to the heart of the buffalo but the suffering of he tribe from want of food and other privation be ever before he eye vengeance upon the white man who have cause they chapter ii winter be the season of trial for the sioux especially for the woman and child the incursion of the english half-breed and cree indian into the sisseton country have cause they buffalo to recede and so little other game be to be find that indescribable suffering be endure every winter by the sisseton starvation force the hunter to seek for the buffalo in the depth of winter they family must accompany they for they have not the smallest portion of food to leave with they and who will protect they from the chippeway however inclement the season they home must be for a time on the open prairie as far as the eye can reach it be a desert of snow not a stick of timber can be see a storm be come on too nothing be hear but the howling blast which mock the cry of famished child the drift of the snow make it impossible to see what course they be to take they have only to sit down and let the snow fall upon they it be a relief when they be quite cover with it for it shelter they from the keenness of the blast alas for the child the cry of those who can speak be give I food while the die infant cling to its mother 's breast seek to draw with its parting breath the means of life but the storm be over the pierce cold seize upon the exhaust frame of the sufferer the child have hardly strength to stand the father place one upon he back and go forward the mother wrap she dead child in she blanket and lay it in the snow another be cling to she she have no time to weep for the dead nature call upon she to make a effort for the living she take she child and follow the rest it would be a comfort to she could she hope to find she infant 's body when summer return to bury it she shudder and remember that the wolf of the prairie be starve too food be find at last the strength of the buffalo yield to the arrow of the sioux we will have food and not die be the joyful cry of all and when they fierce appetite be appease they carry with they on they return to they village the skin of the animal with the remainder of the meat the suffering of famine and fatigue however be follow by those of disease the strength of many be lay low they must watch too for they enemy be at hand chapter iii in the summer of 1844 a large party of half-breed and indian from red river -- english subject -- trespass upon the hunting grounds of the sioux there be several hundred hunter and many cart draw by ox for the purpose of carry away the buffalo they have kill one of this party have leave he companion and be ride alone at some distance from they a dahcotah know that he nation would suffer from the destruction of they game -- fresh in he memory too be the suffering of the past winter what wonder then that the arrow which be intend for the buffalo should find its way to the heart of the trespasser this act enrage the half-breed they could not find the sioux who commit it -- but a few day after they fall in with a party of other who be also hunting and kill seven of they the rest escape and carry the news of the death of they brave to they village one of the kill be a relative of sullen face the sad news spread rapidly through the village and nothing be hear but lamentation the woman cut long gash on they arm and as the blood flow from the wound they would cry where be my husband my son my brother soon the cry of revenge be hear above that of lamentation it be not possible say sullen face that we can allow these english to starve we and take the life of we warrior they have take from we the food that would nourish we wife and child and more they have kill seven of we bravest man we will have revenge -- we will watch for they and bring home they scalp that we woman may dance round they a war party be soon form and sullen face at the head of more than fifty warrior station himself in the vicinity of the road by which the half-breed from red river drive they cattle to fort snell some day after there be a unusual excitement in the sioux village on swan lake about twenty mile northwest of traverse des sioux a number of indian be gaze at a object not very distant and in order to discover what it be the chief of the village sleepy eye have send one of he young man out while the rest continue to regard it with look of curiosity and awe they observe that as the sioux approach it he slacken he pace when suddenly he give a loud cry and run towards the village he soon reach they and pale with terror exclaim it be a spirit it be white as the snow that cover we prairie in the winter it look at I and speak not for a short time he fear infect the other but after a while several determine to go and bring a more satisfactory report to they chief they return with the body as it seem only of a white man wear to a skeleton with he foot cut and bleed unable to speak from exhaustion nothing but the beating of he heart tell that he live the indian woman dress he foot and give he food wipe the blood from he limb and after a consultation they agree to send word to the missionary at traverse des sioux that there be a white man sick and suffer with they the missionary come immediately take the man to they home and with kind nursing he be soon able to account for the miserable situation in which he have be find we leave the state of missourus say the man whose name be bennett for the purpose of carry cattle to fort snell my companion ' name be watson and turner we do not know the road but suppose a map would guide we with what information we could get on the way we lose we way however and be eagerly look for some person who could set we right early one morning some sioux come up with we and seem incline to join we party one of they leave hastily as if send on a message after a while a number of warrior accompany by the indian who have leave the first party come towards we they leader have a dark countenance and seem to have great influence over they we try to make they understand that we have lose we way we show they the map but they do not comprehend we after angrily address he man for a few moment the leader shot watson through the shoulder and another send a arrow through he body and kill he they then strike watson 's brother and wound he in the mean time the other indian have be kill we cattle and some of the animal have run away they make watson who be sadly bruise with the blow he have receive from they mount a horse and go with they to hunt the rest of the cattle we never hear of he again the indian say he disappear from among the bush and they could not find he but the probability be that

to its battle plain must i pine in my fetter here with the wild wave 's foam and the free bird 's flight and the tall spear glance on my sight and the trumpet in mine ear the summer of 1845 find sullen face a prisoner at fort snell government have be inform of the murder of watson by two dahcotah indian order be receive at fort snelling that two company should proceed to the sisseton country

prevent the immediate return of we troops they tramp have be a delightful one and so far success have crown they expedition they be in the highest spirit but a little incident occur on they return that be rather calculate to show the transitoriness of earthly joy one dark night when those who be awake be think and those who sleep be dream of they welcome home there be evidently a disturbance the sleeper rouse themselves gun be discharge what could it be the cause be soon ascertain to speak poetically the bird have fly -- in plain language the prisoner have run away they be not bind they honor have be trust to -- but you can not place much reliance on the honor of a indian with a prison in prospect i doubt if a white man could be trust under such circumstance true there be a guard but

I so then welcome death they guard I now with sword and bayonet but the soul of the dahcotah be free after they removal to dubuque the two prisoner from fort snell with other who have be concern in

tis the voice of the sister of my youth -- come with I my brother we wait for you in the house of the spirit we will sit by the bank of a lake more beautiful than that by which we wander in we childhood you will roam over the hunting grounds of you forefather and there the white man may never come he eye be close fast in death but he lip murmur -- wenona i come i come tonwa-yah-pe-kin the spy \* \* \* \* \* chapter i it be in the spring of 1848 that several dahcotah be carefully make they way along the forest near the border of the chippeway country there have recently be a fight near the spot where they be and the dahcotah be seek the body of they friend who have be slay that they might take they home to bury they they move noiselessly along for they enemy be near occasionally one of they would imitate the cry of a bird or of some animal so that if the attention of they enemy should be draw to the spot the slight noise they make in move might be attribute to any but the right cause they have almost give up the hope of find they friend and this be the close of they last day 's effort to that intent in the morning they intend to return to they village it be a bright clear evening and the ray of the setting sun fall upon some object further on for a time the dahcotah gaze in silence but no movement give sign of what it be that excite they curiosity all at once there be a fearful foreboding they remember why they be there and they determine to venture near enough to find out what be the nature of the object on which the ray of the sun seem to rest as if to attract they notice a few more step and they be relieve from they terrible suspense but they worst fear be realize the dahcotah recently kill have be skin by the chippeway while they body be yet warm with life and the skin be stretch upon pole while on separate pole the hand be place with one finger of each hand point to the dahcotah country the savage be in a fearful rage they have to endure a twofold insult there be the body of they friend treat as if they be but beast and evidently put there to be see by the dahcotah and besides the hand point to the country of the dahcotah -- do it not plainly say to the spy go back to you country and say to you warrior that the chippeway despise they that they be not worthy to be treat as man the spy return as cautiously as they have venture near the fatal spot and it be not until they be out of reach of danger from they foe that they give vent to they indignation then they smother rage burst forth they hasten to return and tell the event of they journey they forget how grieve the wife and sister of the dead would be at be deprive of the solace of bury the remains of they friend -- they only think of revenge for the insult they have receive when they arrive at they village they call together they chief and brave and related to they what they have see a council of war be hold which result in immediate preparation be make to resent the indignity offer to they friend and the insult to the whole tribe the war-dance be always celebrate before a war party go out to find a enemy and there be in every village a war chief who conduct the party the war dance be perform inside of a wigwam and not out of door as be usually represent the owl feel himself qualify in every respect to conduct the present party he be a great warrior and a juggler besides and he have a reputation acquire from a act perform when he be a very young man which show as much cunning as bravery for one of these quality be as necessary to a dahcotah war chief as the other he be one of a party of dahcotah who go to war against the chippeway but without success on they way back the owl get separate from the rest of the party and he climb a tree to see if he could discover he comrade while in the tree a war party of the chippeway come in sight and stop quite near the tree to make they camp the owl be in a sad predicament he know not what to do to effect he escape as he know he have not the power to contend with he enemy he determine to have recourse to stratagem when it be quite dark he commence hoot like a owl have previously transform himself into one the chippeway look up towards the tree and ask the owl what he be do there the owl reply that he have come to see a large war party of dahcotah who would soon pass by the chippeway take the hint and take to they heel too and run home the owl then resume he form get down from the tree and return home this wonderful incident which he related of himself give he a great reputation and a name besides for until now he have be call chaskè a name always give to the oldest son but the indian after this give he the name of the owl it be decide that the war party should leave as soon as they preparation could be make the war chief send for those who be to dance the dance be perform every third or fourth night until the party leave for each dance the war chief have a hew set of performer only so many be ask at a time as could conveniently dance inside the wigwam while some be dance other be prepare for the expedition get extra mocassin make dry meat or parching corn when all be ready the party set out with every confidence in they war chief he be to direct they where to find the enemy and at the same time to protect they from be kill themselves for a few day they hunt as they go along and they would build large fire at night and tell long story to make the time pass pleasantly the party be compose of about twenty warrior and they all obey implicitly the order of they war chief who appoint some warrior to see that he direction be carry out by the whole party will to he who violate a single regulation he gun be break he blanket cut to piece and he be tell to return home such be the fate of iron eye who wander from the party to shoot a bird on the wing contrary to the order of they chief but although disgraced and forbid to join in the attempt to punish the chippeway for the outrage they have commit he do not return to he village he follow the track of the war party determine to see the fun if he could not partake of it on the fourth night after they leave home the warrior be all assemble to hear the war song of they chief they be yet in they own country seat on the edge of a prairie and back of they as far as the eye could reach there be nothing to be see but the half melted snow no rock no tree relieve the sameness of the view on the opposite side of the mississippus high bluff with they worn side and broken rock hang over the river and in the center of its water lay the sacred isle whose many tree and bush want only the warm breath of summer to display they luxuriance the war chief commence he prophesy that they would see deer on the next day but that they must begin to be careful for they would then have enter they enemy ' country he tell they how brave they be and that he be braver still he tell they the chippeway be worse than prairie dog to all of which the warrior respond ho when they find themselves near they enemy the chief forbid a gun be fire off no straggling be allow none but the spy be to go beyond a certain distance from the party but after they enter the chippeway country the duty of the war chief be still more important he have to prophesy where the enemy be to be find and about they number and besides he have to charm the spirit of they enemy that they might be unable to contend with the dahcotah the spirit on this occasion take the form of a bear about nine o'clock at night this ceremony commence the warrior all lie down as if asleep when the war chief signify the approach of the spirit to he man by the earnestness of he exertion in sing the song continue and increase in energy as the spirit get nearer to the hole in the ground which the chief dig and fill with water previous to commence he song near this hole he place a hoop against which be lay all the war implement of the chief before the song commence the warrior sit and look steadfastly at they leader but when the spirit approach this hole the warrior hardly dare breathe for fear of frightening it away at last the spirit get close to the hole the war chief strike it with he rattle and kill it this ensure to the dahcotah success in battle and most solemnly do the owl assert to he soldier the fact that he have thus deal with the bear spirit while they as earnestly believe it the next morning four of the warrior go in advance as spy one of they carry a pipe present as a offering to deceive the spirit of they enemy about noon they sit down to rest and wait until the remainder of the party come up when they be all together again they rest and smoke and other spy be appoint who take the pipe and go forward again they have not proceed far when they perceive sign of they enemy in the sand near the border of a prairie be the footprint of chippeway and fresh too they congratulate each other by look too cautious even to whisper in a few moment a hundred chippeway could be call up but still the dahcotahs plunge into the thick forest that skirt the edge of the prairie in order to find out what prospect they have for delight themselves with the long wish for revenge it be not long before a group of chippeway be discover all unapprehensive of evil at they camp the chippeway have make picket for they know they might expect retaliation but those who fall a sacrifice be not expect they foe the spy be not far ahead -- they return to the party and then retrace they step the low cry of animal be imitate to prevent any alarm be give by the breaking of a twig or the rustling of the leaf they be very near the chippeway when the war chief give the signal on a bone whistle and the dahcotah fire every one of the chippeway fall -- two man three woman and two child then come the tomahawk and scalping knife -- the former to finish the work of death the latter to bear a trophy to they country to say we comrade be avenge nor be that all the body be cut to piece and then the warrior commence they homeward journey they allow themselves but little rest until they be out of they enemy ' country but when they be out of the reach of attack when they foot tread again upon dahcotah soil then they stop to stretch each scalp on a hoop which be attach to a slender pole this be always the work of the war chief they look eagerly for the welcome sight of home the cone-shaped teepee rise before they view they know that they young wife will rejoice to see the scalp as much as to know that the wanderer have return when they be near they village the war chief raise the song of victory the other warrior join they voice to he the welcome sound rouse the inhabitant of the village from they duty or amusement the warrior enter the village in triumph one by one each bear the scalp he take and the stout warrior the aged woman and the feeble child all press forward to feast they eye with the sight of the scalp there be a jubilee in the village for week day and night do the savage dance round the scalp but how soon may they rejoicing be lose in cry of terror even now they tremble at the sound of they own voice when evening draw near -- for it be they turn to suffer they expect they foe but they do not dread they the less chapter ii many of the custom of the dahcotah be to be attribute to they superstition they teepee be always make of buffalo-skin nothing would induce they to use deer-skin for that purpose many year ago a woman make a teepee of deer-skin and be take suddenly ill and die immediately after some reason must be find for the cause of she death and as no other be know the indian conclude that she bring she death upon herself by use deer-skin for she teepee they have always since use buffalo-skin for that purpose nothing would induce a dahcotah woman to look into a looking-glass for the medicine man say that death will be the consequence but there be no superstition which influence they more than they belief in haokah or the giant they say this be be possess of superhuman power : indeed he be deem so powerful as to be able to take the thunder in he hand and cast it to the ground he dress in many color and wear a fork hat one side of he face be red the other blue he eye be also of different color he always carry a bow and arrow in he hand but never have occasion to use it as one look will kill the animal he want they sing song to this giant and once in a long time dance in honor of he but so severe be the latter custom that it be rarely perform the follow incident will show how great be they reverence for this singular be a indian make a vapor bath and place inside of it a rude image of the giant make of birch bark this he intend to pray to while bathing after the hot stone be place inside of the wigwam several indian go in to assist in give the bath to they sick friend one of they commence pour the water on the hot stone and the water fly on the other and scald they badly the image of the giant be also displace the indian never dream of attribute they burn to the natural cause but conclude that the giant be displeased at they place he image there and they consider it as a instance of he mercy that they be not scald to death however defective may be the religion of the dahcotah they be faithful in act up to all its requirement every feast and custom among they be celebrate as a part of they religion after the scalp-dance have be perform long enough the dahcotah of the village turn they attention to make sugar many grove of sugar tree be in sight of they village and on this occasion the generous sap reward they labor nor be they ungrateful for when the medicine man announce that they must keep the sugar-feast all leave they occupation anxious to celebrate it neither need it be conclude that this occasion they no loss of time for they be all occupy with the construction of they summer wigwam which be make of the bark of tree which must be peel off in the spring but every villager assemble to keep the feast a certain quantity of sugar be deal out to each individual and any one of they who could not eat all that be give he be oblige to pay leggin or a blanket or something valuable to the medicine man on this occasion indeed on most occasion the dahcotah have no difficulty in dispose of any quantity of food when the feast be over however the skill of they doctor be in requisition for almost all of they be make quite ill by excess and be see at evening lie at full length on the ground groan and writhe with pain chapter iii the day after the sugar feast the owl tell he wife to get ready she canoe as he want to spear some fish she would rather have staid at home as she be not fully recover from she last night 's indisposition but there be no hesitate when the war chief speak so she place she child upon she back and seat herself in the stern of the canoe paddle gently along the shore where the fish usually lie she husband stand in the bow of the canoe with a spear about six foot in length as he see the fish lie in the water he throw the spear into they still keep hold of it when the war chief be tired he wife would stop paddle and nurse she child while he smoke if the owl be loquaciously incline he would point out to he wife the place where he shoot a deer or where he kill the man who have threaten he life indeed if you take he word for it there be not a foot of ground in the country which have not be a scene of some exploit the woman believe they all for like a good wife she shine by the reflect light of she husband 's fame when they return home she make she fire and put the fish to cook and towards evening many of the indian be assemble in the wigwam of the war-chief and partook of the fish he have catch in the morning unk-ta-he -lrb- footnote : the god of the water -rrb- say one of the oldest man in the tribe -lrb- and reverence as a medicine man of extraordinary power -rrb- unk-ta-he be as powerful as the thunder-bird each want to be the greatest god of the dahcotah and they have have many battle my father be a great medicine man he be kill many year ago and he spirit wander about the earth the thunder-bird want he and unk-ta-he want he for they say he would make a wonderful medicine man some of the son of unk-ta-he fight against the son of the thunder and the young thunder-bird be kill and then unk-ta-he take the spirit of my father to teach he many mysterious thing when my father have live a long time with unk-ta-he in the water under the earth he take the form of a dahcotah again and live in this village he teach I all that i know and when i go to the land of spirit my son must dance alone all night and he will learn from I the secret of the medicine of we clan all listen attentively to the old man for not a indian there but believe that he could by a spell cause they instant death and many wonderful miracle have the elk work in he day in the corner of the wigwam sit the bind spirit whose vacant look tell the sad tale of she want of reason generally she sit quiet but if the cry of a infant fall upon she ear she would start and she shriek could be hear throughout the village the bind spirit be a sisseton in the depth of winter she have leave she village to seek she friend in some of the neighbor band she be a widow and there be no one to provide she food accompany by several other indian she leave she home which be make wretched by she desolate condition -- that home where she have be very happy while she husband live it have since be the scene of she want and misery the small portion of food they have take for they journey be exhaust rejoice would they have be to have have the bark of tree for food but they be on the open prairie there be nothing to satisfy the wretched craving of hunger and she child -- the very child that cling to she bosom -- be kill by the unhappy mother and its tender limb supply to she the means of life she reach the place of destination but it be through instinct for forget and forget by all be the wretched maniac who enter she native village the indian fear she they long to kill she but be afraid to do so they say she have no heart sometimes she would go in the morning to the shore and there with only she head out of water would she lie all day now she have be weep over the infant who sleep by she she be perfectly harmless and the wife of the war chief kindly give she food and shelter whenever she wish it but it be not often she eat -- only when desperate from long fasting -- and when she appetite be satisfied she seem to live over the scene the memory of which have make she what she be after all but she have eat of the fish the elk related to they the story of the large fish that obstruct the passage of the st croix river the scene of this tradition be far from they but the dahcotah tell each other over and over again the story which have be hand down from they father and these incident be know throughout the tribe two dahcotah go to war against they enemy on return home they stop at the lake st croix hungry and much fatigued one of they catch a fish cook it and ask he comrade to eat but he refuse the other argue with he and beg of he to eat but still he decline the owner of the fish continue to invite he friend to partake of it until he weary by he importunity consent to eat but add with a mysterious look ` my friend i hope you will not get out of patience with I ' after say this he eat heartily of the fish he then seem to be very thirsty and ask he companion to bring he some water out of the lake he do so but very soon the thirst which be quench for a time only return more be give he but the terrible thirst continue and at last the indian who have beg he companion to eat begin to be tire of bring he water to drink he therefore tell he he would bring he no more and request he to go down to the water and drink he do so and after drink a great quantity while he friend be asleep he turn himself into a large fish and stretch himself full length across the st croix this fish for a long time obstruct the passage of the st croix so much so that the indian be oblige to go round it by land some time ago the indian be on a hunting excursion up the river and when they get near the fish a woman of the party dart ahead in she canoe she make a dish of bark work the edge of it very handsomely fill it with water and place some red down in it she then place the dish near the fish in the river and entreat the fish to go to its own element and not to obstruct the passage of the river and give they so much trouble the fish obey and settle down in the water and have never since be see the woman who make this request of the fish be love by he when he be a dahcotah and for that reason he obey she wish nor be this the only legend with which he amuse he listener the night be half spend when they separate to rest with as firm a faith in the story of the old medicine man as we have in the annals of the revolution -lrb- illustration -rrb- the maiden 's rock or wenona 's leap lake pepin be a widening of the mississippus river it be about twenty mile in length and from one to two mile wide the country along its bank be barren the lake have little current but be dangerous for steamboat in a high wind it be not deep and abound in fish particularly the sturgeon on its shore the traveller gather white and red agate and sometimes specimen streak with vein of gold color the lover read the motto from he mistress ' seal not think that the beautiful stone which make the impression be find on the bank of lake pepin at the south end of the lake the chippeway river empty into the mississippus the maiden 's rock be a high bluff whose top seem to lean over towards the water with this rock be associate one of the most interesting tradition of the sioux but the incident be well-known almost every one have read it a dozen time and always differently tell some represent the maiden as deliver a oration from the top of the rock long enough for a address at a college celebration it have be state that she fall into the water a circumstance which the relative situation of the rock and river would render impossible writer have pretend too that the heroine of the rock be a winnebago it be a mistake the maiden be a dahcotah it be from the dahcotah that i obtain the incident and they believe that it really occur they be offend if you suggest the possibility of its be a fiction indeed they fix a date to it reckoning by the occurrence of great battle or other event worthy of notice but to the story -- and i wish i could throw into it the feeling and energy of the old medicine woman who relate it about one hundred and fifty year ago the band of dahcotah to which wenona belong live near fort snell they village be on the site now occupy by good road 's band the whole band make preparation to go below lake pepin after porcupine these animal be of great value among the dahcotah they flesh be consider excellent as a article of food and the woman stain they quill to ornament the dress of the man they mocassin and many other article in use among they a young girl of this band have receive repeat offer of marriage from a dahcotah whom she hate with the same degree of intensity that she love he rival she dare not marry the object of she choice for she know it would subject herself and he to the persecution of she family she declare she never would consent to be the wife of the man whom she parent have choose for she though he be young and brave and what be most value by the friend of a indian girl he be say to be the best hunter of the tribe marry he my daughter say the mother you father be old he can not now hunt deer for you and I and what shall we do for food chaskè will hunt the deer and buffalo and we shall be comfortable and happy yes say she father you mother speak well chaskè be a great warrior too when you brother die do he not kill he worst enemy and hang up he scalp at he grave but wenona persevere in she refusal i do not love he i will not marry he be she constant reply but chaskè trusting to time and she parent 's influence be not discourage he kill game and supply the want of the family besides he have twice buy she accord to indian custom he have give she parent cloth and blanket calico and gun the girl entreat they not to receive they but the lover refuse to take they back and finally they be take into the wigwam just as the band be about leave the village for the hunt he come again with many present whatever would make the family comfortable on they journey and a decide promise be then give that the maiden should become he wife she know it would be useless to contend so she seem to be willing to submit to she fate after encamp for a time opposite the maiden 's rock to rest from they journey the hunter determine to go further down the river they have cross over to the other side and be seat nearly under the rock they woman be in they canoe come over when suddenly a loud cry be hear from a old woman the mother of wenona the canoe have nearly reach the shore and the mother continue to shriek gaze at the project rock the indian eagerly inquire of she what be the matter do you not see my daughter she say she be stand close to the edge of the rock she be there indeed loudly and wildly sing she dirge a invocation to the spirit of the rock calm and unconcerned in she dangerous position while all be terror and excitement among she friend below she the hunter so soon as they perceive she hastily ascend the bluff while she parent call to she and entreat she to go back from the edge of the rock come down to we my child they cry do not destroy you life you will kill we we have no child but you have finish she song the maiden answer she parent you have force I to leave you i be always a good daughter and never disobey you and could i have marry the man i love i should have be happy and would never have leave you but you have be cruel to I you have turn my beloved from the wigwam you would have force I to marry a man i hate i go to the house of spirit by this time the hunter have nearly reach she she turn towards they for a moment with a smile of scorn as if to intimate to they that they effort be in vain but when they be quite near so that they hold out they arm towards she in they eagerness to draw she from she dangerous station she throw herself from the rock the first blow she receive from the side of the rock must have kill she for she fall like a dead bird amidst the shout of the hunter above and the shriek of the woman below she body be array in she handsomest clothing place upon a scaffold and afterwards bury but the dahcotah say that she spirit do not watch over she earthly remains for she spirit be offend when she bring trouble upon she aged mother and father such be the story tell by the dahcotah and why not apply to they for they own tradition neither be there any reason to doubt the actual occurrence of the incident not a season pass away but we hear of some dahcotah girl who put a end to she life in consequence of jealousy or from the fear of be force to marry some one she dislike a short time ago a very young girl hang herself rather than become the wife of a man who be already the husband of one of she sister the parent tell she they have promise she and insist upon she fulfil the engagement even she sister do not object nay rather seem anxious to forward the scheme which would give she a rival from among she nearest relation the young girl finally run away and the lover leave he wife pursue the fugitive and soon overtake she he renew he entreaty and find she still obstinate he tell she that she should become he wife and that he would kill she if she make any more trouble this last argument seem to have the desire effect for the girl express she willingness to return home after they arrive the man go to he wigwam to tell he wife of the return of she sister and that everything be now in readiness for they marriage but one hour after the girl be miss and when find be hang to a tree forever free from the power of she tormentor she friend celebrate the ceremony of death instead of marriage it must be concede that a indian girl when desperate with she love affair choose a most unromantic way of end she trouble she almost invariably hang herself when there be so many beautiful lake near she where she could die a easier death and at the same time one that would tell better than where she fasten a old leather strap about she neck and die literally by choke but there be this to be take into consideration when she hang herself near the village she can manage affair so that she can be cut down if she conclude to live a little longer for this frequently occur and the suicide live forty and sometimes sixty year after but when wenona take the resolution of end she earthly sorrow no doubt there be other passion beside love influence she mind love be the most powerful with he she love life would have be all happiness -- without he all misery such be the reasoning of she young heart but she resent the importunity of the hunter whose pretension she parent favor how often she have tell he she would die before she would become he wife and he would smile as if he have but little faith in the word of a woman now he should see that she hatred to he be not assume and she would die such a death that he might know that she fear neither he nor a death of agony and while she parent mourn they unkindness she lover would admire that firmness which make death more welcome than the triumph of he rival and sacred be the spot where the devoted girl close she earthly sorrow spirit be ever hover near the scene the laugh of the dahcotah be check when he canoe glide near the spot he point to the bluff and as the shades of evening be throw dimness and a mystery around the beauty of the lake and of the mountain he fancy he can see the arm of the girl as she toss they wildly in the air some have aver they hear she voice as she call to the spirit of the rock and ever will the traveller as he pass the bluff admire the wondrous beauty of the picture and remember the story of the lover 's leap there be a tradition among the dahcotah which fix a date to the incident as well as to the death of the rival lover of wenona they say that it occur about the time state and that the band of indian go and obtain the porcupine and then they return and settle on the st croix river shortly after the tragical death of wenona the band go again down the mississippus and they camp at what they call the medicine wood here a child die and the body be lay on a scaffold the father in the middle of the night go out to mourn for he child while he lean against the scaffold weep he see a man watch he the stranger do not appear to be a dahcotah and the mourner be alarm and return to the camp in the morning he tell the indian of the circumstance and they raise the camp and go into the pine country the body of the child be carry along and in he night the father go out again to lament its death the same figure appear to he and again he return alarm at the circumstance in the morning the indian move they camp again and at night the same occurrence take place the dahcotah be slave to superstition and they now dread a serious evil they fear be not confirm in the way they anticipate for they foe come bodily and when daylight appear one thousand chippeway warrior appear before they and the shrill whistle and terrible whoop of war be hear in earnest dreadful be the shout of the chippeway for the dahcotah be totally unprepared for they and many be lay low at the first discharge of the rifle the merciless chippeway continue the work of death the woman and child flee to they canoe but the chippeway be too quick for they and they only enter they canoe to meet as certain a fate as those who remain the woman have not they paddle with they and there be a eddy in the current as soon as the canoe be push from the shore it would whirl round and the delighted chippeway catch the canoe and pull they ashore again while other let fall upon they victim the uplifted tomahawk when the chippeway have kill until they be tire they take what they want from the sioux camp and start for home take one dahcotah boy prisoner the party have not travel far when a number of dahcotah attack the chippeway but the latter succeed in kill many of the dahcotah one of the latter flee and be in he canoe on the lake st croix when the chippeway suddenly come upon he the little dahcotah see he only chance for liberty -- he plunge in the water and make for the canoe of the dahcotah in a moment he have reach and enter it and the two dahcotah be out of sight before the arrow of they enemy could reach they a very few of that band escape one of they say that when they be first attack by the chippeway he see he have but one chance so he dive down to the bottom of the river and the chippeway could not see he he find the water at the bottom of the river very cold and when he have go some distance he venture where the water be warmer which he know be near the shore he then come out of the water and make he escape even this latter trifling incident have be hand down from father to son and be believe universally by the dahcotah and accord to they tradition the lover and family of wenona perish in this battle at all event there be no one who can prove that they tradition or my translation may not be true the indian in a trance \* \* \* \* \* about forty year ago ahak-tah the male elk be take sick with a sore throat it be in the winter too and sickness and cold together be hard to bear want be a evil from which they be suffer though the dahcotah be not so poor then as they be now they have not give so much of they land to the white people and they depend more upon they own exertion for support than they do at present the medicine man do all they could to cure ahaktah they try to charm away the animal that have enter into he body they use the sacred rattle but ahaktah 's throat get worse he die and while he wife and child weep for he he have start on he long journey to the land of spirit he be wrap in scarlet cloth and lay upon a scaffold he wife sit weep in they teepee when a cry from they young child draw they attention to the door there stand he for whom they mourn the dead man again take he place among those who sit beside the household fire tear of grief be shed no more -- food be give to ahaktah and when he be refresh he thus address he wonder family : -- while you be weep for I my spirit be on its way to the great city where we father who have teach we all the wonder of we sacred medicine of haokah the giant and of the thunder bird be now live twice have the sun cease to shine since i leave you and in that short time i have see many strange thing first i pass through a beautiful country the forest-tree be larger than any you have ever see bird of all color fill they and they music be as loud as when we medicine man play for we to celebrate the scalp dance the broad river be full of fish and the loon scream as she swim across the lake i have no difficulty in find my way for there be a road through this country it seem as if there must have be many traveller there though i see no one this great road be make by the spirit of those who be kill in battle no warrior however brave he may have be have ever assist in make this road except those who sing they death song under the tomahawk of they enemy neither do any woman ever assist she be not consider worthy to touch the war implement of a dahcotah warrior and she be not permit to do anything towards complete the path in which the brave of the dahcotah would walk when they join they forefather in the land of spirit as i pursued my journey i see near the bank of the river a teepee i enter it and see paint and all that a warrior need to dress himself in order to be fit to enter the city of spirit i sit down and plait my hair i put vermilion on my cheek and arrange the war-eagle feather in my head here i say to myself do my father rest when he be on the same journey i be tired but i could not wait -- i long to see my friend who have travel this path before I -- i long to tell they that the dahcotah be true to the custom of they forefather -- i long to tell they that we have drunk deep of the blood of the chippeway that we have eat the heart of we enemy that we have tear they infant from they mother ' breast and dash they to the earth i continue my journey look eagerly around I to see some one but all be desolate and beautiful as everything be i would have be glad to have see the face of a friend it be evening when a large city burst upon my sight the house be build regularly on the shore of the river as far as i could see the home of the spirit of my forefather be in view but still i see no one i descend the hill towards the river which i must cross to reach the city of spirit i see no canoe but i fear nothing i be so near my journey 's end the river be wide and deep and the wave be swiftly follow one another when i plunge among they soon i reach the opposite shore and as i again stand on the land i hear some one cry ` here he come here he come ' i approach the nearest house and enter everything look awful and mysterious in the corner of the room sit a figure whom i recognize it be my mother 's brother fly wind the medicine man i remember he for it be he who teach I to use my bow and arrow in a bark dish in the corner of the room be some wild rice i be very hungry for i have not eat since i leave the earth i ask my uncle for some rice to eat but he do not give it to I have i eat of the food for spirit i never should have return to earth at last my uncle speak to I ` my nephew ' say he ` why be you travel without a bow and arrow how can you provide yourself with food when you have no means of killing game when my home be on the mississippus the warrior of the dahcotah be never without they bow and arrow -- either to secure they food or to strike to the heart of they enemy ' i then remember that i have be travel without my bow and arrow ` but where ' say i to my uncle ` where be the spirit of my forefather where be my brother who fall under the tomahawk of he enemy where be my sister who throw herself into the power of unktahe rather than to live and see she rival the wife of the sun where be the spirit of the dahcotah brave whose deed be still tell from father to son among we ' ` the dahcotah brave be still watch for they enemy -- the hunter be bring in the deer and the buffalo -- we woman be plant corn and tan deer-skin but you will not now see they you step be firm and you eye be bright you must return to earth and when you limb be feeble when you eye be dim then will you return and find you home in the city of spirit ' so say he arise and give I a bow and arrow i take it and while try it i leave the house but how i do not know the next thing that i remember be be seat on the top of the cliff of eagle 's nest below lake pepin i hear a sound and soon distinguish my mother 's voice she be weep i know that she be bend over my body i could see she as she cut off she hair and i feel sad when i hear she cry ` my son my son ' then i recollect be on the top of the half-side mountain on lake pepin afterwards i be on the mountain near red wing 's village and again i stand on a rock on a point of land near where the water of the mississippus and st peter 's meet on the ` maiden 's jump rock ' -lrb- footnote : near fort snelling be a high rock call the maiden 's jump rock where formerly the dahcotah girl use to jump for amusement a distance of many foot from the top to the ground -rrb- here i recover my right mind the daughter of ahaktah say that she father retain the wahkun bow and arrow that be give he by he uncle and that he be always successful in hunting or in war that he enjoy fine health and live to be a very old man and she be live now to tell the story oeche-monesah the wanderer \* \* \* \* \* chaskè be tire of live in the village where the young man find plenty of small game to support life and yield to the languor and indolence produce by a summer 's sun play at checker 's or drink or sleep from morn till night and seem to forget that they be the greatest warrior and hunter in the world this do very well for a time but as i say chaskè get tire of it so he determine to go on a long journey where he might meet with some adventure early one morning he shoulder he quiver of arrow and draw out one arrow from the quiver he shoot it in the direction he intend to go now say he i will follow my arrow but it seem as if he be destine never to find it for morning and noon have pass away and the setting sun warn he not only of the approach of night but of musquito too he think he would build a fire to drive the musquito away besides he be both hungry and tired though he have not yet find he arrow and have nothing to eat when he be hesitate as to what he should do he see in the bush a dead elk and behold he arrow be stick in its side he draw the arrow out then cut out the tongue and after make a fire he put the tongue upon a stick to roast but while the tongue be roast chaskè fall asleep and sleep many hour at day-break a woman come up to he and shake he as if to awake he chaskè start and rub he eye and the woman point to the path which lead across the prairie be he dream no he feel sure he be awake so he get up and follow the woman he think it very strange that the woman do not speak to he i will ask she who she be say he but as he turn to address she she raise she arm in the air and change she form to that of a beautiful bird blue as the sky that hang over the morning 's mist she fly away chaskè be surprised and delighted too he love adventure have he not leave home to seek they so he pursue he journey quite forget he supper which be cooking when he fall asleep he shoot he arrow off again and follow it it be late in the evening when he find it and then it be in the heart of a moose i will not be cheat out of my supper to-night say he so he cut the tongue out of the moose and place it before the fire to roast hardly have he seat himself to smoke when sleep overcome he and he know nothing until morning when a woman approach and shake he as before point to the path he arise quickly and follow she and as he touch she arm determine to find out who she be she turn upon he a brow black as night be suddenly change into a crow the dahcotah be completely puzzle he have never care for woman on the contrary have avoid they he never waste he time tell they they be beautiful or play on the flute to charm they sens he think he have leave all such thing behind he but already have he be twice baffle by a woman still he continue he journey he have this consolation the dahcotah girl do not turn into bird and fly away at least there be the charm of novelty in the incident the next day he kill a bear but as usual he fall asleep while the tongue be roast and this time he be wake by a porcupine the fourth day he find he arrow in a buffalo now say he i will eat at last and i will find out too who and what it be that wake I but he fall asleep as usual and be wake in the morning by a female who touch he lightly and point to the path she back be turn towards he and instead of rise to follow she he catch she in he arm determine to see and talk with she finding herself a prisoner the girl turn she face to he and chaskè have never see anything so beautiful she skin be white as the fairest flower that droop its head over the bank of the lac quus parle she hair be not plait neither be it black like the dahcotah maiden ' but it hang in golden ringlet about she face and neck the warm blood tint she cheek as she meet the ardent gaze of the dahcotah and chaskè could not ask she who she be how could he speak when he heart be throbbing and every pulse beat wildly let I go say the girl why do you seek to detain I i be a beaver-woman -lrb- footnote : accord to the wise man of the dahcotah beaver and bear have soul they have many tradition about bear and beaver-woman -rrb- and you be a dahcotah warrior turn from I and find a wife among the dark-faced maiden of you tribe i have always despise they say the dahcotah but you be more beautiful than the spirit of the water i love you and will make you my wife then you must give up you people reply the girl for i can not live as the dahcotah woman come with I to my white lodge and we will be happy for see the bright water as it fall on the rock we will sit by its bank during the heat of the day and when we be tire the music of its wave will lull we to sleep so she take chaskè by the hand and they walk on till they come to a empty white lodge and there they live and be very happy they be still happier when they little boy begin to play about the lodge for although they love each other very much still it be lonely where they live and the child be company for they both there be one thing however that trouble the dahcotah he could not turn he mind from it and day after day pass without relieve he from he perplexity he beautiful wife never eat with he when he return in the evening from hunting she be always glad to see he and while he rest himself and smoke she would cook he meat for he and seem anxious to make he comfortable but he have never see she eat and when he would tell she that he do not like to eat alone and beg she to sit down and eat with he she would say she be not hungry and then employ herself about she wigwam as if she do not wish he to say any more about it chaskè make up he mind that he would find out what he wife live upon so the next morning he take he bow and arrow as if he be go out on a day 's hunt after go a short distance from the lodge he hide himself in the tree where he could watch the motion of he wife she leave the lodge after a while and with a axe in she hand she approach a grove of poplar tree after carefully look round to satisfy herself that there be no one near she cut down a number of the small and tender poplar and carry they home eat they as if she enjoy they very much chaskè be infinitely relieve when he see that he wife do eat for it frighten he to think that she live on nothing but air but it be so droll to think she should eat young tree surely venison be a great deal better but like a good husband he think it be he duty to humor he wife 's fancy and then he love she tenderly -- he have give up country and home for she she be so good and kind and she beautiful hair chaskè call she the mocassin flower for she golden ringlet remind he of that beautiful flower she shall not have to cut the tree down herself say chaskè i will bring she food while she prepare mine so he go out to hunt and return in the evening and while he wife be cook he supper he go to the poplar grove and cut a number of young tree he then bring they to the lodge and lay they down he say to he wife i have find out at last what you like no one would suppose but that the beaver-woman would have be grateful to she husband for thinking of she instead of that she be very angry and take she child in she arm she leave the lodge chaskè be astonish to see he gentle wife angry but he conclude he would eat he supper and then follow she hope that in the meantime she would recover she good temper when he go out she be nowhere to be see he call she -- he think at first that she have hide herself but as night come on and neither she nor the child return the desert husband grow desperate he could not stay in he lodge and the only thing that he could do be to start in search of she he walk all night but see no trace of she about sunrise he come to a stream and follow it up a little way he come to a beaver dam and on it sit he wife with she child in she arm and beautiful she look with she long tress fall into the water chaskè be delighted to find she why do you leave I call he i should have die of grief if i have not find you do i not tell you that i could not live like the dahcotah woman reply mocassin flower you need not have watch I to find out what i eat return to you own people you will find there woman enough who eat venison the little boy clap he hand with delight when he see he father and want to go to he but he mother would not let he she tie a string to he leg and tell he to go and the child would plunge into the water and when he have nearly reach the shore where he father sit then would the beaver-woman draw he back in the meantime the dahcotah have be try to persuade he wife to come to he and return to the lodge but she refuse to do so and sit comb she long hair the child have cry itself to sleep and the dahcotah wear out with fatigue and grief think he would go to sleep too after a while a woman come and touch he on the shoulder and awake he as of old he start and look at she and perceive it be not he wife feel inclined to take little notice of she what say she do a dahcotah warrior still love a woman who hate he mocassin flower love I well reply the dahcotah she have be a good wife yes reply the woman she be for a time but she sigh to return home -- she heart yearn towards the lover of she youth chaskè be very angry can this be true he say and he look towards the beaver dam where he wife still sit in the meantime the woman who have wake he bring he some food in bark dish work with porcupine eat she say to the dahcotah you be hungry but who can tell the fury that mocassin flower be in when she see that strange woman bring she husband food who be you she cry that be troubling yourself about my husband i know you well you be the ` bear-woman ' and if i be say the bear woman do not the soul of the bear enjoy forever the heaven of the dahcotah poor chaskè he could not prevent they quarrel so be very hungry he soon dispose of what the bear woman have bring he when he have do eat she take the bark dish come with I she say you can not live in the water and i will take you to a beautiful lodge and we will be happy the dahcotah turn to he wife but she give he no encouragement to remain well say he i always love adventure and i will go and seek some more the new wife be not half so pretty as the old one then she be so wilful and order he about -- as if woman be anything but dog in comparison with a dahcotah warrior yes he who have scorn the dahcotah girl as they smile upon he be now the slave of a bear-woman but there be one comfort -- there be no warrior to laugh at he for a while they get on well enough he wife have twin child -- one be a fine young dahcotah and the other be a smart active little bear and it be very amusing to see they play together but in all they fight the young dahcotah have the advantage though the little bear would roll and tumble and stick he claw into the dahcotah yet it always end by the little bear 's caper off and roar after he mother perhaps this be the reason but for some reason or other the mother do not seem contented and happy one morning she wake up very early and while tell she husband that she have a bad dream the dog commence bark outside the lodge what can be the matter say chaskè oh say the woman i know there be a hunter out there who want to kill I but i be not afraid so say she put she head out of the door which the hunter see shot he arrow but instead of hurt she the arrow fall to the ground and the bear-woman catch up she little child run away and be soon out of sight ha say chaskè i have better have marry a dahcotah girl for they do not run away from they husband except when another wife come to take they place but i have be twice desert so say he take the little dahcotah in he arm and follow he wife towards evening he come up with she but she do not seem glad to see he he ask she why she leave he she reply i want to live with my own people well say the dahcotah i will go with you the woman consent though it be plain she do not want he for she hate she dahcotah child and would not look at he after travel a few day they approach a grove of tree which grow in a large circle do you see that nest of tree say the woman there be the great village of the bear there be many young man there that love I and they will hate you because i prefer you to they take you boy then and return to you people but the dahcotah fear not and they approach the village of the bear there be a great commotion among the bear as they discover they they be glad to see the young bear-woman back again but they hate the dahcotah and determine on he death however they receive he hospitably conduct he and he wife to a large lodge give they food and the tired traveller be soon asleep but the dahcotah soon perceive he be among enemy and he keep a careful look out upon they the little dahcotah be always quarrel with the young bear and on one occasion be pretty hungry a cub annoy he at the time very much he deliberately shoot the cub with he bow and arrow and eat he up this arouse the vengeance of the bear they have a consultation among themselves and swear they would kill both father and son it would be impossible to tell of the trouble of chaskè he wife he could see love one of the bear and be anxious for he own death but whenever he contend with the bear he come off victor whether in run a foot race or shooting with a bow and arrow or whatever it might be he always win the prize and this make he enemy still more venomous four year have now pass since chaskè leave he native village and nothing have ever be hear of he but at length the wanderer return but who would have recognize in the crest-fallen melancholy-looking indian the gay warrior that have leave home but a few year before the little boy that hold he hand be cheerful enough and seem to recognize acquaintance instead of look for the first time on the face of he father 's friend how do the young girl laugh when he tell of the desertion of he first wife but when he continue he story and tell they of the faithlessness of the bear woman also you hear nothing but shout of derision be it not a triumph for the dahcotah woman how have he scorn they before he go away -- do he not say that woman be only dog or worse than dog but there be one among he old acquaintance who would not join in the laughter as she look on the care-worn countenance of the warrior she would fain have offer to put new mocassin upon he foot and bring he food but she dare not subject herself to the ridicule of she companion -- though as night come on she seek he when there be no one to heed she chaskè she call -- and the dahcotah turn hastily towards she attract by the kindness of she voice -- there be no woman who love as the dahcotah woman i would have go to the end of the earth with you but you despise I you have come back and be laugh at care have break you spirit or you would not submit to the sneer of you old friend and the contempt of those who once fear you i will be you wife and mingling again in the feast and custom of you race you will soon be the bold and fearless warrior that you be when you leave we and she word be true for the indian soon learn that they be not at liberty to talk to chaskè of he wanderings he never speak of he former wife except to compare they with he present who be as faithful and obedient as they be false and troublesome and he find say chequered cloud that there be no land like the dahcotah 's no river like the father of water and no happiness like that of follow the deer across the open prairie or of listen in the long summer day to the wisdom of the medicine man and she who have love he in he youth and weep for he in he absence now lie by he side -- for chaskè have take another long journey death have touch he but not lightly and point to the path which lead to the land of spirit -- and he do not go alone for she life close with and together they spirit watch over the mortal frame that they once tenant look at the white woman 's life say chequered cloud as she conclude the story of chaskè and then at the dahcotah 's you sleep on a soft bed while the dahcotah woman lay she head upon the ground with only she blanket for a cover when you be hungry you eat but for day have the dahcotah woman want for food and there be none to give it you child be happy and fear nothing ours have crouch in the earth at night when the whoop and yell of the chippeway send terror to they young heart and tremble to they tender limb and when the fire-water of the white man have madden the sens of the dahcotah so that the blow of he war club fall upon he wife instead of he enemy even then the dahcotah woman must live and suffer on but chequered cloud the spirit of the dahcotah watch over the body which remain on earth do you not say the soul go to the house of spirit the dahcotah have four soul reply the old woman one wander about the earth and require food another protect the body the third go to the land of spirit while the fourth forever hover around he native village i wish say i that you would believe in the god of the white people you would then learn that there be but one soul and that that soul will be reward for the good it have do in this life or punish for the evil the great spirit she reply be the god of the dahcotah he make all thing but thunder and wild rice when we do wrong we be punish in this world if we do not live up to the law of we forefather the spirit of the dead will punish we we must keep up the custom of we tribe if we be afraid that the thunder will strike we we dance in honor of it and destroy its power we great medicine feast be give in honor of we sacred medicine which will not only heal the sick but will preserve we in danger and we make feast for the dead we child be teach to do right they be not to injure one who have not harm they but where be the dahcotah who will not rejoice as he take the life of he enemy but say i you honor the thunder and yet it strike you what be the thunder and where do it come from thunder be a large bird fly through the air its bright track be see in the heaven before you hear the clapping of its wing but it be the young one who do the mischief the parent bird would not hurt a dahcotah long ago a thunder bird fall dead from the heaven and we father see it as it lay not far from little crow 's village it have a face like a dahcotah warrior with a nose like a eagle 's bill its body be long and slender its wing be large and on they be paint the lightning we warrior be once out hunting in the

she have stop to rest and to weep nor do she strength fail she until she reach she home then insensible to sorrow and fatigue she sink to the earth the woman relieve she from the burden and afterwards help she to bury she dead many water could not quench she love nor could the flood drown it it be strong as death well might she sit in she lodge and weep the village where she pass she childhood and youth be desert she husband forget by all but herself she two son be murder by the chippeway while defend they mother and they young brother well might she weep and tremble too for death among the dahcotah come as often by the fire water purchase from the white people as from the murderous tomahawk and scalping-knife of the chippeway nor be she fear useless she never again see she son until he body be bring to she he dark feature stiff in death the death blow be give too by the friend who have shame he from listen to he mother 's voice \* \* \* \* \* what wonder that she should not heed the noise of the tempest the storm of she life have be fiercer than the war of the element but while the fountain of heaven be unsealed those of she heart be close forever never more should tear relieve she who have shed so many often have she go into the prairie to weep far from the sight of she companion she voice be hear from a distance the wind would waft the melancholy sound back to the village it be only harpstenah say the woman she have go to the prairie to weep for she husband and she child the storm rage during the night but cease with the come of day the widow wife and childless mother be find dead under the scaffold where lay the body of she son the thunder bird be avenge for the death of he friend the strength of red deer have waste under a linger disease he child be dead they mother lay beside she youngest son the spirit of the water have not appear in vain when the countenance of unktahe rest upon a dahcotah it be the sure prognostic of come evil the fury of the storm spirit be spend when the soul of harpstenah follow she lose one \* \* \* \* \* dimly as the lengthen shadow of evening fall around they be see the outstretched arm of the suffering dahcotah woman as they appeal to we for assistance -- and not to proud man he in the hall of legislation decide when the land of the red man be need -- one party make a bargain which the other be force to accept but in a woman 's heart god have place sympathy to which the sorrow of the dahcotah woman appeal listen for they tell you they would fain know of a balm for the many grief they endure they would be teach to avoid the many sin they commit and oh how gladly would many of they have they young child accustom to shudder at the sight of a fellow creature 's blood like we they pour out the best affection of early youth on a beloved object like we they have clasp they child to they heart in devoted love like we too they have weep as they lay they in the quiet earth but they must fiercely grapple with trial which we have never conceive winter after winter pass and they perish from disease and murder and famine there be a way to relieve they -- would you know it assist the missionary who be give they life to they and god send they money that they may clothe the feeble infant and feed its starve mother send they money that they may supply the want of those who be send to school and thus encourage other to attend as the day of these forget one be pass away so be ours they be bear to suffer we to relieve let they deathless soul be teach the way of life that they and we after the harsh discord of earth shall have cease may listen together to the harmony of heaven haokah ozape the dance to the giant chapter i the dance to the giant be now rarely celebrate among the dahcotah so severe be the sacrifice to this deity that there be few who have courage to attempt it and yet haokah be universally reverence and fear among the sioux they believe in the existence of many giant but haokah be one of the principal he be style the anti-natural god in summer he feel cold in winter he suffer from the heat hot water be cold to he and the contrary the dahcotah warrior however brave he may be believe that when he dream of haokah calamity be impend and can only be avoid by some sort of sacrifice to this god the incident on which this story be found occur while i reside among the sioux i allude to the desertion of wenona by she lover it serve to show the blind and ignorant devotion of the dahcotah to he religion and as man be ever alike in every country and under every circumstance of life -- as he often from selfish motive trample upon the heart that trust he -- so do woman utterly condemn a sister feeling no sympathy for she sorrow but only hatred of she fault jealous for the honor of the long-reverenced feast of the dahcotah -- the deer killer think not for a moment of the sorrow and disgrace he would bring upon wenona while wauska love the warrior more than ever triumph in he preference of she above she companion and wenona -- a cloud come o'er the prospect of she life and evening do set in early and dark and deadly but she love too truly to be jealous and depart without the revenge that most indian woman would have seek and accomplish too she silence on the subject of she early trial induce she friend to believe that she mind be affect a situation cause by long and intense suffering and follow by neglect in such case the invalid be say to _ have no heart _ the girl from whom i have attempt to draw the character of wauska i know well good look with tooth like pearl she laugh be perfect music often have i be rouse from my sewing or reading by hear the ringing note as they be answer by the child she generally announce herself by a laugh and be welcome by one in return she be pettish withal and easily offend and if refuse calico for a okendokenda or bead or ribbon to ornament some part of she dress she would sullenly rest she chin on she hand until pacify with a present or the promise of one it be in indian life as in ours -- youth believe and trust and advance year bring the consciousness of the trial of life the necessity of endure and in some case the power to overcome they who but she who suffer it can conceive the sioux woman 's greatest trial -- to feel that the love that be she right be go to see another take the place by the household fire that be hers to be last where she be first it may require some apology that wauska should have vow destruction upon herself if the deer killer take another wife and yet should have live on and become that most unromantic of all character -- a virago she be reconcile in time to what be inevitable and as there be many wife among the sioux there must be the proportion of scolding one so i plead guilty to the charge of want sentiment choosing rather to be true to nature and there be this consideration : if there be among the dahcotah some catharine there be many petruchio \* \* \* \* \* a group of indian girl be seat on the grass wauska in the center she merry musical laugh echo back by all but wenona the leaf of the large forest tree under which they be sheltered seem to vibrate to the joyous sound stir as they be by a light breeze that blow from the st peter 's hark they laugh again and old john wake up from he noon-day nap and turn a curious reprove look to the noisy party and shah-co-pee the orator of the sioux move towards they anxious to find out the cause of they mirth old john after a hearty stretch join they too and now the fume of the pipe ascend and mix with the odor of the sweet-scented prairie grass that the young girl be braid but neither shah-co-pee the chief nor old john the medicine man could find out the secret they coax and threaten in turn -- but all in vain for they curiosity be not gratify they might have notice however that wenona 's face be pale and she eye red with weep she be idle too while the other plait busily and there be a subdue look of sadness about she countenance contrast strangely with the merry face of the other why do you not tell shah-co-pee what we be laugh at wenona say wanska you secret be know now the deer-killer tell all at the virgin 's feast why do you not make he promise not to come if i have be you i would have lie sick the day of the feast i would have strike my foot so that i could not walk or i would have die before i enter the ring the deer-killer promise to marry I reply wenona he say that when he return from he hunt i should be he wife but i know well why he have disgrace I you have try to make he love you and now he be wait to take you to he lodge he be not a great warrior or he would have keep he word wenona say wanska interrupt she you have not mind the advice of you grandmother she tell you never to trust the promise of the bravest warrior you should not have believe he word until he take you to he wigwam but do not be afraid that i will marry the deer-killer there be never but one woman among the dahcotah who do not marry and i be go to be the second you have better hush wanska say the bright star you know she have she nose cut off because she refuse to be a wife and somebody may cut yours off too it be better to be the mother of warrior than to have every one laughing at you enah then i will be marry rather than have my nose cut off but i will not be the deer-killer 's wife so wenona may stop cry he say he will never marry I say wenona and it will do I no good for you to refuse to be he wife but you be a liar like he for you know you love he i be go far away and the man who have break he faith to the maiden who trust he will never be a good husband if i be wenona and you marry the deer-killer say the bright star to wanska you should not live long after it she be a coward or she would not let you laugh at she as you do i believe _ she have no heart _ since the virgin 's feast sometimes she laugh so loud that we can hear she from we teepee and then she bend she head and weep when she mother place food before she she say ` will he bring the meat of the young deer for I to dress for he and will my lodge be ever full of food that i may offer it to the hungry and weary stranger who stop to rest himself ' if i be in she place wanska add the bright star i would try and be a medicine woman and i would throw a spell upon the deer-killer and upon you too if you marry he the deer-killer be come say another of the girl he have be watch we and now that he see wenona have go away he be come to talk to wanska he wear many eagle feather : wenona may well weep that she can

he pipe he seat himself and then the dancer advance to the fire and light theirs and soon they be envelop in a cloud of smoke when the water begin to boil the indian arise and dancing round the fire imitate the voice of the giant hah-hah hah hah they sing and each endeavor to drown the voice of the other now they crouch as they dance look diminutive and contemptible as those who be degrade themselves in they most sacred duty then they rise up and show they full height stalwart warrior as they be they keen eye flash as they glance from the fire to each other ' face distort with the effort of utter such discordant sound now they broad chest heave with the exertion and they breath come quickly they seat themselves to rest and smoke again the hellish sound be hear and the wife of

u-mi-ne-wah-chippe or to dance around i have notice the many singular notion of the sioux concern thunder and especially the fact that they believe it to be a large bird they represent it thus -lrb- illustration : -rrb- this figure be often see work with porcupine quill on they ornament ke-on mean to fly thunder be call wah-ke-on or all-flier u-mi-ne-wah-chippe be a dance give by some one who fear thunder and thus endeavor to propitiate the god and save he own life a ring be make of about sixty foot in circumference by stick sapling in the ground and bend they top down fasten they together in the center of this ring a pole be place the pole be about fifteen foot in height and paint red from this swing a piece of birch bark cut so as to represent thunder at the foot of the pole stand two boy and two girl the two boy represent war : they be paint red and hold war-club in they hand the girl have they face paint with blue clay : they represent peace on one side of the circle a kind of booth be erect and about twenty foot from it a wigwam there be four entrance to this circle when all the arrangement for the dance be conclude the man who give the dance emerge from he wigwam dress up as hideously as possible crawl on all fours towards the booth he must sing four tune before reach it in the meantime the medicine man who be seat in the wigwam beat time on the drum and the young man and squaw keep time to the music by first hop on one foot and then on the other -- move around inside the ring as fast as they can this be continue for about five minute until the music stop after

the man dancer after the indian have reach he booth inside the ring he must sing four more tune as before at the end of the fourth tune the squaw all run out of the ring as fast as possible and must leave by the same way that they enter the other three entrance be reserve for the man who carry they war implement might be accidentally touch by one of the squaw -- and the war implement of the sioux warrior have from time immemorial be hold sacred from the touch of woman for the same reason the man form the inner ring in dancing round the pole they war implement be place at the foot of the pole when the last tune be end the young man shoot at the image of thunder which be hang to the pole and when it fall a general rush be make by the warrior to get hold of it there be place at the foot of the pole a bowl of water color with blue clay while the man be try to seize the part of the bark representation of they god they at the same time be eagerly endeavor to drink the water in the bowl every drop of which must be drink the warrior then seize on the two boy and girl -- the representation of war and peace -- and use they as roughly as possible -- take they pipe and war-club from they and roll they in the dirt until the paint be entirely rub off from they face much as they dislike this part of the dance they submit to it through fear believe that after this performance the power of thunder be destroy now that the water be drink up and the guardian of the thunder bird be deprive of they war-club and pipe a terrible wail commence no description could convey a idea of the noise make by they cry and lamentation all join in exert to the utmost the strength of they lung before the man shoot at thunder the squaw must leave the ring no one sing at this dance but the warrior who give it and while the visitor the dancer and the medicine man woman and child all be array in they gayest clothing the host must be dress in he meanest in the dance ahahkah koyah or to make the elk a figure of thunder be also make and fight against the sioux have a great deference for the majesty of thunder and consequently for they own skill in prevail or seem to prevail against it a sioux be always alarm after dream of a elk and soon prevail upon some of he friend to assist he in dance to prevent any evil consequence result from he dream those willing to join in must lay aside all clothing paint they body with a reddish gray color like the elk 's each indian must procure two long sapling leave the bough upon they these be to aid the indian in run the sapling must be about twelve foot in length with they they tear down the bark image of thunder which be hang with a string to the top of the pole all be ready the elk run off at a gallop assist by they sapling to within about two hundred yard of the pole when they stop for a while and then start again for the pole to which be attach the figure of thunder they continue run round and round this pole constantly strike the figure of thunder with they sapling endeavor to knock it down which after a while they succeed in accomplish the ceremony be now end and the dreamer have nothing to fear from elk until he dream again there be no end to the superstition and fancy entertain by the sioux concern thunder on the cradle of the indian child we frequently see the figure of thunder represent it be generally carve on the wood by the father of the child with representation of the elk accompany with hieroglyphic look figure but thunder be regard as the type of all animal that fly there be many medicine feast -- and i see one celebrate near the oak grove mission and near also to the village of good road and the chief man in the cloud it be on a dark cold day about the first of march we leave the fort at about nine o'clock and follow the road on the st peter 's river which have be use for many month but which though still strong be begin to look unsafe as we advance towards the scene of the feast many indian from every direction be collect and hurry forward either to join in the ceremony about to be celebrate or to be spectator we ascend quite a high hill and be then at the spot where all the arrangement be make to celebrate one of the most sacred form of they religion many of the indian to be engage in the performance be entirely without protection from the severe cold -- they body be paint and they head adorn with they choicest ornament but throw aside even they blanket accord to the law of the ceremony the indian continue to assemble at eleven o'clock the dance commence although i could not faithfully describe yet i never can forget the scene the dark lowering sky -- the mantle of snow and ice throw over all the object that surround we except the fierce human being who be thus under heaven 's arch for a roof about to offer to they deity a solemn worship then the music commence and the horrid sound increase the wildness of the scene and the contortion of the medicine man as he go round and round make he countenance horrible beyond expression the devoted attention of the savage give to every part of the ceremony make it in a measure interesting there be hundred of human being believe in a great spirit and anxious to offer he acceptable service but how degrade in that service how fall from its high estate be the soul that god have make when it stoop to worship the bone of animal the senseless rock the very earth that we stand upon the aged man tremble with feebleness ready to depart to the spirit 's land weary with the weight of he infirmity -- the warrior tread the earth with the pride of middle age -- the young with nothing to regret and everything to look forward to -- all unite in a worship which they ignorantly believe to be religion but which we know to be idolatry i be glad to leave the scene and turn towards the house of the rev mr pond who live near the spot where the feast be celebrate here pursue he duty and study do this excellent man improve every moment of he time to the advantage of the sioux always ready to converse kindly with they in order to gain they confidence -- give medicine to the sick and food to the hungry do all that lie in he power to administer to they temporal comfort he labor to improve they condition as a people how can it better be do than by introduce the christian religion among they this the missionary be gradually do and do they receive proper assistance from government and from religious society they would indeed go on they way rejoice place under the government of the united state these helpless unhappy being be dependent upon we for the means of subsistence in a measure and how much more for the knowledge of the true god church will soon rise where the odious feast and medicine dance be celebrated but will the indian worship there when the foundation of these church be lay the bone of the original owner of the country will be throw out -- but where will be the soul of those who be thrust out of they country and they rights to make way for we i have see where literally two or three be meet together -- where in a distant country the few who celebrate the death of the redeemer be assemble -- where the beautiful service of we church be read and the heart that hear it respond to its animate truth we rejoice that the religion which be we comfort be not confine to place here be no altar nor marble tablet -- but here in this humble house we know god would meet and be with we a indian silently open the church door and enter as strange to he be the solemn decorum of this scene as to we be the useless ceremony we every day witness he watch the countenance of the clergyman but he know not that he be preach the doctrine of a universal religion he see the sacred book upon the desk but he could not read the glorious doctrine of a world redeem by a savior 's blood he hear the voice of prayer but how could he soul like ours rise as on eagle 's wing and ascend to the throne of god who be he this intruder it may be a descendant of those who guard the oracle of god who for a time preserve they for we no wonder he tire and turn away not he the fault that he do not join in the solemn service but ours if we disregard the temporal want of the dahcotah can we shut we ear against they cry that rise up day after day and year after year -- show we the path to happiness and god
