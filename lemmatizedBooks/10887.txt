introduction by epiphanius wilson be revise edition 1901 special introduction the great nation which dwell in the seventh century before we era on the bank of tigri and euphrate flourish in literature as well as in the plastic art and have a alphabet of its own the assyrian sometimes write with a sharp reed for a pen upon skin wooden tablet or papyrus bring from egypt in this case they use cursive letter of a phoenician character but when they wish to preserve they write document they employ clay tablet and a stylus whose bevelled point make a impression like a narrow elongate wedge or arrow-head by a combination of these wedge letter and word be form by the skilled and practice scribe who would thus rapidly turn off a vast amount of copy all work of history poetry and law be thus write in the cuneiform or old chaldean character and on a substance which could withstand the ravages of time fire or water hence we have authentic monument of assyrian literature in they original form unglossed unaltered and ungarbled and in this respect chaldean record be actually superior to those of the greek the hebrew or the roman the literature of the chaldean be very vary in its form the hymn to the god form a important department and be doubtless employ in public worship they be by no means lack in sublimity of expression and while quite unmetrical they be proportion and emphasize like hebrew poetry by means of parallelism in other respects they resemble the production of jewish psalmist and yet they date as far back as the third millennium before christ they seem to have be transcribe in the shape in which we at present have they in the reign of assurbanipal who be a great patron of letter and in whose reign library be form in the principal city the assyrian renaissance of the seventeenth century bc witness great activity among scribe and book collector : modern scholar be deeply indebted to this golden age of letter in babylonium for many precious and imperishable monument it be however only within recent year that these work of hoar antiquity have pass from the secluded cell of the specialist and have come within reach of the general reader or even of the student of literature for many century the cuneiform writing be literally a dead letter to the learn world the clue to the understanding of this alphabet be originally discover in 1850 by colonel rawlinson and describe by he in a paper read before the royal society hence the knowledge of assyrian literature be so far as europe be concerned scarcely more than half a century old among the most valuable of historic record to be find among the monument of any nation be inscription set up on public building in palace and in temple the greek and latin inscription discover at various point on the shore of the mediterranean have be of priceless value in determine certain question of philology as well as in throw new light on the event of history many secret of language have be reveal many perplexity of history disentangle by the word engraven on stone or metal which the scholar discover amid the dust of ruin temple or on the _ cippus _ of a tomb the form of one greek letter perhaps even its existence would never have be guess but for its discovery in a inscription if inscription be of the highest critical importance and historic interest in language which be represent by a voluminous and familiar literature how much more precious must they be when they record what happen in the remotest dawn of history survive among the ruin of a vast empire whose people have vanish from the face of the earth hence the cuneiform inscription be of the utmost interest and value and present the greatest possible attraction to the curious and intelligent reader they record the deed and conquest of mighty king the napoleon and hannibal of primeval time they throw a vivid light on the splendid sculpture of nineveh they give a new interest to the picture and carving that describe the building of city the march to war the battle by sea and land of great monarch whose horse and foot be as multitudinous as the locust that in eastern literature be compare to they lover of the bible will find in the assyrian inscription many confirmation of scripture history as well as many parallel to the account of the primitive world in genesis and none can give even a cursory glance at these famous remains without feel he mental horizon widen we be carry by this write on the wall of assyrian town far beyond the little world of the recent century we pass as almost modern the day when julius cæsar struggle in the surf of kent against the paint savage of britain nay the birth of romulus and remus be a recent event in comparison with record of incident in assyrian national life which occur not only before mose lay cradle on the water of a egyptian canal but before egypt have a single temple or pyramid three millennium before the very dawn of history in the valley of the nile but the interest of assyrian literature be not confine to hymn or even to inscription a nameless poet have leave in the imperishable tablet of a babylonian library a epic poem of great power and beauty this be the epic of izdubar at dur-sargina the city where stand the palace of assyrian monarch three thousand year ago be two gigantic human figure stand between the winged bull carve in high relief at the entrance of the royal residence these human figure be exactly alike and represent the same personage -- a colossus with swell thew and dress in a robe of dignity he strangle a lion by press it with brawny arm against he side as if it be no more than a cat this figure be that of izdubar or gisdubar the great central character of assyrian poetry and sculpture the theme of minstrel the typical hero of he land the favor of the god what be call the epic of izdubar relate the exploit of this hero who be bear the son of a king in ourouk of chaldea he father be dethrone by the elamite and izdubar be drive into the wilderness and become a mighty hunter in the half-peopled earth so lately create wild beast have multiply and threaten the extermination of mankind the hunter find himself at war with monster more formidable than even the lion or the wild bull there be half-human scorpion bull with the head of man fierce satyr and winged griffin deadly war do izdubar wage with they till as he period of exile draw near to a close he say to he mother i have dream a dream the star rain from heaven upon I then a creature fierce-faced and taloned like a lion rise up against I and i smote and slew he the dream be long in be fulfil but at last izdubar be tell of a monstrous jinn whose name be heabani he head be human but horned and he have the leg and tail of a bull yet be he wisest of all upon earth entice he from he cave by send two fair woman to the entrance izdubar take he captive and lead he to ourouk where the jinn marry one of the woman whose charm have allure he and become henceforth the well-loved servant of izdubar then izdubar slew the elamite who have dethrone he father and put the royal diadem on he own head and behold the goddess ishtar -lrb- ashtaroth -rrb- cast she eye upon the hero and wish to be he wife but he reject she with scorn remind she of the fate of tammuz and of alalum the eagle and of the shepherd taboulon -- all she husband and all dead before they time thus as the wrath of juno pursue paris so the hatred of this slight goddess attend izdubar through many adventure the last plague that torment he be leprosy of which he be to be cure by khasisadra son of oubaratonton last of the ten primeval king of chaldea khasisadra while still live have be transport to paradise where he yet abide here he be find by izdubar who listen to he account of the deluge and learn from he the remedy for he disease the afflict hero be destine after be cure to pass without death into the company of the god and there to enjoy immortality with this promise the work conclude the great poem of izdubar have but recently be know to european scholar have be discover in 1871 by the eminent assyriologist mr george smith it be probably write about 2000 bc though the extant edition which come from the library of king assurbanipal in the palace at dur-sargina must bear the date of 600 bc the hero be suppose to be a solar personification and the epic be interesting to modern writer not only on account of its description of the deluge but also for the pomp and dignity of its style and for its noble delineation of heroic character -lrb- signature :

naught i know but conscious entity no boundary my be feel or have and speechless deaf and blind and formless sad i float through dark space -- a conscious blank no breath of air my spirit move i sink i know not where till motionless i cease at last to move and yet i could not rest around I spread the limitless and vast my cheerless conscious spirit -- fix and fast in some lone spot in space be
