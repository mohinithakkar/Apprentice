excellence be not expect in every number of every daily or weekly journal in the land he do not know that if every such journal be not edit so as to suit the comprehension of all class of cursory critic it should be unqualifiedly condemn suppose that a painter should not condemn a paper for publish a musical article beyond he comprehension and that a architect ought not to get in a rage because he find in he favorite journal a paper on beaver which make he feel insignificant punchinello have generally look around upon he fellow-journalist and think they very good fellow who generally publish very good papers he do not find superlative excellence in any of they issue but then he do not look for it he might as well pretend to look for that in the journalist themselves or in society at large but he have lately learn from the critic of the period that he ought to look for it and that it be the proper thing nowadays to pitch into every journal which do not in every part please every body whether they be smart or dull those quick of appreciation or those slow gentleman who always come in with they congratulation upon the birth of a joke at the time its funeral be take place and so punchinello will do as other do and will occasionally view from the loop-hole in he curtain the success and failure of he neighbor and will give he patron the benefit of he observation the first thing he notice to-day be that the _ evening snail _ of last night be not so good as it be a fortnight ago or let we think a bit -- it may have be a good number at the beginning of last month that he be think of at all event this last issue be inferior the matter on the first page be not print in nearly as good type as the original periodical have it and while the letter in the head be quite fair it be very noticeable that the i 's be very defective and there be no c in it the gleanings be excellent and it would be advisable to have more of they -- if indeed such a thing be possible in this case the spider-work inside show no acquaintance with the writings of bach or gliddon and there be nothing about the spectrum analysis in any part of the paper besides the paper be too stiff and rattle too much and punchinello could never abide the color of the editor 's pantaloons why will not people dress and write so that every body can admire and understand they especially in regard to witty thing and breastpin they ought to be loud overpowering and so glaring that people could not help see they and they ought to be a little cheap too or average people will not comprehend they in

moment a breeze stir in the apartment produce a chill sensation i think it prudent to jump back into bed next morning upon make my usual visit to note the progress of the early bulb in the flower-bed
