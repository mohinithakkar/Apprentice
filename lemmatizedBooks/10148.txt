clothyard arrow and raise the bow draw the gray goose feather to he ear the next moment the bowstring ring and the arrow speed down the glade as a sparrowhawk skim in a northern wind high leap the noblest hart of all the herd only to fall dead redden the green path with he heart 's blood ha cry robin how likest thou that shoot good fellow i wot the wager be mine a it be three hundred pound then all the forester be fill with rage and he who have speak the first and have lose the wager be more angry than all nay cry he the wager be none of thine and get thee go straightway or by all the saint of heaven i 'll baste thy side until thou wilt ne'er be able to walk again knowest thou not say another that thou hast kill the king 's deer and by the law of we gracious lord and sovereign king harry thine ear should be shaven close to thy head catch he cry a third nay say a fourth let he e ` en go because of he tender year never a word say robin hood but he look at the forester with a grim face then turn on he heel stride away from they down the forest glade but he heart be bitterly angry for he blood be hot and youthful and prone to boil now well would it have be for he who have first speak have he leave robin hood alone but he anger be hot both because the youth have get the better of he and because of the deep draught of ale that he have be quaff so of a sudden without any warning he spring to he foot and seize upon he bow and fit it to a shaft ay cry he and i 'll hurry thee anon and he send the arrow whistle after robin it be well for robin hood that that same forester 's head be spin with ale or else he would never have take another step as it be the arrow whistle within three inch of he head then he turn around and quickly draw he own bow and send a arrow back in return ye say i be no archer cry he aloud but say so now again the shaft fly straight the archer fall forward with a cry and lay on he face upon the ground he arrow rattle about he from out of he quiver the gray goose shaft wet with he heart 's blood then before the other could gather they wit about they robin hood be go into the depths of the greenwood some start after he but not with much heart for each fear to suffer the death of he fellow so presently they all come and lift the dead man up and bear he away to nottingham town meanwhile robin hood run through the greenwood go be all the joy and brightness from everything for he heart be sick within he and it be bear in upon he soul that he have slay a man alas cry he thou hast find I a archer that will make thy wife to wring i would that thou hadst ne'er say one word to I or that i have never pass thy way or e ` en that my right forefinger have be stricken off ere that this have happen in haste i smote but grieve i sore at leisure and then even in he trouble he remember the old saw that what be do be do and the egg crack can not be cure and so he come to dwell in the greenwood that be to be he home for many a year to come never again to see the happy day with the lad and lass of sweet locksley town for he be outlaw not only because he have kill a man but also because he have poach upon the king 's deer and two hundred pound be set upon he head as a reward for whoever would bring he to the court of the king now the sheriff of nottingham swear that he himself would bring this knave robin hood to justice and for two reason : first because he want the two hundred pound and next because the forester that robin hood have kill be of kin to he but robin hood lay hide in sherwood forest for one year and in that time there gather around he many other like himself cast out from other folk for this cause and for that some have shoot deer in hungry wintertime when they could get no other food and have be see in the act by the forester but have escape thus save they ear some have be turn out of they inheritance that they farm might be add to the king 's land in sherwood forest some have be despoil by a great baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire -- all for one cause or another have come to sherwood to escape wrong and oppression so in all that year fivescore or more good stout yeoman gather about robin hood and choose he to be they leader and chief then they vow that even as they themselves have be despoil they would despoil they oppressor whether baron abbot knight or squire and that from each they would take that which have be wring from the poor by unjust tax or land rent or in wrongful fine but to the poor folk they would give a help hand in need and trouble and would return to they that which have be unjustly take from they besides this they swear never to harm a child nor to wrong a woman be she maid wife or widow so that after a while when the people begin to find that no harm be mean to they but that money or food come in time of want to many a poor family they come to praise robin and he merry man and to tell many tale of he and of he doings in sherwood forest for they feel he to be one of themselves up rise robin hood one merry morn when all the bird be sing blithely among the leaf and up rise all he merry man each fellow wash he head and hand in the cold brown brook that leap laugh from stone to stone then say robin for fourteen day have we see no sport so now i will go abroad to seek adventure forthwith but tarry ye my merry man all here in the greenwood only see that ye mind well my call three blast upon the bugle horn i will blow in my hour of need then come quickly for i shall want you aid so say he stride away through the leafy forest glade until he have come to the verge of sherwood there he wander for a long time through highway and byway through dingly dell and forest skirt now he meet a fair buxom lass in a shady lane and each give the other a merry word and pass they way now he see a fair lady upon a amble pad to whom he doff he cap and who bow sedately in return to the fair youth now he see a fat monk on a pannier-laden ass now a gallant knight with spear and shield and armor that flash brightly in the sunlight now a page clothe in crimson and now a stout burgher from good nottingham town pacing along with serious footstep all these sight he see but adventure find he none at last he take a road by the forest skirt a bypath that dip toward a broad pebbly stream span by a narrow bridge make of a log of wood as he draw nigh this bridge he see a tall stranger come from the other side thereupon robin quicken he pace as do the stranger likewise each think to cross first now stand thou back quoth robin and let the better man cross first nay answer the stranger then stand back shine own self for the better man i wet be i that will we presently see quoth robin and meanwhile stand thou where thou art or else by the bright brow of saint aelfrida i will show thee right good nottingham play with a clothyard shaft betwixt thy rib now quoth the stranger i will tan thy hide till it be as many color as a beggar 's cloak if thou darest so much as touch a string of that same bow that thou holdest in thy hand thou pratest like a ass say robin for i could send this shaft clean through thy proud heart before a curtal friar could say grace over a roast goose at michaelmastide and thou pratest like a coward answer the stranger for thou standest there with a good yew bow to shoot at my heart while i have nought in my hand but a plain blackthorn staff wherewith to meet thee now quoth robin by the faith of my heart never have i have a coward 's name in all my life before i will lay by my trusty bow and eke my arrow and if thou darest abide my come i will go and cut a cudgel to test thy manhood withal ay marry that will i abide thy come and joyously too quoth the stranger whereupon he lean sturdily upon he staff to await robin then robin hood step quickly to the coverside and cut a good staff of ground oak straight without new and six foot in length and come back trim away the tender stem from it while the stranger wait for he lean upon he staff and whistle as he gaze round about robin observe he furtively as he trim he staff measure he from top to toe from out the corner of he eye and think that he have never see a lustier or a stouter man tall be robin but taller be the stranger by a head and a neck for he be seven foot in height broad be robin across the shoulder but broader be the stranger by twice the breadth of a palm while he measure at least a ell around the waist nevertheless say robin to himself i will baste thy hide right merrily my good fellow then aloud lo here be my good staff lusty and tough now wait my come a thou darest and meet I a thou fearest not then we will fight until one or the other of we tumble into the stream by dint of blow marry that meeteth my whole heart cry the stranger twirl he staff above he head betwixt he finger and thumb until it whistle again never do the knight of arthur 's round table meet in a stouter fight than do these two in a moment robin step quickly upon the bridge where the stranger stand first he make a feint and then deliver a blow at the stranger 's head that have it meet its mark would have tumble he speedily into the water but the stranger turn the blow right deftly and in return give one as stout which robin also turn as the stranger have do so they stand each in he place neither move a finger 's - breadth back for one good hour and many blow be give and receive by each in that time till here and there be sore bone and bump yet neither thought of cry enough nor seem likely to fall from off the bridge now and then they stop to rest and each think that he never have see in all he life before such a hand at quarterstaff at last robin give the stranger a blow upon the rib that make he jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun so shrewd be the stroke that the stranger come within a hair 's - breadth of fall off the bridge but he regain himself right quickly and by a dexterous blow give robin a crack on the crown that cause the blood to flow then robin grow mad with anger and smote with all he might at the other but the stranger ward the blow and once again thwack robin and this time so fairly that he fall heel over head into the water as the queen pin fall in a game of bowl and where art thou now my good lad shout the stranger roar with laughter oh in the flood and float adown with the tide cry robin nor could he forbear laugh himself at he sorry plight then gain he foot he wade to the bank the little fish speeding hither and thither all frighten at he splash give I thy hand cry he when he have reach the bank i must need own thou art a brave and a sturdy soul and withal a good stout stroke with the cudgel by this and by that my head hummeth like to a hive of bee on a hot June day then he clap he horn to he lip and wind a blast that go echo sweetly down the forest path ay marry quoth he again thou art a tall lad and eke a brave one for ne'er i bow be there a man betwixt here and canterbury town could do the like to I that thou hast do and thou quoth the stranger laugh takest thy cudgeling like a brave heart and a stout yeoman but now the distant twig and branch rustle with the come of man and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeoman all clothe in lincoln green burst from out the covert with merry will stutely at they head good master cry will how be this truly thou art all wet from head to foot and that to the very skin why marry answer jolly robin yon stout fellow have tumble I neck and crop into the water and have give I a drubbing beside then shall

strike right and leave with he stout staff so that though he go down with press of number some of they rub crack crown before he be overcome nay forbear cry robin laughing until he sore side ache again he be a right good man and true and no harm shall befall he now hark ye good youth wilt thou stay with I and be one of my band three suit of lincoln green shalt thou have each year beside forty

i hit it not strip I and beat I blue with bowstring then he choose the stoutest bow among they all next to robin 's own and a straight gray goose shaft well-feathered and smooth and step to the mark -- while all the band sit or lie upon the greensward watch to see he shoot -- he draw the arrow to he cheek and loose the shaft right deftly send it so straight down the path that it cleave the mark in the very center aha cry he mend thou that if thou canst while even the yeomen clap they hand at so fair a shot that be a keen shot indeed quoth robin mend it i can not but mar it i may perhaps then take up he own good stout bow and nock a arrow with care he shoot with he very greatest skill straight fly the arrow and so true that it light fairly upon the stranger 's shaft and split it into

fitteth thee well little john shall thou be call henceforth and little john shall it be so come my merry man we will prepare a christen feast for this fair infant so turn they back upon the stream they plunge into the forest once more through which they trace they step till they reach the spot where they dwell in the depths of the woodland there have they build hut of bark and branch of tree and make couch of sweet rush spread over with skin of fallow deer here stand a great oak tree with branch spread broadly around beneath which be a seat of green moss where robin hood be wont to sit at feast and at merrymake with he stout man about he here they find the rest of the band some of whom have come in with a brace of fat do then they all build great fire and after a time roasted the do and broach a barrel of hum ale then when the feast be ready they all sit down but robin place little john at he right hand for he be henceforth to be the second in the band then when the feast be do will stutely speak up it be now time i ween to christen we bonny babe be it not so merry boy and aye aye cry all laugh till the wood echo with they mirth then seven sponsor shall we have quoth will

without a word they all run upon he at once seize he by he leg and arm and hold he tightly in spite of he struggle and they bear he forth while all stand around to see the sport then one come forward who have be choose to play the priest because he have a bald crown and in he hand he carry a brimming pot of ale now who bringeth this babe ask he right soberly that do i answer will stutely and what name callest thou he little john call i he now little john quoth the mock priest thou hast not live heretofore but only get thee along through the world but henceforth thou wilt live indeed when thou livedst not thou wast call john little but now that thou dost live indeed little john shalt thou be call so christen i thee and at these last word he empty the pot of ale upon little john 's head then all shout with laughter as they see the good brown ale stream over little john 's beard and trickle from he nose and chin while he eye blink with the smart of it at first he be of a mind to be angry but find he could not because the other be so merry so he too laugh with the rest then robin take this sweet pretty babe clothe he all anew from top to toe in lincoln green and give he a good stout bow and so make he a member of the merry band and thus it be that robin hood become outlawed thus a band of merry companion gather about he and thus he gain he right-hand man little john and so the prologue end and now i will tell how the sheriff of nottingham three time seek to take robin hood and how he fail each time part first tell how the sheriff of nottingham swear that he would deal dole to robe hood also how he make three trial thereat but miss each time by a good bow 's length robin hood and the tinker now it be tell before how two hundred pound be set upon robin hood 's head and how the sheriff of nottingham swear that he himself would seize robin both because he would fain have the two hundred pound and because the slay man be a kinsman of he own now the sheriff do not yet know what a force robin have about he in sherwood but think that he might serve a warrant for he arrest as he could upon any other man that have break the law therefore he offer fourscore golden angel to anyone who would serve this warrant but man of nottingham town know more of robin hood and he doings than the sheriff do and many laugh to think of serve a warrant upon the bold outlaw know well that all they would get for such service would be crack crown so that no one come forward to take the matter in hand thus a fortnight pass in which time none come forward to do the sheriff 's business then say he a right good reward have i offer to whosoever would serve my warrant upon robin hood and i marvel that no one have come to undertake the task then one of he man who be near he say good master thou wottest not the force that robin hood have about he and how little he care for warrant of king or sheriff truly no one like to go on this service for fear of crack crown and broken bone then i hold all nottingham man to be coward say the sheriff and let I see the man in all nottinghamshire that dare disobey the warrant of we sovereign lord king harry for by the shrine of saint edmund i will hang he forty cubit high but if no man in nottingham dare win fourscore angel i will send elsewhere for there should be man of mettle somewhere in this land then he call up a messenger in whom he place great trust and bid he saddle he horse and make ready to go to lincoln town to see whether he could find anyone there that would do he bidding and win the reward so that same morning the messenger start forth upon he errand bright shine the sun upon the dusty highway that lead from nottingham to lincoln stretch away all white over hill and dale dusty be the highway and dusty the throat of the messenger so that he heart be glad when he see before he the sign of the blue boar inn when somewhat more than half he journey be do the inn look fair to he eye and the shade of the oak tree that stand around it seem cool and pleasant so he alight from he horse to rest himself for a time call for a pot of ale to refresh he thirsty throat there he see a party of right jovial fellow seat beneath the spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door there be a tinker two barefoot friar and a party of six of the king 's forester all clothe in lincoln green and all of they be quaff hum ale and singing merry ballad of the good old time loud laugh the forester as jest be bandy about between the singing and louder laugh the friar for they be lusty man with beard that curl like the wool of black ram but loudest of all laugh the tinker and he sing more sweetly than any of the rest he bag and he hammer hang upon a twig of the oak tree and near by lean he good stout cudgel as thick as he wrist and knot at the end come cry one of the forester to the tired messenger come join we for this shot ho landlord bring a fresh pot of ale for each man the messenger be glad enough to sit down along with the other who be there for he limb be weary and the ale be good now what news bearest thou so fast quoth one and whither ridest thou today the messenger be a chatty soul and love a bit of gossip dearly besides the pot of ale warm he heart so that settle himself in a easy corner of the inn bench while the host lean upon the doorway and the hostess stand with she hand beneath she apron he unfold he budget of news with great comfort he tell all from the very first : how robin hood have slay the forester and how he have hide in the greenwood to escape the law how that he live therein all against the law god wot slaying he majesty 's deer and levy toll on fat abbot knight and esquire so that none dare travel even on broad watle street or the fosse way for fear of he how that the sheriff have a mind to serve the king 's warrant upon this same rogue though little would he mind warrant of either king or sheriff for he be far from be a law - abide man then he tell how none could be find in all nottingham town to serve this warrant for fear of crack pate and broken bone and how that he the messenger be now upon he way to lincoln town to find of what mettle the lincoln man might be now come i forsooth from good banbury town say the jolly tinker and no one nigh nottingham -- nor sherwood either a that be the mark -- can hold cudgel with my grip why lad do i not meet that mad wag simon of ely even at the famous fair at hertford town and beat he in the ring at that place before sir robert of leslie and he lady this same robin hood of whom i wot i never

warrant of the good sheriff of nottinghamshire i will so bruise beat and bemaul he pate that he shall never move finger or toe again hear ye that bully boy now art thou the man for my farthing cry the messenger and back thou goest with I to nottingham town nay quoth the tinker shake he head slowly from side to side go i with no man gin it be not with mine own free will nay nay say the messenger no man be there in nottinghamshire could make thee go against thy will thou brave fellow ay that be i brave say the tinker ay marry say the messenger thou art a brave lad but we good sheriff have offer

band until the famous allan a dale join they before whose sweet voice all other seem as harsh as a raven 's but of he we will learn hereafter the shooting match at nottingham town then the sheriff be very wroth because of this failure to take jolly robin for it come to he ear as ill news always do that the people laugh at he and make a jest of he think to serve a warrant upon such a one as the bold outlaw and a man hate nothing so much as be make a jest of so he say : we gracious lord and sovereign king himself shall know of this and how he law be pervert and despise by this band of rebel outlaw as for yon traitor tinker he will i hang if i catch he upon the very highest gallows tree in all nottinghamshire then he bid all he servant and retainer to make ready to go to london town to see and speak with the king at this there be bustling at the sheriff 's castle and man run hither and thither upon this business and upon that while the forge fire of nottingham glow red far into the night like twinkle star for all the smith of the town be busy make or mend armor for the sheriff 's troop of escort for two day this labor last then on the third all be ready for the journey so forth they start in the bright sunlight from nottingham town to fosse way and thence to watle street and so they journey for two day until they see at last the spire and tower of great london town and many folk stop as they journey along and gaze at the show they make ride along the highway with they flash armor and gay plume and trappings in london king henry and he fair queen eleanor hold they court gay with lady in silk and satin and velvet and cloth of gold and also brave knight and gallant courtier thither come the sheriff and be show into the king 's presence a boon a boon quoth he as he kneel upon the ground now what wouldst thou have say the king let we hear what may be thy desire o good my lord and sovereign spake the sheriff in sherwood forest in we own good shire of nottingham liveth a bold outlaw whose name be robin hood in good sooth say the king he doings have reach even we own royal ear he be a saucy rebellious varlet yet i be fain to own a right merry soul withal but hearken o my most gracious sovereign say the sheriff i send a warrant to he with thine own royal seal attach by a right lusty knave but he beat the messenger and steal the warrant and he killeth thy deer and robbeth thine own liege subject even upon the great highway why how now quoth the king wrathfully what wouldst thou have I do comest thou not to I with a great array of man-at-arms and retainer and yet art not able to take a single band of lusty knave without armor on breast in thine own county what wouldst thou have I do art thou not my sheriff be not my law in force in nottinghamshire canst thou not take thine own course against those that break the law or do any injury to thee or thine go get thee go and think well devise some plan of thine own but trouble I no further but look well to it master sheriff for i will have my law obey by all man within my kingdom and if thou art not able to enforce they thou art no sheriff for I so look well to thyself i say or ill may befall thee as well as all the thieving knave in nottinghamshire when the flood cometh it sweepeth away grain as well as chaff then the sheriff turn away with a sore and troubled heart and sadly he rue he fine show of retainer for he see that the king be angry because he have so many man about he and yet could not enforce the law so as they all ride slowly back to nottingham the sheriff be thoughtful and full of care not a word do he speak to anyone and no one of he man speak to he but all the time he be busy devise some plan to take robin hood aha cry he suddenly smite he hand upon he thigh i have it now ride on my merry man all and let we get back to nottingham town as speedily as we may and mark well my word : before a fortnight be pass that evil knave robin hood will be safely clap into nottingham gaol but what be the sheriff 's plan as a usurer take each one of a bag of silver angel feel each coin to find whether it be clip or not so the sheriff as all ride slowly and sadly back toward nottingham take up think after think in turn feel around the edge of each but find in every one some flaw at last he think of the daring soul of jolly robin and how as he the sheriff know he often come even within the wall of nottingham now think the sheriff could i but persuade robin nigh to nottingham town so that i could find he i warrant i would lay hand upon he so stoutly that he would never get away again then of a sudden it come to he like a flash that be he to proclaim a great shooting match and offer some grand prize robin hood might be overpersuade by he spirit to come to the butt and it be this thought which cause he to cry aha and smite he palm upon he thigh so as soon as he have return safely to nottingham he send messenger north and south and east and west to proclaim through town hamlet and countryside this grand shooting match and everyone be bid that could draw a longbow and the prize be to be a arrow of pure beaten gold when robin hood first hear the news of this he be in lincoln town and hasten back to sherwood forest he soon call all he merry man about he and speak to they thus : now hearken my merry man all to the news that i have bring from lincoln town today we friend the sheriff of nottingham have proclaim a shooting match and have send messenger to tell of it through all the countryside and the prize be to be a bright golden arrow now i fain would have one of we win it both because of the fairness of the prize and because we sweet friend the sheriff have offer it so we will take we bow and shaft and go there to shoot for i know right well that merriment will be a-going what say ye lad then young david of doncaster speak up and say now listen i pray thee good master unto what i say i have come straight from we friend eadom o ' the blue boar and there i hear the full news of this same match but master i know from he and he get it from the sheriff 's man ralph o ' the scar that this same knavish sheriff have but lay a trap for thee in this shooting match and wish nothing so much as to see thee there so go not good master for i know right well he doth seek to beguile thee but stay within the greenwood lest we all meet dole and woe now quoth robin thou art a wise lad and keepest thine ear open and thy mouth shut as becometh a wise and crafty woodsman but shall we let it be say that the sheriff of nottingham do cow bold robin hood and sevenscore as fair archer as be in all merry england nay good david what thou tellest I maketh I to desire the prize even more than i else should do but what sayeth we good gossip swanthold be it not ' a hasty man burneth he mouth and the fool that keepeth he eye shut falleth into the pit ' thus he say truly therefore we must meet guile with guile now some of you clothe yourselve as curtal friar and some as rustic peasant and some as tinker or as beggar but see that each man taketh a good bow or broadsword in case need should arise as for myself i will shoot for this same golden arrow and should i win it we will hang it to the branch of we good greenwood tree for the joy of all the band how like you the plan my merry man all then good good cry all the band right heartily a fair sight be nottingham town on the day of the shooting match all along upon the green meadow beneath the town wall stretch a row of bench one above the other which be for

many-colored flag and streamer in this booth be cask of ale free to be broach by any of the archer who might wish to quench they thirst across the range from where the seat for the better folk be raise be a railing to keep the poorer people from crowd in front of the target already while it be early the bench be begin to fill with people of quality who keep constantly arrive in little cart or upon palfrey that curvet gaily to the merry tinkle of silver bell at bridle rein with these come also the poorer folk who sit or lay upon the green grass near the railing that keep they from off the range in the great tent the archer be gather by two and three some talk loudly of the fair shot each man have make in he day some look well to they bow draw a string betwixt the finger to see that there be no fray upon it or inspect arrow shut one eye and peer down a shaft to see that it be not warped but straight and true for neither bow nor shaft should fail at such a time and for such a prize and never be such a company of yeoman as be gather at nottingham town that day for the very best archer of merry england have come to this shooting match there be gill o ' the red cap the sheriff 's own head archer and diccon cruikshank of lincoln town and adam o ' the dell a man of tamworth of threescore year and more yet hale and lusty still who in he time have shoot in the famous match at woodstock and have there beat that renowned archer clym o ' the clough and many more famous man of the longbow be there whose name have be hand down to we in goodly ballad of the olden time but now all the bench be fill with guest lord and lady burgher and dame when at last the sheriff himself come with he lady he ride with stately mien upon he milk-white horse and she upon she brown filly upon he head he wear a purple velvet cap and purple velvet be he robe all trim about with rich ermine he jerkin and hose be of sea-green silk and he shoe of black velvet the pointed toe fasten to he garter with golden chain a golden chain hang about he neck and at he collar be a great carbuncle set in red gold he lady be dress in blue velvet all trim with swan 's down so they make a gallant sight as they ride along side by side and all the people shout from where they crowd across the space from the gentlefolk so the sheriff and he lady come to they place where man-at-arms with hauberk and spear stand about wait for they then when the sheriff and he dame have sit down he bid he herald wind upon he silver horn who thereupon sound three blast that come echo cheerily back from the gray wall of nottingham then the archer step forth to they place while all the folk shout with a mighty voice each man call upon he favorite yeoman red cap cry some cruikshank cry other hey for william o ' leslie shout other yet again while lady wave silken scarf to urge each yeoman to do he best then the herald stand forth and loudly proclaim the rule of the game as follow : shoot each man from yon mark which be sevenscore yard and ten from the target one arrow shooteth each man first and from all the archer shall the ten that shooteth the fairest shaft be choose for to shoot again two arrow shooteth each man of these ten then shall the three that shoot the fairest shaft be choose for to shoot again three arrow shooteth each man of those three and to he that shooteth the fairest shaft shall the prize be give then the sheriff lean forward look keenly among the press of archer to find whether robin hood be among they but no one be there clothe in lincoln green such as be worn by robin and he band nevertheless say the sheriff to himself he may still be there and i miss he among the crowd of other man but let I see when but ten man shoot for i wot he will be among the ten or i know he not and now the archer shoot each man in turn and the good folk never see such archery as be do that day six arrow be within the clout four within the black and only two smite the outer ring so that when the last arrow speed and strike the target all the people shout aloud for it be noble shooting and now but ten man be leave of all those that have shoot before and of these ten six be famous throughout the land and most of the folk gather there know they these six man be gilbert o ' the red cap adam o ' the dell diccon cruikshank william o ' leslie hubert o ' cloud and swithin o ' hertford two other be yeoman of merry yorkshire another be a tall stranger in blue who say he come from london town and the last be a tattered stranger in scarlet who wear a patch over one eye now quoth the sheriff to a man-at-arms who stand near he seest thou robin hood among those ten nay that do i not you worship answer the man six of they i know right well of those yorkshire yeoman one be too tall and the other too short for that bold knave robin 's beard be as yellow as gold while yon tattered beggar in scarlet have a beard of brown besides be blind of one eye as for the stranger in blue robin 's shoulder i ween be three inch broader than he then quoth the sheriff smite he thigh angrily yon knave be a coward as well as a rogue and dare not show he face among good man and true then after they have rest a short time those ten stout man step forth to shoot again each man shoot two arrow and as they shoot not a word be speak but all the crowd watch with scarce a breath of sound but when the last have shoot he arrow another great shout arise while many cast they cap aloft for joy of such marvelous shooting now by we gracious lady fair quoth old sir amya o ' the dell who bow with fourscore year and more sit near the sheriff ne'er see i such archery in all my life before yet have i see the best hand at the longbow for threescore year and more and now but three man be leave of all those that have shoot before one be gill o ' the red cap one the tattered stranger in scarlet and one adam o ' the dell of tamworth town then all the people call aloud some cry ho for gilbert o ' the red cap and some hey for stout adam o ' tamworth but not a single man in the crowd call upon the stranger in scarlet now shoot thou well gilbert cry the sheriff and if thine be the best shaft fivescore broad silver penny will i give to thee beside the prize truly i will do my best quoth gilbert right sturdily a man can not do aught but he best but that will i strive to do this day so say he draw forth a fair smooth arrow with a broad feather and fit it deftly to the string then draw he bow with care he speed the shaft straight fly the arrow and light fairly in the clout a finger 's - breadth from the center a gilbert a gilbert shout all the crowd and now by my faith cry the sheriff smite he hand together that be a shrewd shot then the tattered stranger step forth and all the people laugh as they see a yellow patch that show beneath he arm when he raise he elbow to shoot and also to see he aim with but one eye he draw the good yew bow quickly and quickly loose a shaft so short be the time that no man could draw a breath betwixt the drawing and the shooting yet he arrow lodge nearer the center than the other by twice the length of a barleycorn now by all the saint in paradise cry the sheriff that be a lovely shaft in very truth then adam o ' the dell shot carefully and cautiously and he arrow lodge close beside the stranger 's then after a short space they all three shot again and once more each arrow lodge within the clout but this time adam o ' the dell 's be farthest from the center and again the tattered stranger 's shot be the best then after another time of rest they all shot for the third time this time gilbert take great heed to he aim keenly measure the distance and shooting with shrewdest care straight fly the arrow and all shout till the very flag that wave in the breeze shake with the sound and the rook and daw fly clamor about the roof of the old gray tower for the shaft have lodge close beside the spot that mark the very center well do gilbert cry the sheriff right joyously fain be i to believe the prize be thine and right fairly win now thou ragged knave let I see thee shoot a better shaft than that nought spake the stranger but take he place while all be hushed and no one speak or even seem to breathe so great be the silence for wonder what he would do meanwhile also quite still stand the stranger hold he bow in he hand while one could count five then he draw he trusty yew hold it draw but a moment then loose the string straight fly the arrow and so true that it smite a gray goose feather from off gilbert 's shaft which fall flutter through the sunlit air as the stranger 's arrow lodge close beside he of the red cap and in the very center no one speak a word for a while and no one shout but each man look into he neighbor 's face amazedly nay quoth old adam o ' the dell presently draw a long breath and shake he head as he speak twoscore year and more have i shoot shaft and maybe not all time bad but i shoot no more this day for no man can match with yon stranger whosoe'er he may be then he thrust he shaft into he quiver rattle and unstring he bow without another word then the sheriff come down from he dais and draw near in all he silk and velvet to where the tattered stranger stand lean upon he stout bow while the good folk crowd around to see the man who shoot so wondrously well here good fellow quoth the sheriff take thou the prize and well and fairly hast thou win it i bow what may be thy name and whence comest thou man do call I jock o ' teviotdale and thence be i come say the stranger then by we lady jock thou art the fairest archer that e'er mine eye behold and if thou wilt join my service i will clothe thee with a better coat than that thou hast upon thy back thou shalt eat and drink of the best and at every christmastide fourscore mark shall be thy wage i trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave robin hood that dare not show he face here this day say good fellow wilt thou join my service nay that will i not quoth the stranger roughly i will be mine own and no man in all merry england shall be my master then get thee go and a murrain seize thee cry the sheriff and he voice tremble with anger and by my faith and troth i have a good part of a mind to have thee beat for thine insolence then he turn upon he heel and stride away it be a right motley company that gather about the noble greenwood tree in sherwood 's depths that same day a score and more of barefoot friar be there and some that look like tinker and some that seem to be sturdy beggar and rustic hind and seat upon a mossy couch be one all clothe in tattered scarlet with a patch over one eye and in he hand he hold the golden arrow that be the prize of the great shooting match then amidst a noise of talk and laughter he take the patch from off he eye and strip away the scarlet rag from off he body and show himself all clothe in fair lincoln green and quoth he easy come these thing away but walnut stain cometh not so speedily from yellow hair then all laugh louder than before for it be robin hood himself that have win the prize from the sheriff 's very hand then all sit down to the woodland feast and talk among themselves of the merry jest that have be play upon the sheriff and of the adventure that have befall each member of the band in he disguise but when the feast be do robin hood take little john apart and say truly be i vexed in my blood for i hear the sheriff say today ` thou shootest better than that coward knave robin hood that dare not show he face here this day ' i would fain let he know who it be who win the golden arrow from out he hand and also that i be no coward such as he take I to be then little john say good master take thou I and will stutely and we will send yon fat sheriff news of all this by a messenger such as he doth not expect that day the sheriff sit at meat in the great hall of he house at nottingham town long table stand down the hall at which sit men-at - arm and household servant and good stout villain -lrb- bond-servant -rrb- in all fourscore and more there they talk of the day 's shooting as they eat they meat and quaff they ale the sheriff sit at the head of the table upon a raise seat under a canopy and beside he sit he dame by my troth say he i do reckon full roundly that that knave robin hood would be at the game today i do not think that he be such a coward but who could that saucy knave be who answer I to my beard so bravely i wonder that i do not have he beat but there be something about he that speak of other thing than rag and tatters then even as he finish speak something fall rattle among the dish on the table while those that sit near start up wonder what it might be after a while one of the men-at-arms gather courage enough to pick it up and bring it to the sheriff then everyone see that it be a blunt gray goose shaft with a fine scroll about the thickness of a goose quill tie near to its head the sheriff open the scroll and glance at it while the vein upon he forehead swell and he cheek grow ruddy with rage as he read for this be what he see : _ now heaven bless thy grace this day say all in sweet sherwood for thou didst give the prize away to merry robin hood _ whence come this cry the sheriff in a mighty voice even through the window you worship quoth the man who have hand the shaft to he will stutely rescue by he companion now when the sheriff find that neither law nor guile could overcome robin hood he be much perplexed and say to himself fool that i be have i not tell we king of robin hood i would not have get myself into such a coil but now i must either take he captive or have wrath visit upon my head from he most gracious majesty i have try law and i have try guile and i have fail in both so i will try what may be do with might thus commune within himself he call he constable together and tell they what be in he mind now take ye each four man all arm in proof say he and get ye go to the forest at different point and lie in wait for this same robin hood but if any constable find too many man against he let he sound a horn and then let each band within hear come with all speed and join the party that call they thus i think shall we take this green-clad knave furthermore to he that first meeteth with robin hood shall one hundred pound of silver money be give if he be bring to I dead or alive and to he that meeteth with any of he band shall twoscore pound be give if such be bring to I dead or alive so be ye bold and be ye crafty so thus they go in threescore company of five to sherwood forest to take robin hood each constable wish that he might be the one to find the bold outlaw or at least one of he band for seven day and night they hunt through the forest glade but never see so much as a single man in lincoln green for tiding of all this have be bring to robin hood by trusty eadom o ' the blue boar when he first hear the news robin say if the sheriff dare send force to meet force woe will it be for he and many a better man besides for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all but fain would i shun blood and battle and fain would i not deal sorrow to womenfolk and wife because good stout yeoman lose they life once i slew a man and never do i wish to slay a man again for it be bitter for the soul to think thereon so now we will abide silently in sherwood forest so that it may be well for all but should we be force to defend ourselves or any of we band then let each man draw bow and brand with might and main at this speech many of the band shake they head and say to themselves now the sheriff will think that we be coward and folk will scoff throughout the countryside say that we fear to meet these man but they say nothing aloud swallow they word and do as robin bid they thus they hide in the depths of sherwood forest for seven day and seven night and never show they face abroad in all that time but early in the morning of the eighth day robin hood call the band together and say now who will go and find what the sheriff 's man be at by this time for i know right well they will not bide forever within sherwood shades at this a great shout arise and each man wave he bow aloft and cry that he might be the one to go then robin hood 's heart be proud when he look around on he stout brave fellow and he say brave and true be ye all my merry man and a right stout band of good fellow be ye but ye can not all go so i will choose one from among you and it shall be good will stutely for he be as sly as e'er a old dog fox in sherwood forest then will stutely leap high aloft and laugh loudly clap he hand for pure joy that he should have be choose from among they all now thanks good master quoth he and if i bring not news of those knave to thee call I no more thy sly will stutely then he clothe himself in a friar 's gown and underneath the robe he hang a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hand upon it thus clothe he set forth upon he quest until he come to the verge of the forest and so to the highway he see two band of the sheriff 's man yet he turn neither to the right nor the left but only draw he cowl the closer over he face folding he hand as if in meditation so at last he come to the sign of the blue boar for quoth he to himself we good friend eadom will tell I all the news at the sign of the blue boar he find a band of the sheriff man drink right lustily so without speak to anyone he sit down upon a distant bench he staff in he hand and he head bow forward as though he be meditate thus he sit wait until he might see the landlord apart and eadom do not know he but think he to be some poor tired friar so he let he sit without say a word to he or molest he though he like not the cloth for say he to himself it be a hard heart that kick the lame dog from off the sill as stutely sit thus there come a great house cat and rub against he knee raise he robe a palm 's - breadth high stutely push he robe quickly down again but the constable who command the sheriff man see what have pass and saw also fair lincoln green beneath the friar 's robe he say nothing at the time but commune within himself in this wise : yon be no friar of order gray and also i wot no honest yeoman goeth about in priest 's garb nor doth a thief go so for nought now i think in good sooth that be one of robin hood 's own man so presently he say aloud o holy father wilt thou not take a good pot of march beer to slake thy thirsty soul withal but stutely shake he head silently for he say to himself maybe there be those here who know my voice then the constable say again whither goest thou holy friar upon this hot summer 's day i go a pilgrim to canterbury town answer will stutely speak gruffly so that none might know he voice then the constable say for the third time now tell I holy father do pilgrim to canterbury wear good lincoln green beneath they robe ha by my faith i take thee to be some lusty thief and perhaps one of robin hood 's own band now by we lady 's grace if thou movest hand or foot i will run thee through the body with my sword then he flash forth he bright sword and leap upon will stutely think he would take he unaware but stutely have he own sword tightly hold in he hand beneath he robe so he draw it forth before the constable come upon he then the stout constable strike a mighty blow but he strike no more in all that fight for stutely parry the blow right deftly smite the constable back again with all he might then he would have escape but could not for the other all dizzy with the wound and with the flow blood seize he by the knee with he arm even as he reel and fall then the other rush upon he and stutely strike again at another of the sheriff 's man but the steel cap glance the blow and though the blade bit deep it do not kill meanwhile the constable fainting as he be draw stutely downward and the other see the yeoman hamper so rush upon he again and one smite he a blow upon the crown so that the blood run down he face and blind he then stagger he fall and all spring upon he though he struggle so manfully that they could hardly hold he fast then they bind he with stout hempen cord so that he could not move either hand or foot and thus they overcome he robin hood stand under the greenwood tree thinking of will stutely and how he might be fare when suddenly he see two of he stout yeoman come run down the forest path and betwixt they run buxom maken of the blue boar then robin 's heart fall for he know they be the bearer of ill tiding will stutely have be take cry they when they have come to where he stand and be it thou that hast bring such doleful news say robin to the lass ay marry for i see it all cry she pant as the hare pants when it have escape the hound and i fear he be wound sore for one smite he main shrewdly i ' the crown they have bind he and take he to nottingham town and ere i leave the blue boar i hear that he should be hang tomorrow day he shall not be hang tomorrow day cry robin or if he be full many a one shall gnaw the sod and many shall have cause to cry alack-a - day then he clap he horn to he lip and blow three blast right loudly and presently he good yeoman come run through the greenwood until sevenscore bold blade be gather around he now hark you all cry robin we dear companion will stutely have be take by that vile sheriff 's man therefore doth it behoove we to take bow and brand in hand to bring he off again for i wot that we ought to risk life and limb for he as he have risk life and limb for we be it not so my merry man all then all cry ay with a great voice so the next day they all wend they way from sherwood forest but by different path for it behoove they to be very crafty so the band separate into party of two and three which be all to meet again in a tangled dell that lay near to nottingham town then when they have all gather together at the place of meeting robin speak to they thus : now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news for it doth behoove we to be cunning and wary if we would bring we friend will stutely off from the sheriff 's clutch so they lay hide a long time until the sun stand high in the sky the day be warm and the dusty road be bare of traveler except a aged palmer who walk slowly along the highroad that lead close beside the gray castle wall of nottingham town when robin see that no other wayfarer be within sight he call young david of doncaster who be a shrewd man for he year and say to he now get thee forth young david and speak to yonder palmer that walk beside the town wall for he have come but now from nottingham town and may tell thee news of good stutely perchance so david stride forth and when he come up to the pilgrim he salute he and say good morrow holy father and canst thou tell I when will stutely will be hang upon the gallows tree i fain would not miss the sight for i have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hang now out upon thee young man cry the palmer that thou shouldst speak so when a good stout man be to be hang for nothing but guard he own life and he strike he staff upon the ground in anger alas say i that this thing should be for even this day toward evening when the sun falleth low he shall be hang fourscore rod from the great town gate of nottingham where three road meet for there the sheriff sweareth he shall die as a warn to all outlaw in nottinghamshire but yet i say again alas for though robin hood and he band may be outlaw yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong and the dishonest man while there be not a poor widow nor a peasant with many child nigh to sherwood but have barley flour enough all the year long through he it grieve my heart to see one as gallant as this stutely die for i have be a good saxon yeoman in my day ere i turn palmer and well i know a stout hand and one that smiteth shrewdly at a cruel norman or a proud abbot with fat moneybags have good stutely 's master but know how he man be compass about with peril perchance he might send succor to bring he out of the hand of he enemy ay marry that be true cry the young man if robin and he man be nigh this place i wot right well they will strive to bring he forth from he peril but fare thee well thou good old man and believe I if will stutely die he shall be right well avenge then he turn and stride rapidly away but the palmer look after he mutter i wot that youth be no country hind that have come to see a good man die well well perchance robin hood be not so far away but that there will be stout doings this day so he go upon he way mutter to himself when david of doncaster tell robin hood what the palmer have say to he robin call the band around he and speak to they thus : now let we get straightway into nottingham town and mix ourselves with the people there but keep ye one another in sight press as near the prisoner and he guard as ye can when they come outside the wall strike no man without need for i would fain avoid bloodshed but if ye do strike strike hard and see that there be no need to strike again then keep all together until we come again to sherwood and let no man leave he fellow the sun be low in the western sky when a bugle note sound from the castle wall then all be bustle in nottingham town and crowd fill the street for all know that the famous will stutely be to be hang that day presently the castle gate open wide and a great array of man-at-arms come forth with noise and clatter the sheriff all clothe in shine mail of link chain ride at they head in the midst of all the guard in a cart with a halter about he neck ride will stutely he face be pale with he wound and with loss of blood like the moon in broad daylight and he fair hair be clot in point upon he forehead where the blood have harden when he come forth from the castle he look up and he look down but though he see some face that show pity and some that show friendliness he see none that he know then he heart sink within he like a plummet of lead but nevertheless he speak up boldly give a sword into my hand sir sheriff say he and wound man though i be i will fight thee and all thy man till life and strength be go nay thou naughty varlet quoth the sheriff turn he head and look right grimly upon will stutely thou shalt have no sword but shall die a mean death as beseemeth a vile thief like thee then do but untie my hand and i will fight thee and thy man with no weapon but only my naked fist i crave no weapon but let I not be meanly hang this day then the sheriff laugh aloud why how now quoth he be thy proud stomach quail shrive thyself thou vile knave for i mean that thou shalt hang this day and that where three road meet so that all man shall see thee hang for carrion crow and daw to peck at o thou dastard heart cry will stutely gnash he tooth at the sheriff thou coward hind if ever my good master meet thee thou shalt pay dearly for this day 's work he doth scorn thee and so do all brave heart knowest thou not that thou and thy name be jest upon the lip of every brave yeoman such a one as thou art thou wretched craven will never be able to subdue bold robin hood ha cry the sheriff in a rage be it even so be i a jest with thy master as thou callest he now i will make a jest of thee and a sorry jest withal for i will quarter thee limb from limb after thou art hang then he spur he horse forward and say no more to stutely at last they come to the great town gate through which stutely see the fair country beyond with hill and dale all clothe in verdure and far away the dusky line of sherwood 's skirt then when he see the slanting sunlight lie on field and fallow shine redly here and there on cot and farmhouse and when he hear the sweet bird sing they vespers and the sheep bleat upon the hillside and behold the swallow fly in the bright air there come a great fullness to he heart so that all thing blur to he sight through salt tear and he bow he head lest the folk should think he unmanly when they see the tear in he eye thus he keep he head bow till they have pass through the gate and be outside the wall of the town but when he look up again he feel he heart leap within he and then stand still for pure joy for he see the face of one of he own dear companion of merry sherwood then glance quickly around he see well-known face upon all side of he crowd closely upon the man-at-arms who be guard he then of a sudden the blood spring to he cheek for he see for a moment he own good master in the press and see he know that robin hood and all he band be there yet betwixt he and they be a line of man-at-arms now stand back cry the sheriff in a mighty voice for the crowd press around on all side what mean ye varlet that ye push upon we so stand back i say then come a bustle and a noise and one strove to push between the man - at-arm so as to reach the cart and stutely see that it be little john that make all that stir now stand thou back cry one of the man-at-arms whom little john push with he elbow now stand thou back thine own self quoth little john and straightway smite the man a buffet beside he head that fell he as a butcher fell a ox and then he leap to the cart where stutely sit i pray thee take leave of thy friend ere thou diest will quoth he or maybe i will die with thee if thou must die for i could never have better company then with one stroke he cut the bond that bind the other 's arm and leg and stutely leap straightway from the cart now as i live cry the sheriff yon varlet i know right well be a sturdy rebel take he i bid you all and let he not go so say he spur he horse upon little john and rise in he stirrup smite with might and main but little john duck quickly underneath the horse 's belly and the blow whistle harmlessly over he head nay good sir sheriff cry he leap up again when the blow have pass i must e ` en borrow thy most worshipful sword thereupon he twitch the weapon deftly from out the sheriff 's hand here stutely he cry the sheriff have lend thee he sword back to back with I man and defend thyself for help be nigh down with they bellow the sheriff in a voice like a angry bull and he spur he horse upon the two who now stand back to back forget in he rage that he have no weapon with which to defend himself stand back sheriff cry little john and even as he speak a bugle horn sound shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistle within a inch of the sheriff 's head then come a sway hither and thither and oath cry and groan and clashing of steel and sword flash in the setting sun and a score of arrow whistle through the air and some cry help help and some a rescue a rescue treason cry the sheriff in a loud voice bear back bear back else we be all dead man thereupon he rein he horse backward through the thickest of the crowd now robin hood and he band might have slay half of the sheriff 's man have they desire to do so but they let they push out of the press and get they go only send a bunch of arrow after they to hurry they in they flight oh stay shout will stutely after the sheriff thou wilt never catch bold robin hood if thou dost not stand to meet he face to face but the sheriff bow along he horse 's back make no answer but only spur the faster then will stutely turn to little john and look he in the face till the tear run down from he eye and he weep aloud and kiss he friend 's cheek o little john quoth he mine own true friend and he that i love better than man or woman in all the world beside little do i reckon to see thy face this day or to meet thee this side paradise little john could make no answer but weep also then robin hood gather he band together in a close rank with will stutely in the midst and thus they move slowly away toward sherwood and be go as a storm cloud move away from the spot where a tempest have sweep the land but they leave ten of the sheriff 's man lie along the ground wound -- some more some less -- yet no one know who smite they down thus the sheriff of nottingham try thrice to take robin hood and fail each time and the last time he be frighten for he feel how near he have come to lose he life so he say these man fear neither god nor man nor king nor king 's officer i would sooner lose mine office than my life so i will trouble they no more so he keep close within he castle for many a day and dare not show he face outside of he own household and all the time he be gloomy and would speak to no one for he be ashamed of what have happen that day robin hood turn butcher now after all these thing have happen and it become know to robin hood how the sheriff have try three time to make he captive he say to himself if i have the chance i will make we worshipful sheriff pay right well for that which he have do to I maybe i may bring he some time into sherwood forest and have he to a right merry feast with we for when robin hood catch a baron or a squire or a fat abbot or bishop he bring they to the greenwood tree and feast they before he lighten they purse but in the meantime robin hood and he band live quietly in sherwood forest without show they face abroad for robin know that it would not be wise for he to be see in the neighborhood of nottingham those in authority be very wroth with he but though they do not go abroad they live a merry life within the woodland spend the day in shooting at garland hang upon a willow wand at the end of the glade the leafy aisle ring with merry jest and laughter : for whoever miss the garland be give a sound buffet which if deliver by little john never fail to topple over the unfortunate yeoman then they have bout of wrestling and of cudgel play so that every day they gain in skill and strength thus they dwell for nearly a year and in that time robin hood often turn over in he mind many means of make a even score with the sheriff at last he begin to fret at he confinement so one day he take up he stout cudgel and set forth to seek adventure stroll blithely along until he come to the edge of sherwood there as he ramble along the sunlit road he meet a lusty young butcher drive a fine mare and ride in a stout new cart all hang about with meat merrily whistle the butcher as he jog along for he be go to the market and the day be fresh and sweet make he heart blithe within he good morrow to thee jolly fellow quoth robin thou seemest happy this merry morn ay that be i quoth the jolly butcher and why should i not be so be i not hale in wind and limb have i not the bonniest lass in all nottinghamshire and lastly be i not to be marry to she on Thursday next in sweet locksley town ha say robin comest thou from locksley town well do i know that fair place for mile about and well do i know each hedgerow and gentle pebbly stream and even all the bright little fish therein for there i be bear and breed now where goest thou with thy meat my fair friend i go to the market at nottingham town to sell my beef and my mutton answer the butcher but who art thou that comest from locksley town a yeoman be i and man do call I robin hood now by we lady 's grace cry the butcher well do i know thy name and many a time have i hear thy deed both sing and speak of but heaven forbid that thou shouldst take aught of I a honest man be i and have wrong neither man nor maid so trouble I not good master as i have never trouble thee nay heaven forbid indeed quoth robin that i should take from such as thee jolly fellow not so much as one farthing would i take from thee for i love a fair saxon face like thine right well -- more especially when it cometh from locksley town and most especially when the man that owneth it be to marry a bonny lass on Thursday next but come tell I for what price thou wilt sell I all of thy meat and thy horse and cart at four mark do i value meat cart and mare quoth the butcher but if i do not sell all my meat i will not have four mark in value then robin hood pluck the purse from he girdle and quoth he here in this purse be six mark now i would fain be a butcher for the day and sell my meat in nottingham town wilt thou close a bargain with I and take six mark for thine outfit now may the blessing of all the saint fall on thine honest head cry the butcher right joyfully as he leap down from he cart and take the purse that robin hold out to he nay quoth robin laugh loudly many do like I and wish I well but few call I honest now get thee go back to thy lass and give she a sweet kiss from I so say he don the butcher 's apron and climb into the cart he take the rein in he hand and drive off through the forest to nottingham town when he come to nottingham he enter that part of the market where butcher stand and take up he inn -lrb- stand for selling -rrb- in the best place he could find next he open he stall and spread he meat upon the bench then take he cleaver and steel and clatter they together he troll aloud in merry tone : now come ye lass and eke ye dame and buy you meat from I for three pennyworth of meat i sell for the charge of one penny lamb have i that have feed upon nought but the dainty dame pie and the violet sweet and the daffodil that grow fair stream beside and beef have i from the heathery word and mutton from dale all green and veal as white as a maiden 's brow with its mother 's milk i ween then come ye lass and eke ye dame come buy you meat from I for three pennyworth of meat i sell for the charge of one penny thus he sing blithely while all who stand near listen amazedly then when he have finish he clatter the steel and cleaver still more loudly shout lustily now who 'll buy who 'll buy four fixed price have i three pennyworth of meat i sell to a fat friar or priest for sixpence for i want not they custom stout alderman i charge threepence for it doth not matter to I whether they buy or not to buxom dame i sell three pennyworth of meat for one penny for i like they custom well but to the bonny lass that have a liking for a good tight butcher i charge nought but one fair kiss for i like she custom the best of all then all begin to stare and wonder and crowd around laugh for never be such selling hear of in all nottingham town but when they come to buy they find it as he have say for he give goodwife or dame as much meat for one penny as they could buy elsewhere for three and when a widow or a poor woman come to he he give she flesh for nothing but when a merry lass come and give he a kiss he charge not one penny for he meat and many such come to he stall for he eye be as blue as the sky of June and he laugh merrily give to each full measure thus he sell he meat so fast that no butcher that stand near he could sell anything then they begin to talk among themselves and some say this must be some thief who have steal cart horse and meat but other say nay when do ye ever see a thief who part with he goods so freely and merrily this must be some prodigal who have sell he father 's land and would fain live merrily while the money last and these latter be the greater number the other come round one by one to they way of think then some of the butcher come to he to make he acquaintance come brother quoth one who be the head of they all we be all of one trade so wilt thou go dine with we for this day the sheriff have ask all the butcher guild to feast with he at the guild hall there will be stout fare and much to drink and that thou likest or i much mistake thee now beshrew he heart quoth jolly robin that would deny a butcher and moreover i will go dine with you all my sweet lad and that as fast as i can hie whereupon have sell all he meat he close he stall and go with they to the great guild hall there the sheriff have already come in state and with he many butcher when robin and those that be with he come in all laugh at some merry jest he have be tell they those that be near the sheriff whisper to he yon be a right mad blade for he have sell more meat for one penny this day than we could sell for three and to whatsoever merry lass give he a kiss he give meat for nought and other say he be some prodigal that have sell he land for silver and gold and meaneth to spend all right merrily then the sheriff call robin to he not know he in he butcher 's dress and make he sit close to he on he right hand for he love a rich young prodigal -- especially when he think that he might lighten that prodigal 's pocket into he own most worshipful purse so he make much of robin and laugh and talk with he more than with any of the other at last the dinner be ready to be serve and the sheriff bid robin say grace so robin stand up and say now heaven bless we all and eke good meat and good sack within this house and may all butcher be and remain as honest man as i be at this all laugh the sheriff loudest of all for he say to himself surely this be indeed some prodigal and perchance i may empty he purse of some of the money that the fool throweth about so freely then he speak aloud to robin say thou art a jolly young blade and i love thee mightily and he smite robin upon the shoulder then robin laugh loudly too yea quoth he i know thou dost love a jolly blade for didst thou not have jolly robin hood at thy shooting match and didst thou not gladly give he a bright golden arrow for he own at this the sheriff look grave and all the guild of butcher too so that none laugh but robin only some wink slyly at each other come fill we some sack cry robin let we e'er be merry while we may for man be but dust and he have but a span to live here till the worm getteth he as we good gossip swanthold sayeth so let life be merry while it last say i nay never look down i ' the mouth sir sheriff who knowest but that thou mayest catch robin hood yet if thou drinkest less good sack and malmsey and bringest down the fat about thy paunch and the dust from out thy brain be merry man then the sheriff laugh again but not as though he like the jest while the butcher say one to another before heaven never have we see such a mad rollick blade mayhap though he will make the sheriff mad how now brother cry robin be merry nay never count over you farthing for by this and by that i will pay this shot myself e ` en though it cost two hundred pound so let no man draw up he lip nor thrust he forefinger into he purse for i swear that neither butcher nor sheriff shall pay one penny for this feast now thou art a right merry soul quoth the sheriff and i wot thou must have many a head of horned beast and many a acre of land that thou dost spend thy money so freely ay that have i quoth robin laugh loudly again five hundred and more horned beast have i and my brother and none of they have we be able to sell else i might not have turn butcher as for my land i have never ask my steward how many acre i have at this the sheriff 's eye twinkle and he chuckle to himself nay good youth quoth he if thou canst not sell thy cattle it may be i will find a man that will lift they from thy hand perhaps that man may be myself for i love a merry youth and would help such a one along the path of life now how much dost thou want for thy horn cattle well quoth robin they be worth at least five hundred pound nay answer the sheriff slowly and as if he be think within himself well do i love thee and fain would i help thee along but five hundred pound in money be a good round sum besides i have it not by I yet i will give thee three hundred pound for they all and that in good hard silver and gold now thou old miser quoth robin well thou knowest that so many horn cattle be worth seven hundred pound and more and even that be but small for they and yet thou with thy gray hair and one foot in the grave wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth at this the sheriff look grimly at robin nay quoth robin look not on I as though thou hadst sour beer in thy mouth man i will take thine offer for i and my brother do need the money we lead a merry life and no one lead a merry life for a farthing so i will close the bargain with thee but mind that thou bringest a good three hundred pound with thee for i trust not one that driveth so shrewd a bargain i will bring the money say the sheriff but what be thy name good youth man call I robert o ' locksley quoth bold robin then good robert o ' locksley quoth the sheriff i will come this day to see thy horned beast but first my clerk shall draw up a paper in which thou shalt be bind to the sale for thou gettest not my money without i get thy beast in return then robin hood laugh again so be it he say smite he palm upon the sheriff 's hand truly my brother will be thankful to thee for thy money thus the bargain be close but many of the butcher talk among themselves of the sheriff say that it be but a scurvy trick to beguile a poor spendthrift youth in this way the afternoon have come when the sheriff mount he horse and join robin hood who stand outside the gateway of the paved court wait for he for he have sell he horse and cart to a trader for two mark then they set forth upon they way the sheriff ride upon he horse and robin run beside he thus they leave nottingham town and travel forward along the dusty highway laughing and jest together as though they have be old friend but all the time the sheriff say within himself thy jest to I of robin hood shall cost thee dear good fellow even four hundred pound thou fool for he think he would make at least that much by he bargain so they journey onward till they come within the verge of sherwood forest when presently the sheriff look up and down and to the right and to the left of he and then grow quiet and cease he laughter now quoth he may heaven and its saint preserve we this day from a rogue man call robin hood then robin laugh aloud nay say he thou mayst set thy mind at rest for well do i know robin hood and well do i know that thou art in no more danger from he this day than thou art from I at this the sheriff look askance at robin say to himself i like not that thou seemest so well acquaint with this bold outlaw and i wish that i be well out of sherwood forest but still they travel deeper into the forest shades and the deeper they go the more quiet grow the sheriff at last they come to where the road take a sudden bend and before they a herd of dun deer go trip across the path then robin hood come close to the sheriff and point he finger he say these be my horned beast good master sheriff how dost thou like they be they not fat and fair to see at this the sheriff draw rein quickly now fellow quoth he i would i be well out of this forest for i like not thy company go thou thine own path good friend and let I but go mine but robin only laugh and catch the sheriff 's bridle rein nay cry he stay awhile for i would thou shouldst see my brother who own these fair horned beast with I so say he clap he bugle to he mouth and wind three merry note and presently up the path come leap fivescore good stout yeoman with little john at they head what wouldst thou have good master quoth little john why answer robin dost thou not see that i have bring goodly company to feast with we today fye for shame do you not see we good and worshipful master the sheriff of nottingham take thou he bridle little john for he have honor we today by come to feast with we then all doff they hat humbly without smile or seem to be in jest while little john take the bridle rein and lead the palfrey still deeper into the forest all march in order with robin hood walk beside the sheriff hat in hand all this time the sheriff say never a word but only look about he like one suddenly awaken from sleep but when he find himself go within the very depths of sherwood he heart sink within he for he think surely my three hundred pound will be take from I even if they take not my life itself for i have plot against they life more than once but all seem humble and meek and not a word be say of danger either to life or money so at last they come to that part of sherwood forest where a noble oak spread its branch wide and beneath it be a seat all make of moss on which robin sit down place the sheriff at he right hand now busk ye my merry man all quoth he and bring forth the best we have both of meat and wine for he worship the sheriff have feast I in nottingham guild hall today and i would not have he go back empty all this time nothing have be say of the sheriff 's money so presently he begin to pluck up heart for say he to himself maybe robin hood have forget all about it then while beyond in the forest bright fire crackle and savory smell of sweetly roast venison and fat capon fill the glade and brown pasty warm beside the blaze do robin hood entertain the sheriff right royally first several couple stand forth at quarterstaff and so shrewd be they at the game and so quickly do they give stroke and parry that the sheriff who love to watch all lusty sport of the kind clap he hand forget where he be and cry aloud well strike well strike thou fellow with the black beard little know that the man he call upon be the tinker that try to serve he warrant upon robin hood then several yeoman come forward and spread cloth upon the green grass and place a royal feast while other still broach barrel of sack and malmsey and good stout ale and set they in jar upon the cloth with drinking horn about they then all sit down and feast and drink merrily together until the sun be low and the half-moon glimmer with a pale light betwixt the leaf of the tree overhead then the sheriff arise and say i thank you all good yeoman for the merry entertainment ye have give I this day right courteously have ye use I show therein that ye have much respect for we glorious king and he deputy in brave nottinghamshire but the shadow grow long and i must away before darkness come lest i lose myself within the forest then robin hood and all he merry man arise also and robin say to the sheriff if thou must go worshipful sir go thou must but thou hast forget one thing nay i forget nought say the sheriff yet all the same he heart sink within he but i say thou hast forget something quoth robin we keep a merry inn here in the greenwood but whoever becometh we guest must pay he reckoning then the sheriff laugh but the laugh be hollow well jolly boy quoth he we have have a merry time together today and even if ye have not ask I i would have give you a score of pound for the sweet entertainment i have have nay quoth robin seriously it would ill beseem we to treat you worship so meanly by my faith sir sheriff i would be ashamed to show my face if i do not reckon the king 's deputy at three hundred pound be it not so my merry man all then ay cry all in a loud voice three hundred devil roar the sheriff think ye that you beggarly feast be worth three pound let alone three hundred nay quoth robin gravely speak not so roundly you worship i do love thee for the sweet feast thou hast give I this day in merry nottingham town but there be those here who love thee not so much if thou wilt look down the cloth thou wilt see will stutely in whose

sherwood forest ` ne'er buy a horse good friend without first look into its mouth ' as we good gaffer swanthold say and so once more fare thee well then he clap he hand to the horse 's back and off go nag and sheriff through the forest glade then bitterly the sheriff rue the day that first he meddle with robin hood for all man laugh at he and many ballad be sing by folk throughout the country of

but though time have so smooth thing over that man no longer talk of the horn beast that the sheriff wish to buy he be still sore about the matter and could not bear to hear robin hood 's name speak in he presence with October have come the time for hold the great fair which be celebrated every five year at nottingham town to which folk come from far and near throughout the country at such time archery be always the main sport of the day for the nottinghamshire yeoman be the best hand at the longbow in all merry england but this year the sheriff hesitate a long time before he issue proclamation of the fair fear lest robin hood and he band might come to it at first he have a great part of a mind not to proclaim the fair but second thought tell he that man would laugh at he and say among themselves that he be afraid of robin hood so he put that think by at last he fix in he mind that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for at such time it have be the custom to offer a half score of mark or a tun of ale so this year he proclaim that a prize of two fat steer should be give to the best bowman when robin hood hear what have be proclaim he be vex and say now beshrew this sheriff that he should offer such a prize that none but shepherd hind will care to shoot for it i would have love nothing better than to have have another bout at merry nottingham

sign of the blue boar and there we hear all the news of this merry fair and also that the sheriff have offer this prize that we of sherwood might not care to come to the fair so good master if thou wilt i would fain go and strive to win even this poor thing among the stout yeoman who will shoot at nottingham town nay little john quoth robin thou art a sound stout fellow yet thou lackest the cunning that good stutely have and i would not have harm befall thee for all nottinghamshire nevertheless if thou wilt go take some disguise lest there be those there who may know thee so be it good

and beard and then i trust no one will know I it be much against my will say robin hood ne'ertheless if thou dost wish it get thee go but bear thyself seemingly little john for thou art mine own right-hand man and i could ill bear to have harm befall thee so little john clad himself all in scarlet and start off to the fair at nottingham town right merry be these fair day at nottingham when the green before the great town gate be dot with booth stand in row with tent of many-colored canvas hang about with streamer and garland of flower and the folk come from all the countryside both

minstrel sing ballad of the olden time play a second upon the harp or where the wrestler struggle with one another within the sawdust ring but the people gather most of all around a raise platform where stout fellow play at quarterstaff so little john come to the fair all scarlet be he hose and jerkin and scarlet be he cowled cap with a scarlet feather stick in the side of it over he shoulder be sling a stout bow of yew and across he back hang a quiver of good round arrow many turn to look after such a stout tall fellow for he shoulder be broader by a palm 's - breadth than any that be there and he stand a head taller than all the other man the lass also look at he askance think they have never see a lustier youth first of all he go to the booth where stout ale be sell and stand

tingle come hither good yeoman and thou and thou for not a farthing shall one of you pay nay turn hither thou lusty beggar and thou jolly tinker for all shall be merry with I thus he shout and all crowd around laugh while the brown ale flow and they call little john a brave fellow each swearing that he love he as he own brother for when one have entertainment with nothing to pay one love the man that give it to one then he stroll to the platform where they be at cudgel play for he love a bout at quarterstaff as he love meat and drink and here befall a adventure that be sing in ballad throughout the mid-country for many a day one fellow there be that crack crown of everyone who throw cap into the ring this be eric o ' lincoln of great renown whose name have be sing in ballad throughout the countryside when little john reach the stand he find none fighting but only bold eric walk up and down the platform swing he staff and shout lustily now who will come and strike a stroke for the lass he love the best with a good lincolnshire yeoman how now lad step up step up or else the lass ' eye be not bright hereabouts or the blood of nottingham youth be sluggish and cold lincoln against nottingham say i for no one have put foot upon the board this day such as we of lincoln call a cudgel player at this one would nudge another with he elbow say go thou ned or go thou thomas but no lad care to gain a crack crown for nothing presently eric saw where little john stand among the other a head and shoulder above they all and he call to he loudly halloa thou long-legged fellow in scarlet broad be thy shoulder and thick thy head be not thy lass fair enough for thee to take cudgel in hand for she sake in truth i believe that nottingham man do turn to bone and sinew for neither heart nor courage have they now thou great lout wilt thou not twirl staff for nottingham ay quoth little john have i but mine own good staff here it would pleasure I hugely to crack thy knave 's pate thou saucy braggart i wot it would be well for thee a thy cock 's comb be cut thus he speak slowly at first for he be slow to move but he wrath gather headway like a great stone roll down a hill so that at the end he be full of anger then eric o ' lincoln laugh aloud well speak for one who fear to meet I fairly man to man say he saucy art thou thine own self and if thou puttest foot upon these board i will make thy saucy tongue rattle within thy tooth now quoth little john be there never a man here that will lend I a good stout staff till i try the mettle of yon fellow at this half a score reach he they stave and he take the stoutest and heaviest of they all then look up and down the cudgel he say now i have in my hand but a splint of wood -- a barley straw as it be -- yet i trow it will have to serve I so here goeth thereupon he cast the cudgel upon the stand and leap lightly after it snatch it up in he hand again then each man stand in he place and measure the other with fell look until he that direct the sport cry play at this they step forth each grasp he staff tightly in the middle then those that stand around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that e'er nottingham town behold at first eric o ' lincoln think that he would gain a easy advantage so he come forth as if he would say watch good people how that i carve you this cockerel right speedily but he presently find it to be no such speedy matter right deftly he strike and with great skill of fence but he have find he match in little john once twice thrice he strike and three time little john turn the blow to the left hand and to the right then quickly and with a dainty backhanded blow he rap eric beneath he guard so shrewdly that it make he head ring again then eric step back to gather he wit while a great shout go up and all be glad that nottingham have crack lincoln 's crown and thus end the first bout of the game then presently the director of the sport cry play and they come together again but now eric play warily for he find he man be of right good mettle and also he have no sweet memory of the blow that he have get so this bout neither little john nor the lincoln man catch a stroke within he guard then after a while they part again and this make the second bout then for the third time they come together and at first eric strove to be wary as he have be before but grow mad at find himself so foiled he lose he wit and begin to rain blow so fiercely and so fast that they rattle like hail on penthouse roof but in spite of all he do not reach within little john 's guard then at last little john see he chance and seize it right cleverly once more with a quick blow he rap eric beside the head and ere he could regain himself little john slip he right hand down to he left and with a swing blow smite the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fall as though he would never move again then the people shout so loud that folk come run from all about to see what be the ado while little john leap down from the stand and give the staff back to he that have lend it to he and thus end the famous bout between little john and eric o ' lincoln of great renown but now the time have come when those who be to shoot with the longbow be to take they place so the people begin flock to the butt where the shooting be to be near the target in a good place sit the sheriff upon a raise dais with many gentlefolk around he when the archer have take they place the herald come forward and proclaim the rule of the game and how each should shoot three shot and to he that should shoot the best the prize of two fat steer be to belong a score of brave shot be gather there and among they some of the keenest hand at the longbow in lincoln and nottinghamshire and among they little john stand taller than all the rest who be yon stranger clothe all in scarlet say some and other answer it be he that have but now so soundly crack the crown of eric o ' lincoln thus the people talk among themselves until at last it reach even the sheriff 's ear and now each man step forward and shoot in turn but though each shot well little john be the best of all for three time he strike the clout and once only the length of a barleycorn from the center hey for the tall archer shout the crowd and some among they shout hey for reynold greenleaf for this be the name that little john have call himself that day then the sheriff step down from the raise seat and come to where the archer stand while all doff they cap that see he come he look keenly at little john but do not know he though he say after a while how now good fellow methink there be that about thy face that i have see erewhile mayhap it may be so quoth little john for often have i see you worship and as he speak he look steadily into the sheriff 's eye so that the latter do not suspect who he be a brave blade art thou good friend say the sheriff and i hear that thou hast well uphold the skill of nottinghamshire against that of lincoln this day what may be thy name good fellow man do call I reynold greenleaf you worship say little john and the old ballad that tell of this add so in truth be he a green leaf but of what manner of tree the sheriff wott not now reynold greenleaf quoth the sheriff thou art the fairest hand at the longbow that mine eye ever behold next to that false knave robin hood from whose wiles heaven forfend I wilt thou join my service good fellow thou shalt be pay right well for three suit of clothes shalt thou have a year with good food and as much ale as thou canst drink and besides this i will pay thee forty mark each michaelmastide then here stand i a free man and right gladly will i enter thy household say little john for he think he might find some merry jest should he enter the sheriff 's service fairly hast thou win the fat steer say the sheriff and hereunto i will add a butt of good march beer for joy of have get such a man for i wot thou shootest as fair a shaft as robin hood himself then say little john for joy of have get myself into thy service i will give fat steer and brown ale to all these good folk to make they merry withal at this arise a great shout many cast they cap aloft for joy of the gift then some build great fire and roasted the steer and other broach the butt of ale with which all make themselves merry then when they have eat and drunk as much as they could and when the day fade and the great moon arise all red and round over the spire and tower of nottingham town they join hand and dance around the fire to the music of bagpipe and harp but long before this merrymaking have begin the sheriff and he new servant reynold greenleaf be in the castle of nottingham how little john live at the sheriff 's thus little john enter into the sheriff 's service and find the life he lead there easy enough for the sheriff make he he right-hand man and hold he in great favor he sit nigh the sheriff at meat and he run beside he horse when he go a-hunting so that what with hunting and hawk a little and eating rich dish and drink good sack and sleep until late hour in the morning he grow as fat as a stall-fed ox thus thing float easily along with the tide until one day when the sheriff go a-hunting there happen that which break the smooth surface of thing this morning the sheriff and many of he man set forth to meet certain lord to go a-hunting he look all about he for he good man reynold greenleaf but not find he be vex for he wish to show little john 's skill to he noble friend as for little john he lay abed snore lustily till the sun be high in the heaven at last he open he eye and look about he but do not move to arise brightly shine the sun in at the window and all the air be sweet with the scent of woodbine that hang in spray about the wall without for the cold winter be past and spring be come again and little john lay still think how sweet be everything on this fair morn just then he hear faint and far away a distant bugle note sound thin and clear the sound be small but like a little pebble drop into a glassy fountain it break all the smooth surface of he thought until he whole soul be fill with disturbance he spirit seem to awaken from its sluggishness and he memory bring back to he all the merry greenwood life -- how the bird be sing blithely there this bright morning and how he loved companion and friend be feast and make merry or perhaps talk of he with sober speech for when he first enter the sheriff 's service he do so in jest but the hearthstone be warm during the winter and the fare be full and so he have abide put off from day to day he go back to sherwood until six long month have pass but now he think of he good master and of will stutely whom he love better than anyone in all the world and of young david of doncaster whom he have train so well in all manly sport till there come over he heart a great and bitter longing for they all so that he eye fill with tear then he say aloud here i grow fat like a stall-fed ox and all my manliness departeth from I while i become a sluggard and dolt but i will arouse I and go back to mine own dear friend once more and never will i leave they again till life doth leave my lip so say he leap from bed for he hate he sluggishness now when he come downstairs he see the steward standing near the pantry door -- a great fat man with a huge bundle of key hang to he girdle then little john say ho master steward a hungry man be i for nought have i have for all this bless morn therefore give I to eat then the steward look grimly at he and rattle the key in he girdle for he hate little john because he have find favor with the sheriff so master reynold greenleaf thou art anhungered art thou quoth he but fair

little john in a rage and so say he stride to the pantry and try to open the door but find it lock whereat the steward laugh and rattle he key then the wrath of little john boil over and lift he clenched fist he smite the pantry door burst out three panel and make so large a opening that he could easily stoop and walk through it when the steward see what be do he wax mad with rage and as little john stooped to look within the pantry he seize he from behind by the nape of the neck pinch he sorely and smite he over the head with he key till the yeoman 's ear ring again at this little john turn upon the steward and smite he such a buffet that the fat man fall to the floor and lay there as though he would never move again there quoth little john think well of that stroke and never keep a good breakfast from a hungry man again so say he creep into the pantry and look about he to see if he could find something to appease he hunger he see a great venison pasty and two roasted capon beside which be a platter of plover 's egg moreover there be a flask of sack and one of canary -- a sweet sight to a hungry man these he take down from the shelf and place upon a sideboard and prepare to make himself merry now the cook in the kitchen across the courtyard hear the loud talking between little john and the steward and also the blow that little john strike the other so he come run across the court and up the stairway to where the steward 's pantry be bear in he hand the spit with the roast still upon it meanwhile the steward have gather he wit about he and rise to he foot so that when the cook come to the steward 's pantry he see he glower through the broken door at little john who be make ready for a good repast as one dog glower at another that have a bone when the steward see the cook he come to he and put one arm over he shoulder alas sweet friend quoth he -- for the cook be a tall stout man -- seest thou what that vile knave reynold greenleaf have do he have break in upon we master 's goods and have smitten I a buffet upon the ear so that i think i be dead good cook i love thee well and thou shalt have a good pottle of we master 's best wine every day for thou art a old and faithful servant also good cook i have ten shilling that i mean to give as a gift to thee but hatest thou not to see a vile upstart like this reynold greenleaf take it upon he so bravely ay marry that do i quoth the cook boldly for he like the steward because of he talk of the wine and of the ten shilling get thee go straightway to thy room and i will bring out this knave by he ear so say he lay aside he spit and draw the sword that hang by he side whereupon the steward leave as quickly as he could for he hate the sight of naked steel then the cook walk straightway to the broken pantry door through which he see little john tuck a napkin beneath he chin and prepare to make himself merry why how now reynold greenleaf say the cook thou art no better than a thief i wot come thou straight forth man or i will carve thee as i would carve a suck pig nay good cook bear thou thyself more seemingly or else i will come forth to thy dole at most time i be as a yearling lamb

little john coward 's name have i never have so look to thyself good cook for i come forth straight the roar lion i do speak of but now then he too draw he sword and come out of the pantry then put

stand so nigh and such a feast as would befit two stout fellow such as we be marry good friend i think we should enjoy this fair feast ere we fight what sayest thou jolly cook at this speech the cook look up and down scratch he head in doubt for he love good feasting at last he draw a long breath and say to little john well good friend i like thy plan right well so pretty boy say i let we feast with all my heart for one of we may sup in paradise before nightfall so each thrust he sword back into the scabbard and enter the pantry then after they have seat themselves little john draw he dagger and thrust it into the pie a hungry man must be feed quoth he so sweet chuck i help myself without leave but the cook do not lag far behind for straightway he hand also be deeply thrust within the goodly pasty after this neither of they speak further but use they tooth to better purpose but though neither speak they look at one another each think within himself that he have never see a more lusty fellow than the one across the board at last after a long time have pass the cook draw a full deep breath as though of much regret and wipe he hand upon the napkin for he could eat no more little john also have enough for he push the pasty aside as though he would say i want thee by I no more good friend then he take the pottle of sack and say he now good fellow i swear by all that be bright that thou art the stoutest companion at eat that ever i have lo i drink thy health so say he clap the flask to he lip and cast he eye aloft while the good wine flood he throat then he pass the

my brother and i love thee too but the day draweth on and i have my cooking to do ere we master cometh home so let we e ` en go and settle this brave fight we have in hand ay marry quoth little john and that right speedily never have i be more laggard in fight than in eating and drinking so come thou straight forth into the passageway where there be good room to swing a sword and i will try to serve thee then they both step forth into the broad passage that lead to the steward 's pantry where each man draw he sword again and without more ado fall upon the other as though he would hew he fellow limb from limb then they sword clash upon one another with great din and spark fly from each blow in shower so they fight up and down the hall for a hour and more neither strike the other a blow though they strive they best to do so for both be skillful at the fence so nothing come of all they labor ever and anon they rest panting then after get they wind at it they would go again more fiercely than ever at last little john cry aloud hold good cook whereupon each rest upon he sword pant now will i make my vow quoth little john thou art the very best swordsman that ever mine eye behold truly i have think to carve thee ere now and i have think to do the same by thee quoth the cook but i have miss the mark somehow now i have be think within myself quoth little john what we be fight for but albeit i do not rightly know why no more do i say the cook i bear no love for that pursy steward but i think that we have engage to fight with one another and that it must be do now quoth little john it doth seem to I that instead of strive to cut one another 's throat it be better for we to be boon companion what sayst thou jolly cook wilt thou go with I to sherwood forest and join with robin hood 's band thou shalt live a merry life within the woodland and sevenscore good companion shalt thou have one of whom be mine own self thou shalt have three suit of lincoln green

with open eye i be little john indeed and i will bring to robin hood this day a right stout fellow to join he merry band but ere we go good friend it seemeth to I to be a vast pity that as we have have so much of the sheriff 's food we should not also carry off some of he silver plate to robin hood as a present from he worship ay marry be it say the cook and so they begin hunting about and take as much silver as they could lay hand upon clap it into a bag and when they have fill the sack they set forth to sherwood forest plunge into the wood they come at last to the greenwood tree where they find robin hood and threescore of he merry man lie upon the fresh green grass when robin and he man see who it be that come they leap to they foot now welcome cry robin hood now welcome little john

fellow i be glad thou hast bring thyself back to we and with such a good companion as the cook whom we all welcome to sherwood but i like not so well that thou hast steal the sheriff 's plate like some paltry thief the sheriff have be punish by we and have lose three hundred pound even as he seek to despoil another but he have do nought that we should steal he household plate from he though little john be vex with this he strive to pass it off with a jest nay good master quoth he if thou thinkest the sheriff give we not the plate i will fetch he that he may tell we with he own lip he giveth it all to we so say he leap to he foot and be go before robin could call he back little john run for full five mile till he come to where the sheriff of nottingham and a gay company be hunting near the forest when little john come to the sheriff he doff he cap and bent he knee god save thee good master quoth he why reynold greenleaf cry the sheriff whence comest thou and where hast thou be i have be in the forest answer little john speak amazedly and there i see a sight such as ne'er before man 's eye behold yonder i see a young hart all in green from top to toe and about he be a herd of threescore deer and they too be all of green from head to foot yet i dare not shoot good master for fear lest they should slay I why how now reynold greenleaf cry the sheriff art thou dream or art thou mad that thou dost bring I such a tale nay i be not dream nor be i mad say little john and if thou wilt come with I i will show thee this fair sight for i have see it with mine own eye but thou must come alone good master lest the other frighten they and they get away so the party all ride forward and little john lead they downward into the forest now good master quoth he at last we be nigh where i see this herd then the sheriff descend from he horse and bid they wait for he until he should return and little john lead he forward through a close copse until suddenly they come to a great open glade at the end of which robin hood sit beneath the shade of the great oak tree with he merry man all about he see good master sheriff quoth little john yonder be the hart of which i spake to

robin hood have come to they now welcome master sheriff say he hast thou come today to take another feast with I nay heaven forbid say the sheriff in tone of deep earnest i care for no feast and have no hunger today nevertheless quoth robin if thou hast no hunger maybe thou hast thirst and well i know thou wilt take a cup of sack with I but i be grieve that thou wilt not feast with I for thou couldst have victuals to thy liking for there stand thy cook then he lead the sheriff willy-nilly to the seat he know so well beneath the greenwood tree ho lad cry robin fill we good friend the sheriff a right brimming cup of sack and fetch it hither for he be faint and weary then one of the band bring the sheriff a cup of sack bow low as he hand it to he but the sheriff could not touch the wine for he see it serve in one of he own silver flagon on one of he own silver plate how now quoth robin dost thou not like we new silver service we have get a bag of it this day so say he hold up the sack of silver that little john and the cook have bring with they then the sheriff 's heart be bitter within he but not daring to say anything he only gaze upon the ground robin look keenly at he for a time before he speak again then say he now master sheriff the last time thou camest to sherwood forest thou didst come seek to despoil a poor spendthrift and thou wert despoil thine own self but now thou comest seek to do no harm nor do i know that thou hast despoil any man i take my tithe from fat priest and lordly squire to help those that they despoil and to raise up those that they bow down but i know not that thou hast tenant of thine own whom thou hast wrong in any way therefore take thou thine own again nor will i dispossess thee today of so much as one farthing come with I and i will lead thee from the forest back to thine own party again then sling the bag upon he shoulder he turn away the sheriff follow he all too perplexed in mind to speak so they go forward until they come to within a furlong of the spot where the sheriff 's companion be wait for he then robin hood give the sack of silver back to the sheriff take thou thine own again he say and hearken to I good sheriff take thou a piece of advice with it try thy servant well ere thou dost engage they again so readily then turn he leave the other standing bewilder with the sack in he hand the company that wait for the sheriff be all amaze to see he come out of the forest bear a heavy sack upon he shoulder but though they question he he answer never a word act like one who walk in a dream without a word he place the bag across he nag 's back and then mount ride away all follow he but all the time there be a great turmoil of thought within he head tumble one over the other and thus end the merry tale of little john and how he enter the sheriff 's service little john and the tanner of blyth one fine day not long after little john have leave abide with the sheriff and have come back with he worship 's cook to the merry greenwood as have just be tell robin hood and a few choose fellow of he band lay upon the soft sward beneath the greenwood tree where they dwell the day be warm and sultry so that while most of the band be scatter through the forest upon this mission and upon that these few stout fellow lay lazily beneath the shade of the tree in the soft afternoon pass jest among themselves and tell merry story with laughter and mirth all the air be laden with the bitter fragrance of the may and all the bosky shades of the woodland beyond ring with the sweet song of bird -- the throstle cock the cuckoo and the wood pigeon -- and with the song of bird mingle the cool sound of the gurgle brook that leap out of the forest shades and run fret amid its rough gray stone across the sunlit open glade before the tryst tree and a fair sight be that halfscore of tall stout yeoman all clothe in lincoln green lie beneath the broad-spreading branch of the great oak tree amid the quiver leaf of which the sunlight shiver and fall in dancing patch upon the grass suddenly robin hood smite he knee by saint dunstan quoth he i have nigh forget that quarter-day cometh on apace and yet no cloth of lincoln green in all we store it must be look to and that in quick season come busk thee little john stir those lazy bone of thine for thou must get thee straightway to we good gossip the draper hugh longshank of ancaster bid he send we straightway twentyscore yard of fair cloth of lincoln green and mayhap the journey may take some of the fat from off thy bone that thou hast get from lazy living at we dear sheriff 's nay mutter little john -lrb- for he have hear so much upon this score that he be sore upon the point -rrb- nay truly mayhap i have more flesh upon my joint than i once have yet flesh or no flesh i doubt not that i could still hold my place and footing upon a narrow bridge against e'er a yeoman in sherwood or nottinghamshire for the matter of that even though he have no more fat about he bone than thou hast good master at this reply a great shout of laughter go up and all look at robin hood for each man know that little john spake of a certain fight that happen between they master and himself through which they first become acquaint nay quoth robin hood laugh louder than all heaven forbid that i should doubt thee for i care for no taste of thy staff myself little john i must need own that there be those of my band can handle a seven-foot staff more deftly than i yet no man in all nottinghamshire can draw gray goose shaft with my finger nevertheless a journey to ancaster may not be ill for thee so go thou as i bid and thou hadst best go this very evening for since thou hast abide at the sheriff 's many know thy face and if thou goest in broad daylight thou mayst get thyself into a coil with some of he worship 's man-at-arms bide thou here till i bring thee money to pay we good hugh i warrant he have no better customer in all nottinghamshire than we so say robin leave they and enter the forest not far from the tryst tree be a great rock in which a chamber have be hew the entrance be bar by a massive oaken door two palm ' - breadth in thickness stud about with spike and fasten with a great padlock this be the treasure house of the band and thither robin hood go and unlock the door enter the chamber from which he bring forth a bag of gold which he give to little john to pay hugh longshank withal for the cloth of lincoln green then up get little john and take the bag of gold which he thrust into he bosom he strap a girdle about he loin take a stout pikestaff full seven foot long in he hand and set forth upon he journey so he stride whistle along the leafy forest path that lead to fosse way turn neither to the right hand nor the leave until at last he come to where the path branch lead on the one hand onward to fosse way and on the other as well little john know to the merry blue boar inn here little john suddenly cease whistle and stop in the middle of the path first he look up and then he look down and then tilt he cap over one eye he slowly scratch the back part of he head for thus it be : at the sight of these two road two voice begin to alarum within he the one cry there lie the road to the blue boar inn a can of brown October and a merry night with sweet companion such as thou mayst find there the other there lie the way to ancaster and the duty thou art send upon now the first of these two voice be far the louder for little john have grow pass fond of good living through abide at the sheriff 's house so presently look up into the blue sky across which bright cloud be sail like silver boat and swallow skim in circle flight quoth he i fear I it will rain this evening so i 'll e ` en stop at the blue boar till it pass by for i know my good master would not have I wet to the skin so without more ado off he stride down the path that lay the way of he liking now there be no sign of any foul weather but when one wish to do a thing as little john do one find no lack of reason for the do four merry wag be at the blue boar inn a butcher a beggar and two barefoot friar little john hear they singing from afar as he walk through the hush of the mellow twilight that be now fall over hill and dale right glad be they to welcome such a merry blade as little john fresh can of ale be bring and with jest and song and merry tale the hour slip away on fleeting wing none thought of time or tide till the night be so far go that little john put by the thought of set forth upon he journey again that night and so bide at the blue boar inn until the morrow now it be a ill piece of luck for little john that he leave he duty for he pleasure and he pay a great score for it as we be all apt to do in the same case as you shall see up he rise at the dawn of the next day and take he stout pikestaff in he hand he set forth upon he journey once more as though he would make up for lose time in the good town of blyth there live a stout tanner celebrate far and near for feat of strength and many tough bout at wrestling and the quarterstaff for five year he have hold the mid-country champion belt for wrestle till the great adam o ' lincoln cast he in the ring and break one of he rib but at quarterstaff he have never yet meet he match in all the country about besides all this he dearly love the longbow and a sly jaunt in the forest when the moon be full and the dun deer in season so that the king 's ranger keep a shrewd eye upon he and he doings for arthur a bland 's house be apt to have aplenty of meat in it that be more like venison than the law allow now arthur have be to nottingham town the day before little john set forth on he errand there to sell a halfscore of tan cowhide at the dawn of the same day that little john leave the inn he start from nottingham homeward for blyth he way lead all in the dewy morn past the verge of sherwood forest where the bird be welcome the lovely day with a great and merry jubilee across the tanner 's shoulder be sling he stout quarterstaff ever near enough to he to be grip quickly and on he head be a cap of double cowhide so tough that it could hardly be cloven even by a broadsword now quoth arthur a bland to himself when he have come to that part of the road that cut through a corner of the forest no doubt at this time of year the dun deer be come from the forest depths nigher to the open meadow land mayhap i may chance to catch a sight of the dainty brown darling thus early in the morn for there be nothing he love better than to look upon a tripping herd of deer even when he could not tickle they rib with a clothyard shaft accordingly quit the path he go peep this way and that through the underbrush spy now here and now there with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft and of one who have more than once don a doublet of lincoln green now as little john step blithely along thinking of nothing but of such thing as the sweetness of the hawthorn bud that bedeck the hedgerow or gaze upward at the lark that spring from the dewy grass hang aloft on quiver wing in the yellow sunlight pour forth its song that fall like a fall star from the sky he luck lead he away from the highway not far from the spot where arthur a bland be peep this way and that through the leaf of the thicket hear a rustling of the branch little john stop and presently catch sight of the brown cowhide cap of the tanner move among the bush i do much wonder quoth little john to himself what yon knave be after that he should go thus peep and peer about i verily believe that yon scurvy varlet be no better than a thief and cometh here after we own and the good king 's dun deer for by much roving in the forest little john have come to look upon all the deer in sherwood as belong to robin hood and he band as much as to good king harry nay quoth he again after a time this matter must e ` en be look into so quit the highroad he also enter the thicket and begin spy around after stout arthur a bland so for a long time they both of they go hunting about little john after the tanner and the tanner after the deer at last little john trod upon a stick which snap under he foot whereupon hear the noise the tanner turn quickly and catch sight of the yeoman see that the tanner have spy he out little john put a bold face upon the matter hilloa quoth he what art thou do here thou naughty fellow who art thou that comest range sherwood 's path in very sooth thou hast a evil cast of countenance and i do think truly that thou art no better than a thief and comest after we good king 's deer nay quoth the tanner boldly -- for though take by surprise he be not a man to be frighten by big word -- thou liest in thy tooth i be no thief but a honest craftsman as for my countenance it be what it be and for the matter of that thine own be none too pretty thou saucy fellow ha quoth little john in a great loud voice wouldst thou give I backtalk now i have a great part of a mind to crack thy pate for thee i would have thee know fellow that i be as it be one of the king 's forester leastwise mutter he to himself i and my friend do take good care of we good sovereign 's deer i care not who thou art answer the bold tanner and unless thou hast many more of thy kind by thee thou canst never make arthur a bland cry ' a mercy ' be it so cry little john in a rage now by my faith thou saucy rogue thy tongue have lead thee into a pit thou wilt have a sorry time get out of for i will give thee such a drubbing as ne'er hast thou have in all thy life before take thy staff in thy hand fellow for i will not smite a unarmed man marry come up with a murrain cry the tanner for he too have talk himself into a fume big word ne'er kill so much as a mouse who art thou that talkest so freely of crack the head of arthur a bland if i do not tan thy hide this day as ne'er i tan a calf 's hide in all my life before split my staff into skewer for lamb 's flesh and call I no more brave man now look to thyself fellow stay say little john let we first measure we cudgel i do reckon my staff longer than thine and i would not take vantage of thee by even so much as a inch nay i pass not for length answer the tanner my staff be long enough to knock down a calf so look to thyself fellow i say again so without more ado each grip he staff in the middle and with fell and angry look they come slowly together now news have be bring to robin hood how that little john instead of do he bidding have pass by duty for pleasure and so have stop overnight with merry company at the blue boar inn instead of go straight to ancaster so be vex to he heart by this he set forth at dawn of day to seek little john at the blue boar or at least to meet the yeoman on the way and ease he heart of what he think of the matter as thus he stride along in anger put together the word he would use to chide little john he hear of a sudden loud and angry voice as of man in a rage passing fall word back and forth from one to the other at this robin hood stop and listen surely quoth he to himself that be little john 's voice and he be talk in anger also methink the other be strange to my ear now heaven forfend that my good trusty little john should have fall into the hand of the king 's ranger i must see to this matter and that quickly thus speak robin hood to himself all he anger pass away like a breath from the windowpane at the thought that perhaps he trusty right-hand man be in some danger of he life so cautiously he make he way through the thicket whence the voice come and push aside the leaf peep into the little open space where the two man staff in hand be come slowly together ha quoth robin to himself here be merry sport afoot now i would give three golden angel from my own pocket if yon stout fellow would give little john a right sound drubbing it would please I to see he well thump for have fail in my bidding i fear I though there be but poor chance of my see such a pleasant sight so say he stretch himself at length upon the ground that he might not only see the sport the better but that he might enjoy the merry sight at he ease as you may have see two dog that think to fight walk slowly round and round each other neither cur wish to begin the combat so those two stout yeoman move slowly around each watch for a chance to take the other unaware and so get in the first blow at last little john strike like a flash and -- rap -- the tanner meet the blow and turn it aside and then smite back at little john who also turn the blow and so this mighty battle begin then up and down and back and forth they tread the blow fall so thick and fast that at a distance one would have think that half a score of man be fight thus they fight for nigh a half a hour until the ground be all plow up with the digging of they heel and they breathing grow labor like the ox in the furrow but little john suffer the most for he have become unused to such stiff labor and he joint be not as supple as they have be before he go to dwell with the sheriff all this time robin hood lay beneath the bush rejoice at such a comely bout of quarterstaff by my faith quoth he to himself never have i think to see little john so evenly match in all my life belike though he would have overcome yon fellow before this have he be in he former trim at last little john see he chance and throw all the strength he feel go from he into one blow that might have fell a ox he strike at the tanner with might and main and now do the tanner 's cowhide cap stand he in good stead and but for it he might never have hold staff in hand again as it be the blow he catch beside the head be so shrewd that it send he stagger across the little glade so that if little john have have the strength to follow up he vantage it would have be ill for stout arthur but he regain himself quickly and at arm 's length strike back a blow at little john and this time the stroke reach its mark and down go little john at full length he cudgel fly from he hand as he fall then raise he staff stout arthur deal he another blow upon the rib hold roar little john wouldst thou strike a man when he be down ay marry would i quoth the tanner give he another thwack with he staff stop roar little john help hold i say i yield I i yield I i say good fellow hast thou have enough ask the tanner grimly hold he staff aloft ay marry and more than enough and thou dost own that i be the better man of the two yea truly and a murrain seize thee say little john the first aloud and the last to he beard then thou mayst go thy way and thank thy patron saint that i be a merciful man say the tanner a plague o ' such mercy as thine say little john sit up and feel he rib where the tanner have cudgel he i make my vow my rib feel as though every one of they be break in twain i tell thee good fellow i do think there be never a man in all nottinghamshire could do to I what thou hast do this day and so think i also cry robin hood burst out of the thicket and shout with laughter till the tear run down he cheek o man man say he as well as he could for he mirth ' a didst go over like a bottle knock from a wall i do see the whole merry bout and never do i think to see thee yield thyself so hand and foot to any man in all merry england i be seek thee to chide thee for leave my bidding undo but thou hast be pay all i owe thee full measure press down and overflow by this good fellow marry ' a do reach out he arm full length while thou stand gaping at he and with a pretty rap tumble thee over as never have i see one tumble before so speak bold robin and all the time little john sit upon the ground look as though he have sour curd in he mouth what may be thy name good fellow say robin next turn to the tanner man do call I arthur a bland speak up the tanner boldly and now what may be thy name ha arthur a bland quoth robin i have hear thy name before good

marry have i know who thou art i would never have be so bold as to lift my hand against thee let I help thee to thy foot good master little john and let I brush the dust from off thy coat nay quoth little john testily at the same time rise carefully as though he bone have be make of glass i can help myself good fellow without thy aid and let I tell thee have it not be for that vile cowskin cap of thine it would have be ill for thee this day at this robin laugh again and turn to the tanner he say wilt thou join my band good arthur for i make my vow thou art one of the stoutest man that ever mine eye behold will i join thy band cry the tanner joyfully ay marry will i hey for a merry life cry he leap aloft and snap he finger and hey for the life i love away with tanbark and filthy vat and foul cowhide i will follow thee to the end of the earth good master and not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the twang of my bowstring as for thee little john say robin turn to he and laugh thou wilt start once more for ancaster and we will go part way with thee for i will not have thee turn again to either the right hand or the left till thou hast fairly get away from sherwood there be other inn that thou knowest yet hereabouts thereupon leave the thicket they take once more to the highway and depart upon they business robin hood and will scarlet thus they travel along the sunny road three stout fellow such as you could hardly match anywhere else in all merry england many stop to gaze after they as they stride along so broad be they shoulder and so sturdy they gait quoth robin hood to little john why didst thou not go straight to ancaster yesterday as i tell thee thou hadst not get thyself into such a coil hadst thou do as i order i fear the rain that threaten say little john in a sullen tone for he be vex at be so chaff by robin with what have happen to he the rain cry robin stop of a sudden in the middle of the road and look at little john in wonder why thou great oaf not a drop of rain have fall these three day neither have any threaten nor have there be a sign of foul weather in earth or sky or water nevertheless growl little john the holy saint swithin holdeth the water of the heaven in he pewter pot and he could have pour they out have he choose even from a clear sky and wouldst thou have have I wet to the skin at this robin hood burst into a roar of laughter o little john say he what butter wit hast thou in that head of thine who could hold anger against such a one as thou art so say they all step out once more with the right foot foremost as the say be after they have travel some distance the day be warm and the road dusty robin hood wax thirsty so there be a fountain of water as cold as ice just behind the hedgerow they cross the stile and come to where the water bubble up from beneath a mossy stone here kneel and make cup of the palm of they hand they drink they fill and then the spot be cool and shady they stretch they limb and rest they for a space in front of they over beyond the hedge the dusty road stretch away across the plain behind they the meadow land and bright green field of tender young corn lay broadly in the sun and overhead spread the shade of the cool rustling leave of the beechen tree pleasantly to they nostril come the tender fragrance of the purple violet and wild thyme that grow within the dewy moisture of the edge of the little fountain and pleasantly come the soft gurgle of the water all be so pleasant and so full of the gentle joy of the bright maytime that for a long time no one of the three care to speak but each lay on he back gaze up through the tremble leaf of the tree to the bright sky overhead at last robin whose thought be not quite so busy wool - gathering as those of the other and who have be gaze around he now and then break the silence heyday quoth he yon be a gaily feathered bird i take my vow the other look and see a young man walk slowly down the highway gay be he indeed as robin have say and a fine figure he cut for he doublet be of scarlet silk and he stocking also a handsome sword hang by he side the embossed leathern scabbard be pick out with fine thread of gold he cap be of scarlet velvet and a broad feather hang down behind and back of one ear he hair be long and yellow and curl upon he shoulder and in he hand he bear a early rose which he smell at daintily now and then by my life quoth robin hood laugh saw ye e'er such a pretty mincing fellow truly he clothes have overmuch prettiness for my taste quoth arthur a bland but ne'ertheless he shoulder be broad and he loin be narrow and seest thou good master how that he arm hang from he body they dangle not down like spindle but hang stiff and bend at the elbow i take my vow there be no bread and milk limb in those fine clothes but stiff joint and tough thew methink thou art right friend arthur say little john i do verily think that yon be no such roseleaf and whipped-cream gallant as he would have one take he to be pah quoth robin hood the sight of such a fellow doth put a nasty taste into my mouth look how he doth hold that fair flower betwixt he thumb and finger as he would say ` good rise i like thee not so ill but i can bear thy odor for a little while ' i take it ye be both wrong and verily believe that be a furious mouse to run across he path he would cry ` la ' or ` alack-a-day ' and fall straightway into a swoon i wonder who he may be some great baron 's son i doubt not answer little john with good and true man 's money line he purse ay marry that be true i make no doubt quoth robin what a pity that such man as he that have no thought but to go abroad in gay clothes should have good fellow whose shoe they be not fit to tie dancing at they bidding by saint dunstan saint alfr saint withold and all the good man in the saxon calendar it doth make I mad to see such gay lordling from over the sea go step on the neck of good saxon who own this land before ever they great-grandsire chew rind of brawn by the bright bow of heaven i will have they ill-gotten gain from they even though i hang for it as high as e'er a forest tree in sherwood why how now master quoth little john what heat be this thou dost set thy pot a-boiling and mayhap no bacon to cook methink yon fellow 's hair be overlight for norman lock he may be a good man and true for aught thou knowest nay say robin my head against a leaden farthing he be what i say so lie ye both here i say till i show you how i drub this fellow so say robin hood step forth from the shade of the beech tree cross the stile and stand in the middle of the road with he hand on he hip in the stranger 's path meantime the stranger who have be walk so slowly that all this talk be hold before he come opposite the place where they be neither quicken he pace nor seem to see that such a man as robin hood be in the world so robin stand in the middle of the road wait while the other walk slowly forward smell he rose and look this way and that and everywhere except at robin hold cry robin when at last the other have come close to he hold stand where thou art wherefore should i hold good fellow say the stranger in soft and gentle voice and wherefore should i stand where i be ne'ertheless as thou dost desire that i should stay i will abide for a short time that i may hear what thou mayst have to say to I then quoth robin as thou dost so fairly do as i tell thee and dost give I such soft speech i will also treat thee with all due courtesy i would have thee know fair friend that i be as it be a votary at the shrine of saint wilfr who thou mayst know take willy-nilly all they gold from the heathen and melt it up into candlestick wherefore upon such as come hereabouts i levy a certain toll which i use for a better purpose i hope than to make candlestick withal therefore sweet chuck i would have thee deliver to I thy purse that i may look into it and judge to the best of my poor power whether thou hast more wealth about thee than we law allow for as we good gaffer swanthold sayeth ` he who be fat from overlive must need lose blood ' all this time the youth have be sniff at the rose that he hold betwixt he thumb and finger nay say he with a gentle smile when robin hood have do i do love to hear thee talk thou pretty fellow and if haply thou art not yet do finish i beseech thee i have yet some little time to stay i have say all quoth robin and now if thou wilt give I thy purse i will let thee go thy way without let or hindrance so soon as i shall see what it may hold i will take none from thee if thou hast but little alas it doth grieve I much say the other that i can not do as thou dost wish i have nothing to give thee let I go my way i prythee i have do thee no harm nay thou goest not quoth robin till thou hast show I thy purse good friend say the other gently i have business elsewhere i have give thee much time and have hear thee patiently prythee let I depart in peace i have speak to thee friend say robin sternly and i now tell thee again that thou goest not one step forward till thou hast do as i bid thee so say he raise he quarterstaff above he head in a threatening way alas say the stranger sadly it doth grieve I that this thing must be i fear much that i must slay thee thou poor fellow so say he draw he sword put by thy weapon quoth robin i would take no vantage of thee thy sword can not stand against a oaken staff such as mine i could snap it like a barley straw yonder be a good oaken thicket by the roadside take thee a cudgel thence and defend thyself fairly if thou hast a taste for a sound drubbing first the stranger measure robin with he eye and then he measure the oaken staff thou art right good fellow say he presently truly my sword be no match for that cudgel of thine bide thee awhile till i get I a staff so say he throw aside the rise that he have be hold all this time thrust he sword back into the scabbard and with a more hasty step than he have yet use step to the roadside where grow the little clump of ground oak robin have speak of choosing among they he presently find a sapling to he liking he do not cut it but roll up he sleeve a little way he lay hold of it place he heel against the ground and with one mighty pull pluck the young tree up by the root from out the very earth then he come back trim away the root and tender stem with he sword as quietly as if he have do nought to speak of little john and the tanner have be watch all that pass but when they see the stranger drag the saple up from the earth and hear the rending and snap of its root the tanner purse he lip together draw he breath between they in a long inward whistle by the breath of my body say little john as soon as he could gather he wit from they wonder sawest thou that arthur marry i think we poor master will stand but a ill chance with yon fellow by we lady he pluck up yon green tree as it be a barley straw whatever robin hood think he stand he ground and now he and the stranger in scarlet stand face to face well do robin hood hold he own that day as a mid-country yeoman this way and that they fight and back and forth robin 's skill against the stranger 's strength the dust of the highway rise up around they like a cloud so that at time little john and the tanner could see nothing but only hear the rattle of the stave against one another thrice robin hood strike the stranger once upon the arm and twice upon the rib and yet have he ward all the other 's blow only one of which have it meet its mark would have lay stout robin lower in the dust than he have ever go before at last the stranger strike robin 's cudgel so fairly in the middle that he could hardly hold he staff in he hand again he strike and robin bent beneath the blow a third time he strike and now not only fairly beat down robin 's guard but give he such a rap also that down he tumble into the dusty road hold cry robin hood when he see the stranger raise he staff once more i yield I hold cry little john burst from he cover with the tanner at he heel hold give over i say nay answer the stranger quietly if there be two more of you and each as stout as this good fellow i be like to have my hand full nevertheless come on and i will strive my best to serve you all stop cry robin hood we will fight no more i take my vow this be a ill day for thee and I little john i do verily believe that my wrist and eke my arm be palsy by the jar of the blow that this stranger strike I then little john turn to robin hood why how now good master

clear he throat he sing : _ in the merry blossom time when love longing food the breast when the flower be on the lime when the small fowl build she nest sweetly sing the nightingale and the throstle cock so bold cuckoo in the dewy dale and the turtle in the word but the robin i love dear for he singeth through the year robin robin merry robin so i would have my true love be : not to fly at the nigh sign of cold adversity _ _ when the spring bring sweet delight when aloft the lark doth rise lover woo o ' mellow night and youth peep in maiden ' eye that time bloom the eglantine daisy pie upon the hill cowslip fair and columbine dusky violet by the rill but the ivy green cloth grow when the north wind bringeth snow ivy ivy stanch and true thus i would have she love to be : not to die at the nigh breath of cold adversity _ ` tis well sing quoth robin but cousin i tell thee plain i would rather hear a stout fellow like thee sing some lusty ballad than a finicking song of flower and bird and what not yet thou didst sing it fair and ` tis none so bad a snatch of a song for the matter of that now tanner it be thy turn i know not quoth arthur smile with he head on one side like a bud lass that be ask to dance i know not that i can match we sweet friend 's song moreover i do verily think that i have catch a cold and have a certain tickling and huskiness in the windpipe nay sing up

ever hear of the woo of sir keith the stout young cornish knight in good king arthur 's time methink i have hear somewhat of it say robin but ne'ertheless strike up thy ditty and let we hear it for as i do remember I it be a gallant song so out with it good fellow thereupon clear he throat the tanner without more ado begin to sing : the woo of sir keith _ king arthur sit in he royal hall and about on either hand be many a noble lordling tall the greatest in the land sit lancelot with raven lock gawaine with golden hair sir tristram kay who keep the lock and many another there and through the stain window bright from o'er the red-tiled eave the sunlight blaze with color light on golden helm and greave but suddenly a silence come about the table round for up the hall there walk a dame bent nigh unto the ground she nose be hooked she eye be blear she lock be lank and white upon she chin there grow a beard she be a gruesome sight and so with crawl step she come and kneel at arthur 's foot quoth kay ` she be the foulest dame that e'er my sight do greet ' ' o mighty king of thee i crave a boon on bended knee ' 'twa thus she speak ` what wouldst thou have ' quoth arthur king ` of I _ ' _ quoth she ' i have a foul disease doth gnaw my very heart and but one thing can bring I ease or cure my bitter smart ` there be no rest no ease for I north east or west or south till christian knight

oftentimes seem to I say will scarlet that it have a certain motive in it e ` en such as this : that a duty which seemeth to we sometimes ugly and harsh when we do kiss it fairly upon the mouth so to speak be no such foul thing after all methink thou art right quoth robin and contrariwise that when we kiss a pleasure that appeareth gay it turneth foul to we be it not so little john truly such a

a-coughing till he could scarcely stand then while all four stumble about roar with the smart of the meal in they eyeball and while they rub they eye till the tear make great channel on they face through the meal the miller seize another handful of flour and another and another throw it in they face so that even have they have a glimmering of light before they be now as blind as ever a beggar

the most beautiful maiden in all the world to all this the yeomen listen in silence the clatter of many voice jest and laugh sound around they and the red light of the fire shine on they face and in they eye so simple be the poor boy 's word and so deep he sorrow that even little john feel a certain knotty lump rise in he throat i wonder not say robin after a moment 's silence that thy true love

allan quoth he so much have be say of thy singing that we would fain have a taste of thy skill ourselves canst thou not give we something surely answer allan readily for he be no third-rate songster that must be ask again and again but say yes or no at the first bidding so take up he harp he run he finger lightly over the sweetly sound string and all be hush about the cloth then back he voice with sweet music on he harp he sing : may ellen 's wedding -lrb- give a account of how she be beloved by a fairy prince who take she to he own home -rrb- _ may ellen sit beneath a thorn and in a shower around the blossom fall at every breeze like snow upon the ground and in a lime tree near be hear the sweet song of a strange wild bird o sweet sweet sweet o pierce sweet o linger sweet the strain may ellen 's heart within she breast stand still with blissful pain : and so with listen upturned face she sit as dead in that fair place ` come down from out the blossom bird come down from out the tree and on my heart i 'll let thee lie and love thee tenderly ' thus cry may ellen soft and low from where the hawthorn shed its snow down drop the bird on quivering wing from out the blossom tree and nestle in she snowy breast ` my love my love ' cry she then straightway home ` mid sun and flower she bare he to she own sweet bower the day have pass to mellow night the moon float o'er the lea and in its solemn pallid light a youth stand silently : a youth of beauty strange and rare within may ellen 's bower there he stand where o'er the pavement cold the glimmer moonbeam lay may ellen gaze with wide scared eye nor could she turn away for as in mystic dream we see a spirit stand he silently all in a low and breathless voice ` whence comest thou ' say she ` art thou the creature of a dream or a vision that i see ' then soft spake he as night wind shiver through strain reed beside the river ' i come a bird on feathered wing from distant faeryland where murmur water softly sing upon the golden strand where sweet tree be forever green and there my mother be the queen ' no more may ellen leave she bower to grace the blossom fair but in the hushed and midnight hour they hear she talking there or when the moon be shine white they hear she singing through the night ` oh don thy silk and jewel fine ' may ellen 's mother say ` for hither come the lord of lyne and thou this lord must wed ' may ellen say ` it may not be he ne'er shall find he wife in I ' up speak she brother dark and grim : ` now by the bright blue sky e'er yet a day have go for he thy wicked bird shall die for he have work thee bitter harm by some strange art or cunning charm ' then with a sad and mournful song away the bird do fly and o'er the castle eave and through the gray and windy sky ` come forth ' then cry the brother grim ` why dost thou gaze so after he ' it be may ellen 's wedding day the sky be blue and fair and many a lord and lady gay in church be gather there the bridegroom be sir hugh the bold all clothe in silk and cloth of gold in come the bride in samite white with a white wreath on she head she eye be fix with a glassy look she face be as the dead and when she stand among the throng she sing a wild and wondrous song then come a strange and rush sound like the come wind doth bring and in the open window shoot nine swan on whistle wing and high above the head they fly in gleaming fight the darkness through around may ellen 's head they fly in wide and windy fight and three time round the circle draw the guest shrink in affright and the priest beside the altar there do cross himself with muttered prayer but the third time they fly around fair ellen straight be go and in she place upon the ground there stand a snow-white swan then with a wild and lovely song it join the swift and winged throng there be ancient man at wedding be for sixty year and more but such a wondrous wedding day they never see before but none could check and none could stay the swan that bear the bride away _ not a sound break the stillness when allan a dale have do but all sit gaze at the handsome singer for so sweet be he voice and the music that each man sit with bated breath lest one drop more should come and he should lose it by my faith and my troth quoth robin at last draw a deep breath lad thou art -- thou must not leave we company allan wilt thou not stay with we here in the sweet green forest truly i do feel my heart go out toward thee with great love then allan take robin 's hand and kiss it i will stay with thee always dear master say he for never have i know such kindness as thou hast show I this day then will scarlet stretch forth he hand and shake allan 's in token of fellowship as do little john likewise and thus the famous allan a dale become one of robin hood 's band robin hood seek the curtal friar the stout yeoman of sherwood forest be ever early riser of a morn more especially when the summertime have come for then in the freshness of the dawn the dew be always the brightest and the song of the small bird the sweetest quoth robin now will i go to seek this same friar of fountain abbey of whom we speak yesternight and i will take with I four of my good man and these four shall be little john will scarlet david of doncaster and arthur a bland bide the rest of you here and will stutely shall be you chief while i be go then straightway robin hood don a fine steel coat of chain mail over which he put on a light jacket of lincoln green upon he head he clap a steel cap and this he cover by one of soft white leather in which stand a nodding cock 's plume by he side he hang a good broadsword of temper steel the bluish blade mark all over with strange figure of dragon wing woman and what not a gallant sight be robin so arrayed i wot the glint of steel show here and there as the sunlight catch brightly the link of polished mail that show beneath he green coat so have array himself he and the four yeomen set forth upon they way will scarlet take the lead for he know better than the other whither to go thus mile after mile they stride along now across a brawling stream now along a sunlit road now adown some sweet forest path over which the tree meet in green and rustling canopy and at the end of which a herd of startled deer dash away with rattle of leaf and crackle of branch onward they walk with song and jest and laughter till noontide be pass when at last they come to the bank of a wide glassy and lily-padded stream here a broad beaten path stretch along beside the bank on which path labor the horse that tug at the slow-moving barge laden with barley meal or what not from the countryside to the many-towered town but now in the hot silence of the midday no horse be see nor any man besides themselves behind they and before they stretch the river its placid bosom ruffle here and there by the purple dusk of a small breeze now good uncle quoth will scarlet at last when they have walk for a long time beside this sweet bright river just beyond yon bend ahead of we be a shallow ford which in no place be deeper than thy mid-thigh and upon the other side of the stream be a certain little hermitage hide amidst the bosky tangle of the thicket wherein dwelleth the friar of fountain dale thither will i lead thee for i know the way albeit it be not overhard to find nay quoth jolly robin stop suddenly have i think that i should have have to wade water even be it so crystal a stream as this i have don other clothes than i have upon I but no matter now for after all a wetting will not wash the skin away and what must be must but bide ye here lad for i would enjoy this merry adventure alone nevertheless listen well and if ye hear I sound upon my bugle horn come quickly so say he turn and leave they stride onward alone robin have walk no farther than where the bend of the road hide he good man from he view when he stop suddenly for he think that he hear voice he stand still and listen and presently hear word pass back and forth betwixt what seem to be two man and yet the two voice be wondrously alike the sound come from over behind the bank that here be steep and high drop from the edge of the road a half a score of foot to the sedgy verge of the river ` tis strange muttered robin to himself after a space when the voice have cease they talk surely there be two people that speak the one to the other and yet methink they voice be mightily alike i make my vow that never have i hear the like in all my life before truly if this twain be to be judge by they voice no two pea be ever more alike i will look into this matter so say he come softly to the river bank and lay he down upon the grass peer over the edge and down below all be cool and shady beneath the bank a stout osier grow not straight upward but lean across the water shadow the spot with its soft foliage all around grow a mass of feathery fern such as hide and nestle in cool place and up to robin 's nostril come the tender odor of the wild thyme that love the moist verge of run stream here with he broad back against the rugged trunk of the willow tree and half hide by the soft fern around he sit a stout brawny fellow but no other man be there he head be as round as a ball and cover with a mat of close-clipped curly black hair that grow low down on he forehead but he crown be shear as smooth as the palm of one 's hand which together with he loose robe cowl and string of bead show that which he look never would have do that he be a friar he cheek be as red and shine as a winter crab albeit they be nearly cover over with a close curly black beard as be he chin and upper lip likewise he neck be thick like that of a north country bull and he round head closely set upon shoulder e ` en a match for those of little john himself beneath he bushy black brow dance a pair of little gray eye that could not stand still for very drollery of humor no man could look into he face and not feel he heartstrings tickle by the merriment of they look by he side lay a steel cap which he have lay off for the sake of the coolness to he crown he leg be stretch wide apart and betwixt he knee he hold a great pasty compound of juicy meat of diver kind make savory with tender young onion both meat and onion be mingle with a good rich gravy in he right fist he hold a great piece of brown crust at which he munch sturdily and every now and then he thrust he left hand into the pie and draw it forth full of meat anon he would take a mighty pull at a great bottle of malmsey that lay beside he by my faith quoth robin to himself i do verily believe that this be the merriest feast the merriest wight the merriest place and the merriest sight in all merry england methought there be another here but it must have be this holy man talk to himself so robin lay watch the friar and the friar all unknow that he be so overlook eat he meal placidly at last he be do and have first wipe he greasy hand upon the fern and wild thyme -lrb- and sweeter napkin ne'er have king in all the world -rrb- he take up he flask and begin talk to himself as though he be another man and answer himself as though he be somebody else dear

he mouth to keep it from burst forth for truly he would not have spoil such a goodly jest for the half of nottinghamshire have get he breath from he last draught the friar begin talk again in this wise : now sweet lad canst thou not sing I a song la i know not i be but in a ill voice this day prythee ask I not dost thou not hear how i croak like a frog nay nay thy voice be as sweet as any bullfinch come sing i prythee i would rather hear thee sing than eat a fair feast alas i would fain not sing before one that can pipe so well and have hear so many goodly song and ballad ne'ertheless a thou wilt have it so i will do my best but now methink that thou and i might sing some fair song together dost thou not know a certain dainty little catch call ` the loving youth and the scornful

in haste today nor have i make up my mind _ _ and if thou only wilt stay with I i 'll love no other sweet lad but thee _ here robin could contain himself no longer but burst forth into a mighty roar of laughter then the holy friar keep on with the song he join in the chorus and together they sing or as one might say bellow : _ so it be hark hark hark to the joyous lark and it be hark to the cooing dive for the bright daffodil groweth down by the rill and i 'll be thine own true love _ so they sing together for the stout friar do not seem to have hear robin 's laughter neither do he seem to know that the yeoman have join in with the song but with eye half close look straight before he and wag he round head from side to side in time to the music he keep on bravely to the end he and robin finish up with a mighty roar that might have be hear a mile but no sooner have the last word be sing than the holy man seize he steel cap clap it on he head and spring to he foot cry in a great voice what spy have we here come forth thou limb of evil and i will carve thee into as fine pudding meat as e'er a wife in yorkshire cook of a Sunday hereupon he draw from beneath he robe a great broadsword full as stout as be robin 's nay put up thy pinking iron friend quoth robin stand up with the tear of laughter still on he cheek folk who have sing so sweetly together should not fight thereafter hereupon he leap down the bank to where the other stand i tell thee friend say he my throat be as parched with that song as e'er a barley stubble in October hast thou haply any malmsey leave in that stout pottle truly say the friar in a glum voice thou dost ask thyself freely where thou art not bid yet i trust i be too good a christian to refuse any man drink that be athirst such as there be o ' t thou art welcome to a drink of the same and he hold the pottle out to robin robin take it without more ado and put it to he lip tilted he head back while that which be within say glug lug glug for more than three wink i wot the stout friar watch robin anxiously the while and when he be do take the pottle quickly he shake it hold it betwixt he eye and the light look reproachfully at the yeoman and straightway place it at he own lip when it come away again there be nought within it doss thou know the country hereabouts thou good and holy man ask robin laughing yea somewhat answer the other dryly and dost thou know of a certain spot call fountain abbey yea somewhat then perchance thou knowest also of a certain one who goeth by the name of the curtal friar of fountain abbey yea somewhat well then good fellow holy father or whatever thou art quoth robin i would know whether this same friar be to be find upon this side of the river or the other that quoth the friar be a practical question upon which the cunning rule appertain to logic touch not i do advise thee to find that out by the aid of thine own five sens sight feeling and what not i do wish much quoth robin look thoughtfully at the stout priest to cross yon ford and strive to find this same good friar truly say the other piously it be a goodly wish on the part of one so young far be it from I to check thee in so holy a quest friend the river be free to all yea good father say robin but thou seest that my clothes be of the finest and i fain would not get they wet methink thy shoulder be stout and broad couldst thou not find it in thy heart to carry I across now by the white hand of the holy lady of the fountain burst forth the friar in a mighty rage dost thou thou poor puny stripling thou kiss-my-lady-la poppenjay thou -- thou what shall i call thee dost thou ask I the holy tuck to carry thee now i swear -- here he pause suddenly then slowly the anger pass from he face and he little eye twinkle once more but why should i not quoth he piously do not the holy saint christopher ever carry the stranger across the river and should i poor sinner that i be be ashamed to do likewise come with I stranger and i will do thy bidding in a humble frame of mind so say he clamber up the bank closely follow by robin and lead the way to the shallow pebbly ford chuckle to himself the while as though he be enjoy some goodly jest within himself have come to the ford he gird up he robe about he loin tuck he good broadsword beneath he arm and stoop he back to take robin upon it suddenly he straighten up methink quoth he thou ` lt get thy weapon wet let I tuck it beneath mine arm along with mine own nay good father say robin i would not burden thee with aught of mine but myself dost thou think say the friar mildly that the good saint christopher would ha ' seek he own ease so nay give I thy tool as i bid thee for i would carry it as a penance to my pride upon this without more ado robin hood unbuckle he sword from he side and hand it to the other who thrust it with he own beneath he arm then once more the friar bent he back and robin have mount upon it he step sturdily into the water and so stride onward splash in the shoal and break all the smooth surface into ever - widen ring at last he reach the other side and robin leap lightly from he back many thanks good father quoth he thou art indeed a good and holy man prythee give I my sword and let I away for i be in haste at this the stout friar look upon robin for a long time he head on one side and with a most waggish twist to he face then he slowly wink he right eye nay good youth say he gently i doubt not that thou art in haste with thine affair yet thou dost think nothing of mine thine be of a carnal nature mine be of a spiritual nature a holy work so to speak moreover mine affair do lie upon the other side of this stream i see by thy quest of this same holy recluse that thou art a good young man and most reverent to the cloth i do get wet come hither and be sadly afraid that should i wade the water again i might get certain crick and pain i ' the joint that would mar my devotions for many a day to

that not one of thy cloth have so hoodwink I in all my life before i might have know from thy look that thou wert no such holy man as thou didst pretend to be nay interrupted the friar i bid thee speak not so scurrilously neither lest thou mayst perchance feel the prick of a inch or so of blue steel tut tut say robin speak not so friar the loser have ever the right to use he tongue as he doth list give I my sword i do promise to carry thee back straightway nay i will not lift the weapon against thee marry come up quoth the friar i fear thee not fellow here be thy skewer and get thyself presently ready for i would hasten back so robin take he sword again and buckle it at he side then he bent he stout back and take the friar upon it now i wot robin hood have a heavier load to carry in the friar than the friar have in he moreover he do not know the ford so he go stumble among the stone now step into a deep hole and now nearly trip over a boulder while the sweat run down he face in bead from the hardness of he journey and the heaviness of he load meantime the friar keep digging he heel into robin 's side and bidding he hasten call he many ill name the while to all this robin answer never a word but have softly feel around till he find the buckle of the belt that hold the friar 's sword he work slyly at the fastening seek to loosen they thus it come about that by the time he have reach the other bank with he load the friar 's sword belt be loose albeit he know it not so when robin stand on dry land and the friar leap from he back the yeoman grip hold of the sword so that blade sheath and strap come away from the holy man leave he without a weapon now then quoth merry robin panting as he speak and wipe the sweat from he brow i have thee fellow this time that same saint of whom thou didst speak but now have deliver two sword into my hand and have strip thine away from thee now if thou dost not carry I back and that speedily i swear i will prick thy skin till it be as full of hole as a slash doublet the good friar say not a word for a while but he look at robin with a grim look now say he at last i do think that thy wit be of the heavy sort and know not that thou wert so cunning truly thou hast I upon the hip give I my sword and i promise not to draw it against thee save in self-defense also i promise to do thy bidding and take thee upon my back and carry thee so jolly robin give he he sword again which the friar buckle to he side and this time look to it that it be more secure in its fastening then tuck up he robe once more he take robin hood upon he back and without a word step into the water and so wade on in silence while robin sit laugh upon he back at last he reach the middle of the ford where the water be deepest here he stop for a moment and then with a sudden lift of he hand and heave of he shoulder fairly shoot robin over he head as though he be a sack of grain down go robin into the water with a mighty splash there quoth the holy man calmly turn back again to the shore let that cool thy hot spirit if it may meantime after much splashing robin have get to he foot and stand gaze about he all bewilder the water run from he in pretty little rill at last he shoot the water out of he ear and spit some out of he mouth and gather he scattered wit together see the stout friar standing on the bank and laugh then i wot be robin hood a mad man stay thou villain roar he i be after thee straight and if i do not carve thy brawn for thee this day may i never lift finger again so say he dash splash to the bank thou needst not hasten thyself unduly quoth the stout friar fear not i will abide here and if thou dost not cry ` alack-a-day ' ere long time be go may i never more peep through the brake at a fallow deer and now robin have reach the bank begin without more ado to roll up he sleeve above he wrist the friar also tuck he robe more about he show a great stout arm on which the muscle stand out like hump of a aged tree then robin see what he have not wott of before that the friar have also a coat of chain mail beneath he gown look to thyself cry robin draw he good sword ay marry quoth the friar who hold he already in he hand so without more ado they come together and thereupon begin a fierce and mighty battle right and leave and up and down and back and forth they fight the sword flash in the sun and then meet with a clash that sound far and near i wot this be no playful bout at quarterstaff but a grim and serious fight of real earnest thus they strive for a hour or more pause every now and then to rest at which time each look at the other with wonder and think that never have he see so stout a fellow then once again they would go at it more fiercely than ever yet in all this time neither have harm the other nor cause he blood to flow at last merry robin cry hold thy hand good friend whereupon both lower they sword now i crave a boon ere we begin again quoth robin wipe the sweat from he brow for they have strive so long that he begin to think that it would be a ill-done thing either to be smitten himself or to smite so stout and brave a fellow what wouldst thou have of I ask the friar only this quoth robin that thou wilt let I blow thrice upon my bugle horn the friar bent he brow and look shrewdly at robin hood now i do verily think that thou hast some cunning trick in this quoth he ne'ertheless i fear thee not and will let thee have thy wish provide thou wilt also let I blow thrice upon this little whistle with all my heart quoth robin so here go for one so say he raise he silver horn to he lip and blow thrice upon it clear and high meantime the friar stand watch keenly for what might come to pass hold in he finger the while a pretty silver whistle such as knight use for call they hawk back to they wrist which whistle always hang at he girdle along with he rosary scarcely have the echo of the last note of robin 's bugle come wind back from across the river when four tall man in lincoln green come run around the bend of the road each with a bow in he hand and a arrow ready nocked upon the string ha be it thus thou traitor knave cry the friar then marry look to thyself so say he straightway clap the hawk 's whistle to he lip and blow a blast that be both loud and shrill and now there come a crackling of the bush that line the other side of the road and presently forth from the covert burst four great shaggy hound at 'em sweet lip at 'em bell throat at 'em beauty at 'em fang cry the friar point at robin and now it be well for that yeoman that a tree stand nigh he beside the road else have he have a ill chance of it ere one could say gaffer downthedale the hound be upon he and he have only time to drop he sword and leap lightly into the tree around which the hound gather look up at he as though he be a cat on the eaves but the friar quickly call off he dog at 'em cry he point down the road to where the yeoman be stand stock still with wonder of what they see as the hawk dart down upon its quarry so speed the four dog at the yeoman but when the four man see the hound so come all with one accord save only will scarlet draw each man he goose feather to he ear and let fly he shaft and now the old ballad telleth of a wondrous thing that happen for thus it say that each dog so shot at leap lightly aside and as the arrow pass he whistle catch it in he mouth and bit it in twain now it would have be a ill day for these four good fellow have not will scarlet step before the other and meet the hound as they come rush why how now

midst of which be allan a dale and friar tuck he lead they forth upon they way from the forest shades so they walk on for a long time till they have come out of sherwood and to the vale of rotherstream here be different sight from what one saw in the forest hedgerow broad field of barley corn pasture land roll upward till they meet the sky and all dot over with flock of white sheep hayfield whence come the odor of new-mown hay that lay in smooth swath over which skim the swift in rapid flight such they see and different be it i wot from the tangled depths of the sweet woodland but full as fair thus robin lead he band walk blithely with chest throw out and head throw back snuff the odor of the gentle breeze that come drift from over the hayfield truly quoth he the dear world be as fair here as in the woodland shades who call it a vale of tear methink it be but the darkness in we mind that bringeth gloom to the world for what sayeth that merry song thou singest little john be it not thus _ for when my love 's eye do thine do thine and when she lip smile so rare the day it be jocund and fine so fine though let it be wet or be fair and when the stout ale be all flow so fast we sorrow and trouble be thing of the past _ nay say friar tuck piously ye do think of profane thing and of nought else yet truly there be better safeguard against care and woe than ale drinking and bright eye to wit fasting and meditation look upon I have i the likeness of a sorrowful man at this a great shout of laughter go up from all around for the night before the stout friar have empty twice as many canakin of ale as any one of all the merry man truly quoth robin when he could speak for laughter i should say that thy sorrow be about equal to thy goodliness so they step along talk singing jesting and laugh until they have come to a certain little church that belong to the great estate own by the rich priory of emmet here it be that fair ellen be to be marry on that morn and here be the spot toward which the yeoman have point they toe on the other side of the road from where the church stand with wave field of barley around run a stone wall along the roadside over the wall from the highway be a fringe of young tree and bush and here and there the wall itself be cover by a mass of blossom woodbine that fill all the warm air far and near with its sweet summer odor then straightway the yeomen leap over the wall alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side frightening a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scamper away in all direction here be a sweet cool shadow both from the wall and from the fair young tree and bush and here sit the yeoman down and glad enough they be to rest after they long tramp of the morning now quoth robin i would have one of you watch and tell I when he see anyone come to the church and the one i choose shall be young david of doncaster so get thee upon the wall david and hide beneath the woodbine so as to keep watch accordingly young david do as he be bid the other stretch themselves at length upon the grass some talk together and other sleep then all be quiet save only for the low voice of those that talk together and for allan 's restless footstep pacing up and down for he soul be so full of disturbance that he could not stand still and save also for the mellow snore of friar tuck who enjoy he sleep with a noise as of one saw soft wood very slowly robin lay upon he back and gaze aloft into the leaf of the tree he thought league away and so a long time pass then up speak robin now tell we young david of doncaster what dost thou see then david answer i see the white cloud float and i feel the wind a-blowing and three black crow be fly over the wold but nought else do i see good master so silence fall again and another time pass break only as i have say till robin grow impatient spake again now tell I young david what dost thou see by this and david answer i see the windmill swing and three tall poplar tree sway against the sky and a flock of fieldfare be fly over the hill but nought else do i see good master so another time pass till at last robin ask young david once more what he see and david say i hear the cuckoo singing and i see how the wind make wave in the barley field and now over the hill to the church cometh a old friar and in he hand he carry a great bunch of key and lo now he cometh to the church door then up rise robin hood and shake friar tuck by the shoulder come rouse thee holy man cry he whereupon with much grunt the stout tuck get to he foot marry bestir thyself quoth robin for yonder in the church door be one of thy cloth go thou and talk to he and so get thyself into the church that thou mayst be there when thou art want meantime little john will stutely and i will follow thee anon so friar tuck clamber over the wall cross the road and come to the church where the old friar be still labor with the great key the lock be somewhat rusty and he somewhat old and feeble hilloa brother quoth tuck let I aid thee so say he take the key from the other 's hand and quickly open the door with a turn of it who art thou good brother ask the old friar in a high wheeze voice whence comest thou and whither art thou go and he wink and blink at stout friar tuck like a owl at the sun thus do i answer thy question brother say the other my name be tuck and i go no farther than this spot if thou wilt haply but let I stay while this same wedding be go forward i come from fountain dale and in truth be a certain poor hermit as one may say for i live in a cell beside the fountain bless by that holy saint ethelrada but if i understand aught there be to be a gay wedding here today so if thou mindest not i would fain rest I in the cool shade within for i would like to see this fine sight truly thou art welcome brother say the old man lead the way within meantime robin hood in he guise of harper together with little john and will stutely have come to the church robin sit he down on a bench beside the door but little john carry the two bag of gold go within as do will stutely so robin sit by the door look up the road and down the road to see who might come till after a time he see six horseman come ride sedately and slowly as become they for they be churchman in high order then when they have come nearer robin saw who they be and know they the first be the bishop of hereford and a fine figure he cut i wot he vestment be of the richest silk and around he neck be a fair chain of beaten gold the cap that hide he tonsure be of black velvet and around the edge of it be row of jewel that flash in the sunlight each stone be set in gold he hose be of flame-colored silk and he shoe of black velvet the long pointed toe be turn up and fasten to he knee and on either instep be embroider a cross in gold thread beside the bishop ride the prior of emmet upon a mincing palfrey rich be he clothes also but not so gay as the stout bishop 's behind these be two of the higher brethren of emmet and behind these again two retainer belong to the bishop for the lord bishop of hereford strove to be as like the great baron as be in the power of one in holy order when robin see this train drawing near with flash of jewel and silk and jingle of silver bell on the trappings of the nag he look sourly upon they quoth he to himself yon bishop be overgaudy for a holy man i do wonder whether he patron who methink be saint thoma be give to wear golden chain about he neck silk clothing upon he body and point shoe upon he foot the money for all of which god wot have be wring from the sweat of poor tenant bishop bishop thy pride may have a fall ere thou wottest of it so the holy man come to the church the bishop and the prior jesting and laughing between themselves about certain fair dame they word more befitting the lip of layman methink than holy clerk then they dismount and the bishop look around presently catch sight of robin standing in the doorway hilloa good fellow quoth he in a jovial voice who art thou that struttest in such gay feather a harper be i from the north country quoth robin and i can touch the string i wot as never another man in all merry england can do truly good lord bishop many a knight and burgher clerk and layman have dance to my music willy-nilly and most time greatly against they will such be the magic of my harping now this day my lord bishop if i may play at this wedding i do promise that i will cause the fair bride to love the man she marry with a love that shall last as long as that twain shall live together ha be it so cry the bishop meanest thou this in sooth and he look keenly at robin who gaze boldly back again into he eye now if thou wilt cause this maiden -lrb- who have verily bewitch my poor cousin stephen -rrb- thus to love the man she be to marry as thou sayst thou canst i will give thee whatsoever thou wilt ask I in due measure let I have a taste of thy skill fellow nay quoth robin my music cometh not without i choose even at a lord bishop 's bidding in sooth i will not play until the bride and bridegroom come now thou art a saucy varlet to speak so to my crest quoth the bishop frown on robin yet i must need bear with thee look prior hither cometh we cousin sir stephen and he ladylove and now around the bend of the highroad come other ride upon horse the first of all be a tall thin man of knightly bearing dress all in black silk with a black velvet cap upon he head turn up with scarlet robin look and have no doubt that this be sir stephen both because of he knightly carriage and of he gray hair beside he ride a stout saxon franklin ellen 's father edward of deirwold behind those two come a litter bear by two horse and therein be a maiden whom robin know must be ellen behind this litter ride six man-at-arms the sunlight flash on they steel cap as they come jingle up the dusty road so these also come to the church and there sir stephen leap from he horse and come to the litter hand fair ellen out therefrom then robin hood look at she and could wonder no longer how it come about that so proud a knight as sir stephen of trent wish to marry a common franklin 's daughter nor do he wonder that no ado be make about the matter for she be the fairest maiden that ever he have behold now however she be all pale and droop like a fair white lily snap at the stem and so with bent head and sorrowful look she go within the church sir stephen lead she by the hand why dost thou not play fellow quoth the bishop look sternly at robin marry say robin calmly i will play in greater wise than you lordship think but not till the right time have come say the bishop to himself while he look grimly at robin when this wedding be go by i will have this fellow well whip for he saucy tongue and bold speech and now fair ellen and sir stephen stand before the altar and the bishop himself come in he robe and open he book whereat fair ellen look up and about she in bitter despair like the fawn that find the hound on she haunch then in all he flutter tag and ribbon of red and yellow robin hood stride forward three step he take from the pillar whereby he lean and stand between the bride and bridegroom let I look upon this lass he say in a loud voice why how now what have we here here be lily in the cheek and not rose such as befit a bonny

three blast so loud and clear they echo from floor to rafter as though they be sound by the trump of doom then straightway little john and will stutely come leap and stand upon either side of robin hood and quickly draw they broadsword the while a mighty voice roll over the head of all here be i good master when thou wantest I for it be friar tuck that so call from the organ loft and now all be

lincoln green with allan a dale at they head in he hand he bear robin hood 's good stout trusty bow of yew and this he give to he kneel the while upon one knee then up spake edward of deirwold in a

thereby i tell thee plainly i love thy daughter old as i be and would have take she up like a jewel from the sty yet truly i know not that she do love this fellow and be beloved by he maiden if thou dost rather choose a beggarly minstrel than a high-born knight take thy choice i do feel it shame that i should thus stand talk amid this herd and so i will leave you thus say he turn and gather he man about he walk proudly down the aisle then all the yeoman be silence by the scorn of he word only friar tuck lean over the edge of the choir loft and call out to he ere he have go good den sir knight thou wottest old bone must alway make room for young blood sir stephen neither answer nor look up but pass out from the church as though he have hear nought he man follow he then the bishop of

to say to thee the bishop 's face fall but he stay as robin bid he for he see he could not go then robin hood turn to stout edward of deirwold and say he give thy blessing on thy daughter 's marriage to this yeoman and all will be well little john give I the bag of gold look farmer here be two hundred bright golden angel give thy blessing as i say and i will count they out to thee as thy daughter

have think to make a lady of she yet if she choose to be what she be like to be i have nought to do with she henceforth ne'ertheless i will give she my blessing when she be duly wed it may not be

old ballad lest three time should not be enough he publish they nine time o'er then straightway he come down from the loft and forthwith perform the marriage service and so allan and ellen be duly wed and now robin count out two hundred golden angel to edward of deirwold and he upon he part give he blessing yet not i wot as though he mean it with overmuch good will then the stout yeoman crowd around and grasp allan 's palm and he hold ellen 's hand within he own look about he all dizzy with he happiness then at last jolly robin turn to the bishop of hereford who have be look on at all that pass with a grim look my lord bishop quoth he thou mayst bring to thy mind that thou didst promise I that do i play in such wise as to cause this fair lass to love she husband thou wouldst give I whatsoever i ask in reason i have play my play and she loveth she husband which she would not have do but for I so now fulfill thy promise thou hast upon thee that which methink thou wouldst be the better without therefore i prythee give I that golden chain that hangeth about thy neck as a wedding present for this fair bride then the bishop 's cheek grow red with rage and he eye flash he look at robin with a fell look but see that in the yeoman 's face which bid he pause then slowly he take the chain from about he neck and hand it to robin who fling it over ellen 's head so that it hang glitter about she shoulder then say merry robin i thank thee on the bride 's part for thy handsome gift and truly thou thyself art more seemly without it now shouldst thou ever come nigh to sherwood i much hope that i shall give thee there such a feast as thou hast ne'er have in all thy life before may heaven forfend cry the bishop earnestly for he know right well what manner of feast it be that robin hood give he guest in sherwood forest but now robin hood gather he man together and with allan and he young bride in they midst they all turn they footstep toward the woodland on the way thither friar tuck come close to robin and pluck he by the sleeve thou dost lead a merry life good master quoth he but dost thou not think that it would be for the welfare of all you soul to have a good stout chaplain such as i to oversee holy matter truly i do love this life mightily at this merry robin hood laugh amain and bid he stay and become one of they band if he wish that night there be such a feast hold in the greenwood as nottinghamshire never see before to that feast you and i be not bid and pity it be that we be not so lest we should both feel the matter the more keenly i will say no more about it robin hood aid a sorrowful knight so pass the gentle springtime away in bud beauty its silver shower and sunshine its green meadow and its flower so likewise pass the summer with its yellow sunlight its quivering heat and deep bosky foliage its long twilight and its mellow night through which the frog croak and fairy folk be say to be out on the hillside all this have pass and the time of fall have come bring with it its own pleasure and joyousness for now when the harvest be gather home merry band of gleaner roam the country about singing along the road in the daytime and sleep beneath the hedgerow and the hay-rick at night now the hip burn red in the tangled thicket and the hew wax black in the hedgerow the stubble lay all crisp and naked to the sky and the green leaf be fast turn russet and brown also at this merry season good thing of the year be gather in in great store brown ale lie ripen in the cellar ham and bacon hang in the smoke-shed and crab be stow away in the straw for roast in the wintertime when the north wind pile the snow in drift around the gable and the fire crackle warm upon the hearth so pass the season then so they pass now and so they will pass in time to come while we come and go like leaf of the tree that fall and be soon forget quoth robin hood snuff the air here be a fair day little john and one that we can ill waste in idleness choose such man as thou dost need and go thou east while i will wend to the west and see that each of we bringeth back some goodly guest to dine this day beneath the greenwood tree marry cry little john clap he palm together for joy thy bidding fitteth my liking like heft to blade i 'll bring thee back a guest this day or come not back mine own self then they each choose such of the band as they wish and so go forth by different path from the forest now you and i can not go two way at the same time while we join in these merry doings so we will e ` en let little john follow he own path while we tuck up we skirt and trudge after robin hood and here be good company too robin hood will scarlet allan a dale will scathelock midge the miller 's son and other a score or more of stout fellow have abide in the forest with friar tuck to make ready for the homecoming but all the rest be go either with robin hood or little john they travel onward robin follow he fancy and the other follow robin now they wend they way through a open dale with cottage and farm lie therein and now again they enter woodland once more pass by fair mansfield town with its tower and battlements and spire all smile in the sun they come at last out of the forest land onward they journey through highway and byway through village where goodwife and merry lass peep through the casement at the fine show of young man until at last they come over beyond alverton in derbyshire by this time high noontide have come yet they have meet no guest such as be worth they while to take back to sherwood so come at last to a certain spot where a shrine stand at the cross of two road robin call upon they to stop for here on either side be shelter of high hedgerow behind which be good hiding whence they could watch the road at they ease while they eat they midday meal quoth merry robin here methink be good lodging where peaceful folk such as we be can eat in quietness therefore we will rest here and see what may perchance fall into we luck-pot so they cross a stile and come behind a hedgerow where the mellow sunlight be bright and warm and where the grass be soft and there sit they down then each man draw from the pouch that hang beside he that which he have bring to eat for a merry walk such as this have be sharpen the appetite till it be as keen as a march wind so no more word be speak but each man save he tooth for better use -- munch at brown crust and cold meat right lustily in front of they one of the highroad crawl up the steep hill and then dip suddenly over its crest sharp-cut with hedgerow and shaggy grass against the sky over the top of the windy hill peep the eaves of a few house of the village that fall back into the valley behind there also show the top of a windmill the sail slowly rise and dip from behind the hill against the clear blue sky as the light wind move they with creak and labor swing so the yeomen lay behind the hedge and finish they midday meal but still the time slip along and no one come at last a man come slowly ride over the hill and down the stony road toward the spot where robin and he band lay hide he be a good stout knight but sorrowful of face and downcast of mien he clothes be plain and rich but no chain of gold such as folk of he stand in life wear at most time hang around he neck and no jewel be about he yet no one could mistake he for aught but one of proud and noble blood he head be bow upon he breast and he hand droop limp on either side and so he come slowly ride as though sink in sad thought while even he good horse the rein loose upon he neck walk with hang head as though he share he master 's grief quoth robin hood yon be verily a sorry-looking gallant and doth seem to have don ill-content with he jerkin this morning nevertheless i will out and talk with he for there may be some pickings here for a hungry daw methink he dress be rich though he himself be so downcast bide ye here till i look into this matter so say he arise and leave they cross the road to the shrine and there stand wait for the sorrowful knight to come near he so presently when the knight come ride slowly along jolly robin step forward and lay he hand upon the bridle rein hold sir knight quoth he i prythee tarry for a short time for i have a few word to say to thee what art thou friend who dost stop a traveler in this manner upon he most gracious majesty 's highway say the knight marry quoth robin that be a question hard to answer one man calleth I kind another calleth I cruel this one calleth I good honest fellow and that one vile thief truly the world have as many eye to look upon a man withal as there be spot on a toad so with what pair of eye thou regardest I lieth entirely with thine own self my name be robin hood truly good robin say the knight a smile twitch at the corner of he mouth thou hast a quaint conceit as for the pair of eye with which i regard thee i would say that they be as favorable as may be for i hear much good of thee and little ill what be thy will of I now i make my vow sir knight quoth robin thou hast surely learn thy wisdom of good gaffer swanthold for he sayeth ` fair word be as easy speak as foul and bring good will in the stead of blow ' now i will show thee the truth of this say for if thou wilt go with I this day to sherwood forest i will give thee as merry a feast as ever thou hadst in all thy life thou art indeed kind say the knight but methink thou wilt find I but a ill-seeming and sorrowful guest thou hadst best let I pass on my way in peace nay quoth robin thou mightst go thine own way but for one thing and that i will tell thee we keep a inn as it be in the very depths of sherwood but so far from highroad and beat path that guest do not often come nigh we so i and my friend set off merrily and seek they when we grow dull of ourselves thus the matter stand sir knight yet i will furthermore tell thee that we count upon we guest pay a reckoning i take thy meaning friend say the knight gravely but i be not thy man for i have no money by I be it sooth say robin look at the knight keenly i can scarce choose but believe thee yet sir knight there be those of thy order whose word be not to be trust as much as they would have other believe thou wilt think no ill if i look for myself in this matter then still hold the horse by the bridle rein he put he finger to he lip and blow a shrill whistle whereupon fourscore yeoman come leap over the stile and run to where the knight and robin stand these say robin look upon they proudly be some of my merry man they share and share alike with I all joy and trouble gain and loss sir knight i prythee tell I what money thou hast about thee for a time the knight say not a word but a slow red arise into he cheek at last he look robin in the face and say i know not why i should be ashamed for it should be no shame to I but friend i tell thee the truth when i say that in my purse be ten shilling and that that be every groat that sir richard of the lea have in all the wide world when sir richard end a silence fall until at last robin say and dost thou pledge I thy knightly word that this be all thou hast with thee yea answer sir richard i do pledge thee my most solemn word as a true knight that it be all the money i have in the world nay here be my purse ye may find for yourselve the truth of what i say and he hold he purse out to robin put up thy purse sir richard quoth robin far be it from I to doubt the word of so gentle a knight the proud i strive to bring low but those that walk in sorrow i would aid if i could come sir richard cheer up thy heart and go with we into the greenwood even i may perchance aid thee for thou surely knowest how the good athelstane be save by the little blind mole that dig a trench over which he that seek the king 's life stumble truly friend say sir richard methink thou meanest kindness in thine own way nevertheless my trouble be such that it be not likely that thou canst cure they but i will go with thee this day into sherwood hereupon he turn he horse 's head and they all wend they way to the woodland robin walk on one side of the knight and will scarlet on the other while the rest of the band trudge behind after they have travel thus for a time robin hood spake sir knight say he i would not trouble thee with idle question but dost thou find it in thy heart to tell I thy sorrow truly robin quoth the knight i see no reason why i should not do so thus it be : my castle and my land be in pawn for a debt that i owe three day hence the money must be pay or else all mine estate be lose forever for then it fall into the hand of the priory of emmet and what they swallow they never give forth again quoth robin i understand not why those of thy kind live in such a manner that all they wealth passeth from they like snow beneath the springtide sun thou wrongest I robin say the knight for listen : i have a son but twenty winter old nevertheless he have win he spur as knight last year on a certain evil day the joust be hold at chester and thither my son go as do i and my lady wife i wot it be a proud time for we for he unhorse each knight that he tilted against at last he run a course with a certain great knight sir walter of lancaster yet though my son be so youthful he keep he seat albeit both spear be shiver to the heft but it happen that a splinter of my boy 's lance run through the visor of sir walter 's helmet and pierce through he eye into he brain so that he die ere he esquire could unlace he helm now robin sir walter have great friend at court therefore he kinsman stir up thing against my son so that to save he from prison i have to pay a ransom of six hundred pound in gold all might have go well even yet only that by in and out and crookedness of law i be shear like a sheep that be clip to the quick so it come that i have to pawn my land to the priory of emmet for more money and a hard bargain they drive with I in my hour of need yet i would have thee understand i grieve so for my land only because of my dear lady wife but where be thy son now ask robin who have listen closely to all the knight have say in palestine say sir richard battle like a brave christian soldier for the cross and the holy sepulcher truly england be a ill place for he because of sir walter 's death and the hate of the

deerskin thereon then robin bid he guest be seat and so they all three sit down some of the chief man such as little john will scarlet allan a dale and other stretch themselves upon the ground near by then a garland be set up at the far end of the glade and thereat the bowman shot and such shooting be do that day as it would have make one 's heart leap to see and all the while robin talk so quaintly to the bishop and the knight that the one forget he vexation and the other he trouble they both laugh aloud again and again then allan a dale come forth and tune he harp and all be hush around and he sing in he wondrous voice song of love of war of glory and of sadness and all listen without a movement or a sound so allan sing till the great round silver moon gleam with its clear

dish that send savory smell far and near stand along the white linen cloth spread on the grass all around be a glare of torch that light everything up with a red light then straightway sit down all fall to with noise and hubbub the rattle of platter blend with the sound of loud talking and laughter a long time the feast last but at last all be over and the bright wine and hum ale pass briskly then robin hood call aloud for silence and all be hushed till he speak i have a story to tell you all so listen to what i have to say quoth he whereupon without more ado he tell they all about sir richard and how he land be in pawn but as he go on the bishop 's face that have erst be smile and ruddy with merriment wax serious and he put aside the horn of wine he hold in he hand for he know the story of sir richard and he heart sink within he with grim foreboding then when robin hood have do he turn to the bishop of hereford now my lord bishop say he dost thou not think this be ill do of anyone much more of a churchman who should live in humbleness and charity to this the bishop answer not a word but look upon the ground with moody eye quoth robin now thou art the richest bishop in all england canst thou not help this needy brother but still the bishop answer not a word then robin turn to little john and quoth he go thou and will stutely and bring forth those five pack horse yonder whereupon the two yeoman do as they be bid those about the cloth make room on the green where the light be brightest for the five horse which little john and will stutely presently lead forward who have the score of the goods ask robin hood look at the black friar then up spake the smallest of all in a tremble voice -- a old man he be with a gentle wrinkled face that have i but i pray thee

voice and all hear that this money be the rental and fine and forfeit from certain estate belong to the bishopric of hereford my lord bishop say robin hood i will not strip thee as little john say like a winter hedge for thou shalt take back one third of thy money one third of it thou canst well spare to we for thy entertainment and that of thy train for thou art very rich one third of it thou canst better spare for charity for bishop i hear that thou art a hard master to those beneath thee and a close hoarder of gain that thou couldst better and with more credit to thyself give to charity than spend upon thy own liking at this the bishop look up but he could say never a word yet he be thankful to keep some of he wealth then robin turn to sir richard of the lea and quoth he now sir richard the church seem like to despoil thee therefore some of the overplus of church gain may well be use in aid thee thou shalt take that five hundred pound lay aside for people more in need than the bishop be and shalt pay thy debt to emmet therewith sir richard look at robin until something arise in he eye that make all the light and the face blur together at last he say i thank thee friend from my heart for what thou doest for I yet think not ill if i can not take thy gift freely but this i will do : i will take the money and pay my debt and in a year and a day hence will return it safe either to thee or to the lord bishop of hereford for this i pledge my most solemn knightly word i feel free to borrow for i know no man that should be more bind to aid I than one so high in that church that have drive such a hard bargain truly sir knight quoth robin i do not understand those fine scruple that weigh with those of thy kind but nevertheless it shall all be as thou dost wish but thou hadst best bring the money to I at the end of the year for mayhap i may make better use of it than the bishop thereupon turn to those near he he give he order and five hundred pound be count out and tie up in a leathern bag for sir richard the rest of the treasure be divide and part take to the treasurehouse of the band and part put by with the other thing for the bishop then sir richard arise i can not stay later good friend say he for my lady will wax anxious if i come not home so i crave leave to depart then robin hood and all he merry man arise and robin say we can not let thee go hence unattended sir richard then up spake little john good master let I choose a score of stout fellow from the band and let we arm ourselves in a seemly manner and so serve as retainer to sir

roll of cloth of gold to take home to he noble lady wife as a present from robin hood and he merry man all at this all clap they hand for joy and robin say : thou hast well speak will stutely and it shall be do then sir richard of the lea look all around and strove to speak but could scarcely do so for the feeling that choke he at last he say in a husky tremble voice ye shall all see good friend that sir richard o ' the lea will ever remember you kindness this day and if ye be at any time in dire need or trouble come to I and my lady and the wall of castle lea shall be batter down ere harm shall befall you i -- he could say nothing further but turn hastily away but now little john and nineteen stout fellow whom he have choose for he band come forth all ready for the journey each man wear upon he breast a coat of link mail and on he head a cap of steel and at he side a good stout sword a gallant show they make as they stand all in a row then robin come and throw a chain of gold about sir richard 's neck and will scarlet knelt and buckle the golden spur upon he heel and now little john lead forward sir richard 's horse and the knight mount he look down at robin for a little time then of a sudden stooped and kiss he cheek all the forest glade ring with the shout that go up as the knight and the yeoman march off through the woodland with glare of torch and gleam of steel and so be go then up spake the bishop of hereford in a mournful voice i too must be jogging good fellow for the night wax late but robin lay he hand upon the bishop 's arm and stay he be not so hasty lord bishop say he three day hence sir richard must pay he debt to emmet until that time thou must be content to abide with I lest thou breed trouble for the knight i promise thee that thou shalt have great sport for i know that thou art fond of hunting the dun deer lay by thy mantle of melancholy and strive to lead a joyous yeoman life for three stout day i promise thee thou shalt be sorry to go when the time have come so the bishop and he train abide with robin for three day and much sport he lordship have in that time so that as robin have say when the time have come for he to go he be sorry to leave the greenwood at the end of three day robin set he free and send he forth from the forest with a guard of yeoman to keep freebooter from take what be leave of the pack and bundle but as the bishop ride away he vow within himself that he would sometime make robin rue the day that he stop he in sherwood but now we shall follow sir richard so listen and you shall hear what befall he and how he pay he debt at emmet priory and likewise in due season to robin hood how sir richard of the lea pay he debt the long highway stretch straight on gray and dusty in the sun on either side be dike full of water border by osier and far away in the distance stand the tower of emmet priory with tall poplar tree around along the causeway ride a knight with a score of stout man-at-arms behind he the knight be clothe in a plain long robe of gray serge gather in at the waist with a broad leathern belt from which hang a long dagger and a stout sword but though he be so plainly dress himself the horse he ride be a noble barb and its trappings be rich with silk and silver bell so thus the band journey along the causeway between the dike till at last they reach the great gate of emmet priory there the knight call to one of he man and bid he knock at the porter 's lodge with the heft of he sword the porter be drowse on he bench within the lodge but at the knock he rouse himself and open the wicket come hobble forth and greet the knight while a tame starling that hang in a wicker cage within pipe out _ in coelo quie in coelo quie _ such be the word that the poor old lame porter have teach he to speak where be thy prior ask the knight of the old porter he be at meat good knight and he looketh for thy come quoth the porter for if i mistake not thou art sir richard of the lea i be sir richard of the lea then i will go seek he forthwith say the knight but shall i not send thy horse to stable say the porter by we lady it be the noblest nag and the best harness that e'er i saw in all my life before and he stroke the horse 's flank with he palm nay quoth sir richard the stable of this place be not for I so make way i prythee so say he push forward and the gate be open he enter the stony courtyard of the priory he man behind he in they come with rattle of steel and clashing of sword and ring of horse ' foot on cobblestone whereat a flock of pigeon that strut in the sun fly with flap wing to the high eaves of the round tower while the knight be ride along the causeway to emmet a merry feast be toward in the refectory there the afternoon sun stream in through the great arched window and lay in broad square of light upon the stone floor and across the board cover with a snowy linen cloth whereon be spread a princely feast at the head of the table sit prior vincent of emmet all clothe in soft robe of fine cloth and silk on he head be a black velvet cap pick out with gold and around he neck hang a heavy chain of gold with a great locket pendant therefrom beside he on the arm of he great chair roost he favorite falcon for the prior be fond of the gentle craft of hawk on he right hand sit the sheriff of nottingham in rich robe of purple all trim about with fur and on he leave a famous doctor of law in dark and sober garb below these sit the high cellarer of emmet and other chief among the brethren jest and laughter pass around and all be as merry as merry could be the wizened face of the man of law be twist into a wrinkled smile for in he pouch be fourscore golden angel that the prior have pay he in fee for the case betwixt he and sir richard of the lea the learn doctor have be pay beforehand for he have not overmuch trust in the holy vincent of emmet quoth the sheriff of nottingham but art thou sure sir prior that thou hast the land so safe ay marry say prior vincent smack he lip after a deep draught of wine i have keep a close watch upon he albeit he be unawares of the same and i know right well that he have no money to pay I withal ay true say the man of law in a dry husky voice he land be surely forfeit if he cometh not to pay but sir prior thou must get a release beneath he sign manual or else thou canst not hope to hold the land without trouble from he yea say the prior so thou hast tell I ere now but i know that this knight be so poor that he will gladly sign away he land for two hundred pound of hard money then up speak the high cellarer methink it be a shame to so drive a misfortunate knight to the ditch i think it sorrow that the noblest estate in derbyshire should so pass away from he for a paltry five hundred pound truly i -- how now break in the prior in a quivering voice he eye glisten and he cheek red with anger dost thou prate to my very beard sirrah by saint hubert thou hadst best save thy breath to cool thy pottage else it may scald thy mouth nay say the man of law smoothly i dare swear this same knight will never come to settlement this day but will prove recreant nevertheless we will seek some means to gain he land from he so never fear but even as the doctor speak there come a sudden clatter of horse ' hoof and a jingle of iron mail in the courtyard below then up spake the prior and call upon one of the brethren that sit below the salt and bid he look out of the window and see who be below albeit he know right well it could be none but sir richard so the brother arise and go and look and he say i see below a score of stout man-at-arms and a knight just dismount from he horse he be dress in long robe of gray which methink be of poor seeming but the horse he rideth upon have the richest course that ever i see the knight dismount and they come this way and be even now below in the great hall lo see ye there now quoth prior vincent here ye have a knight with so lean a purse as scarce to buy he a crust of bread to munch yet he keep a band of retainer and put rich trappings upon he horse 's hide while he own back goeth bare be it not well that such man should be bring low but art thou sure say the little doctor tremulously that this knight will do we no harm such as he be fierce when cross and he have a band of naughty man at he heel mayhap thou hadst better give a extension of he debt thus he speak for he be afraid sir richard might do he a harm thou needst not fear say the prior look down at the little man beside he this knight be gentle and would as soon think of harm a old woman as thee as the prior finish a door at the lower end of the refectory swing open and in come sir richard with fold hand and head bow upon he breast thus humbly he walk slowly up the hall while he man-at-arms stand about the door when he have come to where the prior sit he kneel upon one knee save and keep thee sir prior say he i be come to keep my day then the first word that the prior say to he be hast thou bring my money alas i have not so much as one penny upon my body say the knight whereat the prior 's eye sparkle now thou art a shrewd debtor i wot say he then sir sheriff i drink to thee but still the knight kneel upon the hard stone so the prior turn to he again what wouldst thou have quoth he sharply at these word a slow red mount into the knight 's cheek but still he kneel i would crave thy mercy say he as thou hopest for heaven 's mercy show mercy to I strip I not of my land and so reduce a true knight to poverty thy day be broken and thy land forfeit say the man of law pluck up he spirit at the knight 's humble speech quoth sir richard thou man of law wilt thou not befriend I in mine hour of need nay say the other i hold with this holy prior who have pay I my fee in hard gold so that i be bounder to he wilt thou not be my friend sir sheriff say sir richard nay ` fore heaven quoth the sheriff of nottingham this be no business of mine yet i will do what i may and he nudge the prior beneath the cloth with he knee wilt thou not ease he of some of he debt sir prior at this the prior smile grimly pay I three hundred pound sir richard say he and i will give thee quittance of thy debt thou knowest sir prior that it be as easy for I to pay four hundred pound as three hundred say sir richard but wilt thou not give I another twelvemonth to pay my debt not another day say the prior sternly and be this all thou wilt do for I ask the knight now out upon thee false knight cry the prior burst forth in anger either pay thy debt as i have say or release thy land and get thee go from out my hall then sir richard arise to he foot thou false lie priest say he in so stern a voice that the man of law shrink affrighted i be no false knight as thou knowest full well but have even hold my place in the press and the tourney hast thou so little courtesy that thou wouldst see a true knight kneel for all this time or see he come into thy hall and never offer he meat or drink then quoth the man of law in a tremble voice this be surely a ill way to talk of matter appertain to business let we be mild in speech what wilt thou pay this knight sir prior to give thee release of he land i would have give he two hundred pound quoth the prior but since he have speak so vilely to my tooth not one groat over one hundred pound will he get hadst thou offer I a thousand pound false prior say the knight thou wouldst not have get a inch of my land then turn to where he man-at-arms stand near the door he call come hither and beckon with he finger whereupon the tallest of they all come forward and hand he a long leathern bag sir richard take the bag and shot from it upon the table a glittering stream of golden money bear in mind sir prior say he that thou hast promise I quittance for three hundred pound not one farthing above that shalt thou get so say he count out three hundred pound and push it toward the prior but now the prior 's hand drop at he side and the prior 's head hang upon he shoulder for not only have he lose all hope of the land but he have forgive the knight one hundred pound of he debt and have needlessly pay the man of law fourscore angel to he he turn and quoth he give I back my money that thou hast nay cry the other shrilly it be but my fee that thou didst pay I and thou gettest it not back again and he hug he gown about he now sir prior quoth sir richard i have hold my day and pay all the due demand of I so as there be no more betwixt we i leave this vile place straightway so say he turn upon he heel and stride away all this time the sheriff have be stare with wide-open eye and mouth agape at the tall man-at-arms who stand as though carve out of stone at last he gasp out reynold greenleaf at this the tall man-at-arms who be no other than little john turn grin to the sheriff i give thee good den fair gossip quoth he i would say sweet sheriff that i have hear all thy pretty talk this day and it shall be duly tell unto robin hood so farewell for the nonce till we meet again in sherwood forest then he also turn and follow sir richard down the hall leave the sheriff all pale and amaze shrink together upon he chair a merry feast it be to which sir richard come but a sorry lot he leave behind he and little hunger have they for the princely food spread before they only the learn doctor be happy for he have he fee now a twelvemonth and a day pass since prior vincent of emmet sit at feast and once more the mellow fall of another year have come but the year have bring great change i wot to the land of sir richard of the lea for where before shaggy wild grass grow upon the meadow land now all stretch away in golden stubble betoken that a rich and plentiful crop have be gather therefrom a year have make a great change in the castle also for where be empty moat and the crumble of neglect all be now orderly and well keep bright shine the sun on battlement and tower and in the blue air overhead a hock of clatter jackdaw fly around the gilded weather vane and spire then in the brightness of the morning the drawbridge fall across the moat with a rattle and clank of chain the gate of the castle swing slowly open and a goodly array of steel-clad man-at-arms with a knight all clothe in chain mail as white as frost on brier and thorn of a winter morning come flash out from the castle courtyard in he hand the knight hold a great spear from the point of which flutter a blood-red pennant as broad as the palm of one 's hand so this troop come forth from the castle and in the midst of they walk three pack horse laden with parcel of diver shape and kind thus ride forth good sir richard of the lea to pay he debt to robin hood this bright and merry morn along the highway they wend they way with measure tramp of foot and rattle and jingle of sword and harness onward they march till they come nigh to denby where from the top of a hill they see over beyond the town many gay flag and streamer float in the bright air then sir richard turn to the man-at-arms nearest to he what be toward yonder at denby today quoth he please you worship answer the man-at-arms a merry fair be hold there today and a great wrestling match to which many folk have come for a prize have be offer of a pipe of red wine a fair golden ring and a pair of glove all of which go to the best wrestler now by my faith quoth sir richard who love good manly sport right well this will be a goodly thing to see methink we have to stay a little while on we journey and see this merry sport so he turn he horse 's head aside toward denby and the fair and thither he and he man make they way there they find a great hubbub of merriment flag and streamer be float tumbler be tumble on the green bagpipe be play and lad and lass be dance to the music but the crowd be gather most of all around a ring where the wrestling be go forward and thither sir richard and he man turn they step now when the judge of the wrestling see sir richard come and know who he be the chief of they come down from the bench where he and the other sit and go to the knight and take he by the hand beseech he to come and sit with they and judge the sport so sir richard get down from he horse and go with the other to the bench raise beside the ring now there have be great doings that morning for a certain yeoman name egbert who come from stoke over in staffordshire have throw with ease all those that come against he but a man of denby well know through all the countryside as william of the scar have be bide he time with the stoke man so when egbert have throw everyone else stout william leap into the ring then a tough bout follow and at last he throw egbert heavily whereat there be a great shouting and shake of hand for all the denby man be proud of they wrestler when sir richard come he find stout william puff up by the shout of he friend walk up and down the ring daring anyone to come and try a throw with he come one come all quoth he here stand i william of the scar against any man if there be none in derbyshire to come against I come all who will from nottingham stafford or york and if i do not make they one and all root the ground with they nose like swine in the forest call I no more brave william the wrestler at this all laugh but above all the laughter a loud voice be hear to cry out sin ' thou talkest so big here cometh one from nottinghamshire to try a fall with thee fellow and straightway a tall youth with a tough quarterstaff in he hand come push he way through the crowd and at last leap lightly over the rope into the ring he be not as heavy as stout william but he be taller and broader in the shoulder and all he joint be well knit sir richard look upon he keenly then turn to one of the judge he say knowest thou who this youth be methinks i have see he before nay say the judge he be a stranger to I meantime without a word the young man lay aside he quarterstaff begin to take off he jerkin and body clothing until he presently stand with naked arm and body and a comely sight he be when so bare to the view for he muscle be cut round and smooth and sharp like swift - run water and now each man spat upon he hand and clap they upon he knee squat down watch the other keenly so as to take the vantage of he in the grip then like a flash they leap together and a great shout go up for william have get the better hold of the two for a short time they strain and struggle and writhe and then stout william give he most cunning trip and throw but the stranger meet it with greater skill than he and so the trip come to nought then of a sudden with a twist and a wrench the stranger loose himself and he of the scar find himself lock in a pair of arm that fairly make he rib crack so with heavy hot breathing they stand for a while strain they body all glisten with sweat and great drop of sweat trickle down they face but the stranger 's hug be so close that at last stout william 's muscle soften under he grip and he give a sob then the youth put forth all he strength and give a sudden trip with he heel and a cast over he right hip and down stout william go with a sickening thud and lay as though he would never move hand nor foot again but now no shout go up for the stranger but a angry murmur be hear among the crowd so easily have he win the match then one of the judge a kinsman to william of the scar rise with tremble lip and baleful look quoth he if thou have slay that man it will go ill with thee let I tell thee fellow but the stranger answer boldly he take he chance with I as i take mine with he no law can touch I to harm I even if i slew he so that it be fairly do in the wrestle ring that we shall see say the judge scowl upon the youth while once more a angry murmur run around the crowd for as i have say the man of denby be proud of stout william of the scar then up speak sir richard gently nay say he the youth be right if the other dieth he dieth in the wrestling ring where he take he chance and be cast fairly enow but in the meantime three man have come forward and lift stout william from the ground and find that he be not dead though badly shake by he heavy fall then the chief judge rise and say young man the prize be duly thine here be the red-gold ring and here the glove and yonder stand the pipe of wine to do with whatsoever thou dost list at this the youth who have don he clothes and take up he staff again bow without a word then take the glove and the ring and thrust the one into he girdle and slip the other upon he thumb he turn and leap lightly over the rope again make he way through the crowd and be go now i wonder who yon youth may be say the judge turn to sir richard he seemeth like a stout saxon from he red cheek and fair hair this william of ours be a stout man too and never have i see he cast in the ring before albeit he have not yet strive with such great wrestler as thoma of cornwall diccon of york and young david of doncaster have he not a firm foot in the ring thinkest thou sir richard ay truly and yet this youth throw he fairly and with wondrous ease i much wonder who he can be thus say sir richard in a thoughtful voice for a time the knight stand talk to those about he but at last he arise and make ready to depart so he call he man about he and tighten the girth of he saddle he mount he horse once more meanwhile the young stranger have make he way through the crowd but as he pass he hear all around he such word mutter as look at the cockerel behold how he plumeth himself i dare swear he cast good william unfairly yea truly see ye not birdlime upon he hand it would be well to cut he cock 's comb to all this the stranger pay no heed but stride proudly about as though he hear it not so he walk slowly across the green to where the booth stand wherein be dancing and standing at the door he look in on the sport as he stand thus a stone strike he arm of a sudden with a sharp jar and turn he see that a angry crowd of man have follow he from the wrestling ring then when they see he turn so a great hooting and yell arise from all so that the folk come run out from the dancing booth to see what be to do at last a tall broad-shouldered burly blacksmith stride forward from the crowd swing a mighty blackthorn club in he hand wouldst thou come here to we fair town of denby thou jack in the box to overcome a good honest lad with vile juggling trick growl he in a deep voice like the bellow of a angry bull take that then and of a sudden he strike a blow at the youth that might have fell a ox but the other turn the blow deftly aside and give back another so terrible that the denby man go down with a groan as though he have be smite by lightning when they see they leader fall the crowd give another angry shout but the stranger place he back against the tent near which he stand swing he terrible staff and so fall have be the blow that he strike the stout smith that none dare to come within the measure of he cudgel so the press crowd back like a pack of dog from a bear at bay but now some coward hand from behind throw a sharp jagged stone that smite the stranger on the crown so that he stagger back and the red blood gush from the cut and run down he face and over he jerkin then see he daze with this vile blow the crowd rush upon he so that they overbear he and he fall beneath they foot now it might have go ill with the youth even to the losing of he young life have not sir richard come to this fair for of a sudden shout be hear and steel flash in the air and blow be give with the flat of sword while through the midst of the crowd sir richard of the lea come spur on he white horse then the crowd see the steel-clad knight and the

in the purple new - turn furrow flock of bird hunt for fat worm all the broad moist earth smile in the warm light and each little green hill clap its hand for joy on a deer 's hide stretch on the ground in the open in front of the greenwood tree sit robin hood basking in the sun like a old dog fox lean back with he hand clasp about he knee he lazily watch little john roll a stout bowstr from long strand of hempen thread wet the palm of he hand ever and anon and roll the cord upon he thigh near by sit allan a dale fitting a new string to he harp quoth robin at last methink i would rather roam this forest in the gentle springtime than be king of all merry england what palace in the broad world be as fair as this sweet woodland just now and what king in all the world have such appetite for plover 's egg and lamprey as i for juicy venison and sparkling ale gaffer swanthold speak truly when he saith ` better a crust with content than honey with a sour heart ' yea quoth little john as he rub he new-made bowstr with yellow beeswax the life we lead be the life for I thou speakest of the springtime but methink even the winter have its own joy thou and i good master have have more than one merry day this winter past at the blue boar dost thou not remember that night thou and will stutely and friar tuck and i pass at that same hostelry with the two beggar and the stroll friar yea quoth merry robin laugh that be the night that will stutely must need snatch a kiss from the stout hostess and get a canakin of ale empty over he head for he pain truly it be the same say little john laughing also methink that be a goodly song that the stroll friar sing friar tuck thou hast a quick ear for a tune dost thou not remember it i do have the catch of it one time say tuck let I see and he touch he forefinger to he forehead in think hum to himself and stop ever and anon to fit what he have get to what he search for in he mind at last he find it all and clear he throat sing merrily : _ in the blossom hedge the robin cock sing for the sun it be merry and bright and he joyfully hop and he flutter he wing for he heart be all full of delight for the may bloometh fair and there be little of care and plenty to eat in the maytime rare when the flower all die then off he will fly to keep himself warm in some jolly old barn where the snow and the wind neither chill he nor harm and such be the life of the stroll friar with aplenty to eat and to drink for the goodwife will keep he a seat by the fire and the pretty girl smile at he wink then he lustily troll as he onward stroll a rollick song for the saving of soul when the wind doth blow with the come of snow there be a place by the fire for the fatherly friar and a crab in the bowl for he heart 's desire _ thus friar tuck sing in a rich and mellow voice roll he head from side to side in time with the music and when he have do all clap they hand and shout with laughter for the song fit he well in very sooth quoth little john it be a goodly song and be i not a yeoman of sherwood forest i have rather be a stroll friar than aught else in the world yea it be a goodly song say robin hood but methought those two burly beggar tell the merrier tale and lead the merrier life dost thou not remember what that great black-bearded fellow tell of he beg at the fair in york yea say little john but what tell the friar of the harvest home in kentshire i hold that he lead a merrier life than the other two truly for the honor of the cloth quoth friar tuck i hold with my good gossip little john now quoth robin i hold to mine own mind but what sayst thou little john to a merry adventure this fair day take thou a friar 's gown from we chest of strange garment and don the same and i will stop the first beggar i meet and change clothes with he then let we wander the country about this sweet day and see what befall each of we that fitteth my mind quoth little john so let we forth say i thereupon little john and friar tuck go to the storehouse of the band and there choose for the yeoman the robe of a gray friar then they come forth again and a mighty roar of laughter go up for not only have the band never see little john in such guise before but the robe be too short for he by a good palm 's - breadth but little john 's hand be fold in he loose sleeve and little john 's eye be cast upon the ground and at he girdle hang a great long string of bead and now little john take up he stout staff at the end of which hang a chubby little leathern pottle such as palmer carry at the tip of they stave but in it be something i wot more like good malmsey than cold spring water such as godly pilgrim carry then up rise robin and take he stout staff in he hand likewise and slip ten golden angel into he pouch for no beggar 's garb be among the store of the band so he be fain to run he chance of meet a beggar and buy he clothes of he so all be make ready the two yeomen set forth on they way stride lustily along all in the misty morning thus they walk down the forest path until they come to the highway and then along the highway till it split in twain lead on one hand to blyth and on the other to gainsborough here the yeomen stop quoth jolly robin take thou the road to gainsborough and i will take that to blyth so fare thee well holy father and mayst thou not ha ' cause to count thy bead in earnest ere we meet again good den good beggar that be to be quoth little john and mayst thou have no cause to beg for mercy ere i see thee next so each step sturdily upon he way until a green hill rise between they and the one be hide from the sight of the other little john walk along whistle for no one be nigh upon all the road in the bud hedge the little bird twitter merrily and on either hand the green hill sweep up to the sky the great white cloud of springtime sailing slowly over they crown in lazy flight up hill and down dale walk little john the fresh wind blow in he face and he robe flutter behind he and so at last he come to a crossroad that lead to tuxford here he meet three pretty lass each bear a basket of egg to market quoth he whither away fair maid and he stand in they path hold he staff in front of they to stop they then they huddle together and nudge one another and one presently speak up and say we be go to the tuxford market holy friar to sell we egg now out upon it quoth little john look upon they with he head on one side surely it be a pity that such fair lass should be force to carry egg to market let I tell you a i have the shaping of thing in this world ye should all three have be clothe in the finest silk and ride upon milk-white horse with page at you side and feed upon nothing but whip cream and strawberry for such a life would surely befit you look at this speech all three of the pretty maid look down blush and simper one say la another marry a ' maketh sport of we and the third listen now to the holy man but at the same time they look at little john from out the corner of they eye now look you say little john i can not see such dainty damsel as ye be carry basket along a highroad let I take they mine own self and one of you if ye will may carry my staff for I nay say one of the lass but thou canst not carry three basket all at one time yea but i can say little john and that i will show you presently i thank the good saint wilfr that he have give I a pretty wit look ye now here i take this great basket so here i tie my rosary around the handle thus and here i slip the rosary over my head and sling the basket upon my back in this wise and little john do accord to he word the basket hang down behind he like a peddler 's pack then give he staff to one of the maid and take a basket upon either arm he turn he face toward tuxford town and step forth merrily a laugh maid on either side and one walk ahead carry the staff in this wise they journey along and everyone they meet stop and look after they laugh for never have anybody see such a merry sight as this tall strap gray friar with robe all too short for he laden with egg and tramp the road with three pretty lass for this little john care not a whit but when such folk give jest word to he he answer back as merrily speech for speech so they step along toward tuxford chatting and laugh until they come nigh to the town here little john stop and set down the basket for he do not care to go into the town lest he should perchance meet some of the sheriff 's man alas sweet chuck quoth he here i must leave you i have not think to come this way but i be glad that i do so now ere we part we must drink sweet friendship so say he unsling the leathern pottle from the end of he staff and draw the stopper therefrom he hand it to the lass who have carry he staff first wipe the mouth of the pottle upon he sleeve then each lass take a fair drink of what be within and when it have pass all around little john finish what be leave so that not another drop could be squeeze from it then kiss each lass sweetly he wish they all good den and leave they but the maid stand look after he as he walk away whistle what a pity quoth one that such a stout lusty lad should be in holy order marry quoth little john to himself as he stride along yon be no such ill happen saint dunstan send I more of the like after he have trudge along for a time he begin to wax thirsty again in the warmth of the day he shake he leathern pottle beside he ear but not a sound come therefrom then he place it to he lip and tilted it high aloft but not a drop be there little john little john say he sadly to himself shake he head the while woman will be thy ruin yet if thou dost not take better care of thyself but at last he reach the crest of a certain hill and see below a sweet little thatched inn lie snugly in the dale beneath he toward which the road dip sharply at the sight of this a voice within he cry aloud i give thee joy good friend for yonder be thy heart 's delight to wit a sweet rest and a cup of brown beer so he quicken he pace down the hill and so come to the little inn from which hang a sign with a stag 's head paint upon it in front of the door a cluck hen be scratch in the dust with a brood of chicken about she heel the sparrow be chatter of household affair under the eaves and all be so sweet and peaceful that little john 's heart laugh within he beside the door stand two stout cob with broad soft-padded saddle well fit for easy travel and speak of rich guest in the parlor in front of the door three merry fellow a tinker a peddler and a beggar be seat on a bench in the sun quaff stout ale i give you good den sweet friend quoth little john stride up to where they sit give thee good den holy father quoth the merry beggar with a grin but look thee thy gown be too short thou hadst best cut a piece off the top and tack it to the bottom so that it may be long enough but come sit beside we here and take a taste of ale if thy vow forbid thee not nay quoth little john also grin the bless saint dunstan have give I a free dispensation for all indulgence in that line and he thrust he hand into he pouch for money to pay he score truly quoth the tinker without thy look belie thee holy friar the good saint dunstan be wise for without such dispensation he votary be like to ha ' many a penance to make nay take thy hand from out thy pouch brother for thou shalt not pay this shot ho landlord a pot of ale so the ale be bring and give to little john then blow the froth a little way to make room for he lip he tilted the bottom of the pot higher and higher till it point to the sky and he have to shut he eye to keep the dazzle of the sunshine out of they then he take the pot away for there be nothing in it and heave a full deep sigh look at the other with moist eye and shake he head solemnly ho landlord cry the peddler bring this good fellow another pot of ale for truly it be a credit to we all to have one among we who can empty a canakin so lustily so they talk among themselves merrily until after a while quoth little john who rideth those two nag yonder two holy man like thee brother quoth the beggar they be now have a goodly feast within for i smell the steam of a boil pullet just now the landlady sayeth they come from fountain abbey in yorkshire and go to lincoln on matter of business they be a merry couple say the tinker for one be as lean as a old wife 's spindle and the other as fat as a suet pudding talking of fatness say the peddler thou thyself lookest none too ill-fed holy friar nay truly say little john thou seest in I what the holy saint dunstan can do for they that serve he upon a handful of parched pea and a trickle of cold water at this a great shout of laughter go up truly it be a wondrous thing quoth the beggar i would have make my vow to see the masterly manner in which thou didst tuck away yon pot of ale that thou hadst not taste clear water for a brace of month have not this same holy saint dunstan teach thee a goodly song or two why as for that quoth little john grinning mayhap he have lend I aid to learn a ditty or so then prythee let we hear how he have teach thee quoth the tinker at this little john clear he throat and after a word or two about a certain hoarseness that trouble he sing thus : _ ah pretty pretty maid whither dost thou go i prythee prythee wait for thy lover also and we 'll gather the rose as it sweetly blow for the merry merry wind be blo-o-o-wing _ now it seem as though little john 's song be never to get sing for he have get no farther than this when the door of the inn open and out come the two brother of fountain abbey the landlord follow they and as the say be wash he hand with humble soap but when the brother of fountain abbey see who it be that sing and how he be clothe in the robe of a gray friar they stop suddenly the fat little brother draw he heavy eyebrow together in a mighty frown and the thin brother twist up he face as though he have sour beer in he mouth then as little john gather he breath for a new verse how now roar forth the fat brother he voice come from he like loud thunder from a little cloud thou naughty fellow be this a fit place for one in thy garb to tipple and sing profane song nay quoth little john sin ' i can not tipple and sing like you worship 's reverence in such a goodly place as fountain abbey i must e ` en tipple and sing where i can now out upon thee cry the tall lean brother in a harsh voice now out upon thee that thou shouldst so disgrace thy cloth by this talk and bear marry come up quoth little john disgrace sayest thou methink it be more disgrace for one of we garb to wring hard-earned farthing out of the gripe of poor lean peasant it be not so brother at this the tinker and the peddler and the beggar nudge one another and all grin and the friar scowl blackly at little john but they could think of nothing further to say so they turn to they horse then little john arise of a sudden from the bench where he sit and run to where the brother of fountain abbey be mount quoth he let I hold you horse ' bridle for you truly you word have smite my sinful heart so that i will abide no longer in this den of evil but will go forward with you no vile temptation i wot will fall upon I in such holy company nay fellow say the lean brother harshly for he see that little john make sport of they we want none of thy company so get thee go alas quoth little john i be truly sorry that ye like I not nor my company but as for leave you it may not be for my heart be so move that willy-nilly i must go with you for the sake of you holy company now at this talk all the good fellow on the bench grin till they tooth glisten and even the landlord could not forbear to smile as for the friar they look at one another with a puzzle look and know not what to do in the matter they be so proud that it make they feel sick with shame to think of ride along the highroad with a stroll friar in robe all too short for he run beside they but yet they could not make little john stay against he will for they know he could crack the bone of both of they in a twinkling be he so mind then up speak the fat brother more mildly than he have do before nay good brother say he we will ride fast and thou wilt tire to death at the pace truly i be grateful to thee for the thought of I quoth little john but have no fear brother my limb be stout and i could run like a hare from here to gainsborough at these word a sound of laugh come from the bench whereat the lean brother 's wrath boil over like water into the fire with great fuss and noise now out upon thee thou naughty fellow he cry art thou not ashamed to bring disgrace so upon we cloth bide thee here thou sot with these porker thou art no fit company for we la ye there now quoth little john thou hearest landlord thou art not fit company for these holy man go back to thine alehouse nay if these most holy brother of mine do but give I the word i 'll beat thy head with this stout staff till it be as soft as whip egg at these word a great shout of laughter go up from those on the bench and the landlord 's face grow red as a cherry from smother he laugh in he stomach but he keep he merriment down for he wish not to bring the ill-will of the brother of fountain abbey upon he by unseemly mirth so the two brethren as they could do nought else have mount they nag turn they nose toward lincoln and ride away i can not stay longer sweet friend quoth little john as he push in betwixt the two cob therefore i wish you good den off we go we three so say he swing he stout staff over he shoulder and trudge off measure he pace with that of the two nag the two brother glower at little john when he so push himself betwixt they then they draw as far away from he as they could so that the yeoman walk in the middle of the road while they ride on the footpath on either side of the way as they so go away the tinker the peddler and the beggar run skip out into the middle of the highway each with a pot in he hand and look after they laugh while they be in sight of those at the inn the brother walk they horse soberly not care to make ill matter worse by seem to run away from little john for they could not but think how it would sound in folk ' ear when they hear how the brethren of fountain abbey scamper away from a stroll friar like the ugly one when the bless saint dunstan loose he nose from the red-hot tong where he have hold it fast but when they have cross the crest of the hill and the inn be lose to sight quoth the fat brother to the thin brother brother ambrose have we not better mend we pace why truly gossip speak up little john methink it would be well to boil we pot a little faster for the day be pass on so it will not jolt thy fat too much onward say i at this the two friar say nothing but they glare again on little john with baleful look then without another word they cluck to they horse and both break into a canter so they gallop for a mile and more and little john run betwixt they as lightly as a stag and never turn a hair with the run at last the fat brother draw he horse 's rein with a groan for he could stand the shake no longer alas say little john with not so much as a catch in he breath i do sadly fear that the roughness of this pace would shake thy poor old fat paunch to this the fat friar say never a word but he stare straight before he and he gnaw he nether lip and now they travel forward more quietly little john in the middle of the road whistle merrily to himself and the two friar in the footpath on either side say never a word then presently they meet three merry minstrel all clothe in red who stare amain to see a gray friar with such short robe walk in the middle of the road and two brother with head bow with shame ride upon richly caparisoned cob on the footpath when they have come near to the minstrel little john wave he staff like a usher clear the way make way he cry in a loud voice make way make way for here we go we three then how the minstrel stare and how they laugh but the fat friar shake as with a ague and the lean friar bow he head over he horse 's neck then next they meet two noble knight in rich array with hawk on wrist and likewise two fair lady clothe in silk and velvet all a-riding on noble steed these all make room stare as little john and the two friar come along the road to they little john bow humbly give you greeting lord and lady say he but here we go we three then all laugh and one of the fair lady cry out what three meanest thou merry friend little john look over he shoulder for they have now pass each other and he call back big jack lean jack and fat jack-pudding at this the fat friar give a groan and seem as if he be like to fall from he saddle for shame the other brother say nothing but he look before he with a grim and stony look just ahead of they the road take a sudden turn around a high hedge and some twoscore pace beyond the bend another road cross the one they be ride upon when they have come to the crossroad and be well away from those they have leave the lean friar draw rein suddenly look ye fellow quoth he in a voice quiver with rage we have have enough of thy vile company and care no longer to be make sport of go thy way and let we go ours in peace la there now quoth little john methought we be such a merry company and here thou dost blaze up like fat in the pan but truly i ha ' have enow of you today though i can ill spare you company i know ye will miss I but gin ye want I again whisper to goodman wind and he will bring news thereof to I but ye see i be a poor man and ye be rich i pray you give I a penny or two to buy I bread and cheese at the next inn we have no money fellow say the lean friar harshly come brother thoma let we forward but little john catch the horse by the bridle rein one in either hand ha ' ye in truth no money about you whatsoever say he now i pray you brother for charity 's sake give I somewhat to buy a crust of bread e ` en though it be only a penny i tell thee fellow we have no money thunder the fat little friar with the great voice ha ' ye in holy truth no money ask little john not a farthing say the lean friar sourly not a groat say the fat friar loudly nay quoth little john this must not be far be it from I to see such holy man as ye be depart from I with no money get both of you down straightway from off you horse and we will kneel here in the middle of the crossroads and pray the bless saint dunstan to send we some money to carry we on we journey what sayest thou thou limb of evil cry the lean friar fairly gnash he tooth with rage doss thou bid I the high cellarer of fountain abbey to get down from my horse and kneel in the dirty road to pray to some beggarly saxon saint now quoth little john i ha ' a great part of a mind to crack thy head for thee for speak thus of the good saint dunstan but get down straightway for my patience will not last much longer and i may forget that ye be both in holy order so say he twirl he stout staff till it whistle again at this speech both friar grow as pale as dough down slip the fat brother from off he horse on one side and down slip the lean brother on the other now brother down on you knee and pray say little john thereupon put he heavy hand upon the shoulder of each he force they to they knee he kneel also then little john begin to beseech saint dunstan for money which he do in a great loud voice after he have so besought the saint for a time he bid the friar feel in they pouch and see if the saint have send they anything so each put he hand slowly in the pouch that hang beside he but bring nothing thence ha quoth little john have you prayer so little virtue then let we at it again then straightway he begin call on saint dunstan again somewhat in this wise : o gracious saint dunstan send some money straightway to these poor folk lest the fat one waste away and grow as lean as the lean one and the lean one waste away to nothing at all ere they get to lincoln town but send they only ten shilling apiece lest they grow puff up with pride any more than that that thou sendest send to I now quoth he rise let we see what each man have then he thrust he hand into he pouch and draw thence four golden angel what have ye brother say he then once again each friar slowly thrust he hand into he pouch and once again bring it out with nothing in it have ye nothing quoth little john nay i warrant there be somewhat that have creep into the seam of you pouch and so ye ha ' miss it let I look so he go first to the lean friar and thrust he hand into the pouch he draw forth a leathern bag and count therefrom one hundred and ten pound of golden money i think quoth little john that thou hadst miss in some odd corner of thy pouch the money that the bless saint have send thee and now let I see whether thou hast not some also brother thereupon he thrust he hand into the pouch of the fat friar and draw thence a bag like the other and count out from it threescore and ten pound look ye now quoth he i know the good saint have send thee some pittance that thou also hadst miss then give they one pound

and ride away with never a word but little john turn he footstep back again to sherwood forest and merrily he whistle as he stride along and now we will see what befall robin hood in he venture as beggar robin hood turn beggar after jolly robin have leave little john at the forking of the road he walk merrily onward in the mellow sunshine that shine about he ever and anon he would skip and leap or sing a snatch of song for pure joyousness of the day for because of the sweetness of the springtide he heart be as lusty within he as that of a colt newly turn out to grass sometimes he would walk a long distance gaze aloft at the great white swell cloud that move slowly across the deep blue sky anon he would stop and drink in the fullness of life of all thing for the hedgerow be bud tenderly and the grass of the meadow be wax long and green again he would stand still and listen to the pretty song of the little bird in the thicket or hearken to the clear crow of the cock daring the sky to rain whereat he would laugh for it take but little to tickle robin 's heart into merriment so he trudge manfully along ever willing to stop for this reason or for that and ever ready to chat with such merry lass as he meet now and then so the morning slip along but yet he meet no beggar with whom he could change clothes quoth he if i do not change my luck in haste i be like to have a empty day of it for it be well nigh half go already and although i have have a merry walk through the countryside i know nought of a beggar 's life then after a while he begin to grow hungry whereupon he mind turn from thought of springtime and flower and bird and dwell upon boil capon malmsey white bread and the like with great tenderness quoth he to himself i would i have willie wynkin 's wish coat i know right well what i should wish for and this it should be here he mark upon the finger of he left hand with the forefinger of he right hand those thing which he wish for firstly i would have a sweet brown pie of tender lark mark ye not dry cook but with a good sop of gravy to moisten it withal next i would have a pretty pullet fairly boil with tender pigeon ' egg cunningly slice garnish the platter around with these i would have a long slim loaf of wheaten bread that have be baked upon the hearth it should be warm from the fire with glossy brown crust the color of the hair of mine own maid marian and this same crust should be as crisp and brittle as the thin white ice that lie across the furrow in the early winter 's morning these will do for the more solid thing but with these i must have three potty fat and round one full of malmsey one of canary and one brim full of mine own dear lusty sack thus speak robin to himself he mouth grow moist at the corner with the thought of the good thing he have raise in he own mind so talk to himself he come to where the dusty road turn sharply around the hedge all tender with the green of the come leaf and there he see before he a stout fellow sit upon a stile swing he leg in idleness all about this lusty rogue dangle diver pouch and bag of different size and kind a dozen or more with great wide gaping mouth like a brood of hungry daw he coat be gather in at he waist and be patch with as many color as there be stripe upon a maypole in the springtide on he head he wear a great tall leathern cap and across he knee rest a stout quarterstaff of blackthorn full as long and heavy as robin 's as jolly a beggar be he as ever tread the lane and byway of nottinghamshire for he eye be as gray as slate and snap and twinkle and dance with merriment and he black hair curl close all over he head in little ring of kinkiness halloa good fellow quoth robin when he have come nigh to the other what art thou do here this merry day when the flower be peep and the bud be swell then the other wink one eye and straightway troll forth in a merry voice : _ i sit upon the stile and i sing a little while as i wait for my own true dear o for the sun be shine bright and the leaf be dance light and the little fowl sing she be near o _ and so it be with I bully boy save that my doxy cometh not now that be a right sweet song quoth robin and be i in the right mind to listen to thee i could bear well to hear more but i have two thing of seriousness to ask of thee so listen i prythee at this the jolly beggar cock he head on one side like a rogue of a magpie quoth he i be a ill jug to pour heavy thing into good friend and if i mistake not thou hast few serious word to spare at any time nay quoth jolly robin what i would say first be the most serious of all thought to I to wit ` where shall i get somewhat to eat and drink ' sayst thou so quoth the beggar marry i make no such serious thought upon the matter i eat when i can get it and munch my crust when i can get no crumb likewise when there be no ale to be have i wash the dust from out my throat with a trickle of cold water i be sit here as thou camest upon I bethink myself whether i should break my fast or no i do love to let my hunger grow mightily keen ere i eat for then a dry crust be as good to I as a venison pasty with suet and raisin be to stout king harry i have a sharp hunger upon I now but methink in a short while it will ripen to a right mellow appetite now in good sooth quoth merry robin laugh thou hast a quaint tongue betwixt thy tooth but hast thou truly nought but a dry crust about thee methink thy bag and pouch be fat and lusty for such thin fare why mayhap there be some other cold fare therein say the beggar slyly and hast thou nought to drink but cold water say robin never so much as a drop quoth the beggar over beyond yon clump of tree be as sweet a little inn as ever thou hast lift eyelid upon but i go not thither for they have a nasty way with I once when the good prior of emmet be dine there the landlady set a dear little tart of stewed crab and barley sugar upon the window sill to cool and see it there and fear it might be lose i take it with I till that i could find the owner thereof ever since then they have act very ill toward I yet truth bid I say that they have the best ale there that ever roll over my tongue at this robin laugh aloud marry quoth he they do ill toward thee for thy kindness but tell I truly what hast thou in thy pouch why quoth the beggar peep into the mouth of he bag i find here a goodly piece of pigeon pie wrap in a cabbage leaf to hold the gravy here i behold a dainty streak piece of brawn and here a fair lump of white bread here i find four oaten cake and a cold knuckle of ham ha in sooth ` tis strange but here i behold six egg that must have come by accident from some poultry yard hereabouts they be raw but roasted upon the coal and spread with a piece of butter that i see -- peace good friend cry robin hold up he hand thou makest my poor stomach quake with joy for what thou tellest I so sweetly if thou wilt give I to eat i will straightway hie I to that little inn thou didst tell of but now and will bring a skin of ale for thy drinking and mine friend thou hast say enough say the beggar get down from the stile i will feast thee with the best that i have and bless saint cedric for thy company but sweet chuck i prythee bring three quart of ale at least one for thy drinking and two for mine for my thirst be such that methink i can drink ale as the sand of the river dee drink salt water so robin straightway leave the beggar who upon he part go to a bud lime bush back of the hedge and there spread he feast upon the grass and roasted he egg upon a little fagot fire with a deftness gain by long labor in that line after a while back come robin bear a goodly skin of ale upon he shoulder which he lay upon the grass then look upon the feast spread upon the ground -- and a fair sight it be to look upon -- he slowly rub he hand over he stomach for to he hungry eye it seem the fairest sight that he have behold in all he life friend say the beggar let I feel the weight of that skin yea truly quoth robin help thyself sweet chuck and meantime let I see whether thy pigeon pie be fresh or no so the one seize upon the ale and the other upon the pigeon pie and nothing be hear for a while but the munch of food and the gurgle of ale as it leave the skin at last after a long time have pass thus robin push the food from he and heave a great sigh of deep content for he feel as though he have be make all over anew and now good friend quoth he lean upon one elbow i would have at thee about that other matter of seriousness of which i speak not long since how say the beggar reproachfully thou wouldst surely not talk of thing appertain to serious affair upon such ale as this nay quoth robin laugh i would not check thy thirst sweet friend drink while i talk to thee thus it be : i would have thee know that i have take a liking to thy craft and would fain have a taste of a beggar 's life mine own self say the beggar i marvel not that thou hast take a liking to my manner of life good fellow but ` to like ' and ` to do ' be two matter of different sort i tell thee friend one must serve a long apprenticeship ere one can learn to be even so much as a clapper - dudgeon much less a crank or a abraham-man -lrb- 3 -rrb- i tell thee lad thou art too old to enter upon that which it may take thee year to catch the hang of -lrb- 3 -rrb- class of travel mendicant that infested england as late as the middle of the seventeenth century vide dakkar 's english villainy etc mayhap that may be so quoth robin for i bring to mind that gaffer swanthold sayeth jack shoemaker maketh ill bread tom baker maketh ill shoon nevertheless i have a mind to taste a beggar 's life and need but the clothing to be as good as any i tell thee fellow say the beggar if thou wert clothe as sweetly as good saint wynten the patron of we craft thou wouldst never make a beggar marry the first jolly traveler that thou wouldst meet would beat thee to a pudding for thrust thy nose into a craft that belongeth not to thee nevertheless quoth robin i would have a try at it and methink i shall change clothes with thee for thy garb seemeth to be pretty not to say gay so not only will i change clothes but i will give thee two golden angel to boot i have bring my stout staff with I think that i might have to rap some one of the brethren of thy cloth over the head by way of argument in this matter but i love thee so much for the feast thou hast give I that i would not lift even my little finger against thee so thou needst not have a crumb of fear to this the beggar listen with he knuckle rest against he hip and when robin have end he cock he head on one side and thrust he tongue into he cheek marry come up quoth he at last lift thy finger against I forsooth art thou out of thy wit man my name be riccon hazel and i come from holywell in flintshire over by the river dee i tell thee knave i have crack the head of many a better man than thou art and even now i would scald thy crown for thee but for the ale thou hast give I now thou shalt not have so much as one tag-rag of my coat even could it save thee from hang now fellow say robin it would ill suit I to spoil thy pretty head for thee but i tell thee plainly that but for this feast i would do that to thee would stop thy travel the country for many a day to come keep thy lip shut lad or thy luck will tumble out of thy mouth with thy speech now out and alas for thee man for thou hast breed thyself ill this day cry the beggar rise and take up he staff take up thy club and defend thyself fellow for i will not only beat thee but i will take from thee thy money and leave thee not so much as a clip groat to buy thyself a lump of goose grease to rub thy crack crown withal so defend thyself i say then up leap merry robin and snatch up he staff also take my money if thou canst quoth he i promise freely to give thee every farthing if thou dost touch I and he twirl he staff in he finger till it whistle again then the beggar swing he staff also and strike a mighty blow at robin which the yeoman turn three blow the beggar strike yet never one touch so much as a hair of robin 's head then stout robin see he chance and ere you could count three riccon 's staff be over the hedge and riccon himself lay upon the green grass with no more motion than you could find in a empty pudding bag how now quoth merry robin laugh wilt thou have my hide or my money sweet chuck but to this the other answer never a word then robin see he plight and that he be stun with the blow run still laugh and bring the skin of ale and pour some of it on the beggar 's head and some down he throat so that presently he open he eye and look around as though wonder why he lay upon he back then robin see that he have somewhat gather the wit that have just be rap out of he head say now good fellow wilt thou change clothes with I or shall i have to tap thee again here be two golden angel if thou wilt give I freely

as a true yeoman that thou wilt take nought from I but my clothes i promise on the word of a true yeoman quoth robin think that the fellow have a few penny that he would save thereupon the beggar draw a little knife that hang at he side and rip up the lining of he coat draw thence ten bright golden pound which he lay upon the ground beside he with a cunning wink at robin now thou mayst have my clothes and welcome say he and thou mightest have have they in exchange for thine without the cost of a single farthing far less two golden angel marry quoth robin laugh thou art a sly fellow and i tell thee truly have i known thou hadst so much money by thee maybe thou mightst not have carry it away for i warrant thou didst not come honestly by it then each strip off he clothes and put on those of the other and as lusty a beggar be robin hood as e'er you could find of a summer 's day but stout riccon of holywell skip and leap and dance for joy of the fair suit of lincoln green that he have so get quoth he i be a gay-feathered bird now truly my dear moll peascod would never know I in this dress thou mayst keep the cold piece of the feast friend for i mean to live well and lustily while

the beggar come in at the door and jack and dick call he a fine lusty lad and the hostess run up a great score then hey willy waddykin stay billy waddykin and let the brown ale flow free flow free the beggar 's the man for I _ robin listen till the song end in the distance then he also cross the stile into the road but turn he toe away from where the beggar have go the road lead up a gentle hill and up the hill robin walk a half score or more of bag dangle about he leg onward he stroll for a long time but other adventure he find not the road be bare of all else but himself as he go kick up little cloud of dust at each footstep for it be noontide the most peaceful time of all the day next to twilight all the earth be silent in the restfulness of eat time the plowhorse stand in the furrow munch with great bag over they nose hold sweet food the plowman sit under the hedge and the plowboy also and they too be munch each one hold a great piece of bread in one fist and a great piece of cheese in the other so robin with all the empty road to himself stride along whistle merrily he bag and pouch bob and dangle at he thigh at last he come to where a little grass-grown path leave the road and pass through a stile and down a hill lead into a little dell and on across a rill in the valley and up the hill on the other side till it reach a windmill that stand on the cap of the rise where the wind bent the tree in sway motion robin look at the spot and like it and for no reason but that he fancy lead he he take the little path and walk down the grassy sunny slope of the open meadow and so come to the little dingle and ere he know it upon four lusty fellow that sit with leg outstretch around a goodly feast spread upon the ground four merry beggar be they and each have sling about he neck a little board that rest upon he breast one board have write upon it i be blind another i be deaf another i be dumb and the fourth pity the lame one but although all these trouble write upon the board seem so grievous the four stout fellow sit around feast as merrily as though cain 's wife have never open the pottle that hold misfortune and let they forth like a cloud of fly to pester we the deaf man be the first to hear robin for he say hark brother i hear someone come and the blind man be the first to see he for he say he be a honest man brother and one of like craft to

beggar who be the chief man among they and be the broadest shouldered and most lusty rascal of all smote robin upon the shoulder swearing he be a right merry wag whence comest thou lad ask the dumb man why quoth robin i come this morning from sleep overnight in sherwood be it even so say the deaf man i would not for all the money we four be carry to lincoln town sleep one night in sherwood if

of york say he have send we to lincoln with those money that -- stay brother hodge quoth the blind man break into the talk i would not doubt we brother here but bear in mind we know he not what art thou brother upright-man jurkman clapper-dudgeon dommerer or abraham-man at these word robin look from one man to the other with mouth agape truly quoth he i trust i be a upright man at least i strive to be but i know not what thou meanest by such jargon brother it be much more seemly methink if yon dumb man who have a sweet voice would give we a song at these word a silence fall on all and after a while the blind man speak again quoth he thou dost surely jest when thou sayest that thou dost not understand such word answer I this : hast thou ever fib a chouse quarron in the rome pad for the loure in he bung -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- ie in old beggar 's cant beat a man or gallant upon the highway for the money in he purse dakkar 's english villainy now out upon it quoth robin hood testily a ye make sport of I by patter such gibberish it will be ill for you all i tell you i have the best part of a mind to crack the head of all four of you and would do so too but for the sweet malmsey ye have give I brother pass the pottle lest it grow cold but all the four beggar leap to they foot when robin have do speaking and the blind man snatch up a heavy knotted cudgel that lay beside he on the grass as do the other likewise then robin see that thing be like to go ill with he albeit he know not what all the coil be about leap to he foot also and catch up he trusty staff clap he back against the tree and stand upon he guard against they how now cry he twirl he staff betwixt he finger would you four stout fellow set upon one man stand back ye rascal or i will score you pate till they have as many mark upon they as a pothouse door be ye mad i have do you no harm thou liest quoth the one who pretend to be blind and who be the lustiest villain be the leader of the other thou liest for thou hast come among we as a vile spy but thine ear have hear too much for thy body 's good and thou goest not forth from this place unless thou goest foot foremost for this day thou shalt die come brother all together down with he then whirling up he cudgel he rush upon robin as a angry bull rush upon a red rag but robin be ready for any happen crick crack he strike two blow as quick as a wink and down go the blind man rolling over and over upon the grass at this the other bear back and stand at a little distance scowl upon robin come on ye scum cry he merrily here be cake and ale for all now who will be next serve to this speech the beggar answer never a word but they look at robin as great blunderbore look upon stout jack the slayer of giant as though they would fain eat he body and bone nevertheless they do not care to come nigher to he and he terrible staff then see they so hesitate robin of a sudden leap upon they striking even as he leap down go the dumb man and away fly he cudgel from he hand as he fall at this the other duck to avoid another blow then take to they heel scamper the one one way and the other the other as though they have the west wind 's boot upon they foot robin look after they laugh and think that never have he see so fleet a runner as the lame man but neither of the beggar stop nor turn around for each feel in he mind the wind of robin 's cudgel about he ear then robin turn to the two stout knave lie upon the ground quoth he these fellow speak somewhat about certain money they be take to lincoln methink i may find it upon this stout blind fellow who have as keen sight as e'er a trained woodsman in nottingham or yorkshire it be a pity to let sound money stay in the pocket of such thieving knave so say he stoop over the burly rascal and search among he rag and tatters till presently he finger feel a leathern pouch sling around he body beneath he patched and tattered coat this he strip away and weigh it in he hand bethought himself that it be mighty heavy it be a sweet thing say he to himself if this be fill with gold instead of copper penny then sit down upon the grass he open the pocket and look into it there he find four round roll wrap up in dress sheepskin one of these roll he open then he mouth gape and he eye stare i wot as though they would never close again for what do he see but fifty pound of bright golden money he open the other pocket and find in each one the same fifty bright new-stamped golden pound quoth robin i have oft hear that the beggar ' guild be over-rich but never do i think that they send such sum as this to they treasury i shall take it with I for it will be better use for charity and the good of my merry band than in the enrich of such knave as these so say he roll up the money in the sheepskin again and put it back in the purse he thrust the pouch into he own bosom then take up the flask of malmsey he hold it toward the two fellow lie on the grass and quoth he sweet friend i drink you health and thank you dearly for what ye have so kindly give I this day and so i wish you good den then take up he staff he leave the spot and go merrily on he way but when the two stout beggar that have be rap upon the head rouse themselves and sit up and when the other have get over they fright and come back they be as sad and woebegone as four frog in dry weather for two of they have crack crown they malmsey be all go and they have not so much as a farthing to cross they palm withal but after robin leave the little dell he stride along merrily singing as he go and so blithe be he and such a stout beggar and withal so fresh and clean that every merry lass he meet have a sweet word for he and feel no fear while the very dog that most time hate the sight of a beggar snuff at he leg in friendly wise and wag they tail pleasantly for dog know a honest man by he smell and a honest man robin be -- in he own way thus he go along till at last he have come to the wayside cross nigh ollerton and be somewhat tired he sit he down to rest upon the grassy bank in front of it it groweth nigh time quoth he to himself that i be get back again to sherwood yet it would please I well to have one more merry adventure ere i go back again to my jolly band so he look up the road and down the road to see who might come until at last he see someone drawing near ride upon a horse when the traveler come nigh enough for he to see he well robin laugh for a strange enough figure he cut he be a thin wizened man and to look upon he you could not tell whether he be thirty year old or sixty so dry up be he even to skin and bone as for the nag it be as thin as the rider and both look as though they have be baked in mother huddle 's oven where folk be dry up so that they live forever but although robin laugh at the droll sight he know the wayfarer to be a certain rich corn engrosser of worksop who more than once have buy all the grain in the countryside and hold it till it reach even famine price thus make much money from the need of poor people and for this he be hate far and near by everyone that know aught of he so after a while the corn engrosser come ride up to where robin sit whereupon merry robin step straightway forth in all he rag and tatters he bag and pouch dangle about he and lay he hand upon the horse 's bridle rein call upon the other to stop who art thou fellow that doth dare to stop I thus upon the king 's highway say the lean man in a dry sour voice pity a poor beggar quoth robin give I but a farthing to buy I a piece of bread now out upon thee snarl the other such sturdy rogue as thou art be better safe in the prison or dancing upon nothing with a hempen collar about the neck than stroll the highway so freely tut quoth robin how thou talkest thou and i be brother man do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare do we not make we living by do nought of any good do we not both live without touch palm to honest work have we either of we ever rub thumb over honestly gain farthing go to we be brother i say only thou art rich and i be poor wherefore i prythee once more give I a penny doss thou prate so to I sirrah cry the corn engrosser in a rage now i will have thee soundly whip if ever i catch thee in any town where the law can lay hold of thee as for give thee a penny i swear to thee that i have not so much as a single groat in my purse be robin hood himself to take I he might search I from crown to heel without find the smallest piece of money upon I i trust i be too sly to travel so nigh to sherwood with money in my pouch and that thief at large in the wood then merry robin look up and down as if to see that there be no one nigh and then come close to the corn engrosser he stand on tiptoe and speak in he ear thinkest thou in sooth that i be a beggar as i seem to be look upon I there be not a grain of dirt upon my hand or my face or my body do thou ever see a beggar so i tell thee i be as honest a man as thou art look friend here he take the purse of money from he breast and show to the dazzled eye of the corn engrosser the bright golden piece friend these rag serve but to hide a honest rich man from the eye of robin hood put up thy money lad cry the other quickly art thou a fool to trust to beggar 's rag to shield thee from robin hood if he catch thee he would strip thee to the skin for he hate a lusty beggar as he doth a fat priest or those of my kind be it indeed so quoth robin have i know this mayhap i have not come hereabouts in this garb but i must go forward now as much depend upon my journey where goest thou friend i go to grantham say the corn engrosser but i shall lodge tonight at newark if i can get so far upon my way why i myself be on the way to newark quoth merry robin so that as two honest man be better than one in road beset by such a fellow as this robin hood i will jog along with thee if thou hast no dislike to my company why as thou art a honest fellow and a rich fellow say the corn engrosser i mind not thy company but in sooth i have no great fondness for beggar then forward quoth robin for the day wane and it will be dark ere we reach newark so off they go the lean horse hobble along as before and robin run beside albeit he be so quake with laughter within he that he could hardly stand yet he dare not laugh aloud lest the corn engrosser should suspect something so they travel along till they reach a hill just on the outskirts of sherwood here the lean man check he lean horse into a walk for the road be steep and he wish to save he nag 's strength have far to go ere he reach newark then he turn in he saddle and spake to robin again for the first time since they have leave the cross here be thy greatest danger friend say he for here we be nighest to that vile thief robin hood and the place where he dwell beyond this we come again to the open honest country and so be more safe in we journey alas quoth robin i would that i have as little money by I as thou hast for this day i fear that robin hood will get every groat of my wealth then the other look at robin and wink cunningly quoth he i tell thee friend that i have nigh as much by I as thou hast but it be hide so that never a knave in sherwood could find it thou dost surely jest quoth robin how could one hide so much as two hundred pound upon he person now as thou art so honest a fellow and withal so much younger than i be i will tell thee that which i have tell to no man in all the world before and thus thou mayst learn never again to do such a foolish thing as to trust to beggar 's garb to guard thee against robin hood seest thou these clog upon my foot yea quoth robin laugh truly they be large enough for any man to see even be he sight as foggy as that of peter patter who never could see when it be time to go to work peace friend say the corn engrosser for this be no matter for jest the sole of these clog be not what they seem to be for each one be a sweet little box and by twist the second nail from the toe the upper of the shoe and part of the sole lift up like a lid and in the space within be fourscore and ten bright golden pound in each shoe all wrap in hair to keep they from clink and so tell tale of themselves when the corn engrosser have tell this robin break into a roar of laughter and lay he hand upon the bridle rein stop the sad - look nag stay good friend quoth he between burst of merriment thou art the slyest old fox that e'er i saw in all my life -- in the sole of he shoon quotha -- if ever i trust a poor-seeming man again shave my head and paint it blue a corn factor a horse jockey a estate agent and a jackdaw for cunningness say i and he laugh again till he shake in he shoe with mirth all this time the corn engrosser have be stare at robin he mouth agape with wonder art thou mad quoth he to talk in this way so loud and in such a place let we forward and save thy mirth till we be safe and sound at newark nay quoth robin the tear of merriment wet on he cheek on second thought i go no farther than here for i have good friend hereabouts thou mayst go forward if thou dost list thou sweet pretty fellow but thou must go forward barefoot for i be afraid that thy shoon must be leave behind off with they friend for i tell thee i have take a great fancy to they at these word the corn factor grow pale as a linen napkin who art thou that talkest so say he then merry robin laugh again and quoth he man hereabouts call I robin hood so sweet friend thou hadst best do my bidding and give I thy shoe wherefore hasten i prythee or else thou wilt not get to fair newark town till after dark at the sound of the name of robin hood the corn factor quake with fear so that he have to seize he horse by the mane to save himself from fall off its back then straightway and without more word he strip off he clog and let they fall upon the road robin still hold the bridle rein stoop and pick they up then he say sweet friend i be use to ask those that i have dealings with to come and feast at sherwood with I i will not ask thee because of we pleasant journey together for i tell thee there be those in sherwood that would not be so gentle with thee as i have be the name of corn engrosser leave a nasty taste upon the tongue of all honest man take a fool 's advice of I and come no more so nigh to sherwood or mayhap some day thou mayst of a sudden find a clothyard shaft betwixt thy rib so with this i give thee good den hereupon he clap he hand to the horse 's flank and off go nag and rider but the man 's face be all bedew with the sweat of fright and never again i wot be he find so close to sherwood forest as he have be this day robin stand and look after he and when he be fairly go turn laughing and enter the forest carry the shoe in he hand that night in sweet sherwood the red fire glow brightly in waver light on tree and bush and all around sit or lay the stout fellow of the band to hear robin hood and little john tell they adventure all listen closely and again and again the wood ring with shout of laughter when all be tell friar tuck speak up good master say he thou hast

for he favorite archer then ten fresh target be bring forward and every sound be hush as the archer take they place once more this time the shooting be more speedily do for only nine shaft be shoot by each band not a arrow miss the target but in that of gilbert of the white hand five arrow be in the small white spot that mark the center of these five three be speed by gilbert then the judge come forward again and look at the target call aloud the name of the archer choose as the best bowman of each band of these gilbert of the white hand lead for six of the ten arrow he have shoot have lodge in the center but stout tepus and young clifton tread close upon he heel yet the other stand a fair chance for the second or third place and now amid the roaring of the crowd those ten stout fellow that be leave go back to they tent to rest for a while and change they bowstring for nought must fail at this next round and no hand must tremble or eye grow dim because of weariness then while the deep buzz and hum of talk sound all around like the noise of the wind in the leafy forest queen eleanor turn to the king and quoth she thinkest thou that these yeoman so choose be the very best archer in all merry england yea truly say the king smile for he be well please with the sport that he have see and i tell thee that not only be they the best archer in all merry england but in all the wide world beside but what wouldst thou say quoth queen eleanor if i be to find three archer to match the best three yeoman of all thy guard i would say thou hast do what i could not do say the king laughing for i tell thee there live not in all the world three archer to match tepus and gilbert and clifton of buckinghamshire now say the queen i know of three yeoman and in truth i have see they not long since that i would not fear to match against any three that thou canst choose from among all thy fortyscore archer and moreover i will match they here this very day but i will only match they with thy archer provide that thou wilt grant a free pardon to all that may come in my behalf at this the king laugh loud and long truly say he thou art take up with strange matter for a queen if thou wilt bring those three fellow that thou speakest of i will promise faithfully to give they free pardon for forty day to come or to go wheresoever they please nor will i harm a hair of they head in all that time moreover if these that thou bringest shoot better than my yeomen man for man they shall have the prize for themselves accord to they shooting but as thou hast so take up of a sudden with sport of this kind hast thou a mind for a wager why in sooth say queen eleanor laugh i know nought of such matter but if thou hast a mind to do somewhat in that way i will strive to pleasure thee what wilt thou wager upon thy man then the merry king laugh again for he dearly love goodly jest so he say amidst he laughter i will wager thee ten tun of rhenish wine ten tun of the stoutest ale and tenscore bow of temper spanish yew with quiver and arrow to match all that stand around smile at this for it seem a merry wager for a king to give to a queen but queen eleanor bow she head quietly i will take thy wager say she for i know right well where to place those thing that thou hast speak of now who will be on my side in this matter and she look around upon they that stand about but no one spake or care to wager upon the queen 's side against such archer as tepus and gilbert and clifton then the queen speak again now who will back I in this wager wilt thou my lord bishop of hereford nay quoth the bishop hastily it ill befit one of my cloth to deal in such matter moreover there be no such archer as he majesty 's in all the world therefore i would but lose my money methink the thought of thy gold weigheth more heavily with thee than the wrong to thy cloth say the queen smile and at this a ripple of laughter go around for everyone know how fond the bishop be of he money then the queen turn to a knight who stand near whose name be sir robert lee wilt thou back I in this manner say she thou art surely rich enough to risk so much for the sake of a lady to pleasure my queen i will do it say sir robert lee but for the sake of no other in all the world would i wager a groat for no man can stand against tepus and gilbert and clifton then turn to the king queen eleanor say i want no such aid as sir robert giveth I but against thy wine and beer and stout bow of yew i wager this girdle all set with jewel from around my waist and surely that be worth more than thine now i take thy wager quoth the king send for thy archer straightway but here come forth the other let they shoot and then i will match those that win against all the world so be it say the queen thereupon beckon to young richard partington she whisper something in he ear and straightway the page bow and leave the place cross the meadow to the other side of the range where he be presently lose in the crowd at this all that stand around whisper to one another wonder what it all mean and what three man the queen be about to set against those famous archer of the king 's guard and now the ten archer of the king 's guard take they stand again and all the great crowd be hush to the stillness of death slowly and carefully each man shoot he shaft and so deep be the silence that you could hear every arrow rap against the target as it strike it then when the last shaft have speed a great roar go up and the shooting i wot be well worthy of the sound once again gilbert have lodge three arrow in the white tepus come second with two in the white and one in the black ring next to it but stout clifton have go down and hubert of suffolk have take the third place for while both those two good yeoman have lodge two in the white clifton have lose one shot upon the fourth ring and hubert come in with one in the third all the archer around gilbert 's booth shout for joy till they throat be hoarse toss they cap aloft and shake hand with one another in the midst of all the noise and hubbub five man come walk across the lawn toward the king 's pavilion the first be richard partington and be know to most folk there but the other be strange to everybody beside young partington walk a yeoman clad in blue and behind come three other two in lincoln green and one in scarlet this last yeoman carry three stout bow of yew tree two fancifully inlay with silver and one with gold while these five man come walk across the meadow a messenger come run from the king 's booth and summon gilbert and tepus and hubert to go with he and now the shout quickly cease for all see that something unwonted be toward so the folk stand up in they place and lean forward to see what be the ado when partington and the other come before the spot where the king and queen sit the four yeoman bent they knee and doff they cap unto she king henry lean far forward and stare at they closely but the bishop of hereford when he see they face start as though sting by a wasp he open he mouth as though about to speak but look up he see the queen gaze at he with a smile upon she lip so he say nothing but bite he nether lip while he face be as red as a cherry then the queen lean forward and speak in a clear voice locksley say she i have make a wager with the king that thou and two of thy man can outshoot any three that he can send against you wilt thou do thy best for my sake yea quoth robin hood to whom she speak i will do my best for thy sake and if i fail i make my vow never to finger bowstr more now although little john have be somewhat abashed in the queen 's bower he feel himself the sturdy fellow he be when the sole of he foot press green grass again so he say boldly now blessing on thy sweet face say i a there live a man that would not do he best for thee -- i will say nought only i would like to have the crack of he knave 's pate peace little john say robin hood hastily in a low voice but good queen eleanor laugh aloud and a ripple of merriment sound all over the booth the bishop of hereford do not laugh neither do the king but he turn to the queen and quoth he who be these man that thou hast bring before we then up speak the bishop hastily for he could hold he peace no longer : you majesty quoth he yon fellow in blue be a certain outlawed thief of the mid-country name robin hood yon tall strap villain goeth by the name of little john the other fellow in green be a certain backsliding gentleman know as will scarlet the man in red be a rogue of a northern minstrel name allan a dale at this speech the king 's brow draw together blackly and he turn to the queen be this true say he sternly yea say the queen smile the bishop have tell the truth and truly he should know they well for he and two of he friar spend three day in merry sport with robin hood in sherwood forest i do little think that the good bishop would so betray he friend but bear in mind that thou hast pledge thy promise for the safety of these good yeoman for forty day i will keep my promise say the king in a deep voice that show the anger in he heart but when these forty day be go let this outlaw look to himself for mayhap thing will not go so smoothly with he as he would like then he turn to he archer who stand near the sherwood yeoman listen and wonder at all that pass quoth he gilbert and thou tepus and thou hubert i have pledge myself that ye shall shoot against these three fellow if ye outshoot the knave i will fill you cap with silver penny if ye fail ye shall lose you prize that ye have win so fairly and they go to they that shoot against you man to man do you best lad and if ye win this bout ye shall be glad of it to the last day of you life go now and get you go to the butt then the three archer of the king turn and go back to they booth and robin and he man go to they place at the mark from which they be to shoot then they string they bow and make themselves ready look over they quiver of arrow and pick out the roundest and the best feathered but when the king 's archer go to they tent they tell they friend all that have pass and how that these four man be the famous robin hood and three of he band to wit little john will scarlet and allan a dale the news of this buzz around among the archer in the booth for there be not a man there that have not hear of these great mid-country yeoman from the archer the news be take up by the crowd that look on at the shooting so that at last everybody stand up crane they neck to catch sight of the famous outlaw six fresh target be now set up one for each man that be to shoot whereupon gilbert and tepus and hubert come straightway forth from the booth then robin hood and gilbert of the white hand toss a farthing aloft to see who should lead in the shooting and the lot fall to gilbert 's side thereupon he call upon hubert of suffolk to lead hubert take he place plant he foot firmly and fit a fair smooth arrow then breathe upon he fingertip he draw the string slowly and carefully the arrow speed true and lodge in the white again he shoot and again he hit the clout a third shaft he speed but this time fail of the center and but strike the black yet not more than a finger 's - breadth from the white at this a shout go up for it be the best shooting that hubert have yet do that day merry robin laugh and quoth he thou wilt have a ill time better that round will for it be thy turn next brace thy thew lad and bring not shame upon sherwood then will scarlet take he place but because of overcaution he spoil he target with the very first arrow that he speed for he hit the next ring to the black the second from the center at this robin bit he lip lad lad quoth he hold not the string so long have i not often tell thee what gaffer swanthold sayeth that ` overcaution spilleth the milk ' to this will scarlet take heed so the next arrow he shoot lodge fairly in the center ring again he shoot and again he smite the center but for all that stout hubert have outshoot he and show the better target then all those that look on clap they hand for joy because that hubert have overcome the stranger quoth the king grimly to the queen if thy archer shoot no better than that thou art like to lose thy wager lady but queen eleanor smile for she look for better thing from robin hood and little john and now tepus take he place to shoot he also take overheed to what he be about and so he fall into will scarlet 's error the first arrow he strike into the center ring but the second miss its mark and smite the black the last arrow be tip with luck for it smite the very center of the clout upon the black spot that mark it quoth robin hood that be the sweetest shot that have be speed this day but nevertheless friend tepus thy cake be burn methink little john it be thy turn next so little john take he place as bidden and shoot he three arrow quickly he never lower he bow arm in all the shooting but fit each shaft with he longbow raise yet all three of he arrow smite the center within easy distance of the black at this no sound of shout be hear for although it be the best shooting that have be do that day the folk of london town do not like to see the stout tepus overcome by a fellow from the countryside even be he as famous as little john and now stout gilbert of the white hand take he place and shot with the greatest care and again for the third time in one day he strike all three shaft into the clout well do gilbert quoth robin hood smite he upon the shoulder i make my vow thou art one of the best archer that ever mine eye behold thou shouldst be a free and merry ranger like we lad for thou art better fit for the greenwood than for the cobblestone and gray wall of london town so say he take he place and draw a fair round arrow from he quiver which he turn over and over ere he fit it to he bowstring then the king mutter in he beard now bless saint hubert if thou wilt but jog that rogue 's elbow so as to make he smite even the second ring i will give eightscore waxen candle three finger ' - breadth in thickness to thy chapel nigh matching but it may be saint hubert 's ear be stuff with tow for he seem not to hear the king 's prayer this day have get three shaft to he liking merry robin look carefully to he bowstr ere he shoot yea quoth he to gilbert who stand nigh he to watch he shooting thou shouldst pay we a visit at merry sherwood here he draw the bowstr to he ear in london -- here he loose he shaft -- thou canst find nought to shoot at but rook and daw there one can tickle the rib of the noblest stag in england so he shoot even while he talk yet the shaft lodge not more than half a inch from the very center by my soul cry gilbert art thou the devil in blue to shoot in that wise nay quoth robin laugh not quite so ill as that i trust and he take up another shaft and fit it to the string again he shoot and again he smite he arrow close beside the center a third time he loose he bowstring and drop he arrow just betwixt the other two and into the very center so that the feather of all three be ruffle together seem from a distance to be one thick shaft and now a low murmur run all among that great crowd for never before have london see such shooting as this and never again would it see it after robin hood 's day have go all see that the king 's archer be fairly beat and stout gilbert clap he palm to robin 's owning that he could never hope to draw such a bowstring as robin hood or little john but the king full of wrath would not have it so though he know in he mind that he man could not stand against those fellow nay cry he clench he hand upon the arm of he seat gilbert be not yet beat do he not strike the clout thrice although i have lose my wager he have not yet lose the first prize they shall shoot again and still again till either he or that knave robin hood cometh off the best go thou sir hugh and bid they shoot another round and another until one or the other be overcome then sir hugh see how wroth the king be say never a word but go straightway to do he bidding so he come to where robin hood and the other stand and tell they what the king have say with all my heart quoth merry robin i will shoot from this time till tomorrow day if it can pleasure my most gracious lord and king take thy place gilbert lad and shoot so gilbert take he place once more but this time he fail for a sudden little wind arise he shaft miss the center ring but by not more than the breadth of a barley straw thy egg be crack gilbert quoth robin laughing and straightway he loose a shaft and once more smite the white circle of the center then the king arise from he place and not a word say he but he look around with a baleful look and it would have be a ill day for anyone that he see with a joyous or a merry look upon he face then he and he queen and all the court leave the place but the king 's heart be brimming full of wrath after the king have go all the yeoman of the archer guard come crowd around robin and little john and will and allan to snatch a look at these famous fellow from the mid-country and with they come many that have be onlooker at the sport for the same purpose thus it happen presently that the yeoman to whom gilbert stand talking be all surround by a crowd of people that form a ring about they

this day then he call he three yeomen together and tell they privately that they have best be jogging as it be like to be ill for they so nigh merry london town so without tarry longer they make they way through the crowd until they have come out from the press then without stop they leave london town and start away northward the chase of robin hood so robin hood and the other leave the archery range at finsbury field and tarry not set forth straightway upon they homeward journey it be well for they that they do so for they have not go more than three or four mile upon they way when six of the yeoman of the king 's guard come bustling among the crowd that still linger seek for robin and he man to seize upon they and make they prisoner truly it be a ill-done thing in the king to break he promise but it all come about through the bishop of hereford 's do for thus it happen : after the king leave the archery ground he go straightway to he cabinet and with he go the bishop of hereford and sir robert lee but the king say never a word to these two but sit gnawing he nether lip for he heart be gall within he by what have happen at last the bishop of hereford speak in a low sorrowful voice : it be a sad thing you majesty that this knavish outlaw should be let to escape in this wise for let he but get back to sherwood forest safe and sound and he may snap he finger at king and king 's man at these word the king raise he eye and look grimly upon the bishop sayst thou so quoth he now i will show thee in good time how much thou dost err for when the forty day be past and go i will seize upon this thieving outlaw if i have to tear down all of sherwood to find he thinkest thou that the law of the king of england be to be so evade by one poor knave without friend or money then the bishop speak again in he soft smooth voice : forgive my boldness you majesty and believe that i have nought but the good of england and you majesty 's desiring at heart but what would it boot though my gracious lord do root up every tree of sherwood be there not other place for robin hood 's hiding cannock chase be not far from sherwood and the great forest of arden be not far from cannock chase beside these be many other woodland in nottingham and derby lincoln and york amid any of which you majesty might as well think to seize upon robin hood as to lay finger upon a rat among the dust and broken thing of a garret nay my gracious lord if he doth once plant foot in the woodland he be lose to the law forever at these word the king tap he fingertip upon the table beside he with vexation what wouldst thou have I do bishop quoth he do thou not hear I pledge my word to the queen thy talk be as barren as the wind from the bellows upon dead coal far be it from I say the cunning bishop to point the way to one so clear-sighted as you majesty but be i the king of england i should look upon the matter in this wise : i have promise my queen let we say that for forty day the cunningest rogue in all england shall have freedom to come and go but lo i find this outlaw in my grasp shall i then foolishly cling to a promise so hastily give suppose that i have promise to do she majesty 's bidding whereupon she bid I to slay myself should i then shut mine eye and run blindly upon my sword thus would i argue within myself moreover i would say unto myself a woman knoweth nought of the great thing appertain to state government and likewise i know a woman be ever prone to take up a fancy even as she would pluck a daisy from the roadside and then throw it away when the savor be go therefore though she have take a fancy to this outlaw it will soon wane away and be forget as for I i have the greatest villain in all england in my grasp shall i then open my hand and let he slip betwixt my finger thus you majesty would i say to myself be i the king of england so the bishop talk and the king lend he ear to he evil counsel until after a while he turn to sir robert lee and bid he send six of the yeoman of the guard to take robin hood and he three man prisoner now sir robert lee be a gentle and noble knight and he feel grieve to the heart to see the king so break he promise nevertheless he say nothing for he see how bitterly the king be set against robin hood but he do not send the yeoman of the guard at once but go first to the queen and tell she all that have pass and bid she send word to robin of he danger this he do not for the well-being of robin hood but because he would save he lord 's honor if he could thus it come about that when after a while the yeoman of the guard go to the archery field they find not robin and the other and so get no cake at that fair the afternoon be already well-nigh go when robin hood little john will and allan set forth upon they homeward way trudge along merrily through the yellow slanting light which speedily change to rosy red as the sun sink low in the heaven the shadow grow long and finally merge into the grayness of the mellow twilight the dusty highway lay all white betwixt the dark hedgerow and along it walk four fellow like four shadow the pat of they foot sound loud and they voice as they talk ring clear upon the silence of the air the great round moon be float breathlessly up in the eastern sky when they see before they the twinkling light of barnet town some ten or twelve mile from london down they walk through the stony street and past the cosy house with overhang gable before the door of which sit the burgher and craftsman in the mellow moonlight with they family about they and so come at last on the other side of the hamlet to a little inn all shaded with rose and woodbine before this inn robin hood stop for the spot pleased he well quoth he here will we take up we inn and rest for the night for we be well away from london town and we king 's wrath moreover if i mistake not we will find sweet faring within what say ye lad in sooth good master quoth little john thy bidding and my do ever fit together like cake and ale let we in i say also then up spake will scarlet : i be ever ready to do what thou sayest uncle yet i could wish that we be farther upon we way ere we rest for the night nevertheless if thou thinkest best let we in for the night say i also so in they go and call for the best that the place afford then a right good feast be set before they with two stout bottle of old sack to wash it down withal these thing be serve by as plump and buxom a lass as you could find in all the land so that little john who always have a eye for a fair lass even when meat and drink be by stick he arm akimbo and fix he eye upon she wink sweetly whenever he see she look toward he then you should have see how the lass twitter with laughter and how she look at little john out of the corner of she eye a dimple come in either cheek for the fellow have always a take way with the womenfolk so the feast pass merrily and never have that inn see such lusty feeder as these four stout fellow but at last they be do they eating though it seem as though they never would have end and sit loitering over the sack as they so sit the landlord come in of a sudden and say that there be one at the door a certain young esquire richard partington of the queen 's household who wish to see the lad in blue and speak with he without loss of time so robin arise quickly and bid the landlord not to follow he leave the other gaze at one another and wonder what be about to happen when robin come out of the inn he find young richard partington sit upon he horse in the white moonlight await he come what news bearest thou sir page say robin i trust that it be not of a ill nature why say young partington for the matter of that it be ill enow the king have be bitterly stir up against thee by that vile bishop of hereford he send to arrest thee at the archery butt at finsbury field but not find thee there he have gather together he armed man fiftyscore and more and be send they in haste along this very road to sherwood either to take thee on the way or to prevent thy get back to the woodland again he have give the bishop of hereford command over all these man and thou knowest what thou hast to expect of the bishop of hereford -- short shrift and a long rope two band of horseman be already upon the road not far behind I so thou hadst best get thee go from this place straightway for if thou tarriest longer thou art like to sleep this night in a cold dungeon this word the queen have bid I bring to thee now richard partington quoth robin this be the second time that thou hast save my life and if the proper time ever cometh i will show thee that robin hood never forget these thing as for that bishop of hereford if i ever catch he nigh to sherwood again thing will be like to go ill with he thou mayst tell the good queen that i will leave this place without delay and will let the landlord think that we be go to saint alban but when we be upon the highroad again i will go one way through the country and will send my man the other so that if one falleth into the king 's hand the other may haply escape we will go by devious way and so i hope will reach sherwood in safety and now sir page i wish thee farewell farewell thou bold yeoman say young partington and mayst thou reach thy hiding in safety so each shake the other 's hand and the lad turn he horse 's head ride back toward london while robin enter the inn once more there he find he yeoman sit in silence wait he come likewise the landlord be there for he be curious to know what master partington have to do with the fellow in blue up my merry man quoth robin this be no place for we for those be after we with whom we will stand but a ill chance a we fall into they hand so we will go forward once more nor will we stop this night till we reach saint alban hereupon take out he purse he pay the landlord he score and so they leave the inn when they have come to the highroad without the town robin stop and tell they all that have pass between young partington and himself and how that the king 's man be after they with hot heel then he tell they that here they should part company they three go to the eastward and he to the westward and so skirt the main highroad would come by devious path to sherwood so be ye wily say robin hood and keep well away from the northward road till ye have get well to the eastward and thou will scarlet take the lead of the other for thou hast a cunning turn to thy wit then robin kiss the three upon the cheek and they kiss he and so they part company not long after this a score or more of the king 's man come clatter up to the door of the inn at barnet town here they leap from they horse and quickly surround the place the leader of the band and four other enter the room where the yeoman have be but they find that they bird have fly again and that the king have be balk a second time methought that they be naughty fellow say the host when he hear whom the men-at-arms seek but i hear that blue-clad knave say that they would go straight forward to saint alban so a ye hurry forward ye may perchance catch they on the highroad betwixt here and there for this news the leader of the band thank mine host right heartily and call he man together mount and set forth again gallop forward to saint alban upon a wild goose chase after little john and will scarlet and allan a dale have leave the highway near garnet they travel toward the eastward without stop as long as they leg could carry they until they come to chelmsford in essex thence they turn northward and come through cambridge and lincolnshire to the good town of gainsborough then strike to the westward and the south they come at last to the northern border of sherwood forest without in all that time have meet so much as a single band of the king 's man eight day they journey thus ere they reach the woodland in safety but when they get to the greenwood glade they find that robin have not yet return for robin be not as lucky in get back as he man have be as you shall presently hear after have leave the great northern road he turn he face to the westward and so come past aylesbury to fair woodstock in oxfordshire thence he turn he footstep northward travel for a great distance by way of warwick town till he come to dudley in staffordshire seven day it take he to journey thus far and then he think he have get far enough to the north so turn toward the eastward shun the main road and choose byway and grassy lane he go by way of litchfield and ashby de la zouch toward sherwood until he come to a place call stanton and now robin 's heart begin to laugh aloud for he think that he danger have go by and that he nostril would soon snuff the spicy air of the woodland once again but there be many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip and this robin be to find for thus it be : when the king 's man find themselves foiled at saint alban and that robin and he man be not to be find high nor low they know not what to do presently another band of horseman come and another until all the moonlit street be full of armed man betwixt midnight and dawn another band come to the town and with they come the bishop of hereford when he hear that robin hood have once more slip out of the trap he stay not a minute but gather he band together he push forward to the northward with speed leave order for all the troops that come to saint alban to follow after he without tarry on the evening of the fourth day he reach nottingham town and there straightway divide he man into band of six or seven and send they all through the countryside block every highway and byway to the eastward and the southward and the westward of sherwood the sheriff of nottingham call forth all he man likewise and join with the bishop for he see that this be the best chance that have ever befall of pay back he score in full to robin hood will scarlet and little john and allan a dale have just miss the king 's man to the eastward for the very next day after they have pass the line and enter sherwood the road through which they have travel be block so that have they tarry in they journey they would surely have fall into the bishop 's hand but of all this robin know not a whit so he whistle merrily as he trudge along the road beyond stanton with he heart as free from care as the yolk of a egg be from cobweb at last he come to where a little stream spread across the road in a shallow sheet tinkling and sparkling as it fret over its bed of golden gravel here robin stop be athirst and kneel down he make a cup of the palm of he hand and begin to drink on either side of the road for a long distance stand tangled thicket of bush and young tree and it pleased robin 's heart to hear the little bird singing therein for it make he think of sherwood and it seem as though it have be a lifetime since he have breathe the air of the woodland but of a sudden as he thus stoop drinking something hiss past he ear and strike with a splash into the gravel and water beside he quick as a wink robin spring to he foot and at one bind cross the stream and the roadside and plunge headlong into the thicket without look around for he know right well that that which have hiss so venomously beside he ear be a gray goose shaft and that to tarry so much as a moment mean death even as he leap into the thicket six more arrow rattle among the branch after he one of which pierce he doublet and would have strike deeply into he side but for the tough coat of steel that he wear then up the road come ride some of the king 's man at headlong speed they leap from they horse and plunge straightway into the thicket after robin but robin know the ground better than they do so crawl here stoop there and anon run across some little open he soon leave they far behind come out at last upon another road about eight hundred pace distant from the one he have leave here he stand for a moment listen to the distant shout of the seven man as they beat up and down in the thicket like hound that have lose the scent of the quarry then buckle he belt more tightly around he waist he run fleetly down the road toward the eastward and sherwood but robin have not go more than three furlong in that direction when he come suddenly to the brow of a hill and see beneath he another band of the king 's man seat in the shade along the roadside in the valley beneath then he pause not a moment but see that they have not catch sight of he he turn and run back whence he have come know that it be better to run the chance of escape those fellow that be yet in the thicket than to rush into the arm of those in the valley so back he run with all speed and have get safely past the thicket when the seven man come forth into the open road they raise a great shout when they see he such as the hunter give when the deer break cover but robin be then a quarter of a mile and more away from they course over the ground like a greyhound he never slacken he pace but run along mile after mile till he have come nigh to mackworth over beyond the derwent river nigh to derby town here see that he be out of present danger he slacken in he run and at last sit he down beneath a hedge where the grass be the longest and the shade the coolest there to rest and catch he wind by my soul robin quoth he to himself that be the narrowest miss that e'er thou hadst in all thy life i do say most solemnly that the feather of that wicked shaft tickled mine ear as it whiz past this same run have give I a most craving appetite for victuals and drink now i pray saint dunstan that he send I speedily some meat and beer it seem as though saint dunstan be like to answer he prayer for along the road come plod a certain cobbler one quince of derby who have be to take a pair of shoe to a farmer nigh kirk langly and be now come back home again with a fair boil capon in he pouch and a stout pottle of beer by he side which same the farmer have give he for joy of such a stout pair of shoon good quince be a honest fellow but he wit be somewhat of the heavy sort like unbaked dough so that the only thing that be in he mind be three shilling sixpence ha ` penny for thy shoon good quince -- three shilling sixpence ha ` penny for thy shoon and this travel round and round inside of he head without another think get into he noddle as a pea roll round and round inside a empty quart pot halloa good friend quoth robin from beneath the hedge when the other have get nigh enough whither away so merrily this bright day hearing himself so call upon the cobbler stop and see a well - clad stranger in blue he speak to he in seemly wise give ye good den fair sir and i would say that i come from kirk langly where i ha ' sell my shoon and get three shilling sixpence ha ` penny for they in as sweet money as ever thou sawest and honestly earn too i would ha ' thee know but a i may be so bold thou pretty fellow what dost thou there beneath the hedge marry quoth merry robin i sit beneath the hedge here to drop salt on the tail of golden bird but in sooth thou art the first chick of any worth i ha ' see this bless

be get by boil down a quart of moonbeam in a wooden platter and then one have but a pinch but tell I now thou witty man what hast thou get there in that pouch by thy side and in that pottle at these word the cobbler look down at those thing of which merry robin speak for the thought of the golden bird have drive they from he mind and it take he some time to scrape the memory of they back again why say he at last in the one be good march beer and in the other be a fat capon truly quince the cobbler will ha ' a fine feast this day a i mistake not but tell I good quince say robin hast thou a mind to sell those thing to I for the hearing of they sound sweet in mine ear i will give thee these gay clothes of blue that i have upon my body and ten shilling to boot for thy clothes and thy leather apron and thy beer and thy capon what sayst thou bully boy nay thou dost jest with I say the cobbler for my clothes be coarse and patched and thine be of fine stuff and very pretty never a jest do i speak quoth robin come strip thy jacket off and i will show thee for i tell thee i like thy clothes well moreover i will be kind to thee for i will feast straightway upon the good thing thou hast with thee and thou shalt be bid to the eating at these word he begin slip off he doublet and the cobbler see he so in earnest begin pull off he clothes also for robin hood 's garb tickle he eye so each put on the other fellow 's clothes and robin give the honest cobbler ten bright new shilling quoth merry robin i ha ' be a many thing in my life before but never have i be a honest cobbler come friend let we fall to and eat for something within I cackle aloud for that good fat capon so both sit down and begin to feast right lustily so that when they be do the bone of the capon be pick as bare as charity then robin stretch he leg out with a sweet feeling of comfort within he quoth he by the turn of thy voice good quince i know that thou hast a fair song or two run loose in thy head like colt in a meadow i prythee turn one of they out for I a song or two i ha ' quoth the cobbler poor thing poor thing but such as they be thou art welcome to one of they so moisten he throat with a swallow of beer he sing : _ of all the joy the best i love sing hey my frisking nan o and that which most my soul doth move it be the clink can o all other bliss i would throw away sing hey my frisking nan o but this _ -- the stout cobbler get no further in he song for of a sudden six horseman burst upon they where they sit and seize roughly upon the honest craftsman haul he to he foot and nearly pluck the clothes from he as they do so ha roar the leader of the band in a great big voice of joy have we then catch thee at last thou blue - clad knave now bless be the name of saint hubert for we be fourscore pound richer this minute than we be before for the good bishop of hereford have promise that much to the band that shall bring thee to he oho thou cunning rascal thou wouldst look so innocent forsooth we know thee thou old fox but off thou goest with we to have thy brush clip forthwith at these word the poor cobbler gaze all around he with he great blue eye as round as those of a dead fish while he mouth gape as though he have swallow all he word and so lose he speech robin also gape and stare in a wonder way just as the cobbler would have do in he place alack-a-daisy I quoth he i know not whether i be sit here or in no-man 's - land what meaneth all this stir i ' th ' pot dear good gentleman surely this be a sweet honest fellow ` honest fellow ' sayst thou clown quoth one of the man why i tell thee that this be that same rogue that man call robin hood at this speech the cobbler stare and gape more than ever for there be such a threshing of thought go on within he poor head that he wit be all befog with the dust and chaff thereof moreover as he look at robin hood and see the yeoman look so like what he know himself to be he begin to doubt and to think that mayhap he be the great outlaw in real sooth say he in a slow wonder voice be i in very truth that fellow -- now i have think -- but nay quince thou art mistake -- yet -- be i -- nay i must indeed be robin hood yet truly i have never think to pass from a honest craftsman to such a great yeoman alas quoth robin hood look ye there now see how you ill - treatment have curdle the wit of this poor lad and turn they all sour i myself be quince the cobbler of derby town be it so say quince then indeed i be somebody else and can be none other than robin hood take I fellow but let I tell you that ye ha ' lay hand upon the stoutest yeoman that ever tread the woodland thou wilt play madman wilt thou say the leader of the band here gile fetch a cord and bind this knave 's hand behind he i warrant we will bring he wit back to he again when we get he safe before we good bishop at tutbury town thereupon they tie the cobbler 's hand behind he and lead he off with a rope as the farmer lead off the calf he have bring from the fair robin stand look after they and when they be go he laugh till the tear roll down he cheek for he know that no harm would befall the honest fellow and he picture to himself the bishop 's face when good quince be bring before he as robin hood then turn he step once more to the eastward he step out right foot foremost toward nottinghamshire and sherwood forest but robin hood have go through more than he wott of he journey from london have be hard and long and in a se'ennight he have travel sevenscore and more of mile he think now to travel on without stop until he have come to sherwood but ere he have go a half a score of mile he feel he strength give way beneath he like a river bank which the water have undermine he sit he down and rest but he know within himself that he could go no farther that day for he foot feel like lump of lead so heavy be they with weariness once more he arise and go forward but after travel a couple of mile he be fain to give the matter up so come to a inn just then he enter and call the landlord bid he show he to a room although the sun be only then just sink in the western sky there be but three bedroom in the place and to the meanest of these the landlord show robin hood but little robin care for the look of the place for he could have sleep that night upon a bed of broken stone so strip off he clothes without more ado he roll into the bed and be asleep almost ere he head touch the pillow not long after robin have so go to he rest a great cloud peep blackly over the hill to the westward higher and higher it arise until it pile up into the night like a mountain of darkness all around beneath it come ever and anon a dull red flash and presently a short grim mutter of the come thunder be hear then up ride four stout burgher of nottingham town for this be the only inn within five mile ' distance and they do not care to be catch in such a thunderstorm as this that be come upon they leave they nag to the stableman they enter the best room of the inn where fresh green rush lay all spread upon the floor and there call for the goodliest fare that the place afford after have eat heartily they bid the landlord show they to they room for they be aweary have ride all the way from dronfield that day so off they go grumble at have to sleep two in a bed but they trouble on this score as well as all other be soon lose in the quietness of sleep and now come the first gust of wind rush past the place clapping and bang the door and shutter smell of the coming rain and all wrap in a cloud of dust and leave as though the wind have bring a guest along with it the door open of a sudden and in come a friar of emmet priory and one in high degree as be show by the softness and sleekness of he robe and the richness of he rosary he call to the landlord and bid he first have he mule well feed and bed in the stable and then to bring he the very best there be in the house so presently a savory stew of tripe and onion with sweet little fat dumpling be set before he likewise a good stout pottle of malmsey and straightway the holy friar fall to with great courage and heartiness so that in a short time nought be leave but a little pool of gravy in the center of the platter not large enow to keep the life in a starve mouse in the meantime the storm break another gust of wind go rush by and with it fall a few heavy drop of rain which presently come rattle down in shower beat against the casement like a hundred little hand bright flash of lightning light up every raindrop and with they come crack of thunder that go away rumble and bump as though saint swithin be busy roll great cask of water across rough ground overhead the womenfolk scream and the merry wag in the taproom put they arm around they waist to soothe they into quietness at last the holy friar bid the landlord show he to he room but when he hear that he be to bed with a cobbler he be as ill contented a fellow as you could find in all england nevertheless there be nothing for it and he must sleep there or nowhere so take up he candle he go off grumble like the now distant thunder when he come to the room where he be to sleep he hold the light over robin and look at he from top to toe then he feel better pleased for instead of a rough dirty-bearded fellow he behold as fresh and clean a lad as one could find in a week of sunday so slip off he clothes he also huddle into the bed where robin grunt and grumble in he sleep make room for he robin be more sound asleep i wot than he have be for many a day else he would never have rest so quietly with one of the friar 's sort so close beside he as for the friar have he know who robin hood be you may well believe he would almost as soon have sleep with a adder as with the man he have for a bedfellow so the night pass comfortably enough but at the first dawn of day robin open he eye and turn he head upon the pillow then how he gape and how he stare for there beside he lay one all shaven and shear so that he know that it must be a fellow in holy order he pinch himself sharply but find he be awake sit up in bed while the other slumber as peacefully as though he be safe and sound at home in emmet priory now quoth robin to himself i wonder how this thing have drop into my bed during the night so say he arise softly so as not to waken the other and look about the room he espy the friar 's clothes lie upon a bench near the wall first he look at the clothes with he head on one side and then he look at the friar and slowly wink one eye quoth he good brother what-e ` er - thy-name-may-be as thou hast borrow my bed so freely i 'll e ` en borrow thy clothes in return so say he straightway don the holy man 's garb but kindly leave the cobbler 's clothes in the place of it then he go forth into the freshness of the morning and the stableman that be up and about the stable open he eye as though he see a green mouse before he for such man as the friar of emmet be not wont to be early riser but the man bottle he thought and only ask robin whether he want he mule bring from the stable yea my son quoth robin -- albeit he know nought of the mule -- and bring it forth quickly i prythee for i be late and must be jogging so presently the stableman bring forth the mule and robin mount it and go on he way rejoice as for the holy friar when he arise he be in as pretty a stew as any man in all the world for he rich soft robe be go likewise he purse with ten golden pound in it and nought be leave but patch clothes and a leathern apron he rage and swear like any layman but as he swearing mend nothing and the landlord could not aid he and as moreover he be force to be at emmet priory that very morning upon matter of business he be fain either to don the cobbler 's clothes or travel the road in nakedness so he put on the clothes and still rage and swearing vengeance against all the cobbler in derbyshire he set forth upon he way afoot but he ill have not yet do with he for he have not go far ere he fall into the hand of the king 's man who march he off willy-nilly to tutbury town and the bishop of hereford in vain he swear he be a holy man and show he shaven crown off he must go for nothing would do but that he be robin hood meanwhile merry robin ride along contentedly pass safely by two band of the king 's man until he heart begin to dance within he because of the nearness of sherwood so he travel ever on to the eastward till of a sudden he meet a noble knight in a shady lane then robin check he mule quickly and leap from off its back now well meet sir richard of the lea cry he for rather than any other man in england would i see thy good face this day then he tell sir richard all the happening that have befall he and that now at last he feel himself safe be so nigh to sherwood again but when robin have do sir richard shake he head sadly thou art in greater danger now robin than thou hast yet be say he for before thee lie band of the sheriff 's man block every road and let none pass through the line without examine they closely i myself know this have pass they but now before thee lie the sheriff man and behind thee the king 's man and thou canst not hope to pass either way for by this time they will know of thy disguise and will be in wait to seize upon thee my castle and everything within it be thine but nought could be gain there for i could not hope to hold it against such a force as be now in nottingham of the king 's and the sheriff man have so speak sir richard bent he head in thought and robin feel he heart sink within he like that of the fox that hear the hound at he heel and find he den block with earth so that there be no hiding for he but presently sir richard speak again say one thing thou canst do robin and one only go back to london and throw thyself upon the mercy of we good queen eleanor come with I straightway to my castle doff these clothes and put on such as my retainer wear then i will hie I to london town with a troop of man behind I and thou shalt mingle with they and thus will i bring thee to where thou mayst see and speak with the queen thy only hope be to get to sherwood for there none can reach thee and thou wilt never get to sherwood but in this way so robin go with sir richard of the lea and do as he say for he see the wisdom of that which the knight advise and that this be he only chance of safety queen eleanor walk in she royal garden amid the rose that bloom sweetly and with she walk six of she ladies-in-waiting chatter blithely together of a sudden a man leap up to the top of the wall from the other side and then hang for a moment drop lightly upon the grass within all the ladies-in-waiting shriek at the suddenness of he come but the man run to the queen and kneel at she foot and she see that it be robin hood why how now robin cry she dost thou dare to come into the very jaw of the rage lion alas poor fellow thou art lose indeed if the king find thee here dost thou not know that he be seek thee through all the land yea quoth robin i do know right well that the king seek I and therefore i have come for surely no ill can befall I when he have pledge he royal word to you majesty for my safety moreover i know you majesty 's kindness and gentleness of heart and so i lay my life freely in you gracious hand i take thy meaning robin hood say the queen and that thou dost convey reproach to I as well thou mayst for i know that i have not do by thee as i ought to have do i know right well that thou must have be hard press by peril to leap so boldly into one danger to escape another once more i promise thee mine aid and will do all i can to send thee back in safety to sherwood forest bide thou here till i return so say she leave robin in

glare savagely upon robin quoth he thou hast a merry tongue thou villain but take care that thou makest not too free with it or i may cut it out from thy throat for thee robin hood string he bow and take he place with never a word albeit he heartstrings quiver with anger and loathing twice he shoot the first time hit within a inch of the wand the second time splitting it fairly in the middle then without give the other a chance for speech he fling he bow upon the ground there thou bloody villain cry he fiercely let that show thee how little thou knowest of manly sport and now look thy last upon the daylight for the good earth have be befoul long enough by thee thou vile beast this day we lady willing thou diest -- i be robin hood so say he flash forth he bright sword in the sunlight for a time guy of gisbourne stare upon robin as though bereft of wit but he wonder quickly pass to a wild rage art thou indeed robin hood cry he now i be glad to meet thee thou poor wretch shrive thyself for thou wilt have no time for shrive when i be do with thee so say he also draw he sword and now come the fiercest fight that ever sherwood saw for each man know that either he or the other must die and that no mercy be to be have in this battle up and down they fight till all the sweet green grass be crushed and ground beneath the trampling of they heel more than once the point of robin hood 's sword feel the softness of flesh and presently the ground begin to be sprinkle with bright red drop albeit not one of they come from robin 's vein at last guy of gisbourne make a fierce and deadly thrust at robin hood from which he leap back lightly but in so leap he catch he heel in a root and fall heavily upon he back now holy mary aid I mutter he as the other leap at he with a grin of rage upon he face fiercely guy of gisbourne stab at the other with he great sword but robin catch the blade in he naked hand and though it cut he palm he turn the point away so that it plunge deep into the ground close beside he then ere a blow could be strike again he leap to he foot with he good sword in he hand and now despair fall upon guy of gisbourne 's heart in a black cloud and he look around he wildly like a wounded hawk see that he strength be go from he robin leap forward and quick as a flash strike a back-handed blow beneath the sword arm down fall the sword from guy of gisbourne 's grasp and back he stagger at the stroke and ere he could regain himself robin 's sword pass through and through he body round he spin upon he heel and fling he hand aloft with a shrill wild cry fall prone upon he face upon the green sod then robin hood wipe he sword and thrust it back into the scabbard and come to where guy of gisbourne lay he stand over he with fold arm talk to himself the while this be the first man i have slay since i shoot the king forester in the hot day of my youth i ofttimes think bitterly even yet of that first life i take but of this i be as glad as though i have slay a wild boar that lay waste a fair country since the sheriff of nottingham have send such a one as this against I i will put on the fellow 's garb and go forth to see whether i may not find he worship and perchance pay he back some of the debt i owe he upon this score so say robin hood strip the hairy garment from off the dead man and put they on himself all bloody as they be then strap the other 's sword and dagger around he body and carry he own in he hand together with the two bow of yew he draw the cowl of horse 's hide over he face so that none could tell who he be and set forth from the forest turn he step toward the eastward and nottingham town as he stride along the country road man woman and child hide away from he for the terror of guy of gisbourne 's name and of he doings have spread far and near and now let we see what befall little john while these thing be happen little john walk on he way through the forest path until he have come to the outskirts of the woodland where here and there field of barley corn or green meadow land lay smile in the sun so he come to the highroad and to where a little thatched cottage stand back of a cluster of twisted crab tree with flower in front of it here he stop of a sudden for he think that he hear the sound of someone in sorrow he listen and find that it come from the cottage so turn he footstep thither he push open the wicket and enter the place there he see a gray-haired dame sit beside a cold hearthstone rock herself to and fro and weep bitterly now little john have a tender heart for the sorrow of other folk so come to

along the way when they be swing with a arrow beneath the rib with all my heart say the sheriff only as i say before make thou haste in thy doings little john put the tip of he bow to he instep and string the weapon so deftly that all wonder to see a old man so strong next he draw a good smooth arrow from he quiver and fit it to the string then look all around to see that the way be clear behind he he suddenly cast away the wool from he head and face shouting in a mighty voice run quick as a flash the three youth fling the noose from they neck and speed across the open to the woodland as the arrow speed from the bow little john also fly toward the covert like a greyhound while the sheriff and he man gaze after he all bewilder with the sudden do but ere the yeoman have go far the sheriff rouse himself after he he roar in a mighty voice for he know now who it be with whom he have be talk and wonder that he have not know he before little john hear the sheriff 's word and see that he could not hope to reach the woodland before they would be upon he he stop and turn suddenly hold he bow as though he be about to shoot stand back cry he fiercely the first man that cometh a foot forward or toucheth finger to bowstr dieth at these word the sheriff 's man stand as still as stock for they know right well that little john would be as good as he word and that to disobey he mean death in vain the sheriff roar at they call they coward and urge they forward in a body they would not budge a inch but stand and watch little john as he move slowly away toward the forest keep he gaze fix upon they but when the sheriff see he enemy thus slip betwixt he finger he grow mad with he rage so that he head swam and he know not what he do then of a sudden he turn he horse 's head and plunge he spur into its side he give a great shout and rise in he stirrup come down upon little john like the wind then little john raise he deadly bow and draw the gray goose feather to he cheek but alas for he for ere he could loose the shaft the good bow that have serve he so long split in he hand and the arrow fall harmless at he foot see what have happen the sheriff 's man raise a shout and follow they master come rush down upon little john but the sheriff be ahead of the other and so catch up with the yeoman before he reach the shelter of the woodland then lean forward he strike a mighty blow little john ducked and the sheriff 's sword turn in he hand but the flat of the blade strike the other upon the head and smite he down stunned and senseless now i be right glad say the sheriff when the man come up and find that little john be not dead that i have not slay this man in my haste i would rather lose five hundred pound than have he die thus instead of hang as such a vile thief should do go get some water from yonder fountain william and pour it over he head the man do as he be bid and presently little john open he eye and look around he all daze and bewilder with the stun of the blow then they tie he hand behind he and lift he up set he upon the back of one of the horse with he face to its tail and he foot strap beneath its belly so they take he back to the king 's head inn laughing and rejoice as they go along but in the meantime the widow 's three son have get safely away and be hide in the woodland once more the sheriff of nottingham sit within the king 's head inn he heart rejoice within he for he have at last do that which he have seek to do for year take little john prisoner quoth he to himself this time tomorrow the rogue shall hang upon the gallows tree in front of the great gate of nottingham town and thus shall i make my long score with he even so say he take a deep draught of canary but it seem as if the sheriff have swallow a think with he wine for he shake he head and put the cup down hastily now he mutter to himself i would not for a thousand pound have this fellow slip through my finger yet should he master escape that foul guy of gisbourne there be no know what he may do for he be the cunningest knave in all the world -- this same robin hood belike i have better not wait until tomorrow to hang the fellow so say he push he chair back hastily and go forth from the inn call he man together quoth he i will wait no longer for the hanging of this rogue but it shall be do forthwith and that from the very tree whence he save

sit and the other ride around he they go forward to that tree from the branch of which they have think to hang the poacher on they go rattle and jingle along the road till they come to the tree here one of the man speak to the sheriff of a sudden you worship cry he be not yon fellow come along toward we that same guy of gisbourne whom thou didst send into the forest to seek robin hood at these

purse with a hundred golden pound in it beneath he robe they all go forth and mount the mule that have be bring to the door for they then the king bid the sheriff be silent as to they doings and so they set forth upon they way onward they travel laugh and jest until they pass through the open country between bare harvest field whence the harvest have be gather home through scatter glade that begin to thicken as they go farther along till they come within the heavy shade of the forest itself they travel in the forest for several mile without meeting anyone such as they seek until they have come to that part of the road that lay nearest to newstead abbey by the holy saint martin quoth the king i would that i have a better head for remember thing of great need here have we come away and bring never so much as a drop of anything to drink with we now i would give half a hundred pound for somewhat to quench my thirst withal no sooner have the king so speak than out from the covert at the roadside step a tall fellow with yellow beard and hair and a pair of merry blue eye truly holy brother say he lay he hand upon the king 's bridle rein it be a unchristian thing to not give fitting answer to so fair a bargain we keep a inn hereabouts and for fifty pound we will not only give thee a good draught of wine but will give thee as noble a feast as ever thou didst tickle thy gullet withal so say he put he finger to he lip and blow a shrill whistle then straightway the bush and branch on either side of the road sway and crackle and threescore broad-shouldered yeoman in lincoln green burst out of the covert how now fellow quoth the king who art thou thou naughty rogue hast thou no regard for such holy man as we be not a whit quoth merry robin hood for the fellow be he for in sooth all the holiness belong to rich friar such as ye be one could drop into a thimble and the goodwife would never feel it with the tip of she finger as for my name it be robin hood and thou mayst have hear it before now out upon thee quoth king richard thou art a bold and naughty fellow and a lawless one withal as i have often hear tell now prythee let I and these brethren of mine travel forward in peace and quietness it may not be say robin for it would look but ill of we to let such holy man travel onward with empty stomach but i doubt not that thou hast a fat purse to pay thy score at we inn since thou offerest freely so much for a poor draught of wine show I thy purse reverend brother or i may perchance have to strip thy robe from thee to search for it myself nay use no force say the king sternly here be my purse but lay not thy lawless hand upon we person hut tut quoth merry robin what proud word be these art thou the king of england to talk so to I here will take this purse and see what there be within will scarlet take the purse and count out the money then robin bid he keep fifty pound for themselves and put fifty back into the purse this he hand to the king here brother quoth he take this half of thy money and thank saint martin on whom thou didst call before that thou hast fall into the hand of such gentle rogue that they will not strip thee bare as they might do but wilt thou not put back thy cowl for i would fain see thy face nay say the king draw back i may not put back my cowl for we seven have vow that we will not show we face for four and twenty hour then keep they cover in peace say robin and far be it from I to make you break you vow so he call seven of he yeoman and bid they each one take a mule by the bridle then turn they face toward the depths of the woodland they journey onward until they come to the open glade and the greenwood tree little john with threescore yeoman at he heel have also go forth that morning to wait along the road and bring a rich guest to sherwood glade if such might be he luck for many with fat purse must travel the road at this time when such great doings be go on in nottinghamshire but though little john and so many other be go friar tuck and twoscore or more stout yeoman be seat or lie around beneath the great tree and when robin and the other come they leap to they foot to meet he by my soul quoth merry king richard when he have get down from he mule and stand look about he thou hast in very truth a fine lot of young man about thee robin methink king richard himself would be glad of such a bodyguard these be not all of my fellow say robin proudly for threescore more of they be away on business with my good right-hand man little john but as for king richard i tell thee brother there be not a man of we all but would pour out we blood like water for he ye churchman can not rightly understand we king but we yeomen love he right loyally for the sake of he brave doings which be so like we own but now friar tuck come bustling up gi ' ye good den brother say he i be right glad to welcome some of my cloth in this naughty place truly methink these rogue of outlaw would stand but a ill chance be it not for the prayer of holy tuck who laboreth so hard for they well-being here he wink one eye slyly and stick he tongue into he cheek who art thou mad priest say the king in a serious voice albeit he smile beneath he cowl at this friar tuck look all around with a slow gaze look you now quoth he never let I hear you say again that i be no patient man here be a knave of a friar calleth I a mad priest and yet i smite he not my name be friar tuck fellow -- the holy friar tuck there tuck say robin thou hast say enow prythee cease thy talk and bring some wine these reverend man be athirst and sin ' they have pay so richly for they score they must e ` en have the best friar tuck bridle at be so check in he speech nevertheless he go straightway to do robin 's bidding so presently a great crock be bring and wine be pour out for all the guest and for robin hood then robin hold he cup aloft stay cry he tarry in you drinking till i give you a pledge here be to good king richard of great renown and may all enemy to he be confound then all drink the king 's health even the king himself methink good fellow say he thou hast drunk to thine own confusion never a whit quoth merry robin for i tell thee that we of sherwood be more loyal to we lord the king than those of thine order we would give up we life for he benefit while ye be content to lie snug in you abbey and priory let reign who will at this the king laugh quoth he perhaps king richard 's welfare be more to I than thou wottest of fellow but enough of that matter we have pay well for we fare so canst thou not show we some merry entertainment i have oft hear that ye be wondrous archer wilt thou not show we somewhat of you skill with all my heart say robin we be always please to show we guest all the sport that be to be see as gaffer swanthold sayeth ` tis a hard heart that will not give a caged starling of the best ' and caged starling ye be with we ho lad set up a garland at the end of the glade then as the yeoman run to do they master 's bidding tuck turn to one of the mock friar hearest thou we master quoth he with a sly wink whenever he cometh across some poor piece of wit he straightway layeth it on the shoulder of this gaffer swanthold -- whoever he may be -- so that the poor goodman goeth travel about with all the odds and end and tag and rag of we master 's brain pack on he back thus speak friar tuck but in a low voice so that robin could not hear he for he feel somewhat nettled at robin 's cut he talk so short in the meantime the mark at which they be to shoot be set up at sixscore pace distance it be a garland of leaf and flower two span in width which same be hang upon a stake in front of a broad tree trunk there quoth robin yon be a fair mark lad each of you shoot three arrow thereat and if any fellow misseth by so much as one arrow he shall have a buffet of will scarlet 's fist hearken to he quoth friar tuck why master thou dost bestow buffet from thy strapping nephew as though they be love tap from some bounce lass i warrant thou art safe to hit the garland thyself or thou wouldst not be so free of he cuff first david of doncaster shot and lodge all three of he arrow within the garland well do david cry robin thou hast save thine ear from a warm this day next midge the miller shot and he also lodge he arrow in the garland then follow wat the tinker but alas for he for one of he shaft miss the mark by the breadth of two finger come hither fellow say will scarlet in he soft gentle voice i owe thee somewhat that i would pay forthwith then

standing on tiptoe to give the greater swing to he arm he strike with might and main whoof come he palm against the tinker 's head and down go stout wat to the grass heel over head as the wooden image at the fair go down when the skillful player throw a cudgel at it then as the tinker sit up upon the grass rub he ear and wink and blinking at the bright star that dance before he eye the yeomen roar with mirth till the forest ring as for king richard he laugh till the tear run down he cheek thus the band shot each in turn some get off scot free and some win a buffet that always send they to the grass and now last of all robin take he place and all be hush as he shoot the first shaft he shoot split a piece from the stake on which the garland be hang the second lodge within a inch of the other

waver to one side it smite a inch outside the garland at this a great roar go up those of the yeoman who sit upon the grass rolling over and over and shout with laughter for never before have they see they master so miss he mark but robin fling he bow upon the ground with vexation now out upon it cry he that shaft have a ill feather to it for i feel it as it leave my finger give I a clean arrow and i will engage to split the wand with it at these word the yeomen laugh louder than ever nay good uncle say will scarlet in he soft sweet voice thou hast have thy fair chance and hast miss thine aim

king but even we great king richard may yield to the holy pope without shame and even take a tap from he by way of penance therefore i will yield myself to this holy friar who seemeth to be one in authority and will take my punishment from he thus say he turn to the king i prythee brother wilt thou take my punish into thy holy hand with all my heart quoth merry king richard rise from where he be sit i owe thee somewhat for have lift a heavy weight of fifty pound from my purse so make room for he on the green lad a thou makest I tumble quoth robin i will freely give thee back thy fifty pound but i tell thee brother if thou makest I not feel grass all along my back i will take every farthing thou hast for thy boastful speech so be it say the king i be willing to venture it thereupon he roll up he sleeve and show a arm that make the yeomen stare but robin with he foot wide apart stand firmly plant wait the other smile then the king swing back he arm and balance himself a moment he deliver a buffet at robin that fall like a thunderbolt down go robin headlong upon the grass for the stroke would have fell a stone wall then how the yeomen shout with laughter till they side ache for never have they see such a buffet give in all they life as for robin he presently sit up and look all around he as though he have drop from a cloud and have light in a place he have never see before after a while still gaze about he at he laugh yeoman he put he fingertip softly to he ear and feel all around it tenderly will scarlet say he count this fellow out he fifty pound i want nothing more either of he money or of he a murrain seize he and he buffeting i would that i have take my due from thee for i verily believe he have deafen mine ear from ever hear again then while gust of laughter

ear to match the one thou hast come to I and i will fit thee with it for nought so speak the merry king but even as he end there come suddenly the sound of many voice and out from the covert burst little john and threescore man with sir richard of the lea in the midst across the glade they come run and as they come sir richard shout to robin : make haste dear friend gather thy band together and come with I king richard leave nottingham town this very morning and cometh to seek thee in the woodland i know not how he cometh for it be but a rumor of this that reach I nevertheless i know that it be the truth therefore hasten with all thy man and come to castle lea for there thou mayst lie hidden till thy present danger passeth who be these stranger that thou hast with thee why quoth merry robin rise from the grass these be certain gentle guest that come with we from the highroad over by newstead abbey i know not they name but i have become right well acquaint with this lusty rogue 's palm this morning marry the pleasure of this acquaintance have dost I a deaf ear and fifty pound to boot sir richard look keenly at the tall friar who draw himself up to he full height look fixedly back at the knight then of a sudden sir richard 's cheek grow pale for he know who it be that he look upon quickly he leap from off he horse 's back and fling himself upon he knee before the other at this the king see that sir richard know he throw back he cowl and all the yeoman see he face and know he also for there be not one of they but have be in the crowd in the good town of nottingham and have see he ride side by side with the sheriff down they fall upon they knee nor could they say a word then the king look all around right grimly and last of all he glance come back and rest again upon sir richard of the lea how be this sir richard say he sternly how darest thou step between I and these fellow and how darest thou offer thy knightly castle of the lea for a refuge to they wilt thou make it a hide place for the most renowned outlaw in england then sir richard of the lea raise he eye to the king 's face far be it from I say he to do aught that could bring you majesty 's anger upon I yet sooner would i face you majesty 's wrath than suffer aught of harm that i could stay to fall upon robin hood and he band for to they i owe life honor everything should i then desert he in he hour of need ere the knight have do speak one of the mock friar that stand near the king come forward and kneel beside sir richard and throw back he cowl show the face of young sir henry of the lea then sir henry grasp he father 's hand and say here kneel one who have serve thee well king richard and as thou knowest have step between thee and death in palestine yet do i abide by my dear father and here i say also that i would freely give shelter to this noble outlaw robin hood even though it bring thy wrath upon I for my father 's honor and my father 's welfare be as dear to I as mine own king richard look from one to the other of the kneel knight and at last the frown fade from he brow and a smile twitch at the corner of he lip marry sir richard quoth the king thou art a bold-spoken knight and thy freedom of speech weigheth not heavily against thee with I this young son of thine taketh after he sire both in boldness of speech and of deed for as he sayeth he step one time betwixt I and death wherefore i would pardon thee for he sake even if thou hadst do more than thou hast rise all of you for ye shall suffer no harm through I this day for it be pity that a merry time should end in a manner as to mar its joyousness then all arise and the king beckon robin hood to come to he how now quoth he be thine ear still too deaf to hear I speak mine ear would be deafen in death ere they would cease to hear you majesty 's voice say robin as for the blow that you majesty strike I i would say that though my sin be haply many methink they have be pay up in full thereby thinkest thou so say the king with somewhat of sternness in he voice now i tell thee that but for three thing to wit my mercifulness my love for a stout woodsman and the loyalty thou hast avow for I thine ear mayhap might have be more tightly close than ever a buffet from I could have shut they talk not lightly of thy sin good robin but come look up thy danger be past for hereby i give thee and all thy band free pardon but in sooth i can not let you roam the forest as ye have do in the past therefore i will take thee at thy word when thou didst say thou wouldst give thy service to I and thou shalt go back to london with I we will take that bold knave little john also and likewise thy cousin will scarlet and thy minstrel allan a dale as for the rest of thy band we will take they name and have they duly record as royal ranger for methink it be wiser to have they change to law-abiding caretaker of we deer in sherwood than to leave they to run at large as outlawed slayer thereof but now get a feast ready i would see how ye live in the woodland so robin bid he man make ready a grand feast straightway great fire be kindle and burn brightly at which savory thing roasted sweetly while this be go forward the king bid robin call allan a dale for he would hear he sing so word be pass for allan and presently he come bring he harp marry say king richard if thy singing match thy look it be fair enough prythee strike up a ditty and let we have a taste of thy skill then allan touch he harp lightly and all word be hush while he sing thus : ' _ oh where have thou be my daughter oh where hast thou be this day daughter my daughter ' ` oh i have be to the river 's side where the water lie all gray and wide and the gray sky brood o'er the leaden tide and the shrill wind sigh a strain ' ` what sawest thou there my daughter what sawest thou there this day daughter my daughter ' ` oh i see a boat come drift nigh where the quiver rush hiss and sigh and the water sough as it gurgle by and the shrill wind sigh a strain ' ` what sail in the boat my daughter what sail in the boat this day daughter my daughter ' ` oh there be one all clothe in white and about he face hang a pallid light and he eye gleam sharp like the star at night and the shrill wind sigh a strain ' ` and what say he my daughter what say he to thee this day daughter my daughter ' ` oh say he nought but do he this : thrice on my lip do he press a kiss and my heartstrings shrink with a awful bliss and the shrill wind sigh a strain ' ` why growest thou so cold my daughter why growest thou so cold and white daughter my daughter ' oh never a word the daughter say but she sit all straight with a drooping head for she heart be still and she face be dead : and the shrill wind sigh a strain _ all listen in silence and when allan a dale have do king richard heave a sigh by the breath of my body allan quoth he thou hast such a wondrous sweet voice that it strangely move my heart but what doleful ditty be this for the lip of a stout yeoman i would rather hear thee sing a song of love and battle than a sad thing like that moreover i understand it not what meanest thou by the word i know not you majesty say allan shake he head for ofttime i sing that which i do not clearly understand mine own self well well quoth the king let it pass only i tell thee this allan thou shouldst turn thy song to such matter as i speak of to wit love or war for in sooth thou hast a sweeter voice than blondell and methought he be the best minstrel that ever i hear but now one come forward and say that the feast be ready so robin hood bring king richard and those with he to where it lay all spread out on fair white linen cloth which lay upon the soft green grass then king richard sit he down and feast and drink and when he be do he swear roundly that he have never sit at such a lusty repast in all he life before that night he lay in sherwood forest upon a bed of sweet green leaf and early the next morning he set forth from the woodland for nottingham town robin hood and all of he band go with he you may guess what a stir there be in the good town when all these famous outlaw come march into the street as for the sheriff he know not what to say nor where to look when he see robin hood in such high favor with the king while all he heart be fill with gall because of the vexation that lay upon he the next day the king take leave of nottingham town so robin hood and little john and will scarlet and allan a dale shake hand with all the rest of the band kiss the cheek of each man and swearing that they would often come to sherwood and see they then each mount he horse and ride away in the train of the king epilogue thus end the merry adventure of robin hood for in spite of he promise it be many a year ere he see sherwood again after a year or two at court little john come back to nottinghamshire where he live in a orderly way though within sight of sherwood and where he achieve great fame as the champion of all england with the quarterstaff will scarlet after a time come back to he own home whence he have be drive by he unlucky killing of he father 's steward the rest of the band do they duty as royal ranger right well but robin hood and allan a dale do not come again to sherwood so quickly for thus it be : robin through he great fame as a archer become a favorite with the king so that he speedily rise in rank to be the chief of all the yeoman at last the king see how faithful and how loyal he be create he earl of huntingdon so robin follow the king to the war and find he time so full that he have no chance to come back to sherwood for even so much as a day as for allan a dale and he wife the fair ellen they follow robin hood and share in all he up and downs of life and now dear friend you who have journey with I in all these merry doings i will not bid you follow I further but will drop you hand here with a good den if you wish it for that which cometh hereafter speak of the break up of thing and show how joy and pleasure that be dead and go can never be set upon they foot to walk again i will not dwell upon the matter overlong but will tell as speedily as may be of how that stout fellow robin hood die as he have live not at court as earl of huntingdon but with bow in hand he heart in the greenwood and he himself a right yeoman king richard die upon the battlefield in such a way as properly become a lion-hearted king as you yourself no doubt know so after a time the earl of huntingdon -- or robin hood as we still call he as of old -- find nothing for he do abroad come back to merry england again with he come allan a dale and he wife the fair ellen for these two have be chief of robin 's household ever since he have leave sherwood forest it be in the springtime when they land once more on the shore of england the leaf be green and the small bird sing blithely just as they use to do in fair sherwood when robin hood roam the woodland shades with a free heart and a light heel all the sweetness of the time and the joyousness of everything bring back to robin 's mind he forest life so that a great longing come upon he to behold the woodland once more so he go straightway to king john and besought leave of he to visit nottingham for a short season the king give he leave to come and to go but bid he not stay longer than three day at sherwood so robin hood and allan a dale set forth without delay to nottinghamshire and sherwood forest the first night they take up they inn at nottingham town yet they do not go to pay they duty to the sheriff for he worship bear many a bitter grudge against robin hood which grudge have not be lessen by robin 's rise in the world the next day at a early hour they mount they horse and set forth for the woodland as they pass along the road it seem to robin that he know every stick and stone that he eye look upon yonder be a path that he have ofttime tread of a mellow evening with little john beside he here be one now nigh choke with bramble along which he and a little band have walk when they go forth to seek a certain curtal friar thus they ride slowly onward talk about these old familiar thing old and yet new for they find more in they than they have ever think of before thus at last they come to the open glade and the broad wide-spreading greenwood tree which be they home for so many year neither of the two speak when they stand beneath that tree robin look all about he at the well-known thing so like what they use to be and yet so different for where once be the bustle of many busy fellow be now the quietness of solitude and as he look the woodland the greensward and the sky all blur together in he sight through salt tear for such a great yearning come upon he as he look on these thing -lrb- as well know to he as the finger of he right hand -rrb- that he could not keep back the water from he eye that morning he have sling he good old bugle horn over he shoulder and now with the yearning come a great longing to sound he bugle once more he raise it to he lip he blow a blast tirilum lirilum the sweet clear note go wind down the forest path come back again from the more distant bosky shades in faint echo of sound tirilum lirilum tirilum lirilum until it fade away and be lose now it chance that on that very morn little john be walk through a spur of the forest upon certain matter of business and as he pace along sink in meditation the faint clear note of a distant bugle horn come to he ear as leap the stag when it feel the arrow at its heart so leap little john when that distant sound meet he ear all the blood in he body seem to rush like a flame into he cheek as he bent he head and listen again come the bugle note thin and clear and yet again it sound then little john give a great wild cry of yearning of joy and yet of grief and put down he head he dash into the thicket onward he plunge crackle and rend as the wild boar rush through the underbrush little recked he of thorn and brier that scratch he flesh and tear he clothing for all he think of be to get by the shortest way to the greenwood glade whence he know the sound of the bugle horn come out he burst from the covert at last a shower of little broken twig fall about he and without pause a moment rush forward and fling himself at robin 's foot then he clasp he arm around the master 's knee and all he body be shake with great sob neither could robin nor allan a dale speak but stand look down at little john the tear roll down they cheek while they thus stand seven royal ranger rush into the open glade and raise a great shout of joy at the sight of robin and at they head be will stutely then after a while come four more pant with they running and two of these four be will scathelock and midge the miller for all of these have hear the sound of robin hood 's horn all these run to robin and kiss he hand and he clothing with great sound of weep after a while robin look around he with tear-dimmed eye and say in a husky voice now i swear that never again will i leave these dear woodland i have be away from they and from you too long now do i lay by the name of robert earl of huntingdon and take upon I once again that nobler title robin hood the yeoman at this a great shout go up and all the yeomen shake one another 's hand for joy the news that robin hood have come back again to dwell in sherwood as of old spread like wildfire all over the countryside so that ere a se'ennight have pass nearly all of he old yeoman have gather about he again but when the news of all this reach the ear of king john he swear both loud and deep and take a solemn vow that he would not rest until he have robin hood in he power dead or alive now there be present at court a certain knight sir william dale as gallant a soldier as ever don harness sir william dale be well acquaint with sherwood forest for he be head keeper over that part of it that lay nigh to good mansfield town so to he the king turn and bid he take a army of man and go straightway to seek robin hood likewise the king give sir william he signet ring to show to the sheriff that he might raise all he armed man to aid the other in they chase of robin so sir william and the sheriff set forth to do the king 's bidding and to search for robin hood and for seven day they hunt up and down yet find he not now have robin hood be as peaceful as of old everything might have end in smoke as other such venture have always do before but he have fight for year under king richard and be change from what he use to be it gall he pride to thus flee away before those send against he as a chase fox flee from the hound so thus it come about at last that robin hood and he yeoman meet sir william and the sheriff and they man in the forest and a bloody fight follow the first man slay in that fight be the sheriff of nottingham for he fall from he horse with a arrow in he brain ere half a score of shaft have be speed many a better man than the sheriff kiss the sod that day but at last sir william dale be wound and most of he man slay he withdraw beaten and leave the forest but score of good fellow be leave behind he stretch out all stiff beneath the sweet green bough but though robin hood have beat off he enemy in fair fight all this lay heavily upon he mind so that he brood over it until a fever seize upon he for three day it hold he and though he strive to fight it off he be force to yield at last thus it come that on the morning of the fourth day he call little john to he and tell he that he could not shake the fever from he and that he would go to he cousin the prioress of the nunnery near kirklee in yorkshire who be a skillful leech and he would have she open a vein in he arm and take a little blood from he for the bettering of he health then he bid little john make ready to go also for he might perchance need aid in he journey so little john and he take they leave of the other and robin hood bade will stutely be the captain of the band until they should come back thus they come by easy stage and slow journey until they reach the nunnery of kirklee now robin have do much to aid this cousin of he for it be through king richard 's love of he that she have be make prioress of the place but there be nought in the world so easily forget as gratitude so when the prioress of kirklee have hear how she cousin the earl of huntingdon have throw away he earldom and go back again to sherwood she be vex to the soul and fear lest she cousinship with he should bring the king 's wrath upon she also thus it happen that when robin come to she and tell she how he wish she service as leech she begin plot ill against he in she mind think that by do evil to he she might find favor with he enemy nevertheless she keep this well to herself and receive robin with seeming kindness she lead he up the wind stone stair to a room which be just beneath the eaves of a high round tower but she would not let little john come with he so the poor yeoman turn he foot away from the door of the nunnery and leave he master in the hand of the woman but though he do not come in neither do he go far away for he lay he down in a little glade near by where he could watch the place that robin abide like some great faithful dog turn away from the door where he master have enter after the woman have get robin hood to the room beneath the eave the prioress send all of the other away then take a little cord she tie it tightly about robin 's arm as though she be about to bleed he and so she do bleed he but the vein she open be not one of those that lie close and blue beneath the skin deeper she cut than that for she open one of those vein through which the bright red blood run leap from the heart of this robin know not for though he see the blood flow it do not come fast enough to make he think that there be anything ill in it have do this vile deed the prioress turn and leave she cousin lock the door behind she all that livelong day the blood run from robin hood 's arm nor could he check it though he strive in every way to do so again and again he call for help but no help come for he cousin have betray he and little john be too far away to hear he voice so he bleed and bleed until he feel he strength slip away from he then he arise totter and bear himself up by the palm of he hand against the wall he reach he bugle horn at last thrice he sound it but weakly and faintly for he breath be flutter through sickness and loss of strength nevertheless little john hear it where he lay in the glade and with a heart all sick with dread he come run and leap toward the nunnery loudly he knock at the door and in a loud voice shout for they to let he in but the door be of massive oak strongly bar and stud with spike so they feel safe and bid little john begone then little john 's heart be mad with grief and fear for he master 's life wildly he look about he and he sight fall upon a heavy stone mortar such as three man could not lift nowadays little john take three step forward and bend he back heave the stone mortar up from where it stand deeply rooted stagger under its weight he come forward and hurl it crash against the door in burst the door and away flee the frightened nun shriek at he come then little john stride in and never a word say he but up the wind stone step he run till he reach the room wherein he master be here he find the door lock also but put he shoulder against it he burst the lock as though they be make of brittle ice there he see he own dear master lean against the gray stone wall he face all white and draw and he head sway to and fro with weakness then with a great wild cry of love and grief and pity little john leap forward and catch robin hood in he arm up he lift he as a mother lift she child and carry he to the bed lay he tenderly thereon and now the prioress come in hastily for she be frighten at what she have do and dread the vengeance of little john and the other of the band then she stanch the blood by cunning bandage so that it flow no more all the while little john stand grimly by and after she have do he sternly bid she to begone and she obey pale and tremble then after she have depart little john spake cheer word laugh loudly and say that all this be a child 's fright and that no stout yeoman would die at the loss of a few drop of blood why quoth he give thee a se'ennight and thou wilt be roam the woodland as boldly as ever but robin shake he head and smile faintly where he lay mine own dear little john whisper he heaven bless thy kind rough heart but dear friend we will never roam the woodland together again ay but we will quoth little john loudly i say again ay -- out upon it -- who dare say that any more harm shall come upon thee be i not by let I see who dare touch -- here he stop of a sudden for he word choke he at last he say in a deep husky voice now if aught of harm befall thee because of this day 's doings i swear by saint george that the red cock shall crow over the rooftree of this house for the hot flame shall lick every crack and cranny thereof as for these woman -- here he grind he tooth -- it will be a ill day for they but robin hood take little john 's rough brown fist in he white hand and chide he softly in he low weak voice ask he since what time little john have think of do harm to woman even in vengeance thus he talk till at last the other promise in a choke voice that no ill should fall upon the place no matter what happen then a silence fall and little john sit with robin hood 's hand in he gaze out of the open window ever and anon swallow a great lump that come in he throat meantime the sun drop slowly to the west till all the sky be ablaze with a red glory then robin hood in a weak falter voice bid little john raise he that he might look out once more upon the woodland so the yeoman lift he in he arm as he bid and robin hood 's head lay on he friend 's shoulder long he gaze with a wide linger look while the other sit with bow head the hot tear roll one after another from he eye and drip upon he bosom for he feel that the time of parting be near at hand then presently robin hood bid he string he stout bow for he and choose a smooth fair arrow from he quiver this little john do though without disturb he master or rise from where he sit robin hood 's finger wrap lovingly around he good bow and he smile faintly when he feel it in he grasp then he nock the arrow on that part of the string that the tip of he finger know so well little john say he little john mine own dear friend and he i love better than all other in the world mark i prythee where this arrow lodge and there let my grave be dig lay I with my face toward the east little john and see that my rest place be keep green and that my weary bone be not disturb as he finish speak he raise himself of a sudden and sit upright he old strength seem to come back to he and draw the bowstr to he ear he speed the arrow out of the open casement as the shaft fly he hand sink slowly with the bow till it lay across he knee and he body likewise sink back again into little john 's loving arm but something have speed from that body even as the winged arrow speed from the bow for some minute little john sit motionless but presently he lay that which he hold gently down then folding the hand upon the breast and cover up the face he turn upon he heel and leave the room without a word or a sound upon the steep stairway he meet the prioress and some of the chief among the sister to they he speak in a deep quiver voice and say he a ye go within a score of foot of yonder room i will tear down you rookery over you head so that not one stone shall be leave upon another bear my word well in mind for i mean they so say he turn and leave they and they presently see he run rapidly across the open through the fall of the dusk until he be swallow up by the forest the early gray of the come morn be just begin to lighten the black sky toward the eastward when little john and six more of the band come rapidly across the open toward the nunnery they see no one for the sister be all hide away from sight have be frighten by little john 's word up the stone stair they run and a great sound of weep be presently hear after a while this cease and then come the scuffling and shuffling of man 's foot as they carry a heavy weight down the steep and wind stair so they go forth from the nunnery and as they pass through the door thereof a great loud sound of wail arise from the glade that lay all dark in the dawn as though many man hide in the shadow have lift up they voice in sorrow thus die robin hood at kirklee nunnery in fair yorkshire with mercy in he heart toward those that have be he undoing for thus he show mercy for the err and pity for the weak through all the time of he live he yeoman be scatter henceforth but no great ill befall they thereafter for a more merciful sheriff and one who know they not so well succeed the one that have go and they be separate here and there throughout the countryside they abide in peace and quietness
