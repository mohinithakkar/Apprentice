produce by jonathan ingram l barber and pg distribute proofreader crescent and iron cross by ef benson _ crescent and iron cross preface _ in compile the follow page i have have access to certain source of official information the nature of which i be not at liberty to specify further i have use these freely in such chapter of this book as deal with recent and contemporary event in turkey or in germany in connection with turkey : the chapter for instance entitle ` deutschland über allah ' be base very largely on such document i have try to be discriminate in they use and have not as far as i be aware state anything derive from they as a fact for which i have not find corroborative evidence with regard to the armenian massacre i have draw largely on the testimony collect by lord bryce on that bring forward by mr arnold j toynbee in he pamphlet _ the murder of a nation _ and _ the murderous tyranny of the turk _ and on the pamphlet by dr martin niepage call _ the horror of aleppo _ in the first chapter i have base the short historical survey on the contribution of mr dg hogarth to _ the balkan _ -lrb- clarendon press 1915 -rrb- the chapter call ` thy kingdom be divide ' be in no respect at all a official utterance and merely represent the individual opinion and surmise of the author it have however the official basis that the ally have pledge themselves to remove the power of the turk from constantinople and to remove out of the power of the turk the alien people who have too long already be subject to he murderous rule i have in fact but attempt to conjecture in what kind of manner that promise will be fulfil fresh item of news respect internal condition in turkey be continually come in and if one wait for they all one would have to wait to the end of the war before begin to write at all on this subject but since such usefulness as this book may possibly have be involve with the necessity of its appearance before the end of the war i set a term to the gathering of material and with the exception of two or three note insert later cease to collect it after June 1917 but up to then anything that should have be insert in survey and argument and be not constitute a culpable omission on my part ef benson _ crescent and iron cross contents _ chapter i the theory of the old turk chapter ii the theory of the new turk chapter iii the end of the armenian question chapter iv the question of syrium and palestine chapter v deutschland über allah chapter vi ` thy kingdom be divide ' chapter vii the grip of the octopus _ crescent and iron cross chapter i _ the theory of the old turk the maker of phrase ply a dangerous trade very often he phrase be applicable for the moment and for the situation in view of which he coin it but he coin have only a temporary validity : it be good for a month or for a year or for whatever period during which the crisis last and after that it lapse again into a mere token a thing without value and without mean but the phrase can not as in the case of a monetary coinage at once be recall for it have go broadcast over the land or at any rate it be not recall and it go on be pass from hand to hand its image and superscription deface by wear long after it have cease to represent anything in itself it be obsolete but people still trade with it and think it represent what it represent when it come hot from the mint and unfortunately it sometimes happen that it be worse than valueless it become a forgery -lrb- which it may not have be when it come into circulation -rrb- and deceive those who traffic with it flattering they with a unfounded possession such a phrase which still hold currency be once coin by lord aberdeen in the period of the crimean war ` turkey be a sick man ' he say and add something which give great offence then about the advisability of put turkey out of he misery i do not pretend to quote correctly but that be the gist of it nor do i challenge the truth of lord aberdeen 's phrase at the period when he make it it possibly contain a temporary truth a valid point of view which if it have be act on might have save a great deal of trouble afterwards but it miss then and more than miss now the essential and salient truth about turkey the phrase unfortunately still continue to obtain credit and nowadays it be a forgery it ring false for at whatever period we regard turkey and try to define that monstrous phenomenon we can make a far truer phrase than lord aberdeen 's for turkey be not a sick man : turkey be a sickness he be not sick nor ever have be for he be the cancer itself the devour tumor that for century have feed on live tissue absorb it and kill it it have never have life in itself except in so far that the power of prey on and destroy life constitute life and such a power after all we be accustom to call not life but death turkey like death continue to exist and to dominate through its function of kill life can not kill it be disease and death that kill and from the moment that turkey pass from be a nomadic tribe move westwards from the confines of persium it have exist only and thrive on a process of absorption and of murder when first the turk come out of they eastern fastness they absorb when they grow more or less settle and by degree the power of mere absorption as by some failure of digestion leave they they kill they become a huge tumor that nourish itself by kill the living tissue that come in contact with it now by the amazing irony of fate who weave stranger drama than could ever be set on censor stage for they both take hundred of year to unravel themselves and be of the most unedifying character turkey the rodent cancer have be infect by another with greater organization for devour the disease of ottomanism be threaten by a more deadly hungerer and prussianism have insert its crab-pincers into the cancer that come out of asia those claw be already deeply set and the problem for civilised nation be first to disentangle the nipper that be cancer in a cancer and next to deprive of all power over alien people the domination that have already be allow to exist too long the object of this book be the statement of the case on which all defender of liberty base they prosecution against turkey itself and against the power that to-day have turkey in its grip historical survey be apt to be tedious but in order to understand at all adequately the case against turkey as a ruler and controller of subject people it be necessary to go though briefly into she blood-stained genealogy there be no need to enter into ethnological discussion as to earlier history or define the difference between the osmanli turk and those who be spread over asia minor before the advent of the osmanli from the east but it be the osmanli who be the cancerous and devour nation and it be they who to-day rule over a vast territory -lrb- subject to germany -rrb- of people alien to they by religion and blood and all the instinct common to civilised folk until germany ` deep patient germany ' suddenly hoist she color as a champion of murder and rapine and barbarism she the mother of art and literature and science there be nothing in europe that could compare with the anachronism of turkey be there at all then in August 1914 there be hoist the german flag superimpose with skull and cross-bone and all the insignia of piracy and highway robbery on land and on sea and germany show herself a anachronism worthy to impale she arm on the shield of the most execrable domination that have ever oppress the world since the time when the hun under attilum rage like a forest fire across the cultivate field of european civilisation to-day in the name of kultur a similar invasion have break on shore that seem secure and it be no wonder that it have find its most valuable victim and ally in the power that adopt the same method of absorption and extermination century before the hohenzollern ever start on they career of highway robbery but like seek like and perhaps it be not wholly the fault of we astonishing diplomacy in constantinople that turkey woo like some desirable maiden cast in she lot with the power that by instinct and tradition most resemble she spiritual blood no less than physical blood be thicker than water and gott and allah hand-in-hand pledge each other in the cup they have fill with the blood that pour from the wine-press of belgium and of armenia for century before the osmanli turk make they appearance in asia minor there have come from out of the misty east numerous body of turk push westward and spread over the euphrate valley and over persium in nomadic or military colonisation and it be not until the thirteenth century that we find the osmanli turk who give they name to that congregation of race know as the ottoman empire establish in the north-west corner of asia minor like all previous turkish immigration they come not in any overwhelming horde with sword in one hand and koran in the other but as a small compact body with a genius for military organization and the gift which they retain to this day of stalwart fight the policy to which they owe they growth be absorption and the people whom they first begin to absorb be greek and other christian and it be to a christian girl nilufer that osman marry he son orkhan they take christian youth from the family of greek dweller force they to apostatise give they military training and marry they to turkish girl it be out of this blend of greek and turkish blood as mr dg hogarth point out that they derive they national being and they national strength this system of recruit they steadily pursue not only among the christian people with whom they come in contact but among the settlement of turk who have precede they in this process of push westward and form out of they the professional soldiery know as janissary they do not fight for themselves alone but as mercenary lend they arm to other people moslem and christian alike who would hire they service this be a policy that pay well for after have deliver some settlement from the depredation of a inconvenient neighbor and with they pay in they pocket they sometimes turn on those who have hire they arm take they toll of youth and finally incorporate they in they grow empire like a insatiable sponge they mop up the sprinkling of disconnect people over the fruitful floor of asia minor and swell and prosper but as yet the extermination of these be not part of they program : they absorb the strength and manhood of they annexation into they own soldiery and come back for more they do not levy those tax pay in the person of soldier for they army from they co-religionist since islam may not fight against islam but by means of peaceful penetration -lrb- a policy long since abandon -rrb- they unite scatter settlement of turk to themselves by marriage and the bond of a common tongue and religion they expansion into europe begin in the middle of the fourteenth century when as mercenary they fight against the serb and fifty year later they have a firm hold over bulgarium as well greece be they next prey they penetrate bosnium and macedonium and in 1453 attack and take constantinople under mohamm the conqueror still true to the policy of incorporation they continue to mop up the remainder of the balkan peninsula and at the same time consolidated themselves further in asia minor by the beginning of the seventeenth century they expansion reach its utmost geographical limit but already the empire hold within it the seed of its own decay and by a curious irony the force that should still keep it together be derive not from its own strength but from the jealousy of the european power among themselves who would willingly have dismember it but fear the quarrel that would surely result from the apportionment of its territory the ottoman empire from then onward have owe its existence to its enemy its weakness lay in itself for it be very loosely knit together and no bond whether of blood or religion or tongue bind to it the assembly of christian and jewish and non-moslem race of which it be so largely compose the empire never grow -lrb- as for instance the british empire grow -rrb- by the emigration and settlement of the osmanli stock in the territory it absorb : it never give it only take from the beginning right up to the last quarter of the nineteenth century it have be a military despotism impose itself on unwilling and alien tribe whom it drain of they blood and then leave in neglect until some further levy be need none of its conquer people be ever give a share in the government they be leave unorganised and so to speak undigested element under the power which have force they into subjection and one by one the whole of the european people include in that uncemented tyranny have pass from under turkish control turkey in europe have dwindle to a strip along the bosporus to the sea of marmora and the dardanelle egypt have be lose tripolus also and the only force that for the last hundred year have keep alive in europe the existence of that monstrous anachronism have be the strange political phenomenon now happily extinct call the balance of power no one of the great power from fear of the complication that would ensue could risk the expulsion of the turkish government from constantinople and there all through the nineteenth century it have be maintain lest the key of the black sea which unlock the bolt that bar russium 's development into the mediterranean should lead to such a war as we be now pass through that policy for the present have utterly defeat its own end for the key be in the pocket of prussium but all through that century though the power maintain turkey there they help to liberate or see liberate themselves the various christian kingdom in europe over which at the beginning of the eighteenth century turkey exercise a military despotism they weaken she in so far as they could but they one and all refuse to let she die and above all refuse to give she that stab in the heart which would have be imply in she expulsion from constantinople for century from the first appearance of the osmanli in north-west asia minor down to the reign of abdul hamid the empire maintain itself with alternate bout of vigor and relapse on the general principle of draw its strength from its subject people internally from whatever standpoint we view it whether educational economic or industrial it have have the worst record of any domination know to history rich in mineral wealth possess of land that be once the granary of the world water by amazing river and with its strategic position on the mediterranean that hold the master-key of the black sea in its hand it have remain the most barbaric and least progressive of all state its road and means of communication remain up till the last quarter of the nineteenth century much as they have be in the day of osman except along a insignificant strip of sea-coast railway be non-existent it be bankrupt in finance and in moral and do not contain a single seed that might ripen into progress or civilisation mesopotamium be once the most fertile of all land capable of support not itself alone but half the civilised world : nowadays under the stewardship of the turk it have be suffer to become a desert for the greater part of the year and a impracticable swamp for the remainder where great city flourish where once be rear the pride of babylon and of nineveh there huddle the squalid hut of fever-stricken peasant scarce able to gain they half-starved living from the soil that once support in luxury and pomp the grandeur of metropolitan city the ancient barrage the canal the system of irrigation be all allow to silt up and become useless and at the end of the nineteenth century you would not find in all mesopotamia a agricultural implement that be in any way superior to the plough and the flail of more than two thousand year ago but so long as there be a palace-guard about the gate to secure the safety of the sultan and he corrupt military oligarchy so long as there be houri to divert they leisure tribute of youth to swell they army and tax wring from starve subject to maintain they pomp there be not one of those who hold the rein of government who care the flick of a eyelash for the need of the nation on whom the empire rest for the cultivation of its soil that would yield a hundredfold to the skilled husbandman or for the exploitation and development of its internal wealth while there be leave in the emaciated carcase of the turkish empire enough live tissue for the cancerous government to grow fat on it give not one think to the welfare of all those race on whom it have fasten itself province after province of its european dominion might be lose to it but the balance of power still keep the sultan on he throne and leave the people of asia minor and syrium at he mercy they be largely of alien religion and of alien tongue and they individual weakness be he strength neglect and the decay consequent on neglect be the lot of all who languish under that abominable despotism with the accession in 1876 of abdul hamid of cursed memory there dawn on the doomed subject people of the ottoman empire a day of bloodier import than any yet the year before and during that year have occur the bulgarian atrocity and massacre and the word ` massacre ' linger and make music in abdul hamid 's brain he say it over to himself and dwelt upon it and meditate on the nature and possibility of massacre the trouble which massacre have calm have arise before he accession out of the establishment of the bulgarian exarchate which correspond to the greek patriarchate and be give power over district and people whom the greek justly consider to belong to they by blood and religion greek armed band come into collision with bulgarian band and in order to calm these disturbance by thoroughly effectual means irregular turkish troops be send into bulgarium charge with the command to ` stop the row ' but with no other instruction indiscriminate kill with all the passion and horror that bloodsh evoke in the half-civilised follow and there be no more trouble just then in the disturbed district for there be none to make trouble in 1876 abdul aziz be depose by a group of king-maker under midhat pasha murad v reign shadow-like for three month and during the same year abdul hamid be finally select to fill the throne and stand forth as the shadow of god it be a disturbed and totter inheritance to which he succeed riddled with the dry-rot of corruption but the inheritor prove himself equal to the occasion for a little while he be all abroad and at the bidding of midhat who have place he on the throne he summon a kind of representative turkish parliament by way of imbue the great power with the idea that he be a enlighten shadow of god bent on reform this parody of a parliament last but a short time : it be no more than a faint dissolve magic-lantern picture in the spring of 1877 rumanium under russian encouragement break away from turkish rule turkey declare war on russium and in 1878 find herself utterly defeat at adrianople be draw up the treaty of san stefano create a independent bulgarian state and in the opinion of great britain and germany give russium far greater influence in the balkan peninsula than be agreeable to that disastrous supporter of turkey the balance of power in consequence the treaty of san stefano be supersede by the treaty of berlin in those arrangement abdul hamid have no voice but he be well content to sit quiet think about what be to be do with what be leave he and thank he wane crescent that once again the balance of power have secure constantinople for he leave he free to deal with he asiatic dominion and such part of europe as be leave he as he think fit he could safely trust that he would never be eject from he throne by a foreign power and all he need do be to make himself safe against internal disturbance and revolution which might upset he and it be then that he beget in the womb of he cold and cunning brain a policy that be all he own except in so far as the bulgarian atrocity consequent on feud between bulgar and greek may be consider the father of that hideous birth but it be he who suckle and nourish it it be from he brain that it emerge full-grown and in panoply of armor as from the brain of olympian zeus come palla athene this new policy be in flat contradiction of all the previous policy as he have receive it from he predecessor of strengthen turkey by tribute of man-power from he subject tribe but it would he think have the same result of keep the turk supreme among the alien element of the empire time have change it behove he to change the method which hitherto have hold together he hapless inheritance now abdul hamid be not in any sense a wise man and the ability which have be attribute to he in view of the manner in which he successfully defy the civilisation of europe be base on premiss altogether false he never really defy europe at all he always yield secure in he belief that europe in the shape of the balance of power be unanimous in keep he where he be he never even risk be turn out of constantinople for he know -- none better -- that all europe insist on retain he there as regard wisdom there be never a greater fool but as regard cunning there be never a greater fox he have a brain that be absolutely impervious to large idea : the notion of consolidate and strengthen he empire by ameliorate its internal condition by bring it within speak distance of the influence of civilisation and progress by take advantage of and develop its immense natural resource by employ the brain and the industry of he subject race seem never to have enter he head he could easily have do all this : there be not a power in europe that would not have lend he a help hand in development and reform in the establishment of a solvent state in aid the condition of the people over whom he rule in whatever he do provide that it further the welfare of he subject whether turk armenian or arab the whole concert of europe would have provide he with cash with missionary with engineer and all the resource of the art and science of peace and of progress but be a felon with crime and cunning to take the place of wisdom he prefer to develop he empire on he own original line in europe he be but suffer to exist there remain asia the policy of previous osmanlus ruler have already be roughly define they strengthen themselves and the military turkish despotism round they by absorb the manhood of the tribe over which they have obtain dominion abdul hamid reverse that policy he strengthen the turkish supremacy not by draw into it the manhood of he subject people but by destroy that manhood in proportion so he foxlike brain reason as he alien subject be weak so be the turk strong a consistent weakening of alien nation would strengthen the hold of those who govern the ottoman empire it be as if a man suffer from gout in he foot : he could get rid of the gout by wholesome live the result of which would be that he foot cease to trouble he but the plan which he adopt be to cause he foot to mortify by process of inhuman savagery when it be dead it would trouble he no longer he be well aware that the turkish people only comprise some forty per cent of the population of the turkish empire : numerically they be weaker than the alien people who compose the rest of it something have to be do to bring the govern power up to such a proportionate strength as should secure its supremacy and the most convenient plan be to weaken the alien element the scheme though yet inchoate have be try with success in the case of the bulgarian and greek and to test it further he stir up albanian against the inhabitant of old servium with gratifying result they weaken each other and he further weaken they both by the employment of turkish troops in macedonium to quell the disturbance which he have himself foment there be massacre and atrocity and no more trouble just then from macedonium have thus test he plan and find no flaw in it he settle to adopt it but european combination do not really much interest he for he be aware that the great power to whose sacred balance he owe the permanence of he throne would not tolerate interference with european people and he turn he attention to asia minor there be excrescence there which he could not absorb but which might be destroy he could use the knife on live tissue which the impaired digestion of the ottoman empire could not assimilate so he hit on this fresh scheme which he hellish cunning devise with a matchless sense of the adaptation of the means to the end and he create -lrb- though he do not live to perfect -rrb- a new policy that reverse the tradition of five hundred year that be no light task to undertake and when we consider that since he deposition now nine year ago that policy have reap result undreamed of perhaps by he we can see how far-sighted he cunning be to-day it be be follow out by the very combination that depose he he aim have be fully justified and for that precise reason we be right to classify he among the abhorred of mankind he have a opportunity such as be give to the few and he make the utmost of it even as he greater successor on the throne of turkey for the present namely wilhelm ii of prussium have do in the service of the devil ` well do thou good and faithful servant ' must surely have be he well-deserved welcome when he leave the hell he have make on earth for another of all he subject the armenian be the most progressive the most industrious the most capable they therefore contribute accord to that perverted foxlike mind one of the greatest menace to the stability of he throne which henceforth should owe its strength to the weakness of those it govern they as all the world know be a peaceful christian people and it be against they that abdul hamid direct the policy which he have test in europe the instrument he employ to put it in force be the kurd a turbulent shepherd race march with and mix up among the armenian by this mean he have the excuse ready that these massacre be local disturbance among remote and insubordinate tribe one of whom however the kurd he arm with modern rifle and cause to be instruct in some elementary military training they task be to murder armenian they pay be the privilege to rape they girl and they woman and to rob the house of the man they have kill the armenian resist with at first some small success upon which abdul hamid reinforce the kurd with regular troops and cause it to be proclaim that this be a war of moslem against the infidel a holy war moslem fanaticism ever smoulder and ready to burst into flame blaze high and a fury of massacre break forth against all armenian east and west north and south the street of constantinople run with they blood and before abdul hamid be oblige by foreign civilised power to stop those holocaust he have so decimate the race that not for at least a generation would they conceivably be a menace again even to that zealous guardian of the supremacy in its own dominion of the ottoman power very unwillingly when oblige to do so he whistle off he band of kurd and dismiss they : unwillingly too he give order that the armenian hunt which have so pleasantly divert the sportsman of constantinople must be abandon : then be decree a ` close time ' for armenian the shooting season be over there be no exaggeration in this : eye-witness have record how at the close of the business day in constantinople shooting party use literally to go out and beat the covert of tenement house for armenian of whom there be at that time in constantinople some 150000 but when abdul hamid have finish he sport i do not think more than 80000 at the most survive these be save by the protest of europe and perhaps by the knowledge that if all the armenian be kill there could never be any more shooting the kurd also have lose a considerable number of man and that be far from displease to the yellow-faced butcher of yildiz a little blood-letting among those turbulent kurd be not at all a bad thing here then we see define and at work the new ottoman policy with regard to its people hitherto it have be sufficient to take from they its fill of man-power and leave the tribe in question to its own device there be no objection whatever to its develop the resource of its territory to its increase in prosperity and in population indeed the central power be quite pleased that it should do so for when next the gathering of tax and youth come round the collector would find a creditable harvest await they such a tribe receive no encouragement or help from the government that would have be too much to expect but as long as it keep quiet and obedient it might without interference prosper as well as it could but now in the last quarter of the nineteenth century all that be change instead of a policy of neglect there be substitute a policy of murder the state no longer consider itself secure when in various part of its dominion its subject show themselves progressive and industrious they have to be keep down and clearly the most efficient way of keep people down be kill they let it not be suppose for a moment that either the first massacre or any that follow be the result of local disturbance and fanaticism it be nothing of the sort : each be arrange and plan at constantinople as the official mean invent by the arch-butcher abdul hamid of maintain in power the most devilish despotism that have ever disgrace the world something have to be do to prevent the alien tribe in asia slip out of the noose of ottoman strangulation even as the european tribe have do and form themselves into separate and independent state a ruler with progressive idea one who have any perception of the internal prosperity which alone can render a empire stable would have make the attempt to weld he loose and waver domination together by encourage and work for the prosperity of its component people so that he might though late in the day give birth to a turkey that be strong because its citizen be prosperous and content not so do abdul hamid the turkey that he seek to establish be merely to be strong because he have batter into a blood-stained pulp the most progressive and the most industrious of the alien people over whom he rule it be significant that while yet the blood of the murder christian be scarcely wash from the street of constantinople the emperor wilhelm ii visit he brother-sovereign at yildiz after make he tour throughout the holy land the two can hardly in they intimate conversation have completely avoid the subject of the massacre but after all that be not such a unmanageably awkward topic for wilhelm ii could tactfully have remind abdul hamid that he own throne also be base on the murderous progress of the teutonic knight then there be the war between turkey and greece only lately conclude to discuss and there again -- for the emperor 's sister be crown princess of greece -- conversation must have be a shade difficult altogether in spite of the emperor 's lifelong desire to visit the holy place in palestine it be a odd moment for a christian monarch to visit the butcher of constantinople but the truth be that wilhelm ii have a very strong reason for go to see he brother for the fruit of german policy in turkey be already ripening and swell on the tree and the minor disadvantage of visit this murderous tyrant while still he hand be red with blood be more than compensate for by the advantage of have a heart-to-heart talk with he on other subject germany have already begin she peaceful penetration and the real motive of the emperor 's visit be after sword and order have be exchange to make the definite request that body of colonise german should be allow to settle on the sultan 's dominion in asia minor and a hint no doubt be convey that there would be plenty of room for they now that there be so many armenian farm unfortunately without a master but like uriah heep the emperor have attempt to pluck the fruit before it be ripe or to use a more exact simile before he be tall enough to reach it in vain he represent to abdul hamid the immense advantage which would result to turkey by the establishment of those gott-like german settler in asia minor out of he colossal egalo-megalomania of which we know more now he think that any request which the all-highest should deign to make must instantly be grant but he meet with a perfectly flat refusal and the baffled all-highest left constantinople in a exceedingly bad temper which quite undo all the good that the balm in gilead and the sacred association of jerusalem have do he it be pleasant to think of the pan-islamic merriment with which abdul hamid must have view the indignant exit of he christian brother who have come such a long way to see he and be so tactful about the armenian atrocity he might perhaps -- for those christian be very odd pig -- have express horror or remonstrance not at all : he be much too anxious to get he request grant to make himself disagreeable but do he christian brother really think that all those massacre over which abdul hamid have spend so much time and money have be arrange in order to settle those nasty progressive german in the land that have be so carefully depopulate why the whole point of they have be that the armenian be too progressive and prosperous thus constitute a menace to the central government and certainly abdul hamid be not mean to put in they place settler even more progressive and with a stronger backing behind they so off go the all-highest back home again very much vex with abdul hamid and possibly -lrb- if that be not sacrilegious -rrb- with himself for have be in too great a hurry there be more spade-work to be do yet before turkey be ripe for open and avowed colonisation by the fatherland the episode strictly historical be of a certain importance for it show the date at which wilhelm ii think that the time have come for german to colonise turkey the peaceful penetration -lrb- which now amount to perforation -rrb- be even then pretty far advanced but abdul hamid seem to have see the significance of the request and for some little while after that german influence have a certain set-back in turkey the date of this mark a era and germany ` deep patient germany ' set to work again in no way discourage to set she cancer-nipper in the cancer that already have begin to eat the live tissue round it _ crescent and iron cross chapter ii _ the theory of the new turk in the year 1908 a military group in constantinople style itself the ` young turk ' party seize and depose abdul hamid and shut he up at salonika there to spend the remainder of he infamous day they put forth a liberal program of reformation one that earn they at the moment the sympathy of civilised europe -lrb- include germany -rrb- and the balance of power very mistakenly and prematurely heave a sigh of relief for upward of a century it have maintain in constantinople the corrupt and bloody autocracy of the sultan fear the european quarrel that would attend the dismemberment of that charnel-house of decay know as the ottoman empire and now -lrb- just for the moment -rrb- it seem as if a sudden rally have come to the sick man and he show sign of return animation and wholesome vitality the policy of the power after a century of failure look as if it be justify itself and they be full of congratulation towards turkey and each other but never in the whole century of they pusillanimous cackling have they make a greater mistake whether the young turk ever mean well or not whether there be or be not a grain of sincerity in this profession of they policy be a disputed question there be those who say that originally they be prompt by patriotic and high-minded aim when they proclaim they object of ` organization ' and of reform but all be agree that it matter very little what they original aim be so speedily do they liberal intention narrow down to a ottomanisation such as adbul hamid have aim at but have be unable to accomplish before he evil sceptre cease to sway the destiny of he kingdom in any case this program earn its author the sympathy of europe and probably this and no more than this prompt it they wish to establish themselves unquestioned and undisturbed and do so and i do not think we shall be far wrong if we take the original young turk program about as seriously as we take the parody of a parliament with which abdul hamid open -lrb- as with a blessing -rrb- he atrocious reign the very next year -lrb- 1909 -rrb- they permit -lrb- if they do not arrange -rrb- the armenian massacre at adana and the balance of power begin faintly to wonder whether the young turk in they deposition of abdul hamid have not slay a asp and hatch a cockatrice give that they aim originally be sincere we can but marvel at the swiftness of the corruption which in little more than a year have begin to lead they not into path of reform and liberal policy but along the road towards which the butcher they have depose have point the way it must have make abdul hamid gnaw he nail and shake impotent hand to see those who have tear he from he throne so soon pursue the very policy which he invent and to which he nominally owe he dethronement strange too be it that he overthrow should come from the very quarter to which he look for security for it be on the army that each sultan in turn have most rely for the stability of he throne but abdul hamid in order perhaps to deal more effectually with the subject race he wish to exterminate have introduce a system of foreign training for the officer of he army a course of potsdam efficiency and it be just they on whom sultan from time immemorial have rely who knock the prop of the army away from he though publicly for the edification of europe he deposer profess a liberal policy it be not on account of armenian massacre that they turn he off he throne but because of the muddle and corruption and debility of he rule herein we may easily trace the hand of germany no longer publicly beckon as when wilhelm ii just after the first armenian massacre make he request of the sultan for the establishment in turkey of german colonist but work underground sap and mine like a mole for germany she mind already fix on secure turkey as a instrument of she eastern policy want a strong turkey and without doubt desire to bring a end to the disorganisation and decay of the empire and create and at the same time interpenetrate a efficient state that should be useful to she we may take it for grant that she like the rest of europe welcome any sign of regeneration in the ottoman empire but there be a ulterior purpose behind that turkey already grasp by the prussian hand must be in that hand a weapon fit for use a blade on which she could rely she strengthen the turkish army by the introduction of prussian discipline and work on good material already she have realize she ambition in this respect and now control the material which she then work on the troubled year of the balkan war which follow this false dawn couple with the loss of all the territory which remain to the ottoman empire in europe with the exception of thrace cause a immediate reaction from the open-minded policy of the young turk if we decide to credit they at the outset with a sincere purpose organization by a slightly different spelling become ottomanisation and the aim of the young turk be identify with those of the nationalist party which follow out and develop into a finish and super-fiendish policy the dream of abdul hamid he as we have see have invent the idea of secure ottoman supremacy in the empire not as before by absorption of the strength of its subject people but by they extermination and this form part of the new program which be to be more efficiently administer already in 1909 the experimental massacre at adana take place and the young turk party with its possibly liberal aim have become a party that have as its main object a system of tyranny and murder such as the world have never see simultaneously turkey itself nationalist party and all become enslave to german influence link by link the chain be forge and the manacle weld on and before the european war break out in 1914 the incarceration of turkey in germany be complete and wilhelm ii have a fine revenge for the snub inflict on he by abdul hamid when he propose the scheme of german colonisation in the land depopulate by the armenian massacre of 1895 from the first the aim of the nationalist who thus form so deadly a blend with the young turk party be ottomanisation or the establishment within the empire of a ottoman domination which should be pure and undefiled and in which none of the subject people be they armenian or kurd arab or greek or jew christian or moslem should have any part the inception of the scheme be no doubt inspire by the example give by prussium 's treatment of the pole and hungary 's of rouman and slovak but in thoroughness of method prussium 's pupil be to prove prussium 's master for it aim not merely at expropriation but extermination and seek to become strong not merely by weaken alien element but by abolish they it do not set this out quite explicitly in its manifesto and the resolution of its congress but two extract the first from the proceedings of the ` committee of union and progress ' hold in constantinople in 1911 have a sinister suggestiveness about they for which the act and measure of the committee have already supply the comment ` the formation of new party in the chamber or in the country must be suppress and the emergence of new liberal idea prevent turkey must become a really mohammedan country and moslem influence must be preponderant every other religious propaganda must be suppress sooner or later the complete ottomanisation of all turkish subject must be effect it be clear however that this can never be attain by persuasion but that we must resort to armed force other nationality must be deny the right of organization for decentralisation and autonomy be treason to the turkish empire ' could there be a completer reversion to the policy of abdul hamid than this formal resolution pass within three year of the time when the young turk depose he the conviction begin to dawn on one -- as it begin to dawn on the balancer of power -- that he owe he downfall not to he illiberal and butcherous policy but because he be not thorough enough the second extract from a pamphlet by jelal noury bey may be add which define the policy not with regard to the christian or jewish subject of the turk but with regard to the arab moslem by creed and the guardian of the holy city ` it be a peculiarly imperious necessity of we existence for we to turkise the arab land for the particularistic idea of nationality be awake among the younger generation of arab and already threaten we with a great catastrophe against this we must be fore-armed ' the design of ottomanisation soon begin to take practical form ottomanisation be to be the highest expression of patriotism and any means which secure it massacre such as in 1909 have take place at adana or the treatment accord to the greek and bulgarian who remain in thrace after the balkan war be in accordance with the new ` liberal ' gospel thrace be the only territory leave to the turk in europe and as it be largely populate by greek and bulgarian it could not be consider as sufficiently ottomanise a massacre under the very eye of europe be perhaps dangerous so it suffice to put the entire non-turkish population over the frontier and lay hand on they property in fact this be the first of the ` deportation ' scheme which in 1915 prove so successful with the armenian and the effect of it be that neither greek nor bulgarian be leave in thrace then follow the expulsion of greek from the mediterranean sea-board but this be never completely carry out because the european war intervene and the attention of the nationalist be claim by they over-lord later as we shall see a further deportation of greek be begin but again that be stop for germany see that it would never do to have she turkish ally murder settler of the same blood as those she hope would become she ally of course when it be only a question of armenian she do not interfere the design then of the new ` liberal ' regime of which those three measure the massacre at adana the expulsion of greek and bulgarian from thrace and of greek from the sea-board of the mediterranean be early instance be to restore the absolute supremacy of the turk in the ottoman empire it be obvious that the problem be one of considerable difficulty since the turk at the time compose only some forty per cent of the whole population they number about 8000000 while in the empire be include about 7000000 arab 2000000 greek 2000000 armenian and 3000000 more of smaller nationality such as kurd drus and jew but the turk be back by germany and nowadays since the abolition of the capitulation which leave all alien race unprotected by foreign power such as survive after the extermination of the armenian be completely at the mercy of the government in constantinople all these people speak a different language from the turk and have a different religion for the nationalist party with a view to the ottomanisation of the arab have definitely state that arab moslem be not of the true faith and that they own allah -lrb- in whose name they subsequently exterminate the armenian -rrb- be the god of love -- german equivalent get -- whereas the arab allah be the god of vengeance the sinister motive in this discovery need no comment for it be obvious that it release the ottoman government from the prohibition in the koran whereby moslem may not fight against moslem therefore the arab be declare not to be true moslem later on that motive be translate into practical measure among the first task with regard to the arab that face the nationalist party from what we may call the pacific side of they mission be to substitute the turkish language for arabic kemal bey a nationalist of salonika with the help of ziya bey collect round he a group of young writer and these proceed to translate the koran out of arabic into turkish and to publish the prayer for the caliphate in they own language and order go out that these revise version should be use in all mosque turkish be to be the official language for use in all public proclamation and with prussian thoroughness it be even substitute on such railway ticket as have hitherto be print in arabic the new turkish tongue -lrb- yeni lisan -rrb- have also to be purge of all foreign word but here some difficulty be experience for persian and arabic form a enormous percentage in the language as hitherto employ and the promoter of this ottoman purity of tongue find themselves leave with a very jejune instrument for the rhapsody of they patriotic aim poet in especial -lrb- for the nationalist like all well-equipped founder of romantic movement have they bard -rrb- find themselves in sore strait owe to the limited vocabulary and we read of one mehmed emin bey who be force to publish he ode in small provincial papers since no well-established journal would admit so scrannel a expression of view however exalt -lrb- 1 -rrb- but the translation of the koran be the greatest linguistic feat and tekin alp the most prominent exponent of nationalism refer to it as one of the noblest task undertake by the new movement it matter not at all that by religious ordinance the translation of the koran into any other tongue be a sin ` the nationalist ' he tell we ` have cut themselves off from the superstitious prejudice ' a further attempt be make to substitute turkish letter for arabic letter in the alphabet but this seem to have present insuperable difficulty and i gather that it have be abandon -lrb- footnote 1 : this thwart poet retire from the committee of union and progress not long after and he place be take by enver -rrb- the ottomanisation of religion and language then be among the pacific method of spread pan-turkism through the empire a monstrous idol be set up a hindenburg idol in front of which all people and language not christian alone but moslem be bind to prostrate themselves indeed it be against arab mainly that these provision be direct for the arab constitute the most menacing obstacle to the spread of ottomanisation since they number in the empire only a million less than the turk themselves it be ordain by statute that no arab could have a seat on the committee of union and progress and the cabinet similarly be purge of any greek or armenian element never any more must there be new party in the chamber never any more must liberal idea -lrb- to champion which the new turk party have come into be -rrb- be allow to prick up they pernicious head for the nationalist party with whom the new turk be now identical have take as they creed all that the depose abdul hamid stand for and only differ from he in that as they scheme develop they look forward to logical conclusion far beyond what he have ever dream of but abdul hamid may i think be take to be the true founder of the new nationalism : at any rate it be he who have first see the possibility of massacre as a means of maintain ottoman supremacy in the hand of nationalist that be to prove a more effective weapon than the printing of railway ticket in turkish but already before the european war the nationalist have vastly extend he idea and have see the danger of allow even arab to have a standing of any kind in the new state henceforth all subject people be to be _ raya _ cattle as in the old day of the sultan who absorb the strength of the alien but do not exterminate they but now the cattle be not only to be use for milk but be to be slaughter when advisable till then they must be dumb or speak the language of they master only for this alone can save they from the shambles ahm sherif bey a prominent nationalist lay this down ` it be the business of the porte to make the arab forget they own language and to impose upon they instead that of the nation that rule they if the porte lose sight of this duty it will be digging its grave with its own hand for if the arab do not forget they language they history and they custom they will seek to restore they ancient empire on the ruin of ottomanism and of turkish rule in asia ' here then be the definite statement of the nationalist ' hostility to all thing arab and we shall see how they translate it into practice even moslem be but cattle for they as also be armenian and greek and kurd armenian be doom to be the first complete sacrifice on the bloody altar of the nationalist and as a turkish gendarme engage in that sacrifice say to a danish red cross nurse ` first we kill the armenian then the greek and then the kurd ' and if he have be a progressive minister he would certainly have add ` and then the arab ' it be not only within the present limit of the ottoman empire that the committee of union and progress propose to accomplish they unitive purpose for after have see a glorious and exclusive turkey arise over the depopulated territory of they alien people a vaster vision for a account of which we be indebted to tekin alp open before they prophetic eye out of the 10000000 inhabitant of persium they claim that one-third be of true turkish blood and in the new turkey which so they almost pathetically hope will be establish at the conclusion of the european war by the help of wilhelm ii those persian turk must be incorporate into the true fold of allah god of love the province of adarbaijan for instance the richest and most enlighten district of persium they claim be entirely turkish and here the needful rectification will be make in the new atlas that bear the imprimatur of potsdam similarly all the country south of the caucasus must rank as turkish territory since the turk form from fifty to eighty per cent of the population all kazan for the same reason be truly turkish with the alluvial plain of the volga while the crimea so tekin alp discover be also a lose sheep longing for the turkish fold all this be turkey -lrb- or turanium -rrb- irredenta and may we not add : -- ` jerusalem and madagascar and north and south amerikee ' and then what a glorious future await the power that europe once think of as a sick man ` with the crush of russian despotism ' exclaim tekin alp ` by the brave german austrian and turkish army thirty to forty million turk will receive they independence with the ten million ottoman turk this will form a nation of fifty million advance towards a great civilisation which may perhaps be compare to that of germany in that it will have the strength and energy to rise even higher in some way it will be even superior to the degenerate french and english civilisation ' the arithmetic and the enthusiasm of the foregoing paragraph be of course those of tekin alp from whose book _ the turkish and pan-turkish ideal _ the quotation be make the work be publish in 1915 and appear as it do after the beginning of the european war it be but natural to find in it a expression not only of the nationalist aim for turkey but of the prussian aim for turkey or to speak more correctly of the dream which prussia have induce in a hypnotised turkey it set forth in fact the bait which prussia have dangle in front of turkey the hunger for which have inspire the project future which be here sketch out and significantly enough this book have be spread broadcast over turkey by the agency of german propagandist the ottomanisation of the empire the vision of its further extension free from all consideration of subject people be exactly the lure which be most likely to keep the turk staunch to they prussian master it will be notice that there be no suggestion of the turk recover they lose province and kingdom in europe greece bulgarium rumanium servium and the rest for it would never do to let fox ferdinand awake from _ he _ hypnotic sleep of a sort of czardom over the balkan or cease to dangle dream that include even constantinople before the shifty eye of king constantine so before turkey be spread the prospect of appropriate russian and persian spoil : prussium have already give the lose turkish kingdom in europe elsewhere but would there not be a dismembered russian empire to dispose of the crimea the province of kazan the province of trans-caucasium : all these might be hold before turkey 's nose as a dog have a piece of meat hold up before it to make it beg then there be the province of adarbaijan : certainly turkey might be permit to promise herself that without incur the jealousy of austrium or bulgarium greedily turkey take the bait she gulp it down whole and never consider that there be a string attach to it or that should ever the time come when germany the conqueror of the world would be in a position to reward she ally with the realisation of the dream she have induce the string would be pull and up with retching and vomiting would come these succulent morsel of russium and persium indeed these bright picture flash on to the sheet as the vision of nationalist be but the slide in a german magic-lantern design to keep turkey amuse and it be with the same object that ernst marré in he _ die türken und wir nach dem kriege _ be bid to make other picture ready in case turkey grow fractious or sleepy ` from the ruin of antiquity ' he say when speaking of the ottoman empire ` new life will spring if we can manage to raise the treasure which time and sand have cover ' then he remember that he must be less pan-germanic for the moment and dangle the bait again ` in do this ' he add ` we be benefit turkey the turkish state be no united whole and it have always be very difficult to govern turk arab greek armenian kurd can not be weld together this be a war of liberation for turkey only by energetic interference and by expel the obstinate armenian element could the ottoman empire get rid of a russian domination the non-turkish population of the ottoman empire must be ottomanise ' there be no need for further quotation which might be multiply indefinitely the prussian program be for the moment identical with the turkish nationalist program : turkey in order to be keep ` in with ' germany must be encourage to dream of depopulate armenia -lrb- that dream have come tragically true -rrb- and of annexation in russium and persium all this fit in with the turkish program : germany have scarcely to inspire only to encourage that encouragement she give for simultaneously she be penetrate turkey as water penetrate a sponge and reduce it to the position of a vassal state to keep turkey happy she allow the armenian massacre to run they deadly course and only interfere with other massacre when they do not suit she purpose but suppose -lrb- to suppose the impossible -rrb- that a peace to the european war be dictate by germany how much of the future pan-turkish program would be realize would there be a turkey at all i think not : there would be a germany in europe and a germany in asia where turkey once be indeed in all but name they be in existence now so complete as we shall see have be germany 's penetration of the ottoman empire just for the present she call herself turkey in those region that be she incognito but turkey as a independent power have already cease to exist and tekin alp and the nationalist still dream on with rainbow vision of ottomanisation the vista of which stretch far into persium and the plain of the volga and all the while she have be put out like a candle and all that be leave of she be the smoulder wick ready to be pinch between the horny finger of she stepmother there she stand she stepmother with she grinning tooth already disclose the wolf whatever the end of the european war may be in no circumstance can the dream of the nationalist be realize even if germany and she arm be so victorious that russium lay at she foot a mere inert carcase ready for the chopper she would no more dream of give russian province to a independent turkey than she would hand over to she berlin itself and if as we know germany can never be victorious will the ally once more strive to keep the sick man alive or leave in he ruthless power the people whom he be longing to exterminate even tekin alp can hardly expect that here then in brief be the policy of new turkey its subject people -- armenian arab greek kurd and jew -- be to be totally unrepresented in its council though together they number sixty per cent of the population of the empire but they be not only to be unrepresented in government -- they be if the program be to be carry conclusively out to have no existence in accordance with the plan of the murderous ruffian who to-day administer the nationalist policy those of the armenian who have not flee beyond the frontier have already be exterminate and the same fate threaten arab greek and jew hence when the ally government write they joint note to president wilson they state that among they aim in the war be ` the liberation of the people who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of the turk ' from that avowed determination they will never recede \* \* \* \* \* note -- it be to be hope that tekin alp 's pamphlet _ turk and the pan-turkish ideal _ may soon be accessible to english reader the author be a macedonian jew who write under the pseudonym of tekin alp and he mind be such that he appear to find romance in the idea of a unite turkey purge by indiscriminate massacre from all alien element but he set forth with admirable lucidity the aim of the nationalist party and the step already achieve by they in they progress towards they ideal already the sequestered lady of the harem have come out of they retirement and join in the crusade and not only do man give lecture to woman but ` woman mount the platform and address the man ' there be corporation to advance economic organization boy-scout centre all over the empire and ` intellectual party ' among the guild of merchant -- england and russium appear as the most virulent foe of pan-turkism ` the colossus of darkest barbarism join with the colossus of a degenerate civilisation ' in the second part of he pamphlet tekin alp pass on with a enthusiasm which be as sincere as it be pathetic to the vision of a tremendous turkey extend from thrace on the west to the desert of gobus on the east it embrace as he map show egypt as far south as victorium nyanza arabium persia the greater part of indium the littoral of the black sea the plain of the volga the circuit of the caspian sea and the aral sea and in the north-east nearly touch tomsk all this naturally be dependent on complete german victory in the war and pathetically enough tekin alp appear to think that he ideal turkey will meet with the approval of germany indeed it be no wonder that he pamphlet be circulate broadcast by german propagandist for it be precisely what germany want turkey to believe the romance of the movement appeal also very strongly to ziya gök alp the official bard of the butcher of constantinople he have write a sort of ode to attilum quote by tekin alp which be a fine frenzy in favor of barbarism this preposterous poem begin : ' i do not read the famous deed of my ancestor in the dead fade dusty leaf of the history book but in my own vein in my own heart my attilum my hun those heroic figure which stand for the proud fame of my race appear in those dry page to we malicious and slanderous age as cover with shame and disgrace while in reality they be no less than alexander and caesar ' etc etc i have be at present unable to ascertain whether it be true that the german emperor have set it to music under the impression that it refer to he and the german army it be very popular in prussium which need arouse no surprise _ crescent and iron cross chapter iii _ the end of the armenian question we have trace in brief the backward progress of ottoman domination and have see how from the rough and ready method of a military barbarism the turk evolve a more emphatic and a more highly organised negation of all those principle which we may sum up under the general term of civilisation the comparatively humane neglect of the unfortunate alien people herd within the frontier of earlier sultan be improve upon by abdul hamid who strike out the swifter and superior method of maintain the dominate strength of the turkish element in the kingdom not by the absorption of subject people but by they extermination this in turn this new and effective idea serve as a first sketch of a artist with regard to he finished picture and start with that the nationalist party enlarged and elaborate it into that masterpiece of massacre which they exhibit to the world in the year 1915 and 1916 of the christian era when from end to end of the empire there flash the signal for the extermination of the armenian race abdul hamid be but tentative and experimental as compare to they systematised thoroughness but then the nationalist party have learn thoroughness under the tutelage of its prussian master and in addition to instruction they have have the advantage of see how prussian firmness with the soothing balm of kultur to follow have deal with the now-subject remnant of belgian that be the way to treat subject people : ` the first care of a state be to protect itself ' as enver and talaat could read in the text-book now translate into turkish in copy maybe present to they by they master in berlin and turkey could best show the proof of she enlightenment and regeneration by follow in the footstep of prussian kultur perhaps a few thousand innocent man might suffer the inconvenience of have they nail tear out of be bastinado to death of be shoot burn or hang perhaps a few thousand girl and woman might die by the wayside in be deport to ` agricultural colony ' might fall victim to the lust of turkish soldier or have babe tear from they womb but these paltry individual pain signify nothing compare to the national duty of ` suffer the state to run no risk ' as one of this party of union and progress say ` the innocent of to-day may be the guilty of to-morrow ' and it be therefore wise to provide that for innocent and guilty alike there should be no to-morrow at all year before the statesmanship of abdul hamid have prophetically foresee the dawn of this day when he remark ` the way to get rid of the armenian question be to get rid of the armenian ' and temporarily for twenty year he do get rid of the armenian question but when in 1915 talaat bey complete he arrangement for a further contribution to the solution of the same problem he say ` after this there will be no armenian question for fifty year ' as far as we can judge he rather under-estimate the thoroughness of he arrangement -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : lately -lrb- September 1917 -rrb- when the massacre be all over talaat speaking at a congress of the committee of union and progress uphold as right and proper the treatment of the armenian race -rrb- the race thus mark out for extermination be one of the oldest settlement in asiatic turkey originally it be confine to armenia proper a highland district comprise part of what be now the russian province of trans-caucasia part of persium notably the province of adarbaijan and within the turkish frontier the province of armenia itself accord to legend which may well be correct the armenian be the oldest national christian church in the world with a liturgy that date from the first century of the christian era while they translation of the bible date from the early year of the fifth century ad here in these upland they form a compact and homogeneous population spread over town and country alike and be occupy in the main with agrarian and pastoral pursuit but they have in addition much of the versatility and business capacity of the jew as well as a strong liberal-mindedness towards progress and education and thus while they still continue up to the present day they pastoral life in the countryside other gravitate towards town and by degree they spread over a large part of the turkish empire until most of the town in turkey have a progressive and peaceful quota of armenian citizen tolerate by they moslem neighbor and though possess of no great share of political influence powerful in that the trade and commerce of inland turkey be largely in they hand wherever they go they establish they school many be lawyer doctor and professor of education certain repressive measure be bring to bear on they they be not for instance allow to carry arm except when in accordance with turkish conscriptive law they serve in the ottoman army but many of they by pay they exemption money get off military service and they confine themselves to the art of peace whether pastorally in they native highland or in the shop and office of the town to which they migrate they be not till the time of abdul hamid hold to be in any sense a national danger for except in armenia proper they be too scatter and too peace-loving a element of the population to be capable of united action and never do they seem to have provoke any outburst of moslem fanaticism they have local quarrel and fight with the more warlike kurd who encroach on armenia and in the town where they settle they often incur the vague jealousy and dislike which be the penalty of a race superior morally and intellectually to those among whom they live but that superiority constitute in course of time the ` armenian question ' to which abdul hamid allude in all some sixty year ago they entire race number about 4000000 person of whom about 1250000 inhabit russian trans-caucasia about 150000 be in the province of adarbaijan and there be smaller body of they in austrium and indium the remainder some 2500000 be spread over armenia over the village and town of turkey notably the eastern edge of the cilician upland while in constantinople itself there be certainly not less than 150000 and probably as many as 200000 to-day the male portion of the armenian race in the ottoman empire have practically cease to exist : a quarter of a million man and woman escape over the russian frontier five thousand escape to egypt and there be a few thousand woman and girl -lrb- it be impossible to ascertain the exact number -rrb- in turkish harem turkism as administer by abdul hamid first then far more efficiently by enver pasha and talaat bey have solve the armenian question the history of its solution fall under two head of which the first concern the manner in which it be solve in armenia itself where the population be almost exclusively armenian both in town and in the country here the eastern and north-eastern frontier of turkey across which lie the province of russian trans-caucasium and persium pass through the middle of district people by man of armenian blood and when in the autumn of 1914 the turk make they entry into the european war they eastern army operate against russium find themselves confront by troops among whom be many armenian while in they advance into the persian province of adarbaijan there be in the rank of they opponent armenian and syriac christian they advance in fact in the first week of the war into a country largely peopled with man of the same blood as those on they own side of the frontier though the edict have not yet come from constantinople for the massacre of the armenian -lrb- talaat bey do not complete he arrangement till the follow April -rrb- the slaughter of they begin then first in the advance of the turkish army and follow on that movement which last but a few week in they subsequent retreat before the russian all village through which the turkish army pass be plunder and burn all the inhabitant on whom the turk could lay they hand be kill sometimes woman and child be give to the kurd who form band of irregular troops in conjunction with the turkish army and these be outrage before they be slaughter a price be put on every christian head and in the turkish retreat the corpse be thrust into the well in order to pollute they the excuse for this as give by german apologist -lrb- not apologist perhaps so much as supporter and adherent of the policy -rrb- be that since behind the turkish line the country be populate by a race of the same blood as that through which they advance and then retreat extermination be necessary in order to prevent or to punish treachery and collusion but i have be nowhere able to find that there be instance of such nor that the turk put forward that excuse themselves indeed it would have be a unnecessary explanation for but a few month after the opening of the war talaat bey 's plan be complete and the extermination of armenian hundred of mile from any sphere of military operation render it needless to say anything about it or to invent instance of treachery if there be actually none to hand simultaneously the massacre of armenian behind the turkish line begin the whole male population of the district round bitli be murder so too be all male in bitli itself then all woman and child be drive in as a herdsman might drive sheep from the reek village round and for purpose of convenience concentrate in bitli when they be all collect they be drive in a flock to the edge of the tigri shot and the corpse be throw into the river that be the solution of the armenian question in bitli north-west of bitli and some sixty mile distant lie the town of mush it use to contain about 25000 armenian inhabitant and in the district round there be some three hundred village chiefly consist of armenian arrangement be on foot for a general massacre there when the arrival of russian troops at liz some fifteen hour ' march away cause the execution of it to be put off for a while and up till July a few folk only have be shoot and a few beat to death as a warn to those treacherously inclined then the russian in the face of superior force have to retire again and the massacre be put on a systematic foot the account which follow be base on four independent authority : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the statement of a german eye-witness in mush in charge of a armenian orphanage -lrb- 2 -rrb- the statement of a woman deport from a village near and subsequently kill by kurd -lrb- 3 -rrb- information from refugee escape to trans-caucasium -lrb- 4 -rrb- the journal _ horizon _ of tifli these supplement each other often verify each other and in no instance be contradictory rumor of a impending massacre reach mush before the end of 1914 at a time when the massacre across the frontier have begin the mutessarif of mush a intimate friend of enver pasha have openly declare that ` at a opportune moment ' the slaughter of the whole armenian race be contemplate and later ekran bey corroborate this in the presence of the american and german consul enver indeed seem to have be the chief organiser with regard to the massacre in armenia itself while talaat bey see to the fate of those disperse in town throughout the rest of turkey during the whole of that winter a very severe one sign of the approach extermination multiply in the village round fresh tax be introduce and when armenian be unable to pay they be beat to death while if they resist the village in question be burn but by July 1915 -lrb- after the unavoidable delay cause by the proximity of russian troops -rrb- all be ready and the massacre begin in earnest four battalion of turkish troops arrive from constantinople and a order be give that all armenian must leave the town within three day after ` register themselves ' at the government office the woman and child be to remain but they money and they property would be confiscate within two hour after that owing i suppose to fresh order from constantinople the gun open fire on the crowd in the street flock to the registry office and after that systematic house-to-house murder begin prominent armenian be tortured to death house contain woman and child be set on fire a body of man collect together be throw into the river girl be outraged and slaughter for two day the massacre continue and by the end of the second day the armenian question be solve as regard mush in the surround village the same prussian thoroughness be observe and out of all the inhabitant of the plain 5000 only seem to have survive who flee to sasun -lrb- there to be subsequently massacre in 1916 -rrb- while a few from outlying village escape to the russian troops in certain village the girl and young woman be give to the kurd soldiery who rape they publicly in the presence of they family not spare girl of eight and ten year of age who then bleed and violate be shoot in company with the old woman for whom the kurd -lrb- inspire by allah the god of love -rrb- have no use elsewhere as the story of a deport woman from kheiban tell we the woman guard by kurdish troops be drive out of they village leave behind the corpse of the man and of old woman who could not walk and for day be march along the road nearly naked under the fierce heat of the July sun once every other day they be give bread but all do not get it and many fall exhaust by the wayside and be either whip to they foot again or allow to lie down and die as they pass through village kurd would come out and rape a girl or two and when they halt at night they guard would come among they some few escape the rest in dwindle company go on through day of blind sun and night of shame till at last there be only a few remain it be not worth while go farther for the work of enver pasha be nearly do and the rest be push into the river one alone survive who could swim and she with she two-year-old baby on she back get across the stream and make she way to a village where be a party of armenian who have escape massacre she arrive there at midnight and at first they think she be a ghost to they she tell she story of the outraged and ever-dwindling caravan of helpless woman and girl drive onward all day beneath the smite arrow of the sun and encamp by the wayside where they halt with they barbarous guard and they lust for a terror by night of they none but this one be leave who have carry she baby with she every step of that infernal pilgrimage two day afterwards he die from want of nourishment and before the week be out the mother fall into the hand of a body of patrolling kurd and be kill so the problem of the village of kheiban be solve and if in the history of the crime that have blacken the earth with wanton cruelty and make god to hide he face there be any so atrocious a tale i do not know it but if among the annals of heroism and of mother-love we want to find a nobler record than that of this woman of kheiban equally be i at a loss as to where we should look for it among the true and golden legend of the world shall that which she do be inscribe for a memorial of she northward from mush and bitli lie the province of erzerum with the town of the same name that contain in the autumn of 1914 some 20000 armenian here the first hint of come trouble be the order that all armenian soldier serve in turkish rank should be disarm this be follow in June by another order that all the inhabitant of the hundred village in the district should leave they home at two hour ' notice they number between 10000 and 15000 person of these a few take refuge with friendly kurd but of the remainder a few only live to reach erzinjan where they be again deport and the rest be murder as they march in erzerum itself order be receive by tahsin bey the valus of the town that all armenian be to be kill without distinction of age or sex he refuse to carry this order out but he unwillingness be overrule -lrb- 1 -rrb- simultaneously the german consul telegraph protest to he ambassador at constantinople and be tell that germany could not interfere in the internal affair of turkey -lrb- footnote 1 : at angora a similar refusal on the part of the governor result in he dismissal and the same thing happen at konium and at kutaium -rrb- here the method employ be deportation : the victim be murder not in the town itself but be give order to leave they home and under guard march -lrb- for no conveyance be give they -rrb- to other district the first company be to go to diarbekr all these with the exception of one man and forty woman be murder on the first day 's march the remainder reach kharput which be another station or collect place for the deport a german eye-witness tell we what fate wait they ` they have have they eyebrow pluck out they breast cut off they nail tear off they torturer hew off they foot or else hammer nail into they as they do in shoe horse this be all do at night-time in order that people may not hear they scream and know of they agony soldier be station round the prison beat drum and blow whistle it be needless to relate that many die of these torture when they die the soldier cry now let you christ help you ' a second caravan of five hundred family leave erzerum : at baiburt they be join by another contingent deport from that town and the account that follow be base on the information supply by the rev robert stapleton a american minister at erzerum and by a armenian woman who be among the deport and whose life be spare on she embrace islamism the convoy number when it leave baiburt some 15000 person and it reach erzinjan in safety there the massacre have already take place and the woman and child have be deport for they find no armenian there but the convoy have not yet arrive at its goal and it start out again move south by east till it come to kamakh there band of kurd descend on they and in the space of seven day every male above fifteen year of age include a aged priest of ninety be kill thereafter a pilgrimage of woman as from kheiban move southwards across plain and mountain and every day its number be diminish for the youthful and the good-looking be carry off by brigand at night they be halt outside village and the gendarme and villager take what they choose many die from hunger and heat-stroke : other be leave by the wayside when they come to the bank of the river kara-su there be a debauch of horror woman and girl and little child be rape and mutilate and the child who still survive be throw into the river those who could swim be shoot thereafter the movement of this caravan be hard to trace probably there be then but little leave of it but other follow on the same route ` through field and hillside dot with swollen and blacken corpse that fill and foul the air with they stench ' some of they reach mosul some reach aleppo another collect station where by the mouth of other witness we shall hear of they again corroborative and additional evidence be give by the danish red cross nurse who with a noble disregard of they own safety accompany one of these caravan from erzerum to erzinjan they speak of the massacre at kamakh of the killing by the river and of a _ battue _ through the cornfield where the wheat be high into which some armenian have escape at one time these danish sister be in the charge of a gendarme who have superintend a massacre of 3000 woman and child drive from they home into the country round up and kill he tell the sister that this be the best method of get rid of they for they should be make to suffer first and besides it would be inconvenient for moslem to live in a village with so many corpse about at another place they come to a shambles where armenian soldier deprive of they arm and send to make road have be slaughter : at another there be three gang of labourer one moslem one greek and one armenian these latter be guard presently as they proceed along they road they look round and see that the armenian gang be be form up by itself a little off the highroad and so the ghastly record go on all over armenia at one place only the town of van be any resistance organise there after the massacre have begin some 1500 armenian get hold of arm -lrb- probably many of these man be soldier who have not yet have they arm take from they -rrb- and for the space of twenty-seven day defend themselves against five thousand turkish troops till the russian advance relieve they during that advance armenian refugee into whose district the massacre have not yet penetrate flee for refuge to the invade army and in all some 250000 armenian under its protection cross in safety the russian frontier into trans-caucasia how many die on the way from hunger and exhaustion be not know cholera dysentery and spot fever break out among they and the path of they passage be line with dead and die company of kurd make descent upon they take toll of they maidenhood but with the russian line to protect they at they rear they struggle on out of the cemetery and brothel of they native country and out of the accursed confines of that hell on earth the ottoman empire leave behind they the murder myriad of they husband and they son they violate wife and daughter through incredible hardship they pass but unlike the other pilgrimage we have briefly trace they move not towards death but towards safety and life and they dark step be lighten with hope before the last of those who survive the hunger and the pestilence of that pilgrimage have reach russian soil it be probable that in all armenia there be not a man of they race leave alive nor a woman either unless she have accept islamism and the life of the harem a peaceful and progressive nation have be wipe out with every accompaniment of horror and cruelty and bestial lust and in armenia itself there would never more be a armenian question abdul hamid have hint at the solution of it and have make as we have see experiment in that direction but it be reserve for enver pasha and talaat bey enlighten man of the young turk party with the advantage of a prussian example to complete the work already enver have say that he would never rest until the last armenian in the ottoman empire have be kill and before the end of 1915 as far as armenia itself go he be able to see a reasonable prospect of repose before he but there be much work still leave to do in other province we have see that for the extirpation of armenian in armenia proper the excuse put forward if not by the turk themselves by they german apologist be the necessity of guard against treachery in the vicinity of the turkish army and against spy and collusion between the armenian behind the russian line and those behind turkish line the same pretext be put forward for the massacre and deportation from thrace from constantinople and from the shore of the sea of marmora here if anywhere there may be think to be some justification for measure which might have be undertake for the sake of public safety at any rate there be definite charge bring against armenian in these district and the armenian boatman of silivrus for instance be imprison but not as far as i know massacre on the charge of revictualling english submarine which at that time as the reader will remember have penetrate into the sea of marmora and indeed have reach constantinople itself it be not of course consonant with turkish or prussian justice to substantiate charge before inflict penalty it be sufficient in the new world-justice to accuse but here round constantinople there be some pretence at procedure before resort to murder and deportation a register be draw up of all armenian resident in the capital divide into separate class those who be bear in constantinople and those who be immigrant from armenia with a view to deport those who be not native to the city here i think we may see trace of the prussian instinct for tabulation for classification for category-mongering enver and he colleague lose patience with these dilatory tactic the armenian of the province of brussa be deport wholesale and long before the registration list of constantinople be finish all armenian be move out of the town ten thousand male be massacre in the mountain of ismid and the armenian woman and child take into collect station for deportation to ` agricultural colony ' -lrb- so the phrase run in the pecksniff language of prussium -rrb- situate in the anatolian desert in the desert of arabium and in malarious marsh on the euphrate with this clear out of armenian from thrace from constantinople and from armenia itself we have finish with we first class of the armenian atrocity for it reason be at least invent by german apologist military necessity which here as in belgium know no law dictate it the frightfulness involve be incidental to war but such consideration be not even allege for the second class of the murder-scheme before pass on it will be well to review quite shortly the reason which dictate it and penetrate into the infernal council of enver pasha and talaat bey the text of the scheme be to be find in the define policy of the young turk party as set forth in they congress of 1911 ` turkey must become a really mohammedan country and moslem idea and moslem influence must be preponderant sooner or later the complete ottomanisation of all turkish subject must be effect : it be clear however that this can never be attain by persuasion but that we must resort to armed force ' there be the text that be expand into the discourse of murder it be the definition of a policy within a few year there follow the european war and that probably be the immediate cause of its be put into effect no more admirable opportunity for ottomanisation could present itself for the entry of turkey into the war be most unpopular with the bulk of the turkish population and it be advisable to bribe they into acceptance of it the bribe be the house the property the money and the trade that throughout the length and breadth of turkey be in armenian hand for the armenian be by far the wealthiest of the alien population and some 90 per cent of turkish trade pass through they shop and office here then be the psychological moment : turkey for the turk be the aim of the committee of union and progress and with a discontented population unwilling to fight the moment have come for restore to the turk this mass of property which at present belong to a alien race war might have its drawback and its cloud but war would be see to have its advantage and its silver lining if out of it there come this legacy of armenian wealth and by the same stroke turkey could get rid of those thousand of meddlesome missionary american and french who spread religion and learning and other undesirable thing among the curse race once remove the cursed race and there would be a end of they instructor also for there would be none to instruct ` thanks to they school ' so we read in the _ hilal _ a organ of the young turk ` foreigner be able to exercise great moral influence over the young man of the country by close they -lrb- ie by exterminate they pupil -rrb- the government have put a end to a situation as humiliating as it be dangerous ' such then be the spirit that animated enver and talaat and during the winter of 1914-15 they perfect they plan the armenian race be to cease and the vali and other official be each in he district to see to the thoroughness of its cessation sometimes as happen at erzerum the valus in question not have the broad out-look of enver or quaintly and curiously have a womanish objection to the national duty of flog man to death and give over young girl to a barbarous soldiery remonstrate with the authority or even refuse to obey order such a one be instantly remove from he office and a stauncher patriot substitute all be put on a orderly footing : here kurd be to be employ on the old abdul hamid formulum who by way of wage would enjoy the privilege of rape as many woman and girl out of they hapless convoy as seem desirable while in agricultural district they be allow also to take over the sheep and cattle of they murder victim here in town where there be more chance of resistance than in scatter homestead it would be wise to employ regular troops back if necessary by artillery to whom would be entrust the murder of the whole male population after suitable torture suppose the executioner have a taste for the sport and to they be give the right of general plunder then as soon as the number and capacity of the vacant house be telegraph to constantinople occupier from the discontented townsfolk and native of thrace be assign to they sometimes there would be a big school building to give away as well but that be not always so for it might be more convenient to assemble armenian there for purpose of registration or so forth and then if it happen to catch fire why enver would understand that such accident would occur among other careful and well-thought-out instruction come the order that when possible the murder should not take place in the town but outside it for clean allah-fearing moslem would not like to live in habitation defile by christian corpse but above all there must be thoroughness not a man must be leave alive not a girl nor a woman who must not drag she outraged body so long as breath and the heart-beat remain in it to or rather towards those ` agricultural colony ' as talaat bey in a flash of whimsical prussian humor call they one be advantageously situate in the middle of the anatolian desert at the village of sultanieh there for mile round stretch the rock and sand of a waterless wilderness but no doubt the woman and child of this very industrious race would manage to make it wave with cornfield another agricultural colony by way of contrast should be establish a couple of day ' journey south of aleppo where the river lose itself in pestilential and malarious swamp arab could not live there but who know whether those hardy armenian -lrb- the woman and child of they at least who have prove themselves robust enough to reach the place -rrb- would not flourish there out of harm 's way after the swamp one come to the arabian desert and there a hundred mile south-east be a place call deir-el-zor wander arab tribe sometimes pass through it but arrive there the armenian should wander no more in those arid sand and waterless furnace of barren rock there be room for all and to spare sultanieh the swamp and deir-el-zor : these be the chief of talaat bey 's agricultural colony there must be collect station for these tragic colonist centre to which they must be herd in from surround district : one at osmanieh let we say one at aleppo one at ras-el-ain one at damascus and since it would be a pity to let so many flower of girlhood waste they sweetness on the desert air of deir-el-zor slave market must be establish at these collect station there would be plenty of girl and price would be low but the reverend minister of allah the god of love the ulema the padi and the mufti should be accord a preferential tariff indeed they should pay nothing at all they should just choose a girl and take she away and with the help of allah the god of love convert she to the bless creed no one be too young for these lesson a little abstemiousness would not hurt these pampered christian so when they set out on they march they need not be provide with ration or water perhaps some might die but talaat have no use for weakling at he agricultural colony nor must there be any poke and prying on the part of those interfere american missionary and so talaat bey put all the agricultural colony out of bound for foreigner there be no hurry over these deportation for the plea of military exigency which have cause the deportation in armenia itself to be terminate by massacre with a rapidity almost inartistic do not apply to armenian so far from the seat of war they picnic could be conduct quietly and pleasantly in the leisurely oriental manner even the man need not be murder absolutely out of hand strong young fellow might be strip and tie down and then beat to death by bastinado the foot till they burst or by five hundred blow on the chest and stomach they cry would mingle with the scream of they sister in the embrace of turkish soldier and talking of embrace if a woman be desirable she need not walk all the way to deir-el-zor but by embrace islamism be transfer to a harem but these be detail that might be leave to individual taste : there be no precise instruction save that no armenian man must be discoverable in the ottoman empire at all and no woman save those who have become turkish woman or who be at work on the waterless and the malarial agricultural colony talaat bey review he finished scheme he think it would do and enver pasha agree with he and jemal bey -lrb- who soon after style himself jemal the great -rrb- the military governor of syrium and so responsible for the last stage of they pilgrimage think it would do very well indeed and instruction be send out to every town in the empire where there be armenian in accordance with the program of talaat bey how enver carry out he part of the program in armenia itself we have see and by the end of the year -lrb- 1915 -rrb- he work be do and armenia be armenia no longer but operation as i have say be conduct in a more leisurely manner elsewhere and the agony of that butchery protracted but jemal get to work at once in the thickly populated district round zeitun he have have no success in the campaign of the winter in the direction of the suez canal and he troops be hungry for some sort of victory the zeitunli be hardy independent mountaineer who be possess of arm and jemal think it more prudent not to dally with deportation but conduct a regular campaign against they for two or three month they resist entrench themselves in the hill but they could not hold out against artillery and the modern apparatus of war and the whole tribe be wipe out that do jemal become jemal the great by reason of he national service and pay a visit to germany on he return we shall hear of he again meanwhile from all the report that have arrive from missionary and other we may take one or two almost at random at certain place as in the government of ismid angora and diarbekr the armenian population be completely wipe out sometimes torture be add as at a certain anatolian town where there be a big armenian school in which a number of professor and instructor some of whom have study in america in scotland and in germany have for year be work what happen to they be this : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- professor a serve the college thirty-five year and teach turkish and history he be arrest without charge the hair of he head and beard be pull out in order to secure damaging confession he be starve and hang up by the arm for a day and a night and repeatedly beat he be then murder -lrb- 2 -rrb- professor b who have serve the college thirty-three year and teach mathematics suffer the same fate -lrb- 3 -rrb- professor c head of the preparatory department have serve the college for twenty year he be make to witness the spectacle of a man be beat almost to death and become mentally deranged he be murder with he family -lrb- 4 -rrb- professor d who teach mental and moral science be treat in the same way as professor a he also have three finger nail pull out by the root and be subsequently murder similarly at diarbekr the armenian be collect in batch of 600 take out of the town and kill to the last man among they be the armenian archbishop he eye and nail be drag out before he be butcher or let we take a look at some of the collect camp at one describe by a eye-witness we find that the convoy have arrive after several month of travel more than half be already dead they have be pillage by bandit and kurd seven time they be forbid to drink water when they pass by a stream three-quarter of the young woman and girl have be kidnap the rest be compel to sleep with the gendarme who conduct they at osmanieh it be decide to deport the woman and child by train they lay about the station starve and fever-stricken when the train arrive many be jostle on to the line and the driver yell with joy cry out ` do you see how i smash they up ' at another camp typhus break out those who die of it be leave unburied as vouch for by a turkish officer in order to increase the infection urfa be another collect camp for the armenian in that district and the follow account be base on the information of a eye-witness here before the concentration begin the armenian live in the town offer resistance to the turk and hold out until fahrus bey second in command to jemal the great arrive with artillery bombard the town and massacre every armenian there quiet be thus restore the band of deport begin to arrive they come by rail or on foot and with the prussian love of tabulation be divide into three group the first group consist of old man old woman and young child they guard by gendarme be send march through the desert to deir-el-zor few if any ever arrive there all die by the way the second group consist of able-bodied man be lead off in batch and slaughter among they be zohrab and vartke armenian deputy who have be bring there from constantinople the third group consist of young marriageable girl some perhaps find they way into harem from aleppo -lrb- one of the final concentration camp before such as be leave of the convoys set forth for they goal the swamp or the desert round deir-el-zor -rrb- we have the detailed evidence of dr martin niepage high grade teacher in the german technical school this gentleman with a courage and a humanity to which the highest tribute must be pay address a report of protest to the german ambassador at constantinople and write a open letter to the reichstag on the subject of what he have see with he own eye in that town in he preliminary matter he speak as follow : -- ` in dilapidated caravanserai i find quantity of dead many corpse be half-decomposed and other still live among they who be soon to breathe they last in other yard i find quantity of sick and die people whom nobody be look after we teacher and we pupil have to pass they every day every time we go out we see through the open window they pitiful form emaciated and wrap in rag in the morning we school child on they way through the narrow street have to push past the two-wheeled ox-cart on which every day from eight to ten rigid corpse without coffin or shroud be carry away they arm and leg trail out of the vehicle ' from the report itself : -- ` out of convoy which when they leave they home on the armenian plateau number from two to three thousand man woman and child only two or three hundred survivor arrive here in the south the man be slaughter on the way the woman and girl with the exception of the old the ugly and those who be still child have be abuse by turkish soldier and officer even when they be ford river they do not allow those die of thirst to drink all the nourishment they receive be a daily ration of a little meal sprinkle on they hand opposite the german technical school at aleppo a mass of about four hundred emaciated form the remnant of such convoy be lie in one of the caravanserai there be about a hundred child -lrb- boy and girl -rrb- among they from five to seven year old most of they be suffer from typhoid and dysentery when one enter the yard one have the impression of enter a madhouse if one bring food one notice that they have forget how to eat if one give they bread they put it aside indifferently they just lie there quietly wait for death ' dr niepage write this report in the hope of save such as then -lrb- 1915 -rrb- survive no notice whatever be take of it and he postscript write in may 1916 record the fact that ` the exile encamp at ras-el-ain on the bagdad railway estimate at 20000 man woman and child be slaughter to the last one ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it be right to add that at aleppo a officer call bekir samus guard 50000 armenian whom he have collect from neighbour district who be threaten with massacre and i find that a german missionary state that there be 45000 armenian alive in aleppo this form confirmatory evidence but at the same time there be nothing to show that they be not subsequently deport to deir-el-zor in this case it be highly improbable that any survive -rrb- in dr niepage 's view as i have state elsewhere the german be directly responsible for the continuance of the massacre such too be the opinion he tell we of the educate moslem and he courage in state this have lose he he post at aleppo it be to be sincerely hope that he have escape the fate of a certain dr lepsius who for draw attention to the fact that germany allow the armenian massacre have be arrest for high treason before the end of 1915 the german authority who have refuse to interfere in the massacre and both in the official press and through official utterance have express they support of this ottomanisation of the empire begin to think that you might have too much of a good thing and that the massacre have really go far enough they reason be clear and explicit : there would be a very serious shortage of labor in the beet-growing industry and in the harvest-field for which they have send grain and artificial manure from germany there have be some talk they say of save 500000 armenian out of the race but in the way thing be go on it seem that the remnant would not nearly approach that figure would not the great ottomaniser temper they patriotism with a little clemency talaat bey disagree : he want to make a complete job of it but jemal the great fresh from he visit to germany support the idea and in spite of talaat 's opposition make a spectacular exhibition of clemency in which beyond doubt we can trace a ` imitatio imperatori ' in the follow manner there be at the time a large convoy of man and woman in constantinople which be to be lead out for murder and deportation and jemal give order that it should be spare and send back to its highland home he give order also that the entire convoy should be inform who be they savior and should be lead in procession past he house and show they gratitude all day the sorry pageant last the ragged half-starved crowd stream by the house of jemal the great with murmur of thanksgiving and uplifted hand and all manner of obeisance while jemal the great stand in he porch with stern impassive face and hand on he sword-hilt in the best potsdam manner and acknowledge these thanksgiving -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : in support of jemal 's claim to clemency it must be add that accord to a report come from alexandrium he hang twelve of the worst assassin send to syria as ringleader of the massacre i can not find corroboration of this -rrb- here then be the absurd the williamesque side of this ludicrous popinjay jemal the great and it contain not only the obvious seed of laughter but the more helpful seed of hope he have a strong hand on the very efficient army of syrium and he visit to berlin seem perhaps to have turn he head not quite in the direction that the master-egalo-megalomaniac of berlin intended i gather that jemal the great be not so much impress by the magnificence of william ii as to fall dazzled and prone at the imperial foot and lick with enraptured tongue the imperial boot polish but rather to be inspire to do the same himself to become the god-anointed of the newly acquire german province which be turkey and make a potsdam of he own this be only a guess but the conduct of jemal the great in the matter of these armenian refugee and in other affair have be distinctly imperial in June of this year for instance he telegraph to he the valus of syrium and a extract from he text be truly potsdamish ` one and a half million of sandbag ' he write ` be require for the fortress of gaza the bag should be make if necessary of all the silk-hanging in house of syrium and palestine ' with he army behind he he have twice already defy the order of talaat and i be incline to think that he be the come strong man of the effete empire with whom it would be well worth while to make friend even at a highish price the ally power should keep a undazzled eye on he for it be quite possible that have defy talaat successfully he may go on to defy the real ruler of turkey who live in berlin he syrian army from such source as be available appear to be more efficient than any other body of troops the turk can put into the field and he have they in control probably in the winter of 1917-1918 we troops will come into collision with they but in the interval also quite probably jemal the great may resent german superintendence -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see note at end of this chapter -rrb- but in addition to he ludicrous side there be in he a refine hypocrisy and a subtle cruelty worthy of abdul hamid one instance will suffice there have be some talk that at certain of these concentration camp there be no water supply and he give order do jemal the great and the merciful that water should be send a train consist of truck of water accordingly be despatch to one of those camp situate in the desert with no supply nearer than six mile and a eye-witness describe its arrival the mob of armenian mad with thirst surround it and since everything must be do in a orderly and seemly manner be beat back by the turkish guard and make to stand at a due distance for the distribution and when those rank with they parched throat and sun-cracked lip be all ready the turkish guard open the tap of the reservoir and allow the whole of they contents to run away into the sand whether jemal the great plan that or whether it be but a humorous freak on the part of the official i can not say but as a refinement of cruelty i have outside the page of poe 's tale only once come across anything to equal it and that in a letter from the _ time ' _ correspondent at berne on April 11 1917 he describe the treatment of english prisoner in germany : ` a equally common entertainment with those woman -lrb- german red cross nurse -rrb- be to offer a wounded man a glass perhaps of water then stand just outside he reach to pour it slowly on the ground ' could those sister of mercy have read the account of jemal 's clemency or be it merely a instance of the parallelism of similar mind so the empty train return and jemal the great cause it to be know in berlin that he be active in secure a proper water supply for the famous agricultural settlement in the desert and loud be the encomium in the press of the central power over the colonisation of syrium by the armenian the progress and enlightenment of the turk and the skilful and humane organization of jemal the great there be no difficulty in estimate to-day the number of armenian man who survive in the turkish empire all appeal to the prussian overlord such as be make by dr niepage and the belated remonstrance of the prussian themselves when they foresee a dearth of labor for the husbandry of beet and cereal fall on deaf ear and i can not see any reason for suppose that armenian man exist any more in the empire it be more difficult to judge of the number of woman who by accept the moslem creed and the harem be still alive certainly in some district there be considerable ` conversion ' and dr niepage rate they as many thousand but the willingness to accept those condition be not always a guarantee for they be grant and i have read report where would-be convert be tell that ` religion ' be a more serious matter than that and instead of be accept they be massacre but even if dr niepage be right we can scarcely consider these woman as constitute a armenian element any more in the country the work of butchery the torture the long-drawn agony of those inhuman pilgrimage have come to a end because there be no more armenian victim available apart from those who escape over the russian frontier and the handful who seek refuge in egypt the race exist no longer and the seal have be set on the bloodiest deed that ever stain the annals of the barbarous osmanli it be not in revenge on the murderer but in order to rescue the other subject people arab greek jew who be still enclose within the frontier of the empire that the ally government in they answer to president wilson state that among they aim as belligerent be the ` liberation of the people who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of the turk ' there be define they irreducible demand : never again after peace return will the turk be allow to control the destiny of race not he own too long already -- and to they disgrace be it speak -- have the civilised and christian nation of europe tolerate at they very door a tyranny that have steadily grow more murderous and more monstrous because they fear the upset of the balance of power now at least such power as value national honor and regard a national promise as something more than a gabble of ink on a scrap of paper have resolve that they will suffer the tyranny of the turk over he alien subject people to continue no longer it be the least they can do -lrb- and unhappily the most -rrb- to redeem the century-long neglect of they duty even now as we shall see in a subsequent chapter the direst peril threaten those other people who at present groan under turkish rule and we can but pray that the end of the war will come before arab or greek or jew suffer the same fate as have exterminate the armenian too often have we be too late we must only hope that another item will not have to be add to that miserable list and that when the day of reckoning come no half-hearted and pusillanimous policy will stay we hand from the complete execution of that to which we stand pledge the balance of power have go the way of other rickety makeshift but there must be no makeshift in we dealings with the turk no compromise and no delay what shall be do with those who plan and execute the greatest massacre know to history matter little let they be hang as high as haman and have do with they but what do matter be that at no future time must it be in the power of a government that have never be other than barbaric and butcherous to do again as it have do before note on jemal the great jemal the great have very obligingly do what i suggest we might expect he to do and have kick against the german control of the syrian army general von falkenhayn be send to take supreme command and on June 28th of this year jemal the great refuse to receive order from he in consequence general von falkenhayn refuse responsibility for any offensive movement there if jemal remain in command this promise well for trouble between turk and german but we must not i be afraid build very high hope on it for germany have deal with the situation in a masterly manner jemal be already minister of marine as well as commander of the syrian army so the emperor ask he to pay another visit to berlin and he have be visit krupp 's work and german naval yard and we shall find probably that in the future he activity will be marine rather than military and that von falkenhayn will have a free hand in syrium but this will prove rather disappointing for jemal since it seem beyond mere coincidence that towards the end of August herr von kuhlmann the new german foreign minister induce the turkish government -lrb- while jemal be at berlin -rrb- to put they navy and they merchant fleet under the order of the german admiralty and already many turkish naval officer have be replace by german thus jemal will find himself deprive of he military command because the navy so urgently need he guide hand while he guide hand over the navy will be itself guide by the german admiralty in fact it look rather like checkmate for jemal the great and a end to the trouble he might have give the german control on the eve of he leave germany as yet unconscious probably of the subordination of the entire turkish fleet to the german admiralty he give a interview to a representative of the _ cologne gazette _ which deserve more than that ephemeral appearance it show jemal the great in a sort of hypnotic trance induce at potsdam ` the german fleet ' he say ` be simply spotless in its power and a model for all state which need a modern navy -- a model which can not be surpass ' he go for a cruise in a submarine which proceed ` so smoothly elegantly calmly and securely that i have the impression of cruise in a great steamship ' he be take to belgium and describe the ` idyllic life there ' : in the town ` the people go for walk all day long ' and in the country the peasant blithely gather in the harvest with the help of happy prisoner ' -lrb- he do not tell we where the harvest go to any more than the german tell we where the turkish harvest go to -rrb- he be take to general headquarters which he describe as ` majestic ' finally he be take into the presence of the all-highest and seem to have emerge in the condition in which mose come down from sinaus but one must not altogether despair of jemal the great it be still possible that on he return to constantinople when he find that he position as minister of marine be but a clerkship in the german admiralty the hypnotic trance begin to pass off and he ambition to re-assert themselves he may yet give trouble to the german if properly handle _ crescent and iron cross chapter iv _ the question of syrium and palestine it be impossible to leave this heart-rending tale of the suffering of the armenian people under the turk without some account of that devoted band of american missionary who with a heroism unsurpassed and perhaps unequalled so eagerly sacrifice themselves to the ravages of pestilence and starvation in order to alleviate the horror that descend on the people to whom they have be send often they be forcibly drive from the care of they flock often in the extermination of they flock there be none leave whom they could shepherd but wherever a remnant still linger there remain these dauntless and self-sacrificing man and woman regardless of everything except the cause to which they have devote themselves they reck nothing of the danger to which they expose themselves so long as there be a child or a woman or a man whom they could feed or nurse terrible as be the suffering through which the armenian pass they must have be infinitely more unbearable have it not be for these american missionary small as be the remnant that escape into the safety of persium or russian trans-caucasia they number must have be halve have it not be for the heroism of these man and woman while the german consul contented themselves with a few faint protest to they ambassador at constantinople follow by a acquiescence of silence the missionary constitute themselves into a red cross society of intrepid worker and as one well-qualified authority tell we ` suffer as many casualty from typhus and physical exhaustion as any proportionate body of worker on the european battlefield ' fully indeed do they live up to the mandate of the american board that send they out : ` you great business be with the fundamental doctrine and duty of the gospel ' at the opening of the european war the american mission have be at work for nearly a hundred year and be disseminate over anatolium and armenia they have open 163 protestant church and 450 school they establish hospital and in every possible way spread civilisation in a country where the spirit of the govern class be barbarism it be not they object to proselytise ` let the armenian remain a armenian if he will ' so run the instruction from which i have already quote ` the greek a greek the nestorian a nestorian the oriental a oriental ' and in the same wise and open-minded spirit they encourage native protestant church which be independent of they and largely self-supporting naturally in a country govern by monster like abdul hamid and enver pasha in later day they earn the enmity which be the tribute of barbarian to those who stand for civilisation and when owe to the extermination or flight of they armenian flock they be leave without a charge and they school be close we find a paean of self-congratulation go up from the turkish press inspire by the butcher of armenia but till the massacre and the flight be complete they give themselves to the ` duty of the gospel ' and they deed shine like a star into the blackness of that night of murder i will take as a example of the superb heroism of those man and woman the diary of a american lady attach to the mission at urmium a document that anonymously be one of the noblest least self-conscious record i have ever read the period of it extend over five month early in January 1915 the russian troops be withdraw from urmium which lie on the frontier between turkey and persium and simultaneously the moslem population begin to plunder the christian village the inhabitant of which flee for refuge to the mission in the city talaat 's official murder-scheme be not complete yet but the kurd together with the turk have plan a local massacre at geogtapa which be stop by the american doctor of this mission dr packard who at great personal risk obtain a interview with the kurdish chief and succeed in induce he to spare the life of the christian if they give up arm and ammunition and property the american flag be hoist over the mission building and before a week be out there be over ten thousand refugee house in the yard and room where they remain for five month the place of the dead be take by fresh influx the dining-room the sitting-room the church the school be all give over to these destitute people and from the begin fear of massacre as well as prevalence of disease haunt the camp it be impossible to move dead body outside they have to be bury in the throng yard and every day child be bear but here be the spirit that animated they protector ` we have just have a praise meeting ' record the diarist at the close of the first fortnight ` with fifty or sixty we could gather from the hall and room near and we feel more cheerful we think if paul and sila with they stripe could sing praise in prison so could we ' the week of which each day be a procession of hour too full of work to leave time for anxiety begin to enrol themselves into month and the hope of rescue by a russian advance make they heart sick so long be it defer refugee from neighbour village keep arrive and there be the constant problem before these devoted friend of they flock as to how to feed they all such be welcome and eager be the welcome they receive though every foot of space in the building and in the yard be occupy but somehow they manage to make room for all who come and for those villager who under threat of torture and massacre have apostatise there be but yearning and sorrow but never a word of blame or bitterness sometimes there be a visit of turkish troops to search for conceal russian and as we diarist remark ` we can not complain of the monotony of life for we never know what be go to happen next on Tuesday morning we have a wedding in my room here the boy and girl be simple villager the wedding be fix for the syrian new year but the kurd come and carry off wedding clothes and everything else in the house they all flee here and be marry in the old dirty garment they be wear when they run for they life they only present be a little tea and sugar that i tie up in a handkerchief and give to the bride ' the eternal feminine and the eternal human speak there and there for this gallantest of woman be two key that lock up the endless trouble and anxiety that cease not day or night but sometimes the flesh be weak and in the privacy of she diary she say ` how long o lord ' but for that there be the master-key that unlock all ward and a little further on we read ` one of the verse that help to keep my faith steady be he that spare not he own son for week we have have no word from the outside world but we rest in jehovah and wait patiently for he ' the condition inside the crowded yard grow steadily worse dysentery be rife and the death from it in that narrow space average thirty a day the state of the sufferer grow so terrible that it be difficult to get any one to look after they at all and many be lie in the open yard and the weather which hitherto have be warm get cold and snow fall it be with the greatest difficulty that food could be obtain for those in health and that of a kind utterly unsuitable to the sick while in the mind of they nurse be the bitter knowledge that with proper diet hundred of life could have be save and hundred of case of illness avoid for the dead there be but a small percentage of coffin available and ` the great mass be just drop into the great trench of rot humanity -lrb- in the yard -rrb- as i stand at my window i see one after another of the little body carry by and the condition of the living be more pitiful than that of the dead -- hungry ragged dirty sick cold wet swarm with vermin not for all the wealth of all the ruler of europe would i bear for one hour they responsibility for the suffering and misery of this one little corner of the world alone a helpless unarmed christian community turn over to the sword and the passion of islam ' on the top of this come a epidemic of typhoid twenty-seven case on the first day outside in the town the turkish consul begin hang christian and the missioner be allow to take the body and bury they there be threat that the mission would be enter and all young man -lrb- possible combatant -rrb- kill but this fear be not realize the typhoid increase and the doctor of the mission and other of the staff fall ill with it but the patience and service of the remainder never falter while the same spirit of uncomplaining suffering animated the refugee ` mr mcdowell ' so the diarist relate ` see a tired and weary woman with a baby in she arm sit in one of the seat and say to she where do you stay she say just here how long have you be here since the beginning -lrb- two month -rrb- she reply how do you sleep at night i lay the baby on the desk in front of I and i have this post at the back to lean against this be a very good place thank you very much ' in April there come a break in the diary after the day on which the follow entry be make : -- ' i feel on Sunday as if i ought to get my own burial clothes ready so as to make as little trouble as possible when my time come for in these day we all go about we work know that any one of we may be the next to go down and yet i think we friend would be surprise to see how cheerful we have keep and how many occasion we find for laughing : for ludicrous thing do happen then too after dwelling so intimately with death for three month he do not seem to have so unfriendly a aspect and the other side seem near and we pilot close beside we i find the rock on which i can anchor in peace be the word of christ himself : where i be there ye may be also that be enough to be where he be ' then come a break of two month during which the writer be down with typhoid she resume again in June finding that death have make many change and get back to work again at once by that time the russian have enter urmium a thanksgiving service be hold the refugee disperse and the american mission go quietly on with its normal work now i have take this one instance of the work of american at urmium to show in some detail the character of the work that they be do and the christian and humanising influence of it but all over armenia and anatolium be similar settlement and as already mention at the time of the massacre there be establish there over a hundred of they church and over four hundred school and from these extract which concern only one not very large center it may be gather what leaven of civilising influence the sum of they energy must have imply that lamp shine steady and clear a ` kindly light ' in the darkness of turkish misrule and in the havoc of the massacre a beacon of hope not always reach by those hapless refugee indeed it seem to have be only on the frontier that the mission be able to save those foredoom horde of flee christian in armenia and in anatolium generally the massacre and ` deportation ' be complete and by the end of 1915 all american mission be close for there be none to tend and care for even if the massacre have not occur the entry of america into the war would have result in a similar cessation of they work and most probably in a massacre of the american missioner themselves they withdrawal of course be hail with a peacock scream of pride by that enlighten body under talaat and enver call the new turkish party of progress for they presence be a bar to the turkish notion of civilisation in that they influence make for humanity and health and education now ` the humiliating and dangerous situation ' -lrb- to quote from the column of _ hilal _ -rrb- be put a end to and turkish progress could make headway again similarly in syrium the outbreak of war put a end to ` the humiliating and dangerous situation ' of the presence of french school and mission there for many year french missioner have do the same work as american in armenia work in every sense liberal and civilising but undenominational in religious matter and unproselytise that come to a end earlier than the organization in armenia and in syrium now as over the rest of the turkish people arab and jew and greek have nothing except german influence and kultur to stand between they and the spirit of turkish progress of which the armenian massacre be the latest epiphany germany as we have see stand by and let the armenian massacre go on profess herself unable to interfere in the internal affair of turkey though at the time there be not a single branch of turkish industry railway telegraph army navy over which she have not complete control exercise it precisely as she think fit it be useless then to base any confidence in the safety of jew greek and arab from suffer the same fate as the armenian on a veto from germany if it suit germany to let those unfortunate people be murder or deport to agricultural colony germany will assuredly not stir a finger on they behalf nor prevent a repetition of the horror i have deal with in the previous chapter sooner than risk she hold over turkey by enforce unacceptable demand she will unless other consideration of self-interest determine she let further massacre occur if talaat bey insist on they that spokesman of she policy ernst marré make this perfectly explicit in he book _ die türken und wir nach dem kriege _ uphold from the german standpoint the right of turkey and the wisdom of turkey in deal with she subject people as she have deal with the armenian ` the turkish state ' he tell we ` be no united whole : turk arab greek armenian kurd can not be weld together ' -lrb- this by a somewhat grim and ominous coincidence be in exact accordance with a remark make to a danish red cross sister by a turkish gendarme then engage in massacre armenian : ` first we get rid of the armenian ' he say ` then the greek then the kurd ' -rrb- or again in defense of the armenian massacre ` only by energetic interference and by expel of the obstinate armenian element could the ottoman empire get rid of a russian dominion ' or again ` the non-turkish population of the ottoman empire must be ottomanise ' here then be the german point of view : the ottoman government will be right to ` dispose of ' its subject people as it think fit so far from interfere germany endorse and german influence to-day be all that stand between ` the murderous tyranny ' and its subject people french english and finally american pressure can no longer since the entry of these nation into the war be exercise within the frontier of the ottoman empire and the only protection of defenceless alien be the german government it do not stir a finger to save the armenian until it see that depopulation threaten the prosperity of its industry and it be idle to expect that it will do more if the consolidation of turkish supremacy demand a further campaign of murder greek arab and jew be all completely at the mercy of talaat 's murder-schedule the only chance that can save they be that further extermination may not suit germany 's political aim and that she may find it worth she while to be peremptory and forbid instead of endorse there be unhappily many sign that the butcher of constantinople be plan further massacre in February of this year preliminary measure be begin against the greek settle in anatolium many be forcibly proselytise they property be confiscate and they be forbid to carry on they business deportation also occur and all greek be remove from many village in anatolium into the interior presumably to ` agricultural colony ' such as those provide for armenian they suffer terribly from hunger and exposure and it be estimate that ten per cent of they die on they march since then however there have be no more hear of any extension of those measure and there seem to have be as yet no massacre of greek it be reasonable to infer that germany have in this case intervene she still hope to win greece over to the central european power and clearly any massacre of greek by she own ally be not desirable king constantine among he endless vacillation and pusillanimous treachery probably make a firm protest on the subject but in the kaleidoscope of war should greece come to the side of the ally it seem most probable that there will occur a wholesale massacre of greek from what we know of the principle on which german kultur be base the most optimistic can scarcely hope that the very faintest remonstrance will emanate from berlin the case of the arab in syrium be even more precarious from the moment that the policy of the young turk be evolve namely to consolidate osmanli supremacy by the weakening of its subject people the ottoman government have be wait for its opportunity to get rid of the ` arab menace ' as we have see they begin by substitute turkish for arabic as a write language in all official usage from the printing of the koran and the prayer for the sultan down to the legend on railway ticket the arab spirit accord to one of the spokesman of the new turk party have to be suppress the arab land have to become turkish colony ` it be a peculiarly imperious necessity of we existence ' we read in jelal noury bey 's propaganda ` to turkise the arab land for the particularistic idea of nationality be awake among the younger generation of arab and already threaten we with a great catastrophe ' against the arab the young turk form and foster a special animosity they be powerful and warlike and enver talaat and other see that the idea of a osmanli supremacy could never be realize unless very drastic measure be take against they the tenet of islamism it be true forbid moslem to fight moslem but islamism as a binding force be already obsolete in the counsel of the new regime have give place to kultur of all they subject people the young turk hate the arab the most and have not the european war intervene there be no doubt that the armenian massacre already be plan would have be follow by arab massacre but the armed and warlike arabian tribe be not so easy to deal with as the defenceless armenian and turkish troops could not be spare in sufficient number to render a arab massacre the safe pleasant and lucrative pursuit that massacre should be but jemal the great black with he triumph over the armenian at zeitun be military governor of syrium and the armenian question be solve he begin to get to work on the arab question owe to the expulsion of the french mission from syrium in 1914 we have no such full or detailed information as we have from american in armenia and the follow account be mainly derive from the arabic journal _ mokattam _ publish in cairo the information in which be base on the account give by a syrian refugee it agree with piece of evidence that have come to hand from other source ever since the beginning of the war syrium have be a area of direst poverty starvation and sickness which have be the natural co-operator in jemal 's policy there all supplies have be commandeer for the troops -lrb- include by special clause from potsdam the german troops -rrb- even fish catch by the fisherman of lebanon have to be hand over to the military authority and the shortage of supplies in smyrna for instance be such that at the end of 1916 there be two hundred death daily from sheer starvation while germany be import from turkey hundred of ton of corn and of meat thus this be no natural shortage for though supplies be low all over the turkish empire there be not dearth of that kind it be a artificial shortage make possible by german demand and make intentional by jemal 's policy beirut be in no better case than smyrna lebanon perhaps be in sorer strait than either money be equally scarce and it fit jemal 's policy that this should be so for when american in beirut have raise fund in america for the relief of the destitute the turkish government forbid they distribution arab and greek be die by the hundred all over the province and the beneficent decree of nature must not be interfere with in the street of town the poor have be fight over scrap of sugarcane and orange peel in the country to quote from _ molcattam _ ` no sooner do wild plant and bean start to grow than the field be fill with woman and child who pick they and use they as food ' except for military purpose -lrb- include the victualling of german troops -rrb- transportation have cease to exist and this too be part of the policy of jemal the great on the heel of famine like a hound behind a huntsman come typhus in the province of aleppo before the summer of 1916 over 8000 person have die of it doctor and medicine be unobtainable for all be requisition for the need of the army and in damascus and tripolus in hama and hom the epidemic spread like a forest fire no help be send from constantinople none be permit to be bring by the charitable from abroad for famine and pestilence among the arab be work for the policy of jemal the great there be no troops to spare who should hasten on the work but the work be progress by swift and ` natural ' mean hunger and pestilence -- behold the finger of allah the god of love how superior he show himself to the discard allah of the arab ` ring down the curtain ' say jemal the great ` and let no news of the way of allah get abroad ' so a strict surveillance be establish on the coast all boat be chained to the shore and if any attempt to swim out to ship of the ally nation which pass the coast guard have order to shoot he down too much news about armenian massacre filter through there should not now be such leakage and when starvation and pestilence have firmly establish themselves jemal the great go down to see what he personal exertion could effect all be work in accordance with he plan the poorer class of arab be die like fly but mortality be not so successful among the wealthier who could to some extent purchase food so jemal the great set to work among they he begin by hang the head of syrian-arab in damascus beirut and other city no semblance of trial no prosecution or arraignment be necessary : he establish courts-martial under military control make list of the accuse and order the courts-martial to condemn they to death sometimes he make mistake appoint as the member of he court-martial man who be not such sturdy patriot as he and refuse to sentence for no crime the accuse whom he nominate he remedy such mistake by appoint new board of more seasoned stuff moslem and christian alike be bring before they and a general accusation of pro-french tendency seem to have be sufficient to secure a sentence of death or lifelong imprisonment he aim not at the poor and the obscure for whom hunger and pestilence be provide but at the rich and the influential the higher clergy in christian circle bishop and monsignor be a favorite target and among moslem influential sheikh sometimes there be a parody of a trial sometimes the parody be dispense with and when the black curtain be last raise over syrium jemal the great have dispose of over eight hundred of the head of the most influential of syrian arab he have get rid in fact of the whole house of lord and something more those who be acquaint with ` feudal value ' among the arab will understand what that mean he decapitate not individual only but group for devilish ingenuity in this combination of starvation and pestilence for the poor and death or lifelong imprisonment for the chief jemal the great must take rank with abdul hamid and the contriver of the armenian massacre he can not it be true owe to lack of troops obtain the swift result of enver in armenia but between typhus starvation and courts-martial he solution of the arab question in syrium be make steady progress and those measure hideously efficient in themselves be beyond any doubt whatever only the precursor of more sweeping extermination of the arab race which will be effect after the war if the ally power do not step in to save it the faithful of the holy city mecca have revolt and throw off the turkish yoke and while the war last and turkish troops be otherwise occupy under teutonic supervision they will be able to maintain they independence for there be no considerable body of turk which can seriously threaten they but the syrian arab so long as the war last be be and will be the victim of a quiet scheme of extermination which if long continue will be as complete as that devise and carry out by the butcher of constantinople for the people of armenia it be not in the interest of the german to save they and no check be be put on jemal the great to hinder he from assist starvation and typhus to ravage the country and supplement they deadly work by court-martial without trial equally significant of the rage for the destruction of arab be the treatment of the bagdad arab army corps in spite of the need for troops one half of it be send from bagdad to erzerum in the depth of winter without any provision of warm clothing there in those cold upland the man die at the rate of fifty to sixty a day they commanding officer be a turk and a creature of enver 's call abdul kader though these troops have fight admirably he openly call they arab traitor and he order seem to have be merely to get rid of they there be no courts-martial they be just take into a climate which kill they while for the last thirty year the armenian and syrian have emigrate in large number from the ottoman empire there have be a large immigration of jew into it this movement be originally due to the persecution they suffer in russium germany and austrium be close to they and fly from the hideous pogrom that threaten they with extermination they begin to settle in palestine wealthy compatriot such as baron edmond de rothschild assist they and with the amazing versatility of they race they trades-people and town-folk adapt themselves to new condition turn they wit towards husbandry and agriculture and during the last thirty year have flourish and multiply in a manner quite unrealised by the western world in 1881 there be not more than 25000 of they in the home of they race but by the beginning of the european war when they immigration cease for the present they number 120000 soul till then the ottoman government adopt the ancient turkish policy of neglect towards they for they be not powerful enough numerically to earn the honor of a massacre and in addition they be useful settler back by powerful western influence french english and german alike they improve out of knowledge the value of the land where they establish themselves and by intelligent management by conserve and increase the water supply with irrigation and well-digging they have bring many thousand acre into cultivation originally refugee flee from outrageous persecution they immigration by degree take on a different spirit not only be they come out of captivity but they be enter into the ancient land of promise again zionism the spirit of the return exile animated they and accord to they prophet they realize that ` the lord shall comfort zion he shall comfort all she waste place ' they have sow in tear now on they return they be reap in joy and though they land be still under the infidel yoke they be allow to dwell in peace busy industrious with the halo of home-coming in they heart they pay of course they turkish tax but these be not levy in any oppressive manner and they colony be thrifty self-governing and prosperous already before the war one-tenth of the cultivate land in palestine be in they hand they have they own school they own method of organization and more significant than all hebrew become a living language again germany intent on she penetration of turkey make a attempt to germanise they also -lrb- for germany as we shall see have a very special interest in these jewish colony -rrb- shake she head over zionism for which she try to substitute prussianism and want to make the german language compulsory in jewish school at haifa and jaffa but she effort completely fail nothing could show the inherent vitality of this jewish colonisation more strikingly these jewish settler then be leave in peace from minuteness they escape the notice of the young turk party in its scheme for the complete ottomanisation of the empire and until the present year 1917 no mention of ` the jewish question ' be propound but it will he remember that in 1915 certain jewish refugee take warning from the armenian massacre flee to egypt and there found a zionist mule-corps which serve under the english in the gallipolus campaign it seem very probable that it be this that direct the attention of jemal the great to the jewish colony in palestine : possibly it be merely that he be a more thorough ottomaniser than he colleague in constantinople in any case he order the ` deportation ' of all jew from jaffa gaza and other agricultural district all jew be command to leave jaffa within forty-eight hour no means of transport be give they and they be forbid to take with they either provision or any of they belongings eight thousand jew be evict from jaffa alone and they house be pillage and they rob maltreat and many be murder thus and in no other way have the massacre of the armenian begin and that there should be no mistake about it jemal threaten they explicitly with the fate of the armenian next day ludd be evacuate also the evacuation of haifa and jerusalem be threaten and artillery be send to jerusalem there can be no doubt in fact that jemal plan and begin to carry out a massacre of all jew at that point the german intervene and for the present -lrb- but only for the present for so long in fact as germany have complete control over all turkish internal affair in which she protest she could not meddle -rrb- the jewish colony in palestine seem to be safe -lrb- 1 -rrb- the german chief of the general staff telegraph to berlin that the ` military consideration ' on which jemal base he deportation do not exist and herr cohn in the reichstag draw the imperial chancellor 's attention to this how seriously the menace be regard in germany and how far the deportation have go may be gather from he word ` be the imperial chancellor prepare to influence the turkish government in such a manner as to prevent with certainty -- so far as this be still possible -- a repetition in palestine of the armenian atrocity ' this be sufficient : germany who could not dream of interfere in turkish internal affair when only the massacre of hundred of thousand of armenian be concerned send she order and for the present jemal the great have be unable to proceed with the solution of the jewish question in turkey which he have just discover we need not yet in fact give jemal he jew but some sort of explanation to soothe the exasperation of the turk in not be allow to murder when and how and where they please be think advisable and the explanation -lrb- a extraordinarily significant one -rrb- be give in a inspired paragraph of the _ frankfurter zeitung _ not long after ` the valuable structure of zionist cultural work in which the german empire must have well found interest in view of future and very promising trade relation will it be very much to be hope be preserve from destruction so far as purely military requirement do not make it necessary pan-turkish ideal have no sort of meaning in palestine where practically no turk dwell ' -lrb- footnote 1 : this view seem to be bear out by subsequent event for the jew evacuate from jaffa have be permit to return owe to the intervention of the spanish government it be not hard to guess who prompt that -rrb- we may take it then that with regard to the project jewish massacre quite clearly foreshadow by the scheme of deportation from jaffa and gaza germany have make strong representation to the ottoman government she do not do so -lrb- indeed she officially refuse to do so -rrb- when the armenian massacre begin for she could not interfere in turkey 's internal affair but now she have discover that pan-turkish ideal have no sort of meaning in palestine and thus with amazing astuteness have provide herself with a reason for interfere while still not give up the policy of non-interference in turkish affair for turkey she have discover _ have _ no affair in palestine at the same time she guard herself from diplomatic defeat by the hope that zionist cultural work will be save from destruction so _ far as purely military requirement do not make it necessary _ in other word suppose jemal the great get completely out of hand and proceed to indiscriminate massacre of the jew germany would doubtless accept he plea that military requirement have make it necessary and we be once so ignorant as to assure ourselves that germany have no notion of diplomacy the full significance of she intervention on behalf of the jew when neither the extermination of the armenian the persecution of the arab nor the deportation of the greek move germany to any decide action or energetic protest must be leave in so far as it concern the future to another chapter but as regard the present and the past it will be useful to consider here what have prompt she to make a protest -lrb- which we may regard so long as she foot be on the neck of the turk as have be successful -rrb- against these project massacre certainly it be not humanity it be not the faintest desire to save innocent people in general from be murder wholesale for in the similar case of the armenian she bowels of compassion be not move or possibly if we incline to lenience we may say that she be sorry for the armenian but could not then risk a disagreement with they murderer who be she ally whereas now feel herself more completely dominant over the turk than she then do she could risk be peremptory especially since there be that save clause about military requirement for during the armenian massacre the dardanelle expedition be still on the shore of gallipolus and the menace to constantinople acute it be possible that if she oppose a firm front to the armenian massacre the turk already on the verge of despair with regard to save the capital from capture might have make term with the ally but now no such imminence of danger threaten they and with germany 's domination over they vastly more secure than it have be in 1915 she could afford to treat they less as ally and more as a conquered people this alone might have account for she unprecedented impulse of humanity in the mind of those who still attribute such instinct to she but she have far stronger reason than that for want to save the jew of palestine she policy with regard to they be set forth in a pamphlet by dr davi treitsch call _ die jüden der türkei _ publish in 1915 which be a most illuminating little document these jewish colony as we have see come from russium and as germany realize long before the war they might easily form a german nucleus in the near east for they largely consist of german-speaking jew akin in language and blood to a most important element in she own population ` in a certain sense ' say dr treitsch ` the jew be a near eastern element in germany and a german element in turkey ' he go on with unerring acumen to lament the exodus of german-speaking jew to the united state and to england ` annually some 100000 of these be lose to germany the empire of the english language and the economic system that go with it be be enlarged while a german asset be be proportionately depreciate it will no longer do simply to close the german frontier to they and in view of the difficulty which would result from a wholesale migration of jew into germany itself german will only be too glad to find a way out in the emigration of those jew to turkey -- a solution extraordinarily favourable to the interest of all three party concern ' here then be the matter in a nutshell : germany wide-awake as ever see long ago the advantage to she of a grow jewish population from the pale in turkey she be perhaps a little overloaded with they herself but in this immigration from russium to palestine she see the formation of a colony that be well worth german protection and the result of the war provide the palestinian immigrant be leave in peace would be to augment very largely the number of those settle there ` galicia ' say dr treitsch ` and the western province of russium which between they contain more than half the jew in the world have suffer more from the war than any other region jewish home have be break up by hundred of thousand and there be no doubt whatever that as a result of the war there will be a emigration of east european jew on a unprecedented scale ' this emigration then to palestine be in germany 's view a counter-weight to the 100000 annually lose to she through emigration to america and england with she foot on turkey 's neck she have control over these german-speaking jew and see in they the element of a german colony she calculation it be true be somewhat upset by the development of the zionist movement by which those settler declare themselves to have a nationality of they own and a language of they own and dr treitsch concede that ` but ' he add ` in addition to hebrew to which they be more and more inclined the jew must have a world-language and this can only be german ' this then in brief and only up to the present be the story of how the jewish massacre be stay the jew be potential german and germany who sit by with fold hand when arab and armenian be lead to torture and death put up a warning finger and for the present save they in she whole conduct of the war nothing have be more characteristic than she ` verboten ' to one project massacre and she acquiescence in other but as for she have save the jew out of motive of humanity ` credant judaeus ' _ crescent and iron cross chapter v _ deutschland über allah it be commonly say at the beginning of this war that whatever germany 's military resource might be she be hopelessly and childishly lack in diplomatic ability and in knowledge of psychology from which all success in diplomacy be distil as instance of this grave defect people adduce the fact that apparently she have not anticipate the entry of great britain into the war at all while she treatment of belgium immediately afterwards be universally pronounced to be not a crime merely but a blunder of the stupidest sort it be perfectly true that germany do not understand and as seem likely in the light of innumerable other atrocity never will understand the psychology of civilised people she have never show any sign up till now at any rate of ` have get the hang of it ' at all but critic of she diplomacy fail to see the root-fact that she do not understand it merely because it do not interest she it be not worth she while to master the psychology of other civilised nation since she be out not to understand they but to conquer they she have all the information she want about they army and navy and gun and ammunition neatly and correctly tabulate why then since this be all that concern she should she cram she head with irrelevant information about what they might feel on the subject of gas-attack or the torpedoing of neutral ship without warn as long as she fume be deadly and she submarine subtle nothing further concerned she but europe generally make a great mistake in suppose that germany could not learn psychology and the process of its distillation into diplomacy when it interested she the psychology of the french and english be a useless study for she be merely go to fight they but for year she have be study with a industry and a patience that put we diplomacy to shame -lrb- as be most swiftly and ignominiously prove when it come into conflict with hers -rrb- the psychology of the turk for year she have watch the dealings of the great power with turkey but she have never really associate herself with that policy she sit quietly by and see how it work briefly it be this for a hundred year turkey have be keep alive in europe by the sedulous attention of the physician power who dare not let he die for fear of the stupendous quarrel which would instantly arise over he corpse so there they all sit round he bed and keep he alive with injection of strychnine and oxygen and no less by a policy of rousing and irritate the patient all through the reign of abdul hamid they persevere : great britain pluck he pillow from he so to speak by she protectorate of egypt russium tweak eastern rumelium from he france deprive he of he hot-water bottle when she snatch at the constantinople quay and they all shake and slap he when he go to war with greece in 1896 and instantly deprive he of the territory he have win in thessaly that be the principle of european diplomacy towards turkey and from it germany always hold aloof but from about the beginning of the reign of the present german emperor german or rather prussian diplomacy have be go quietly about its work it be worth while to study the psychology of the turk because dimly then but with ever-increasing distinctness germany foresee that turkey might be a counter of immense importance in the great conflict which be assuredly draw nearer though as yet its existence be but foreshadow by the most distant reflection of summer lightning on a serene horizon but if turkey be to be of any profit to she she want a strong turkey who could fight with she -lrb- or rather for she -rrb- and she have no use for the sick man whom the other power be bent on keep alive but no more she own eventual domination of turkey be always the end in view but she want to dominate not a weak but a strong servant and she diplomacy be not less than brilliant simply from the fact that on the one hand it soothe turkey instead of irritating and on the other that it go absolutely unnoticed for a long time nobody know that it be go on she send officer to train the turkish army well know what magnificent material anatolium afford and she have thoroughly grasp the salient fact that to make any way with oriental people you purse must be open and you backshish unlimited ` there be no god but backshish and the deutsche bank be he prophet ' for year this go on very quietly and all over the great field of the ottoman empire the first tiny blade of the crop that germany be sowing begin to appear to-day that crop wave high and cover the whole field with its ripe and fruitful ear for to-day turkey be neither more nor less than a german colony and more than make up to she for the colony she have lose and hope to regain she know that perfectly well and so do any who have at all study the history and the result of she diplomacy there even turkey itself must as in a uneasy dream be faintly conscious of it for who to-day be the sultan of turkey no other than william ii of germany it be in berlin that he cabinet meet and sometimes he ask talaat bey to attend in a strictly honorary capacity and talaat bey go back to constantinople with a strictly honorary sword of honor or else he give one to william ii from he _ soi-disant _ master the sultan or take one back to he _ soi-disant _ master from he real master for no one know better than william ii the use that sword of honor play in deed of dishonor the object of this chapter be to trace and mount the hew and solid staircase of step by which germany 's present supremacy over turkey be achieve apart from the quiet spade-work that have be go on for some year germany make no important move till the moment when in 1909 the young turk party after the force abdication of abdul hamid proclaim the aim and ideal of the new regime at once germany see she opportunity for here with she help might arise the strong turkey which she desire to see instead of the weak turkey which all the other european power have be keep on a lower diet for so long -lrb- desirous only that it should not quite expire -rrb- and from that moment she begin to lend or rather let to turkey in ever-increasing quantity the resource of she scientific and she military knowledge it be in she interest if turkey be to be of use to she that she should educate and irrigate and develop the unexploited treasure of human material of fertility and mineral wealth and germany 's gold she school she laboratory be at turkey 's disposal but in every case she as in duty bind to she people see that she get very good value for she outlay here then be the great psychological moment when germany instantly move the young turk proclaim that they be go to weld the ottoman empire into one homogeneous and harmonious whole and by a piece of brilliant paradoxical reasoning germany determine that it be she who be go to do it for they in flat contradiction of the spirit of they manifesto which proclaim the pan-turkish ideal she conceive and begin to carry out under they very nose the great new chapter of the pan-germanic ideal and the young turk do not know the difference they mistake that lusty teutonic changele for they own new-born turkish babe and they nurse and nourish it amazingly it throve and soon it cut its tooth and one day when they think it be asleep it arise from its cradle a baby no more but a great prussian guardsman who shout ` deutschland über allah ' only once be there a check in the growth of the prussian infant and that be no more than a childish ailment for when the balkan war break out the turkish army be in the transitional stage its german tutor have not yet have time to inspire the army with german discipline and tradition they have only weed out so to speak the old turkish spirit the blind obedience to the minister of the shadow of god the shadow of god in fact in the person of the sultan have be drag out into the light and he shadow have grow appreciably less in consequence there be not at this juncture any cohesion in the army and it suffer reverse after reverse but a strong though a curtail turkey be more in accordance with prussian idea than a weak and sprawl one and germany bear the turkish defeat very valiantly and that be the only set-back that this pan-prussian youngster experience and it be no more than a attack of german measles which he very quickly get over for two or three year german influence waver then recover ` with blessing on the fall out that all the more endear ' it be interesting to see how germany adapt the pan-turkish ideal to she own end and by a triumphant vindication of germany 's method the best account of this pan-turkish ideal be to be find in a publication of 1915 by tekin alp which be write as german propaganda and by germany disseminate broadcast over the turkish empire a account of this movement have already be give in chapter ii as far as the turkish side of it be concerned and it remain only to enumerate the german contribution to the fledging of this new turkish phoenix the turkish language and the turkish allah god of love in whose name the armenian be tortured and massacre be the two wing on which it be to soar auxiliary soar society be organise among they a turkish ojagha with similar aim and no fewer than sixteen branch of it be found throughout the empire there be also a turkish guijus or gymnastic club and a izjus or boy scout ' club a union of merchant work for the same object in district where hitherto trade have be in the hand of greek and armenian and sign appear on they shop that only turkish labor be employ religious fund also be use for similar economic restoration germany see germany tabulated germany lick she lip and take out she long spoon for she hour be come she do not interfere : she only help to further the pan-turkish ideal with she usual foresight she perceive that the izjus for instance be a thing to encourage for the boy who be be train now would in a few year be precisely the young man of whom she could not have too many by all mean the boy scout movement be to be encourage she encourage it so generously and methodically that in 1916 accord to a absolutely reliable source of information we find that the whole boy scout movement with its innumerable branch be under the control of a german officer colonel von hoff in its class -lrb- dernek -rrb- boy be train in military practice in ' a recreational manner ' so that they enjoy -- positively enjoy -lrb- a prussian touch -rrb- -- the exercise that will fit they to be of use to the sultan william ii they learn trigger-drill they learn skirmish they be teach to make report on the movement of they company they be show neat way of judge distance they be divide into two class the junior class range from the age of twelve to seventeen the senior class consist of boy over seventeen but not yet of military age but since colonel von hoff organise this the military age have be extend and boy of seventeen have get to serve they country on german front prussian thoroughness therefore see that they training must begin earlier the old junior class have become the senior class and a new junior class have be set on foot which begin its recreational exercise in the service of william ii get and allah at the age of eight it be all great fun but those pigeon-livered little boy who be not divert by it have to go on with they fun all the same for needless to say the izjus be compulsory on all boy of course they wear a uniform which be make in germany and be of a ` semi-military ' character the provision of soldier and sailor then train from the early age of eight be the first object of germany 's peaceful and benign penetration as from the pisgah height of the pan-turkish ideal she see the promised land but she have no idea of see it only like mose and expire without enter it and she faith that she would enter it and possess it and organise it have be wonderfully justified she have not only penetrate but have dominate a year ago town like aleppo be cram with german officer while at islahie there be separate wooden barracks for the exclusive use of german troops there be a military mission at mamoura where all the building be permanent erection solidly build of stone for no merely temporary occupation be intend and thousand of freight-car with belgian mark upon they throng the railway and on some be the significant german title of ` military headquarters of the imperial staff ' there be troops in the turkish army to which be give the title of ` pasha formation ' in compliment to turkey but the pasha formation be under command of baron kress von kressenstein and be salt with german officer nco 's and private who although in the turkish army retain they german uniform this german leaven form a instructional class for the remainder of the troops in these formation who be turkish the german be urge to respect moslem custom and to show particular consideration for they religious observance every german contingent arrive at constantinople to join the pasha formation find quarter prepare on a ship and when the troops leave for they ` destination ' they take supplies from depot at the railway station which will last they two or three month they be enjoin to write war diary and be provide with handbook on the military and geographical condition in mesopotamium with map and with note on the training and management of camel this look as if they be intend for use against the english troops in mesopotamium but i can not find that they have be identify there the greatest secrecy be observe with regard to those pasha formation and they constitution and movement be keep extremely well veil wireless station have be set up in asia minor and palestine and these be under the command of major schlee a turkish air-service be institute at the head of which be major serno a prussian officer and turkish aviator be now in training at ostend where they will very usefully defend they native country at constantinople there be a naval school for turkish engineer and mechanic in the arsenal to help on the pan-turkish ideal and with a view to that all the instructor be german : a float dock be in construction at ismid and the order have be place with german firm it will be capable of accommodate ship of dreadnought build which be a new departure for the strictly pan-turkish ideal the cost be # 740000 to be repay three year after the end of the war similarly by the spring of this year germany have arrange to start submarine training in constantinople for the turk and a submarine school be open and at work in march a few month later it be establish at the island of prinkipo where it be now hard at work under german instructor other naval cadet be send to germany for they training and turkish officer be present at the battle of jutland in June 1916 and of course be decorate by the emperor in person for they coolness and courage -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : in October 1917 a bill be pass for the entire remodelling of the turkish fleet after the war on the line of the german fleet ` which prove its perfect training in the battle of skager rak ' -rrb- a complete revision of the turkish system of exemption from military service be necessary as soon as germany begin to want man badly the age for military service be first raise and we find a turkish order of October 1916 call on all man of forty-three forty-four and forty-five year of age to pay they exemption tax if they do not wish to be call to the color that secure they money and with truly prussian irony hardly have this be do when a fresh army order be issue call out all man whether they have pay they exemption tax or not germany thus secure both they money and they life still more man be need and in November a fresh levy of boy be raise regardless of whether they have reach the military age or not this absorb the senior class of the boy scout who hitherto have learn they drill in a ` recreationary manner ' neither jew nor christian be exempt from service and frequent press gang go round constantinople round up those who be in hide again the prussian moloch be hungry for more and in December 1916 the turkish _ gazette _ announce that all male in asia minor between the age of fourteen and sixty-five be to be enrol for military service and in January of this year 1917 fresh recruiting be foreshadow by the order that man of forty-six to fifty-two who have pay they exemption money should be medically examine to see if they be fit for active service this fresh recruiting be also put in force in the case of boy and during the summer of 1917 all boy above the age of twelve provide they be sound and well-built be take for the army wider and wider the net be spread and in the same month a fresh turco-german convention be sign whereby be enforce a reciprocal surrender in both country of person liable to military service and of deserter and simultaneously all turk live in switzerland and who have pay exemption money be recall to they germanised fatherland by now the first crop of the year be ripen in smyrna and in default of civilian labor -lrb- for every one be now a soldier -rrb- they be reap by turkish soldier and the produce send direct to germany already in August 1916 certificate of ottoman nationality have be grant to serbian resident in the empire who be willing to become ottoman subject and they ` willingness ' be intensify by hint that incident akin to the armenian massacre might possibly occur among other alien people they have to sign a declaration that they would not revert to they former nationality and thus no doubt many serb pass into the turkish army further enrolment be desirable and in march 1917 all greek live in anatolium be forcibly proselytise they property be confiscate and they be make liable to military service unfortunately all be not available for of those who be remove from the village where they live to military centre ten per cent die on the force march from hunger and exposure that be annoy for the german recruit agent but it suit well enough the pan-turkish ideal of exterminate foreign nationality when trouble or discontent occur among the troops it be firmly deal with as for instance when in November 1916 there be considerable desertion from the 49th division on that occasion the order be give to fire on they and many be kill and wound the officer who give the order be commend by the prussian authority for he firmness should such a incident occur again it will no doubt be deal with no less firmness for in April 1917 mackensen be put in supreme command of all troops in asia minor but in spite of this desertion have largely increase lately and during the summer deserter out of all the turkish army be believe to number about 200000 many of those have form themselves into brigand band who make the road dangerous for traveller the exchange of honor go on for not long ago in berlin prince zia-ed-din the turkish sultan 's heir present a sword of honor to the sultan william ii probably he give he good news of the progress of the german harbor work begin in the winter at stamboul and himself learn that the railway bridge which the turk propose to build over the bosporus be not to be proceed with for the german high command have supersede that scheme by they own idea of make a tunnel under the bosporus instead which would be safer from aircraft such up-to-date though in brief outline be the history of the establishment of the prussian octopus grip on military and naval matter in turkey we have largely ourselves to blame for it upon that pathetic and lamb-like record of we diplomacy during the month between the outbreak of the european war and the entry of turkey into it in October 1914 it would be morbid to dwell at any length though a short summary be necessary as we all know now turkey have conclude a treaty with germany early in August and when we ambassador in constantinople sir loui malet who be on leave in england at that date return to he post on August 16th all that turkey want be to gain time in which to effect she mobilisation this she do with complete success and we ambassador telegraph to england state he perfect confidence in the sincerity with which the grand vizier profess he friendship for england all through those week of August and September this confidence appear to continue unabated the moderate party in turkey -- that be to say the hoodwink party -- be report to be daily gain strength and it be most important that the ally should give they every assistance and above all not precipitate matter all be go well : all we have to do be to wait so we wait still blindly confident in the sincerity of turkey 's friendship for england while the mobilisation of the turkish force proceed merrily by the end of September this be nearly complete and quite suddenly the ambassador inform the foreign office that turkey appear to be temporise that be perfectly true but the period of temporisation be nearly over and by mid-october turkey have something like 800000 man under arm and for nine week enver pasha have have he sign treaty with germany in he pocket possibly this diplomatic procrastination be useful to we for it enable we to bring troops from indium in security and send other to egypt but without doubt it be useful to the turk for it enable they to mobilise they army and to strengthen enormously the defence of the dardanelle then come the day when germany and turkey be ready the attack be make on odessa and out of constantinople we go we climb into the railway carriage that take the last ray of english influence out of the ottoman empire and steep be the stair in the house of a stranger turk be not much give to laughter but enver pasha must at least have smile on that day already of course german influence be strong in the army which now be thoroughly train in german method but that army might still be call a turkish army nowadays by no stretch of language can it be call turkish except in so far that all turkish efficient manhood be helplessly enlist in it for there be no branch or department of it over which the prussian octopus have not throw its paralysing tentacle and affix its immovable sucker army and navy alike the wireless station the submarine the aircraft be all directly control from berlin and as we have see the generalissimo of the force be mackensen who be absolutely the hindenburg of the east but thorough as be the control of berlin over constantinople in military and naval matter it be not one whit more thorough than she control in all other matter of national life never before have germany be very successful in she colonisation but if complete domination -- the sucking of a country till it be a mere rind of itself and yet at the same time full to burst of prussian ichor -- may be take as germany 's equivalent of colonisation then indeed we must be force to recognize she success and it be all do in the name and for the sake of the pan-turkish ideal even now prussian pecksniff like herr ernst marré whose pamphlet _ die türken und wir nach dem kriege _ be publish in 1916 continue to insist that germany be nobly devote herself to the well-being of turkey ` in do this ' he exclaim in that illuminating document ` we be benefit turkey this be a war of liberation for turkey ' though omit to say from whom turkey be be liberate perhaps the armenian occasionally it be true he forget that and naively remark ` turkey be a very difficult country to govern but after the war turkey will be very important as a transit country ' but then he remember again and say ` we wish to give besides take and we should often like to give more than we can hope to give ' let we look into this and see the manner in which germany express she yearning to impoverish herself for the sake of turkey all this reorganisation of the turkish army be of course a very expensive affair and require skilful financing and it be necessary to get the whole of turkey 's exchequer arrangement into german hand a series of financial regulation be promulgate the finance minister during 1916 be still turkish but the official immediately under he be a german he be authorise to deposit with the controller of the ottoman national debt german imperial bill of # t30000000 and to issue german paper money to the like amount this arrangement insure the circulation of the german note which be redeemable by turkey in _ gold _ two year after the declaration of peace gold be declare to be the standard currency and no creditor be oblige to accept in payment of a debt more than 300 piastre in silver or fifty in nickel and since there be no gold in currency -lrb- for it have be all call in and penalty of death have be authorise for hoarder -rrb- it follow that this and other issue of german paper will filter right through the empire at the same time a german expert dr kautz be appoint to start bank throughout turkey in order to free the peasant from the turkish village usurer and in consequence enslave they to the german bank similarly a german be put at the head of the ottoman agricultural bank these new branch work very well but it be pleasant to think that one such be start by the deutsche bank at bagdad in October 1916 which now have its shutter up before this as we learn from the _ oesterreichischer volkswirt _ -lrb- June 1916 -rrb- germany have issue other gold note in payment for gold from turkey which be retainable in berlin till six month after the end of the war -lrb- it be reasonable to wonder whether it will not be retain rather longer than that -rrb- these gold note be accept willingly at first by the public but the increase in they number -lrb- by the second issue -rrb- have cause they to be view with justifiable suspicion and the depreciation in they continue but the turkish public have no redress except by hoard gold which be a penal offence that these arrangement have not particularly help turkish credit may be gather from the fact that the turkish gold # 1 nominally 100 piastre be very soon worth 280 piastre in the german paper standard and it now fetch a great deal more again the deutsche orientbank have make many extension and be already finance cotton and wool trade for after the war the establishment of this provoke much applause in german financial circle who find it to be a instance of the ` far-reaching and powerful germano-austrian unity which replace the disunion of turkish finance ' this be profoundly true especially if we omit the word ` austrian ' insert for diplomatic reason again we find germany advance # 3000000 of german paper to the turkish government in January 1917 for the payment of supplies they have receive from krupp 's work and -lrb- vaguely -rrb- for interest to the german financial minister this too we may conjecture be to be redeem after the war in gold in march of this year we find in the report of the ottoman bank a german loan of # 1000000 for the purchase of agricultural implement by turkey and this be guarantee by house-tax in all up to that month as be announce in the chamber of deputy at constantinople germany have advance to turkey the sum of # 142000000 entirely it would seem in german paper to be repay at various date in gold the grip in fact be a strangle-hold all for turkey 's good as no doubt will prove the ` new convention ' announce by zimmermann in may 1917 to take the place of the abolish capitulation ` which leave turkey at the mercy of predatory power who look for the disruption of the ottoman empire ' herr zimmermann do not look for that : he look for its absorption and see it the industrial development of turkey by this benevolent and disinterested power have be equally thorough and far-reaching though germany here have have a certain amount of competition by hungary to contend against for hungary consider that germany be trespassing on she sphere of interest but she have be able to make no appreciable headway against she more acute partner and she application for a monopoly of sugar-production be not favourably receive for germany already have take the beet industry well in hand in asia minor the acreage of cultivation early in 1917 have fall more than 50 per cent from that under crop before the war but owe to the importation of machinery from the central power back up by a compulsory agricultural service law which have just be pass it be hope that the acreage will be increase this year by something like 30 per cent the yield per acre also will be greatly increase this year for germany have though need artificial manure badly herself send large quantity into turkey where they will be more profitably employ she have no fear about secure the produce this augmented yield will it be true not be adequate to supply the need of turkey who for the last two year have suffer from very acute food shortage which in certain district have amount to famine and wholesale starvation of the poorer class but it be unlikely that they need will be consider at all for germany 's need -lrb- she the fairy godmother of the pan-turk ideal -rrb- must obviously have the first call on such provision as be obtainable thus in the new preserved meat factory at aidin the whole of the produce be send to germany thus too though in February 1917 there be a daily shortage in smyrna of 700 sack of flour and the arab and greek population be starve no flour at all be allow to be import into smyrna but simultaneously germany be make huge purchase of fish meat and flour in constantinople -lrb- pay for in german paper -rrb- include 100000 sheep yet such be the villainous selfishness of the famine-stricken folk at adrianople that when the train contain these supplies be pass through a mob hold they up and sell the contents to the inhabitant that however be a isolate instance and in any case a law be pass in October 1916 appoint a military commission to control all supplies it enact that troops shall be supply first and specially ordain that the requirement of german troops come under this head -lrb- private firm have be expressly prohibit from purchase these augmented wheat supplies but special permission be give in 1915 to german and austro-hungarian society to buy -rrb- a few month later we find that there be a hundred death daily in constantinople from starvation and two hundred in smyrna where there be a complete shortage of oil but oil be still be send to germany and during 1916 five hundred reservoir of oil be send there each contain up to 15000 kilogramme similarly during this summer the price of fruit have go up in smyrna for the german have reopen certain factory for preserve it and turn it into jam which be be send to germany the sugar be supply from the new beet-field of konium but kultur must be supply first else kultur would grow lean and the turkish god of love will look after the smyrniote it be no wonder that the blockade of germany do not produce the desire result a little quicker for food be already pour in from turkey and when the artificial manure have produce they early harvest the stream will become a torrent -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the harvest have now come in and be most abundant -rrb- but during all these busy and tremendous month of war germany have not only be denude turkey of she food supplies for the sake of the pan-turkish ideal in the same altruistic spirit she have be vastly increase the productiveness of she new and most important colony the great irrigation work at konium begin several year ago be in operation and the revenue of the irrigated village have be double in fact as the report lately issue say ' a new and fertile province have be form by the aid of german energy and knowledge ' at adana be similar irrigation work finance by the deutsche bank ernst marré give we a most hopeful survey of they for adana be already link up with the bagdad railway in October 1916 which be to be the great artery connect germany with the east there be some considerable shortage of labor there -lrb- owe in part to the armenian massacre to which we shall revert presently -rrb- but the financial arrangement be in excellent shape the whole of the irrigation work be in german hand and have be pay for by german paper and to get the reservoir etc back into she own control it have be agree that turkey already completely bankrupt will have to pay not only what have be spend but a handsome sum in compensation while as regard shortage of labor prisoner have be release in large number to work without pay this irrigation scheme at adana will increase the cotton yield by four time the present crop so we learn from the weekly arab magazine _ el alem el ismali _ which tell we also of the electric-power station erect there the same paper -lrb- October 1916 -rrb- announce to the anatolian merchant that transport be now easy owe to the arrival of engine and truck from germany while _ die zeit _ -lrb- February 1917 -rrb- prophesy a prosperous future for this germano-turkish cotton combine hitherto turkey have largely import cotton from england now turkey -- thanks to german capital on term above state -- will in the process of internal development so unselfishly devise for she by germany grow cotton for herself and be kind enough to give a preferential tariff to germany a similarly bright future may be predict for the sugar-beet industry at konium where be the irrigation work already refer to artesian well have be sink and there be the suggestion to introduce bulgarian labor in default of turkish as we have see hungary attempt to obtain a monopoly with regard to sugar but germany have be victorious on this point -lrb- as on every other where she compete with hungary -rrb- and have obtain the concession for a period of thirty year she reap the first-fruit this last spring -lrb- 1917 -rrb- when on a single occasion 350 truck laden with sugar be despatch to berlin a similar irrigation scheme be bring into cultivation the makischelin valley near aleppo and herr wie have be appoint as expert for irrigation plant in syrium there have be considerable shortage of coal but now more be arrive from the black sea and the new coal-field at rodosto will soon be give a output indeed it would be easier to enumerate the industry and economical development of turkey over which germany have not at the present moment get the control than those over which she have in particular she have show a parental interest in turkish educational question she establish last year under german management a school for the study of german in constantinople she have put under the protection of the german government the jewish institution at haifa for technical education in palestine from siva a mission of schoolmaster have be send to germany for the study of german method ernst marré surmise that german will doubtless become compulsory even in the turkish intermediate -lrb- secondary -rrb- school in April 1917 the first stone of the ` house of friendship ' be lay at constantinople the object of which institution be to create among turkish student a interest in everything german while earlier in the year arrangement be make for 10000 turkish youth to go to germany to be teach trade these i imagine be unfit for military service with regard to such a scheme halil hale bey praise the arrangement for the

this script be needless the hand be the hand of halil hale bey but the voice be the voice of potsdam occasionally but rarely austrian competition be see professor schmoller in a austrian quarterly review show jealousy of german influence and we find in October 1916 a ottoman-austrian college start at vienna for 250 pupil of the ottoman empire but germany have 10000 in berlin at adana -lrb-

of nation with special reference to turkey and the parallel case of germany a few month later we find hilmet nazim bey official head of the turkish press proceed to berlin to learn german press method a number of editor of turkish papers will follow he and soon no doubt the turkish press will rival cologne and frankfort so much for german education but she penetrative power extend into every branch of industry and economics in November 1916 a munich expert be put in charge of the college of forestry and a economic society be start in constantinople on german line with german instructor

treaty sign January 11 1917 give the whole reorganisation of the economic system to a special german mission a stuttgart journal chant a characteristic _ lobgesang _ over this feat ` that be how ' it proudly exclaim ` we work for the liberation of people and nationality ' in the same noble spirit we must suppose german legal reform be introduce in December 1916 to replace the turkish shuriat and in the same month all the turk in telegraph office in constantinople be replace by german ernst marré give valuable advice to young german settle in turkey he particularly recommend they know how religion be one of the strongest bond in this murderous race to ` trade in article of devotion in rosary in bag to hold the koran ' and point out what good business might be build up in gramophone earlier in this year we find a ` german oriental trading company ' found for the import of fibrous material for need of military authority and a great carpet business establish at urfa with german machinery that will supplant the loom of smyrna a saltpetre factory be establish at konium by herr toepfer whose enterprise be reward with a iron cross and a turkish decoration the afforestation near constantinople order by the ministry of agriculture be put into german hand and in the vilayet of aidin -lrb- April 1916 -rrb- ninety concession be grant to german capitalist to undertake the exploitation of metallic ore occasionally the german octopus find it have go too far for the moment and release some struggle limb of its victim as for instance when we see that in September 1916 the german director 's stamp for the ` imperial german great radio station ' at damascus have be discard temporarily as that station ` should be treat for the present as a turkish concern ' a ` trading and weave company ' be establish at angora in 1916 a ` import and export company ' at smyrna a ` trading and industrial society ' at beirut a ` tobacco trading company ' at latakieh a ` agricultural company ' at tripolus a ` corn export company ' in lebanon a ` rebuilding commission ' -lrb- perhaps for sack armenian house -rrb- at konium more curious yet will be a tourist 's guide book -- a baedeker in fact -- for traveller in anatolium and the erection of a monument in honor of turkish _ woman _ who have replace man call up for military duty truly these last two item -- a guide-book for anatolium and a monument to woman -- be strange enterprise for turk a new prussian day be dawn it seem for turkish woman as well for the _ tanin _ -lrb- April 1917 -rrb- tell we that diploma be to be confer on lady who have complete they study in the technical school at constantinople it be needless to multiply instance of german penetration : i have but give the skeleton of this german monster that have fasten itself with tentacle and sucker on every branch of turkish industry there be none round which it have not cast its feeler -- no semitic moneylender ever obtain a surer hold on he victim in matter naval military educational legal industrial financial germany have a strangle-hold turkey 's life be already crush out of she and as we have see it have be crush out of she by the benevolent kultur-monger who among all the great power of europe invest they time and they money in the achievement of the pan-turkish ideal silently and skilfully they work bamboozle they chief tool enver pasha even as enver pasha bamboozle we as long as he be of service to they they retain he for he peace of mind at one time they stop up all letter-box in constantinople because so many threatening letter be send he but now enver pasha seem to have have he day he become a little autocratic and think that he be the head of the pan-turkish ideal so he be but the pan-turkish ideal have become pan-prussian and he have not notice the transformation talaat bey have take he place it be he who in may 1917 be receive by the emperor william by king ludwig and by the austrian emperor and he who be the mouthpiece of the german effort to make a separate peace with russium under czardom he proclaim the existence of turkey be threaten but now the revolution have make friendship possible for russium no longer desire territorial annexation and oh how turkey would like to be russium 's friend enver pasha have of late be somewhat out of favor in berlin and i can not but think it curious that when on April 2 1917 he visit the submarine base at wilhelmshaven he be very nearly kill in a motor accident but it may have be a accident since then i can not find that he have take any more active part in pan-turkish ideal than to open a soup-kitchen in some provincial town and lecture the central committee of the young turk on the subject of internal affair in great britain i do not like lecture but i should have like to hear that one i have leave to the end of this chapter the question of germany 's knowledge of and complicity in the armenian massacre from the tribune of the reichstag on January 15 1916 there be make a definite denial of the existence of such massacre at all on another subsequent occasion it be state that germany could not interfere in turkish internal affair in view of the fact that there be no internal affair appertain to turkey in which germany have not interfere the second of these statement may be call insincere but the denial of the massacre be a deliberate lie germany -- official germany -- know all about they and she permit they to go on a few proof of this be here shortly state -lrb- 1 -rrb- in September 1915 four month before the denial of the massacre be make in the reichstag dr martin niepage higher grade teacher in the german technical school at aleppo prepared and send as we have see in he name and that of several of he colleague a report of the massacre to the german embassy at constantinople in that report he give a terrible account of what he have see with he own eye and also state that the country turk ' explanation with regard to the origin of these measure be that it be ` the teaching of the german ' the german embassy at constantinople therefore know of the massacre and know also that the turk attribute they to order from germany dr niepage also consult before send he report with the german consul at aleppo herr hoffman who tell he that the german embassy have be already advise in detail about the massacre from the consulate at alexandretta aleppo and mosul but that he welcome a further protest on the subject -lrb- 2 -rrb- these report or other like they have not go astray for in August 1915 the german ambassador in constantinople baron wangenheim make a formal protest to the turkish government about the massacre there be then no doubt that the german government when it officially deny the massacre be perfectly cognisant of they it be also perfectly capable of stop they for they be not local violence but wholesale murder organise at constantinople in support of this view i find a independent witness state that ` there be no turk of standing who will not readily declare that it would have be perfectly possible for germany to have veto the massacre have she choose ' germany have indeed already give assurance that such massacre should not occur she have assure the armenian katholiko at adana that so long as germany have any influence in turkey he need not fear a repetition of the horror that have take place under abdul hamid have she then no influence in constantinople or how be it that she have obtain complete control over all turkish branch of government the same assurance be give by the german ambassador in April 1915 to the armenian patriarch and the president of the armenian national council so in support of the pan-turkish ideal and in the name of the turkish allah the god of love germany stand by and let the infamous tale of lust and rapine and murder be tell to its end the turk have plan to exterminate the whole armenian race except some half-million who would be deport penniless to work on agricultural development under german rule but this quality of turkish mercy be too strain for major pohl who proclaim that it be a mistake to spare so many but he be a soldier and do not duly weigh the claim of agriculture the choice be open to germany germany choose and let the armenian massacre go on but she be in a difficulty what if the turkish government retort -lrb- perhaps it do so retort -rrb- ` you be not consistent why do you mind about the slaughter of a few armenian what about belgium and you atrocity there ' and all the ingenuity of the wilhelmstrasse would not be able to find a answer to that i do not say that germany want the massacre for she do not she want more agricultural labor and i think that if only for that reason she deprecate they but she allow they to go on when it be in she power to stop they and all the perfume of arabium will not wash clean she hand from that stink horror here then be some of the problem which those who at the end of the war will have to deal with the problem of turkey must tackle it be just as well to recognize that at the present moment turkey be virtually and actually a german colony and the most valuable colony that germany have ever have it will not be enough to limit or rather abolish the supremacy of turkey over alien and martyrised people it will be necessary first to abolish the supremacy of germany over turkey to do this the victory of we ally nation must be complete and germany 's octopus envelopment of turkish industry sever otherwise we shall immediately be confront with a germany that already reach as far as mesopotamium that be do now and that before there can come any permanent peace for europe must be undo nothing less than the complete release of that sucker and tentacle embrace will suffice note as throw a sidelight on the german complicity in the armenian massacre the following be of interest it be know that when metternich succeed wangenheim as german ambassador in constantinople he bring with he a speech write in berlin which by the kaiser 's order he be to read when present he credentials to the sultan this contain a sentence which imply that germany have be unable to stop the armenian massacre talaat refuse to allow the speech to be read obviously because it throw the responsibility of the massacre on to the turk whereas the accept opinion in turkey be that they take place with the connivance and even at the instigation of the german eventually a compromise be arrive at and the speech _ in toto _ be read privately the part refer to the armenian massacre not be publish it be a pity that germany be always find out _ crescent and iron cross chapter vi _ ` thy kingdom be divide ' let we commit the crime of _ lèse-majesté _ and assume -lrb- though the emperor wilhelm ii have repeatedly announce the contrary -rrb- that germany be not at the conclusion of the european war to find herself in possession of the world she have prepare she plan in anticipation of the auspicious event in fact she have have a most interesting map of europe produce which except by its general shape be scarcely recognisable the printing of it it be true be a little premature for it show what europe be to have be like in 1916 and the apportionment be not bear out by fact but assume that there be some radical error about it all from she point of view and assume that there will not be either a conclusive peace favourable to prussian interest or even a inconclusive peace but one in which the ally will be able to dictate and enforce they own term the magnitude of the problem that will await they decision may well appal the most ingenious of they statesman and of all those problem none it be safe to prophesy will be find more difficult of solution than that which will deal with the future of the corrupt and barbarous government which have for century make hell of the ottoman empire we know more or less what will happen to alsace and lorraine to belgium to the trentino because in those case the claim of one or other of we ally to demand a particular settlement be quite certain to be agree to by those not so immediately and vitally concerned but in the balkan these problem will be more complicated because of conflict interest and most complicate of all will they be in turkey one thing however be certain that there can be no go back to the condition that exist there before the war ever since the osmanli come out of remoter asia into the nearer east and into europe the government of they empire have go from bad to worse in the early day as we have see they policy be to absorb the strength of they subject people by incorporate the youth of they into the turkish army by give they turkish wife and by convert they to mohammedanism such be the foundation of the empire and such its growth but have absorb they strength the sultan 's government neglect they until they milk they again they be allow to prosper if they could : all that be demand of they be a toll of they strength they be cattle and for the right to graze on turkish land they pay back a pail of they milk of manhood but a empire found on such principle contain within it active and prolific seed of decay and as we have see more stringent measure have to be resort to in order to preserve the supremacy of the ruling people instead of absorb they strength abdul hamid hit upon the new method of kill they so that the turk should still maintain they domination and the policy set on foot by he be develop but a few year ago into a scheme of slaughter which in atrocity have far surpass the killing of attilum of whom the nationalist poet sing or even the design of the depose sultan the armenian nation with the exception of such part of it as have escape into russian territory have be exterminate and similar measure have be plan and indeed begin against the greek the arab and the jew in consequence of this in consequence also of the european war the policy of the balance of power as regard turkey have be at length abandon the ally have definitely declare in they joint note to president wilson they aim in the war and for those they have pledge themselves to fight until final and complete victory wreathe they arm among these aim be : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the liberation of the people who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of the turk -lrb- 2 -rrb- the expulsion from europe of the ottoman empire which have prove itself so radically alien to western civilisation for a century that most inharmonious of orchestra call the concert of europe have owe to the exigency of the balance of power keep turkey together and in particular have maintain the center of its government at constantinople simply because the balance of power would be upset if anybody else hold the key of the strait that separate russium from the mediterranean england above all other be instrumental in preserve that precarious balance and england now must confess the utter failure of she policy there throughout a century it be humiliating to acknowledge the complete collapse of that which for so many decade have be the keystone of we ruling with regard to we eastern empire but the arch have collapse germany pull the keystone out and all we effort to exclude russium from free access to the mediterranean have only result in let germany in to-day she hold constantinople and the bitter pill must be swallow the situation as it stand at this moment be infinitely worse than it could have be for a century back if at any moment during those hundred year we have do what we always ought to have do and declare that the anachronism of turkey be in europe be more intolerable than anything that could happen in consequence of she expulsion but we have acknowledge that now we have also acknowledge the even greater anachronism of turkey be allow to dispose of the destiny of any of those people who inhabit the territory of the ottoman empire for the ally in they joint note have declare that the remedy of these two monstrous abuse form a essential part of they aim in the war which in costliness of life and of treasure have already far exceed any cataclysm that could have come to europe through its do its clear and christian duty with regard to turkey during the precede hundred year and among the benefit which eventually mankind will reap in the field that have be sow by the blood of the slay will be the fact that the confusion of europe will have accomplish a task which the concert of europe be too craven of consequence to undertake and constantinople and the subject people of the turk will have pass from the yoke of that murderous tyranny for ever we will take these two avowed aim of the ally in order and first try to draw -lrb- though with diffident pencil -rrb- some sketch of what will be the confines of the ottoman empire when we pluck the fruit of the great crusade against the barbarism of turkey and of germany it be quite useless to attempt to keep the map as it be and peg out claim within the empire where we shall proclaim that arab and greek and armenian shall live in peace for it be exactly that plan which have form a century 's failure at the international congress of berlin for instance a solemn pact be enter into by turkey for the reform of the armenian vilayet she carry out she promise by slaughter every armenian male and outrage every armenian woman who inhabit they the _ soi-disant _ protectorate of crete be not a whit more successful in secure for the cretan a tolerable existence and the ally have to bring it to a end twenty year ago and free they from the execrable yoke while finally the repudiation by turkey of the capitulation which provide some sort of guarantee for the safety of foreign people in turkey have show we if further proof be need the value of covenant with the osmanlus it must be render impossible for turkey to repeat such outrage : the soil where she alien people dwell must be hers no more and any turkish aggression on that soil must be _ ipso facto _ a act of war against the european power under the protection of whom such a province be place the difficulty of this part of the problem be not so great as might at first appear we do not when we come to look at it in detail find such a conflict of interest as would seem to face we on a general view even the precarious balance of power be not upset by a quantity of similar adjustment make by the concert of europe during the last hundred year the power free serbium give turkey first a suzerainty over she and finally abolish that : they free bulgarium they free greece eastern rumelium macedonium albanium but as by some strange lapse of humanity they always regard the subject people of turkey in asia as more peculiarly turkish as if at the bosporus a new moral geography begin and massacre in asia be comparatively venial as compare with massacre in europe but now the ally have say that there must be no more massacre in asia nor any possibility of they to secure this it will be necessary to sever from turkey the land where the alien people dwell and form autonymous province under the protectorate of one or other of the ally nation in most case we shall find that there be a protect power more or less clearly indicate whose sphere of interest be obviously concern with one or other of these new and independent province the alien race which for the last thirty year have suffer the most atrociously from turkish inhumanity be that of the armenian and it be fitting to begin we belated campaign of liberation with it if the reader will turn to the map at the end of this book he will see that the district marked armenia lie at the north-west corner of the old ottoman empire and extend across its frontier into russian trans-caucasium that indicate the district which once be people by armenian to-day owe to the various armenian massacre the latest of which describe in another chapter be by far the most appalling such part of armenia as lie in the ottoman empire be practically and probably absolutely depopulate of its armenian inhabitant such as survive apart from the woman whose life be spare on they profess islamism and enter turkish harem have escape beyond the russian frontier and be believe to number about a quarter of a million in the meantime they home have partly be destroy and partly occupy by mouhadjir from thrace and by the kurd who be largely instrumental in butcher they they land have be appropriate haphazardly by any who lay hand on they here the problem be of no great difficulty the robber-tenant must be evict and the remnant of the armenian repatriate without exception they escape into trans-caucasium from village and district near the frontier else they could never have escape from the pursue turk and kurd naturally this remnant of a people will not nearly suffice to fill they entire province but in order to satisfy the claim of justice at all adequately the whole district of armenia as armenia be know before its people be exterminate must be amputate by a clean cut out of the ottoman empire and place in a autonomous condition in a new protected province which will include all the vilayet of armenia there be no doubt about a prosperous future for armenia if this be do and to do less than this would be to fail signally as regard the solemn promise make by the ally when they state to president wilson they aim in the war the armenian have ever be a thrifty and industrious people possess of a inherent vitality which have withstand century of fiendish oppression with facility give they for they re-settlement and with foreign protection to establish they they will beyond question more than hold they own against the kurd as a nation they be as we have see partly agricultural in they pursuit but a considerable proportion of they -lrb- and these the more intelligent -rrb- be man of business merchant doctor educationalist and gravitate to town constantinople as we shall see will be open to they again where lately they number nearly as many as the entire remnant of they nation number now so too will be the city of syrium of palestine and of mesopotamium in the new turkey which we be attempt to sketch they will probably not care to settle in the town and district that will remain in the hand of they late oppressor and murderer in the work of they repatriation none will be more eager to help than the american missionary who at the time of the last massacre as so often before show themselves so nobly disregardant of all personal danger and risk in do they utmost for they murder flock and who have explicitly declare they intention of resume they work with regard to the eviction of kurd that will be necessary it must be remember that the kurd be a trespasser on the plain and town of armenia and properly belong to the mountain from which he be encourage to descend by the turk for purpose of massacre out of those town and plain he must go either into the mountain of armenia from whence he come or over the frontier of armenia into the new turkey presently to be define he must in fact be deport though not in the manner of the deportation at which he himself so often assist the armenian who will thus be reinstate within the boundary of they own territory will be practically penniless and without any of the means or paraphernalia of life and the necessary outlay on supplies for they and the cost of they rehabilitation would naturally fall on the protect power they will however be free from the tax they have hitherto pay to the turk and it should not be difficult for they by means of tax far less oppressive to pay a adequate interest on the money expend on they these would thus take the form of a very small loan the whole of which could easily be repay by the armenian in the course of a generation or so once back on they own soil and free from turkish tyranny and the possibility of it they be bind to prosper even as they have prosper hitherto in spite of oppression and massacre up till the year 1915 when as we have see the liberal and progressive nationalist organise and execute the extermination from which so few escape it be hardly necessary to point out who the protect power would be in the case of the repatriate armenian for none but russium be either desirable or possible with one side along the russian frontier of trans-caucasium the new armenia necessarily fall into the sphere of russian influence it have be suggest that not only armenia proper but part of cilicium should also become a district of the repatriate armenian with a outlet to the sea but while it be true that complete compensation would demand this since zeitun and other district in cilicium be almost pure armenian settlement i can not think that such a restoration be desirable for in the first place the extermination of the zeitunli -lrb- as carry out by jemal the great -rrb- be practically complete all the man be slaughter and it do not seem likely that any of the woman and girl who be deport reach the ` agricultural colony ' of deir-el-zor in the arabian desert it be therefore difficult to see of whom the repatriation would consist in the second place the new armenia will be for several generation to come of a area more than ample for all the armenian who have survive the flight into russium and it obviously will give they the best chance of corporate prosperity if the whole of they be repatriate in a compact body rather than that a portion of they should be form into a mere patch sever from they countryman by so large a distance another sphere of influence also will be operate near the border of cilicium and to place the armenian under two protect power would have serious disadvantage in addition they never be a sea-going people and i can not see what object would be serve by give they a coast-board in any case if a coast-board be find necessary the most convenient would be the coast-board of the black sea lie adjacent to they main territory if it seem clear that for new armenia the proper protect power be russium it be no less clear that for the free inhabitant of new syrium arab and greek alike the proper protect power be france historically france 's connection with syrium date from the time of the crusade in 1099 it have never be sever and of late year the tie between the two country have be both strengthened and multiply the treaty of pari of london of san stefano and of berlin have all recognize the affiliation so too from a ecclesiastical standpoint have the encyclical of leo xiii in 1888 and 1898 similarly it be france who intervene in the syrian massacre of 1845 who land troops for the protection of the maronite in 1860 and establish a protectorate of the lebanon there a few year later which last up till the outbreak of the european war france be the largest holder as she be also the constructor of syrian railway and the harbor of beirut without doubt destine to be one of the most flourishing port of the eastern mediterranean be also a french enterprise and perhaps more important than all these as a link between syrium and france have be the educational penetration which france have effect there what the american missionary do for armenia france have do for syrium and accord to a recent estimate of the 65000 child who attend european school throughout syrium not less than 40000 attend french school when we consider that that proportion have be maintain for many year in syrium it can be estimate how strong the intellectual bond between the syrian and the french now be the french language similarly be talk everywhere : it be as current as be modern greek in port of the levant in virtue of such claim few if any would dispute the title of france to be the protect power in the case of syrium here there will not be as be the case with the armenian any work of repatriation to be do such devastation and depopulation as have be work by jemal the great with hunger and disease to help he be work on the spot and though it will take many year to heal the wound inflict by that barbaric plagiarist of potsdam it be exactly the deft and practical sympathy of the french with the race they have so long tend which will most speedily bring back health to the syrian it will be with regard to the geographical limit of a french protectorate that most difficulty be likely to be experience there will also be point claim careful solution as will be see later with regard to railway control northwards and eastward the natural delimitation seem clear enough : northwards french syrium would terminate with and include the province of aleppo eastward the syrian desert mark its practical limit the technical limit be supply by the course of the euphrate but southwards there be no such natural line of demarcation the arab occupation stretch right down till it reach the hedjaz which already have throw off the turkish yoke and under the shereef of mecca declare its independence inset into this long strip of territory lie palestine now to make one single french protectorate over this very considerable territory seem at first sight a large order but the objection to any other course be many and insuperable should the line of french influence be draw farther north than the hedjaz under what protection be the intervene territory to be leave at present it be turkish but inhabit by arab and unless the ally revoke the fulness of they declaration not to leave alien people under the ` murderous tyranny ' of the turk turkish it can not remain but both by geographical situation and by racial interest it belong to french-protected syrium and there seem no answer to the question as to what sphere of influence it come under if not under the french just as properly if we take this view of the question the sinaitic peninsula largely desert would fall to egypt the french protectorate be define westwards at akabah that the eastern side of the gulf of suez should not be under the same control as the western have always be a anomaly admit even by the sternest opponent of the status of egypt and in the absence of any canal correspond to that of suez and debouching into the red sea _ via _ the gulf of akabah the most advanced champion of french influence in the near east would see no objection to this rectify frontier there be no question of competition involve the proposed change be but a rational rectification of the present status this scheme of delimitation leave palestine inset into the french protectorate of syrium and it be difficult to see to whom the protectorate of palestine should be properly assign except to france italy have no expansive ambition in that sector of the mediterranean england 's national sphere of influence in this partition of the district now occupy by alien people in the ottoman empire lie obviously elsewhere and since the jew who settle in ever-increasing number in palestine before the war and will assuredly continue to settle there again come and will come as refugee from the russian pale it would be clearly inadvisable to assign to russia the protectorate of she own refugee the only other alternative would be to create a independent palestine for the jew and the reason against that be overwhelming it would be merely play into the hand of germany to make such a arrangement for the last thirty year germany have watch with personal and special interest this immigration of jew into palestine see in it not so much a jewish but a german expansion indeed when in the spring of this year as we have notice a massacre and deportation of jew be plan and begin by jemal germany so far reverse she usual attitude towards massacre in general and she express determination never to interfere in turkey 's internal affair as to lodge a peremptory protest and of course get the persecution instantly stop she reason be that pan-turkish ` ideal ' -lrb- the equivalent for the massacre of alien people -rrb- have no sort of meaning in palestine but the pan-germanic ideal have a great deal of meaning in palestine as dr davi treitsch _ -lrb- die jüden der türkei -rrb- _ very clearly state for ` as a result of the war ' he tell we ` there will be a emigration of east-european jew on a unprecedented scale the disposal of the east european jew will be a problem for germany -lrb- and -rrb- german will be only too glad to find a way out in the emigration of those jew to turkey a solution extraordinarily favourable to the interest of all _ three -lrb- sic -rrb- _ party concern there be grounds for talk of a german protectorate over the whole of jewry ' now this be explicit enough germany clearly contemplate a protectorate over palestine and if the jew who be german-speaking jew be leave independent there be nothing more certain than that after the war she penetration of palestine will instantly begin these colonist be and will be in want of fund for the development and increase of they cultivate territory and when we consider the name of the prominent financier in the central empire mendelssohn hirsch goldsmid bleichroeder speyer to name only a few we can not be in much doubt as to the quarter from which that financial assistance will be forthcoming on extremely favourable term it be safe to prophesy that if palestine be give independence without protectorate in three year from the end of the war it will be under not only a protectorate but a despotism as complete as ever rule either turkey or prussium true it be that the zionist movement will offer even as it have offer in the past a strenuous opposition to germanisation but it would be credit it with a inconceivable vitality to imagine that it will be able to resist the blandishments that germany be certainly prepare to shower on it for great as be the progress the jewish settler make in palestine during the twenty or twenty-five year before the war and strong as be the spirit of zionism the emigrant do not as yet number more than about 120000 nor have they under crop more than ten per cent of the cultivate land of palestine they be as yet but settler and they work be before they if leave without a protectorate they will not be without a protectorate long but not such a one as the ally desire a protectorate there must be and no reason be really of weight against that protectorate be french let that then extend from the mediterranean to the euphrate and from alexandretta to where the hedjaz already prosper in its self-proclaimed independence it will be completely sever from turkey by tract under protection of one or other of the ally power any expedition through which would be a act of war the euphrate then will form the eastern boundary of the french protectorate : it will also it be hope form the western boundary of the english protectorate which we know as mesopotamium just as no other power have any real claim to armenia except russium just as syrium can fall to no other than france it seem equally clear that the proper sphere of english influence be in this plain that stretch southwards from the semicircle of hill where the two great river approach each other near diarbekr to the head of the persian gulf as germany very well know it be intimately concern with we safe tenure of indium and the hold the german hope to gain over it and have for ever lose by they possession of the bagdad railway be vital to they dream of world-conquest equally vital to england be it that germany should never get it but its importance to we as a land-route to indium be by no mean the only reason why a english sphere of influence be indicate here : it be the possibility it harbor which as far as can be see england be the only power capable of develop that cause we to put in a claim for its protectorate which none of we ally will dispute to restore mesopotamium to the rank it have hold and to the rank it still might hold among the productive district of the east there be need a huge capital for outlay and a huge population of worker even germany in she nightmare of world-dominion from which she shall be soon drag screaming-awake never formulate a scheme for the restoration of southern mesopotamium to its productive pre-eminence and never so much as contemplated it except as a object that would be possible of realisation after the empire of indium have fall over-ripe into she pelican mouth therein she be perfectly right -- she usually be right in these dream of empire in so far as they be empirical -- for she seem dimly to have conjecture in these methodical vision that india be the key to unlock southern mesopotamium but nowhere can i find that she guess it : i only guess that she guess it this problem of capital outlay and of the necessary man-power for work and restoration apply exclusively to southern mesopotamium which we may roughly define as the district stretch from samara on the tigri and hit on the euphrate to the persian gulf northern mesopotamium as dr rohrbach point out in he _ bagdadbahn _ need only the guarantee of security of life and property to induce the kurd to descend from the hill and the bedouin arab to settle down there and by degree under a protectorate that insure they against massacre and confiscation of property there seem no doubt that the area of cultivation will spread and something of the ancient prosperity return the land be immensely fertile : it be only ottoman misrule which here as everywhere else have leave desolation in the place of prosperity and death in place of life the rainfall be adequate the climate suitable to those who will naturally spread there : it need only freedom from the murderous tyranny that have bleed it for century past to guarantee its future prosperity but southern mesopotamium be a totally different proposition the land lie low between the river and though of unparalleled fertility yield under present condition but a precarious livelihood to its sparse population for nine month of the year it be a desert for three month when its river be in flood a swamp once as we all know it be the very heart of civilisation and from its artery flow out the life-blood of the world rainfall be scarcely existent any more than it be existent in southern or upper egypt but in the day of babylon the great there be true ruler and man of wisdom over these desiccate region who see that every drop of water in the river that now pour senselessly through swamp and desert into the sea be a grain of corn or a stalk of cotton they dig canal they make reservoir and harness like some noble horse of the god the torrent that now gallop unbridled through dreary desert the black land the sawad be then the green land of wave corn where three crop be annually harvest and the average yield be two hundredfold of the seed sow the wheat and barley so herodotus tell we be a palm-breadth long in the blade and millet and sesame grow like tree and in these detail the revered father of lie seem to have speak less than the truth for the statistics we get elsewhere more than bear out he account of its amazing fertility from its wealth before he day have arise the might of babylon and for century later while the canal still regulate the water supply it remain the granary of the world more than a thousand year after herodotus there be over 12500000 acre in cultivation and the husbandmen thereof with the dweller in its city number 5000000 man then come the arab invasion which be bad enough but colossally worse be the invasion of the osmanli truly ' a fruitful land maketh he barren for the wickedness of they that dwell therein ' but the potentiality for production of that great alluvial plain be not diminish the turk could not dispose of that by massacre as a means of weaken the strength of they subject people it be still there ready to respond to the spell of the water of tigri and euphrate which once when handle and control cause it to be the garden of the lord not long before the present european war sir william willcock under whose guidance the great modern irrigation work at assouan be construct be appoint adviser to the ottoman ministry of public work and he report on the irrigation of mesopotamium be issue in 1911 he tell we that the whole of this delta of the sawad be capable of easy levelling and reclamation it would naturally be a gigantic scheme and he take as a basis to start on the question of the refertilisation of 4000000 acre into the detail of it we need not go but he conclusion calculate on a thoroughly conservative basis give the following result he propose to restore of course with modern technical improvement the old system of canal and allow for interest on loan estimate the total expense at # 26000000 -lrb- or the cost of the war for about three day -rrb- on this the annual value of the crop would pay 31 per cent the figure need no enlargement in detail and no comment but now come the difficulty : the construction of the irrigation work be easy the profit be safe so long as the tigri and ` the ancient river ' the river euphrate run they course but all the irrigation work in the world will not raise a penny for the investor or a grain for the miller unless there be man to sow and gather the crop a million be necessary : where be they to come from and the answer be ` egypt and indium ' this be precisely why the protectorate of mesopotamium and its future must be in english hand why no other country can undertake it with hope of success even the ingenious dr rohrbach whose _ bagdadbahn _ i have quote before be force to acknowledge that there be no solution to the man-power problem except by the ` introduction of mohammedan from other country where the climatic condition of irak prevail ' it be true that he start upon the assumption that mesopotamium will remain turkish -lrb- under a german protectorate as we read between he line -rrb- with which we must be permit to disagree but he conclusion be quite correct even under german protection he realize that citizen of well-governed state will not flock by the million to put themselves under turkish control and he dismiss as inadequate the number of syrian arab armenian and jew who can be transport to mesopotamium from inside the boundary of the ottoman empire they number be even more inadequate since the armenian massacre permit by dr rohrbach 's fatherland and even he can not picture a million of he own countryman forsake the beer-garden for summer in the sawad he do not positively state we answer that it be from indium and egypt that the man-power will be supply but as mention before i think he guess it he prophetic gift be not convince enough to himself to let he state the glorious future when indium and egypt shall become german but that i feel sure be he vision : ` he see it but not now he behold it but not nigh ' but we can give the answer which he do not quite like to state since for the english it be clearly more easily realisable the native labor we can supply from egypt and indium especially indium will furnish a million labourer and if we wish two million without difficulty but no power except england can furnish it and that i submit be the solution of the problem of mesopotamium a solution well within the power of english enterprise to attain in the hand of such man as have already bridle the nile the water-horseman of the world and i can not do better in try to convey the spirit in which this work of reclamation should be undertake than by quote some very noble word from sir william willcock 's report in which he speak of the desolation that have come to this garden of fruitfulness through wicked stewardship ` the last voyage i make before come to this country be up the nile from khartoum to the equatorial lake in this most desperate and forbid region i be fill with pride to think i belong to a race whose son even in this inhospitable waste of water be struggle in the face of a thousand discouragement to introduce new forest tree and new agricultural product and ameliorate in some degree the condition of life of the naked and miserable inhabitant how should i have feel if in traverse the desert and swamp which to-day represent what be the richest and most famous tract in the world i have think that i be the scion of a race in whose hand god have place for hundred of year the destiny of this great country and that my countryman could give no better account of they stewardship than the exhibition of two mighty river flow between desert to waste themselves in the sea for nine month of the year and desolating everything in they way for the remain three no effort that turkey can make can be too great to roll away the reproach of those parch and weary land whose cry ascend to heaven ' but the harvest of mesopotamium when gather in must need be transport and for that railway be necessary water transport would of course carry they easily down to the persian gulf but the supply will be mainly if not wholly want westwards and it must be convey to the shore of the mediterranean already in preparation for world-conquest germany have proceed far with she construction of the bagdad railway which be intend after she absorption of turkey to link up berlin with she next oriental objective namely india the taurus have be tunnel the euphrate bridge and but for a hiatus of a few mile the line be practically complete from constantinople into northern mesopotamium but its route be choose for german strategic reason for the link up of berlin with constantinople and bagdad this it may be permit to say do not form part of the scheme of the ally : it be to snap rather than weld such link that they have take the field what we want in the matter of railway transport for the harvest of mesopotamium and generally for we eastern communication be not a line that pass through turkish and german soil and terminate at berlin but one which after the directest possible land-route reach the mediterranean and terminate in suitable port the reader therefore be request to _ unthink _ the present bagdad railway altogether to ` scrap ' it in he mind as it will be probably scrap on the map since it be utterly useless for we purpose for take aleppo as -lrb- roughly -rrb- the half-way house in the existent line we find that the western half of it lie in asia minor in territory which as we shall see will remain turkish while the eastern half of it make a long detour instead of striking directly for bagdad after we experience with turkey there be nothing less conceivable than that we should allow a single mile of we new mesopotamium railway to run through the territory of the turk for who know that she might not -lrb- say when harvest be ripe and ready for delivery -rrb- on any arbitrary pretext close or destroy the line even as before now she have close the dardanelle besides for we purpose a line that go to constantinople -lrb- in whosoever hand constantinople may be after the war -rrb- be out of the way and altogether unsuitable eastward again from aleppo the present bagdad line be circuitous and indirect admirably adapt to the german purpose for which it be construct but utterly unadapted to ours let we then ` scrap ' the existent bagdad route altogether and consider not what the german want but what we want which as have be already state be a direct land communication with suitable mediterranean port of those there be three obvious one alexandretta tripolus and beirut of which beirut be a long way the first in importance and potentiality of increase importance two possible route therefore would seem to suggest themselves one run from alexandretta to aleppo and thence follow pretty closely the course of the euphrate till it reach hit and from there striking directly to bagdad aleppo be already connect with tripolus and el mina -lrb- the actual port of tripolus -rrb- and also with beirut by branch line make a junction at hom and thus all those port will be bring together on one system but if the reader will glance at the map he will see that by far the most direct communication with bagdad would be to run the railway direct from there to hom thus make hom rather than aleppo the central junction of the system from hom line would run northward to aleppo due west to tripolus and south-west to beirut either of those route in any case would be infinitely preferable to the long loop which the present bagdad railway traverse as plan on german line and for german requirement the new railway will thus lie exclusively in territory under french and english protectorate and will probably be they joint enterprise and property prospectively then as regard the fulfilment of the solemn pledge of the ally to liberate subject people from the murderous tyranny of the turk we have discuss the future of armenia of syrium of palestine and of mesopotamium all those be well define district and the demarcation of they respective protectorate should not present great difficulty but there remain before we pass on to the problem of constantinople a further district less easily define largely inhabit by european people whose liberty in the future we be pledge to secure this be the mediterranean coastline to the south and west of asia minor the town of which have be so extensively people and make prosperous by greek and italian similarly among those of we european ally who be desirous and capable of eastern expansion there remain one italy whose rights to partake in this turkish partition we have not yet consider in the shift kaleidoscope of national war-politics it seem at the moment of write by no means impossible that greece have at length get rid of a treacherous and unstable reuben of a monarch may redeem she pledge to serbium in which case no doubt she too would state the term of she desire and legitimate expansion but these would more reasonably be concern with the redistribution of the balkan peninsula which do not come within the scope of this book and we may prophesy without fear of invoke the nemesis that so closely dog the heel of seer that italy will legitimately claim -lrb- or perhaps have already claim -rrb- the protectorate of this valuable littoral certain it be that when peace return the large population of greek and italian once resident -lrb- and soon again to be -rrb- on these coast must be give the liberty and security which they will never enjoy so long as they remain in turkish hand and the hand that have earn the right to be protect power be assuredly italian along the south coast a line include the taurus range would seem to suggest a natural frontier inland from adana on the east to the south-west corner of asia minor and from there a similar strip would pass up the coast as far as and inclusive of smyrna that at least italy have every right to expect and there seem no great fear that among the international council there will arise a dissentient voice the inland boundary on the west coast be the difficult section of this delimitation and into the detail of that it would be both rash and inexpedient to enter ii we pass then to the second avowed object of the ally namely the expulsion from europe of the ottoman rule which have prove itself so radically alien to western civilisation this must be take to include not only the expulsion of the turkish control from thrace and constantinople but from the eastern side as well of the bosporus the sea of marmora and the dardanelle at no future time must turkey be in a position to command even partially a single yard of that momentous channel through which alone we ally russium and rumanium have access to the mediterranean though this be not formally state in the ally ' reply to president wilson it be clearly part and parcel of the object in view for while the ottoman empire retain the smallest control on either side of either of the strait she be so far able to interfere in european concern in which she must never more have a hand the east shore then of the strait and the sea of marmora as well as the west must be under the control of a power or a group of power not alien to western civilisation germany and she ally therefore no less than turkey must be exclude from the guardianship of the strait as we have have previous occasion to note this ejection of the turkish power from constantinople be the absolute reversal of european and in especial of english policy for the last hundred year no crime that the ottoman government could commit no act of barbarism would ever persuade we to do away with the anachronism of turkey 's existence in europe but at last the seismic convulsion of the war have knock this policy into a heap of disjected ruin and it can never be rebuild again on the old line for among we other avowed object in prosecute the war to its victorious end we have pledge ourselves to uphold the right which all people whether small or great have to the enjoyment of full security and free economic development but while turkey can close the strait at she own arbitrary will or at the bidding of a superior and malevolent power and block the passage of ship from russian and rumanian port into the mediterranean the economic development of both these country be seriously menaced three time within the last six year have she exercise that right and while she hold the shore of the strait she can at any moment blockade all southern russian port that such power should be in the hand of any nation be highly undesirable that it should be in the hand of a corrupt despotism like turkey especially now that germany as thing stand can dictate to turkey when and what she please be a thing unthinkable by the most improvident of statesman already we have pay dearly enough for the pusillanimity of a hundred year : it be impossible that we should ever allow a similar bill to be again present whatever be the guardianship of the strait whoever the holder of constantinople it will not be turkey at the beginning of the war and indeed till after the revolution in russium it be announce and state as a axiom that on the conclusion of peace russium should be the door-keeper of what after all be she own lodge-gate subsequently in the unhappy split and disintegration of she government it be announce that she favor peace without annexation -- in other word that she neither claim nor desire the guardianship of constantinople but i think we should be utterly wrong if we regard that as a expression of the will of the russian people : it be far more probable that it be the expression of the will of germany directly inspire by german influence with a view to conclude a separate peace with russium as we have see it have its due effect in turkey and talaat bey give vent to pious ejaculation of thanksgive that now all cause of quarrel with russium be remove and turkey and she could be friend it be possible that when out of the confused cry there again rise from russium the clear call of the people 's voice we shall find she wish to set in order she own house before she project herself on new mission but as far as the manifesto of ` peace without territorial annexation ' go we shall be wise to regard it for the present with the profoundest suspicion it sound far more like the tone of the central european wolf than those of little red ride hood 's proper grandmother but be russium 's decision what it may the turk will hold sway no longer in thrace or constantinople or on the shore of the strait of the sea of marmora there be of course no question of deport the whole of the turkish population that live in those region nor would it be desirable even if it be possible to realize gladstone 's robust vision of see every turk ` bag and baggage ' clear out from the province they have desolate and profane but if not under russium then under the joint control of certain of the ally power there will be a complete reconstruction of the administration of those district the headquarters of the protectorate will doubtless be at constantinople which will be reorganise somewhat on the line of the treaty port of shanghaus and will be open to the ship of all nation the security of the town must be assure by a military garrison either of mixed troops of the control nation or possibly by a rotation of troops draw from the army of each in turn more important even than this will be the adequate control of the strait by sea a naval base must be form which by the gospel of the freedom of the sea -lrb- but not accord to st goeben and the submarine disciple -rrb- will constitute a patrolling police force of the water whether the system of fortification and defence that lately render the dardanelle impregnable shall be retain or not be a question demand the most careful consideration some will hold that they should be maintain in order to insure that none but the guarantor of the freedom of the strait shall ever take possession of they : other that they shall be utterly dismantle and destroy so that the closing of the strait shall be a impossibility the matter really turn on the question as to the extent to which the ally will have the prudence to cut germany 's claw when the war be over it be eminently to be hope that they will be cut so short that never again will they be able to show those chisel talon beyond she velvet -- that sense in fact will allow sentiment no word to say unfortunately there be a great many people the basis of whose character consist of a washy confidence in the good intention of everybody most mistakenly they call it christianity here then have be outline the effect of the ally ' declare aim such territory as turkey hold in europe such control as she possess over the free passage of the strait must pass from she and the alien people who for century have faint and bleed underneath she infamous yoke must be lead out of the land of bondage as we have see throughout precede chapter it be the fix policy of the ottoman government to rid itself of they presence and already it have go far in its murderous mission indeed the avowed aim of the ally when accomplish will do that work for she for the ally be determine to remove those people from turkey the difference of execution however consist in this that they will not remove arab and greek and italian and jew as turkey have already do with the armenian by the simple process of massacre but by a process no less simple namely of take out of the territory of the ottoman empire the district where such people dwell the ally will accomplish in fact for the turk that policy of ottomanisation which be the aim of abdul hamid and have be the aim of he more murderous successor turkey shall henceforth be for the turk : she shall no more be in ` danger ' from the defenceless nation who at present exist within she border the sultan of turkey in some year of grace now not far distant will find that he ottomanisation have be do for he and though he realm be curtail he will have he rest break no more by the thought of arab rising nor will he have to devise measure that will solve the arab question except for a strip along the west and south coast all asia minor and anatolium will be he from the black sea to the mediterranean but syria armenia the coast of asia minor palestine and mesopotamium shall have pass from he it be no dismemberment of a empire that the ally contemplate for they can not dismember limb that never belong to the real trunk it be a despotic military control that the osmanli have establish they always regard they subject people as alien whom they do not scruple to destroy if they exhibit symptom of progress and civilisation henceforth the turkish government shall govern turk and turk alone that for many year have be its aim and by the disastrous dispensation of fate it have be largely able to realize its purpose now though by different method the ally will see thorough accomplishment of it there will be no question of course of turn out or of deport turk who live in syrium in armenia in constantinople for the way of the ally be not those of talaat and enver and jemal the great where to-day turk dwell there shall they continue to dwell but they must dwell there in peace in equal liberty and rights with the once-subject people whom the ally shall have deliver if they do not like that they can migrate not by force march and under the guardianship of murderous kurd but in protection and security to the land where they can still enjoy the beneficent sway of they own governor and be ottomanise to the top of they bent but syrian and armenian and greek and jew will be ottomanise no longer the turk be always a fighter discipline and courageous and he have never lose that virtue of valor but he have be a fighter because he have always live under a military despotism which demand he service and it be much to be doubt whether he quality in this regard will for the future be exercise as they have be in the past for the turkish army in so far as they have consist of turk have be chiefly if not wholly recruit from the peasantry of anatolium who when not summon to they country 's color or order to maltreat and massacre be quiet rather indolent folk content to plough they land and reap a exiguous but sufficient harvest and for they lord and governor who until prussium assume command of the turkish army there will no longer be either the possibility of further conquest as in the old osmanlus day or in less progressive time the necessity for secure ottoman supremacy over the huge ill-knit land which it govern but now instead of have alien and defenceless tribe within they border tribe forbid to bear arm and chafe at the turkish yoke they will see free people under the protectorate of power that be capable of self-defence and if necessary of inflict punishment russium france england italy all ally nation will be establish in close proximity to the turkish frontier and the new turkey will be as powerless for aggression as she will be for defense should she provoke attack but within they border there may the osmanlis dwell secure and undisturbed so long as they conform to the habit of civilised people with regard to they neighbor and it be a question whether now that the military despotism which have always misguided the fortune of this people have no possible field for conquest and no need of secure security the nation will not settle down into the quiet existence of small neutral country perhaps the last chapter of its savage and blood-stained history be already almost finish and in year to come some little light of progress and of civilisation may be kindle in the abode where the household god for century have be cruelty and hate _ crescent and iron cross chapter vii _ the grip op the octopus it will not be sufficient for the fulfilment of the ally ' aim as regard turkey to free from she barbarous control the subject people dwelling within she border for turkey herself have to be deliver from a domination not less barbaric than she own which if allow to continue would soon again be a menace to the peace of the world we have see in a previous chapter how deeply set in she be germany 's nipper how closely the octopus-embrace envelop she and we now have to consider how those tentacle must be unloose from they grip and what will be the condition of the victim already bleed white when that have be do in the beginning as we have see germany obtain she hold by profess a touchingly beautiful and philanthropic desire to help turkey to realize she national ideal and she pecksniff tekin alp and herr ernst marré be bid to write parallel history the one describe the aim of the nationalist party the other the benevolent interest which germany take in they occasionally herr ernst marré could not but remember that he be a german and permit we to see the claw of the cat without quite let it out of the bag but then he pull the string tight again and only loud comfortable purring could be hear the prussian musing over the ` liberation ' of turkey which she be help to accomplish but nowadays so it seem to I the string have be loosen and the claw and tooth be clearly visible it be not so long since dr schnee governor of german east africa send a very illuminating document to berlin from which i extract the following : -- ` do you consider it possible to make a regulation prohibit islam altogether the encouragement of pig-breeding among native be recommend by expert as a effective means of stop the spread of islam ' that seem clear enough and i can imagine talaat bey with he sword of honor in he hand exclaim with the oyster in _ alice in wonderland _ : -- ` after such kindness that would be a dismal thing to do ' but i be afraid that germany be contemplate -lrb- as indeed she have always do -rrb- a quantity of dismal thing to do and be now like the walrus and the carpenter begin to let they appear she have take the turkish oyster out for a nice long walk and when the war be over she propose to sit down and eat they and do she not also interfere in the affair of jewish massacre and declare that ` pan-turkish ideal have no sort of meaning in palestine ' that must have be almost a unfriendly act from turkey 's point of view for it can not be state too clearly that part of the price which germany pay for turkey 's entry on she side into the war be the liberty as far as germany be concern of manage she internal affair massacre and the rest as best suit the damnable doctrine of ottomanisation the other power could not interfere for they fail to force the dardanelle and germany promise not to that promise of course be bind on germany for just so long as it suit she to keep it and it suit she to keep it on the whole during the armenian massacre and in that matter she refusal to interfere be among all she crime the very flower and felicity of she vileness sign be not want that turkey be begin to realize the position in which she have place herself namely that of a bankrupt dependant at the mercy of a nation to whom that quality be a mere derision lately a quantity of small incident have occur such as dispute over the ownership of property finance by germany and the really melodramatic depreciation in the german coinage which unmistakably show the swift ebb of turkey 's misplace confidence more significant perhaps than any be a transaction that take place in may 1917 when talaat bey and enver pasha take the whole of they private fortune out of the deutsche bank in constantinople and invest they in two swiss bank namely the banque nationale de suisse and the banque fédérale : they draw out also the whole fund of the committee of union and progress and similarly transfer they this operation be not effect without loss for in return for the turkish # 1 they receive only thirteen franc but it be significant that they prefer to lose over fifty per cent of they capital and have the moiety secure in switzerland to leave it in constantinople -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be certain therefore that at both end of the scale a distrust of german management have begin a starve population have wreck train load with food-stuff go to germany and at the other end the man with the sword of honor and dishonor deem it wise to put they money out of reach of the great prussian cat that the german themselves be not quite at they ease concern the security of they hold may also be conjecture for they be as far as possible remove turkish troops from constantinople and replace they with they own regiment a instance of this occur in June 1917 when owe to the discontent in the capital it be find necessary to guard bridge residence of minister and government office but instead of recall turkish troops from galicium to do this they keep they there in the manner of hostage mix up in german regiment and send pick body of german troops to constantinople fresh corps of secret police have also be form to suppress popular manifestation they be allow to ` remove ' suspect by any means they choose quite in the old style of bag and bosporus but the organization of they be german and well may the german government distrust those sign of popular discontent in a starve population : already the people have awake to the fact that the german paper money do not represent its face-value and despite assurance to the contrary it be at a discount scarcely credible three german # 1 note be hold even in constantinople to be the equivalent of a gold # 1 while in the province upward of five be ask for and give in exchange for one gold pound it be in vain that german manifesto be put forth declare that all government office will take the note as a equivalent for gold for what the people want be not a traffic with government office but the cash to buy food even more serious be the fact that austrian and hungarian director of bank will no longer accept these scrap of paper in vain too be it that the hungry folk see the wall of the ` house of friendship ' rise higher and higher in constantinople for every day they see with starve eye the train load with sugar from konium and the harvest raise in anatolium with german artificial manure guard by german troops and roll westwards to berlin accord to present estimate the harvest this year be so vastly more abundant than that of previous year that no comparison as the minister of agriculture tell he gratified government be possible but the poorer class get no more than the leavings of it when the army which include the german army have have they want supply the govern class whom it be necessary to feed be not yet suffer for the german grant they enough issue ration to such family as be prove adherent of the german-turkish combination and until the pinch of want attack they we should be foolishly optimistic if we think that a starve peasantry would cause the collapse or the defection of germany 's newest and most valuable colony there be enough discontent to make germany uneasy but that be all -lrb- 2 -rrb- long ago she prove the efficiency of she control and the successful pull of she puppet-string and no instance of that be more complete than the brief story of yakub jemil and the extinction of he and he party which though it happen a full year ago have only lately be completely transmit yakub jemil be a influential commander of a frontier guard near the black sea coast in July 1916 he go to constantinople accompany by he staff -lrb- which include the informant from whom this account be derive -rrb- and be cordially receive by enver and talaat discuss the situation with they he point out the demoralising effect of the armenian massacre and the danger of jemal the great 's attitude towards the arab in syrium realize and seek to make they realize the stupendous folly of make enemy of the subject people and urge the re-establishment of cordial relation between the turk and they that consider that enver and talaat be responsible -lrb- under the german -rrb- for the armenian massacre be a brave outspeak he go on to say that turkey be at war not on behalf of herself but on behalf of germany and that it would be wise of the government to consider the possibility of a separate peace with the power of the entente he be hear with interest and take he leave he remain in constantinople and he view obtain he many adherent not only among turkish officer whose sympathy be already alienate from germany but among member of the committee of union and progress but before long he adherent begin to disappear and he ask for another interview with talaat he be receive as the informant state ` with open arm ' for talaat seize and hold he call for the guard and he be search and on he be find certain document which prove he to hold the view he have already express that now be enough he be ` interrogate ' for two day -lrb- interrogation be otherwise call torture -rrb- and be then hang subsequently 111 officer and man in the army also disappear some be march into the khiat khana valley opposite pera and be stab : other be send under escort to the province and murder no courts-martial of any kind be hold -lrb- footnote 1 : similarly in October of this year a new turkish law be pass prohibit the acquisition of turkish land by foreign settler this be aim point-blank at germany and have naturally annoyed berlin very much -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the army ration have lately be reduce each turkish soldier receive daily a oke of bread and a dry mackerel -rrb- and should anybody doubt the efficiency of german control in turkey and be dispose to be optimistic about the imminence of turkey 's detachment he might do well to ponder that story meantime the efficacy of we naval blockade be largely discount by germany 's new source of supply possibly in the ensue winter of 1917-18 condition may get unbearable but if the turkish government only two year ago massacre more than a million of its subject it would be absurd to expect that the starve of a million more would produce much effect on the minister of the turkish god of love -lrb- 1 -rrb- the people be of course tell with suitable statistics how famine be decimate england and france and how the total starvation of those unfortunate country be imminent indeed of all the sign of want of confidence in they german overlord by far the most promising be the fact that talaat and enver have send they money out of the country and that jemal the great have a swell head on these fact there be a certain justifiable optimism to be base it will do no good to consider they academically in london but be there not practical channel to reach the instinct of the turkish triumvirate that might be navigate -lrb- footnote 1 : the follow list of price in constantinople be of interest : -- July 1914 July 1917 rice per lb 2-1\/4 d 3 4d milk per quart 5d 2 flour per lb 3d 2 6d petroleum per lb 1d 4 6d pair of boot # 1 # 8 -rrb- we need not trouble ourselves with consider what the ally will have to do with the turkish army when once the end of the war come for the collapse of the military party in turkey which owe its whole vitality to germany will be perfect and complete but the economical future of turkey be not so plain : at the present moment its bankruptcy be total early in the war germany drain it of such bullion as it have and have since then advance it about # 150000000 which as far as i can trace be entirely in german paper and must be redeem in gold at some period -lrb- chiefly two year -rrb- after the end of the war that be wonderful finance and one marvel that turkey could have be so far blind as to accept it but i expect that the swallow of the first loan be sweeten by a spoonful of jam of this kind germany point out that though england be quite certainly go to lose the war she have issue a immense paper coinage which have all the purchase power of gold germany on the other hand with she dear ally to help she be just as certainly go to win the war how then could there be the slightest risk of the german paper money depreciate a single piastre in value that sound very good sense to turkey who be equally convince that she would be on the victorious side -lrb- else she would not have join it -rrb- and down go the loan with a pleasant sensation of sweetness a second loan be easily induce by the failure of the dardanelle expedition and about then the ` ignorant ' turkish peasant begin to wonder whether the paper be quite as valuable as gold and to prefer gold or even the ordinary silver piastre to its german equivalent to counteract that as we have see a law be pass make it criminal to hoard gold and to complete the ruin the silver piastre be call in and a nickel token be substitute we can but bow we head in reverence of the thoroughness of german swindle now turkey be completely bankrupt and we must ask ourselves why germany ever bargain for the repayment in gold after the war of the million she have lend the turk in paper if she know that turkey could never repay she true the loan have only cost she the paper the note be print on so that in no case could she prove a loser but how could she be a gainer the answer to that question shout at we from every acre of turkish soil the immense undeveloped riches of turkey supply the answer some indeed be already be develop and the labor and most of the material have be pay for by the german paper note there be the irrigation work at adana there be the beet-sugar industry at konium the irrigation work in the makischelin valley the mineral concession of the bagdad railway the haidar pasha harbor concession the afforestation scheme near constantinople the cotton industry in anatolium -- there be no end to they turkey may not be able to pay in cash but over all these concession already work and over a hundred more of which the concession have be grant germany have a complete hold and she victim will pay in mineral and cotton and sugar and corn she will pay over and over and over again as none who have the smallest knowledge of kultur-finance can possibly doubt she be bleed white already and for the rest of time bloodless and white will she remain only one event can possibly avert she fate and that be the victory of the ally we have be so bold as to assume that this be not a impossible contingency and on that assumption there be a brighter future for turkey than the prussian domination could ever bring she bankrupt she be but as germany see she be rich in possibility even with regard to the restricted territory to which she will surely find herself limited and it be a pleasant chance for she that germany have already be so busy in develop the resource of anatolium for germany may safely bet she last piece of paper money that she will not lay a finger on they the turkey of the future be to be for the turk not for the persecute armenian nor for the arab nor for the greek and assuredly it be not to be for the prussian while the war last germany may draw supplies from the field she artificial manure have enrich and from the acre that she paper money have plant but after that no more she ottomanising work will be over such development -lrb- and it be far from negligible -rrb- as she have do in syrium will be continue under french protection for the arab such as she have do in mesopotamium under english protection and such as she have do in anatolium will be continue by the turk to drag they out of the utter insolvency that she have bring they to never before have a country so justly and so richly deserve the repudiation of a debt incur by the confidence trick not a civilised government in the world would dream of enforce payment any more than a magistrate would enforce a payment to some thimble-rigger return from a race-meet the roar of battle still render inaudible all voice save its own but already the dusk begin to gather over the hall where sit the war-lord and those who for the realisation of they monstrous dream loose hell upon the world and in the grow dusk there begin to steal upon the wall the letter of pale flame that to they portend the doom and to we give promise of dawn faintly they can see the legend _ mene mene tekel upharsin _ the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of crescent and iron cross by e f
