- work imagination a strange and stealthy unrest he try to whistle but he lip be parch and in a mechanical fashion he stoop and begin to pick up the card which litter the floor he stop once or twice and stand with bent head listen the unrest outside seem to increase a loud creaking sound from the stair who be there he cry loudly the creak cease he cross to the door and fling it open stride out into the corridor as he walk he fear leave he suddenly come on he cry with a low laugh all of you all of you show you face -- you infernal ugly face do not skulk he laugh again and walk on and the

along the passage and they go scurry down the stair and then at a jog-trot along the corridor below he go back to the main staircase and they cease again for a time he hang over the baluster listen and try to pierce the blackness below then slowly step by step he make he way downstairs and hold the candle above he head peer about he barne he call where be you shake with fright he make he way along the passage and summon up all he courage push open door and gaze fearfully into empty room then quite suddenly he hear the footstep in front of he he follow slowly for fear of extinguish the

the kitchen grope he way along the narrow passage he could now see better in the darkness and finding himself at last at the foot of the staircase begin to ascend it noiselessly he reach the landing just in time to see a figure disappear round the angle of a wall still careful to make no noise he follow the sound of the step until they lead he to the top floor and he corner the chase at the end of a short passage barne he whisper barne something stir in the darkness a small circular window at the end of the passage just soften the blackness and reveal the dim outline of a motionless figure meagle in place of advance stand almost as still as a sudden horrible doubt take possession of he with he eye fix on the shape in front he fall back slowly and as it advance upon he burst into a terrible cry barne for god 's sake be it you the echo of he voice leave the air quiver but the figure before he pay no heed for a moment he try to brace he courage up to endure its approach then with a smother cry he turn and flee the passage wind like a maze and he thread they blindly in a vain search for the stair if he could get down and open the hall door -- he catch he breath in a sob the step have begin again at a lumbering trot they clatter up and down the bare passage in and out up and down as though in search of he he stand appal and then as they draw near enter a small room and stand behind the door as they rush by he come out and run swiftly and noiselessly in the other direction and in a moment the step be after he he find the long corridor and race along it at top speed the stair he know be at the end and with the step close behind he descend they in blind haste the step gain on he and he shrink to the side to let they pass still continue he headlong flight then suddenly he seem to slip off the earth into space lester awake in the morning to find the sunshine streaming into the room and white sit up and regard with some perplexity a badly blistered finger where be the other inquire lester go i suppose say white we must have be asleep lester arise and stretch he stiffened limb dust he clothes with he hand and go out into the corridor white follow at the noise of they approach a figure which have be lie asleep at the other end sit up and reveal the face of barne why i have be asleep he say in surprise i do not remember come here how do i get here nice
