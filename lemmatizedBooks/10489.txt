rival lady _ howard 's _ preface to four new play _ and the _ essay of dramatic poesy _ -- not only introduce we to one of the most interesting critical controversy of the seventeenth century but present we in the last work with a epoch-marking masterpiece both in english criticism and in english prose composition bishop copleston 's brochure bring we to the early day of the _ edinburgh review _ and to the dawn of the criticism with which we be unhappily only too familiar in we own time from criticism we pass in the extract from ellwood 's life of himself to biography and social history to the most vivid account we have of milton as a personality and in private life next come a series of pamphlet illustrate social and literary history in the reign of anne and george i open with the

current in 1711 next come tickell 's valuable memoir of he friend addison prefix as preface to he edition of addison 's work publish in 1721 with steele 's singularly interesting stricture on the memoir be the dedication of the second edition of the _ drummer _ to congreve the reprint of eachard 's _ grounds and occasion of the contempt of the clergy and religion enquire into _ with the precede extract from chamberlayne 's _ anglia notitium _ and the succeed papers of steele 's in the _ tatler _ and _ guardian _ throw light on a question which be not only of great interest in itself but which have be bring into prominence through the controversy excite by macaulay 's famous picture of the clergy of the seventeenth and eighteenth century last come what be by general consent acknowledge to be one of the most valuable contribution ever make to the literature of proverb franklin 's summary of the maxim in _ poor richard 's almanack _ we first excerpt be the preface to a work which be entitle to the distinction of be the first systematic contribution to literary criticism write in the english language it appear in 1553 and be entitle _ the art of rhetorique for the use of all suche as be studious of eloquence sette foorthe in englishe by thoma wilson _ and it be dedicate to john dudley earl of warwick thoma wilson -- erroneously designate sir thoma wilson presumably because he have be confound with a knight of that name -- be bear about 1525 educate at eton and subsequently at king 's college cambridge whence he graduate ba in 1549 in life he play many part as tutor to distinguish pupil notably henry and charle brandon afterwards duke of suffolk as diplomatist and ambassador to various country as a secretary of state and a privy councillor as one of the master of request and as master of st catherine 's hospital at the tower at which place and in which capacity he terminate a very full and busy life on June 16th 1581 the pupil of sir john cheke and of sir thoma smith and the intimate friend of roger ascham wilson be one of the most accomplished scholar in england be especially distinguish by he knowledge of greek he be the author of a translation of a singularly vigorous translation of the _ olynthiac _ and _ philippic _ of demosthene publish in 1570 he most popular work judge at least from the quickly succeed edition appear to have be he first _ the rule of reason conteinynge the art of logique set forth in englishe _ publish by grafton in 1551 and dedicate to edward vi _ the art of rhetorique _ be say to have be publish at the same time but the earliest known copy be date January 1553 the interest of this art of rhetoric be threefold it be the work of a writer intelligently familiar with the greek and roman classic and it thus stand beside elyot 's _ governor _ which appear two year before as one of the earliest illustration of the influence of the renaissance on we vernacular literature it be one of the earliest example not only of the employment of the english language in the treatment of scholastic subject but of the vindication of the use of english in the treatment of such subject and lastly it be remarkable for its sound and weighty good sense he friend ascham have already say : ` he that wyll wryte well in any tongue muste folowe thy councel of aristotle to speake as the common people do to think as wise man do and so shoulde every man understande hym many english writer have not do so but usinge straunge word as latin french and italian do make all thinge darke and harde ' and it be indeed by no means improbable that this work which be write to inculcate all that ascham uphold may have be suggest by ascham it be in three book and draw largely on quintilian the first two book be substantially little more than a compilation but a very judicious one from the _ institute of oratory _ but wilson be no pedant and have many excellent remark on the nature of the influence which the classic should exercise on english composition one passage be worth transcribe -- ` among all other lesson this should first be learn that we never affect any straunge ynkhorne terme but to speake as be commonly receive neither seek to be over fine nor yet be over carelesse use we speeche as most man doe and order we witte as the fewest have do some seke so far outlandishe english that theus forget altogether they mother language and i dare sweare this if some of they mother be alive theus be not able to tell what thei saie and yet these fine english clerke will saie thei speake in they mother tongue -- if a man should charge they for counterfeityng the kinge englishe the unlearned or foolish phantasicalle that smelle but of learnyng -lrb- suche fellowe as have see learn man in they daie -rrb- will so latin they tongue that the simple can not but wonder at they talke and thinke surely thei speake by some revelation i know they that thinke rhetorique to stand wholie upon darke woorde and he that can catche a ynke horne terme by the taile he thei coumpt to bee a fine englisheman and a good rhetorician ' in turn to wilson 's own style we be remind of butler 's sarcasm -- ` all a rhetorician 's rule teach nothing but to name he tool ' he be not indeed deficient as the excerpt give show in dignity and weightiness but neither there nor elsewhere have he any of the finer quality of style he rhythm be harsh and unmusical he diction cumbrous and diffuse the excerpt which come next in this miscellany be by the author of that treatise which be with the exception perhaps of george puttenham 's _ art of english poesie _ and ben jonson 's _ discovery _ the most precious contribution to criticism make in the elizabethan age but indeed the _ defense of poesie _ stand alone : alone in originality alone in inspiring eloquence the letter we print be take from arthur collin 's _ sydney papers _ vol i pp 283-5 and be write by sir philip sidney to he brother robert afterwards -lrb- August 1618 -rrb- second earl of leicester then at prague from letter of sir henry sidney in the same collection -lrb- see letter date march 25th and October 1578 -rrb- we learn that robert then in he eighteenth year have be send abroad to see the world and to acquire foreign language that he be flighty and extravagant and have in consequence greatly annoy he father who have threaten to recall he home ` follow ' sir henry have write ` the direction of you most loving brother imitate he virtue exercys studye and accyon hee y a rare ornament of thy age ' this letter be write at a critical time in sidney 's life with great courage and with the noblest intention though with extraordinary want of tact for he be only in he twenty-sixth year he have presume to dissuade queen elizabeth from marry the duke of anjou the queen have be greatly offend and he have have to retire from court the greater part of the year 1580 he spend at wilton with he sister mary busy with the _ arcadium _ in August he have through the influence of he uncle leicester become reconcile with the queen and a little later take up he residence at leicester house from which this letter be date it be a mere trifle yet it illustrate very strikingly and even touchingly sidney 's serious sweet and beautiful character the admirable remark on the true use of the study of history such as ' i never require great study in ciceronianism the chief abuse of oxford _ quus dum verba sectantur re ipsas negligunt _ ' remind we of the author of the _ defense _ while the ` great part of my comfort be in you ' ` be careful of yourself and i shall never have care ' and the ' i write this to you as one that for myself have give over the delight in the world ' show that he have estimate royal reconciliation at they true value and anticipate the beautiful and pathetic word with which he be say to have take leave of the world short and hurry as this letter be we feel it be one of those trifle which as plutarch observe throw far more light on character than action of importance often do between 1580 and the appearance of mere 's work in 1598 there be much activity in critical literature five year before the date of sidney 's letter george gascogne have publish he _ certayne note of instruction concern the makyng of verse in rhyme _ this be succeed in 1584 by jame i 's _ ane short treatise contein some rewle and cauteli to be observit _ then come william webbe 's _ discourse of english poesie _ 1586 which have be precede by sidney 's charming _ defense of poetry _ compose in or about 1579 but not publish till 1593 this and puttenham 's elaborate treatise _ the art of english poesie contrived into three book _ -lrb- 1589 -rrb- have indeed mark a epoch in the history of criticism memorable too in this branch of literature be harington 's _ apologie for poetry _ -lrb- 1591 -rrb- prefix to he translation of the _ orlando furioso _ but it be not criticism only which have be advance the publication of the first part of lyly 's _ euphue _ and of spenser 's _ shepherd 's calendar _ in 1579 may be say to have initiate the golden age of we literature the next twenty year see marlowe greene peele kyd shakespeare chapman decker and ben jonson at the head of we drama spenser warner daniel and drayton lead narrative poetry the contributor to _ england 's helicon _ publish a year later at the head of we sonneteer and lyric poet and sidney lyly greene and hooker in the van of we prose literature the history of mere 's work a dissertation from which be here extract be curious in or about 1596 nichola ling and john bodenham conceive the idea of publish a series of volume contain proverb maxim and sententious reflection on religion moral and life generally accordingly in 1597 appear a small volume contain various apothegm extract principally from the classic and the father compile by nichola ling and dedicate to bodenham it be entitle _ politeuphuium _ : _ wit commonwealth _ in the following year appear ' _ palladi tamium wit treasury _ : _ be the second part of wit commonwealth _ by franci mere maister of art in both university ' on the title-page be the motto ' _ vivitur ingenio cetera mortis erunt _ ' it be print by p short for cuthbert burbie from the address to the reader which do not appear in the first edition though it be apparently intend for that edition we learn that it have be undertake because of the extraordinary popularity of _ wit commonwealth _ which ` thrice within one year have runne thorough the presse ' mere 's work differ importantly from _ wit commonwealth _ it be not merely a compilation but contain original matter generally by way of commentary the extract be much fuller many be take from modern writer notably robert greene lyly warner and sir philip sidney in 1634 the work be re-issue under another title _ wit commonwealth the second part : a treasurie of divine moral and phylosophical simile and sentence generally useful but more particular publish for the use of school _ in 1636 it be again reprint the only part of mere 's work which be of interest now be what be here reprint it belong to that portion of he compilation which treat of study and read the precede section discuss respectively of ` book ' of ` reading of book ' of ` choice to be have in reading of book ' of ` the use of read many book ' of ` philosopher ' of ` poetry ' of ` poet ' consist for the most part of remark compile from plutarch and in one or two instance from sir philip sidney 's _ defense of poetry a portion of the passage which immediately precede the _ discourse _ may be transcribe because of its plain speaking about the indifference of elizabeth and she minister to the fortune of poet though this with curious inconsistency be flatly contradict probably for prudential reason in the _ discourse _ itself -- ` as the greeke and latin poet have wonne immortal credit to they native speech be encourage and grace by liberal patrone and bountiful benefactor so we famous and learn lawreate master of england would entitle we english to far greater admire excellency if either the emperor

glorified phrase and great action -rrb- bee still support and uphelde by which meane -lrb- o ingrateful and damned age -rrb- we poet be soly or chiefly maintain countenance and patronize ' of the author of this work franci mere or meer comparatively little be know he spring from a old and highly respectable family in lincolnshire and be bear in 1565 the son of thoma mere of kirton in holland in that county after graduate from pembroke college cambridge in 1587 proceeding ma in 1591 at he own university and subsequently by _ ad eundem _ at oxford he settle in london where in 1597 have take order he be live in botolf lane he be present in July 1602 to the rectory of wing in rutland keep a school there he remain at wing till he death in he eighty-first year January 29 1646-7 as charle fitzgeoffrey in a latin poem in he _ affaniae _ address to mere speak of he as ' _ theologus et poeta _ ' it be possible that the ` fm ' who be a contributor to the _ paradise of dainty device _ be to be identify with mere in addition to the _ palladi tamium _ mere be the author of a sermon publish in 1597 a copy of which be in the bodleian and of two translation from the spanish neither of which be of any interest mere 's _ discourse _ be like the rest of he work mainly a compilation with addition and remark of he own much of it be derive from the thirty-first chapter of the first book of puttenham with these distinction that mere 's include the poet who have come into prominence between 1589 and 1598 and institute parallel biographical and critical between they and the ancient classic it be the notice of these poet and more particularly the reference to shakespeare 's writings which make this treatise so invaluable to literary student thus we be indebted to mere for a list of the play which shakespeare have produce by 1598 and for a striking testimony to he eminence at that date as a dramatic poet as a narrative poet and as a writer of sonnet the perplexing reference to _ love 's labor 's win _ have never be and perhaps never will be satisfactorily explain to assume that it be another title for _ all 's well that end well _ in a earlier form be to cut rather than to solve the knot it be quite possible that it refer to a play that have perish the reference to the imprisonment of nash for write the _ isle of dog _ to the unhappy death of peele greene and marlowe and to the high personal character of drayton be of great interest mere be plainly a man of muddle and inaccurate learning of no judgment and of no critical power a sort of elizabethan boswell without boswell 's virtue and it be no paradox to say that it be this which give he _ discourse _ its chief interest it probably represent not he own but the judgment current on contemporary writer in elizabethan literary circle and we can not but be strike with they general fairness full justice be do to shakespeare who be place at the head of the dramatist full justice be do to spenser who be style divine and place at the head of narrative poet to sidney both as a prose writer and as a poet to drayton to daniel and to hall lodge and marston as satirist we be surprise to find such a high place assign to warner ` style by the best wit of both we university the english homer ' and a modern critic would probably substitute different name notably those of lodge and campion for those of daniel and drayton in a list of the chief lyric poet then in activity in mere 's remark on painter and musician there be nothing to detain we of a very different order be the important critical treatise which come next dryden 's _ essay of dramatic poesy _ to which be prefix as prolegomenon dryden 's _ dedicatory epistle to the rival lady _ sir robert howard 's _ preface to four new play _ and as supplementary howard 's _ preface to the duke of lerma _ and dryden 's _ defense of the essay of dramatic poesy _ as dryden 's _ essay _ like almost all he writings both in verse and prose be of a more or less occasional character it will be necessary to explain at some length the origin of the controversy out of which it spring as well as the immediate object with which it be write the restoration find dryden a literary adventurer with a very slender patrimony and with no prospects poetry be a drug in the market hack-work for the bookseller be not to he taste and the only chance of remunerative employment open to he be to write for the stage to this he accordingly betake himself he begin with comedy and he comedy be a failure he then betake himself to a species of drama for which he part and accomplishment be better fit dryden have few or none of the qualification essential in a great dramatist but as a rhetorician in the more comprehensive sense of the term he be soon to be unrivalled in the rhyme heroic play as they be call he find just the sphere in which he be most qualify to excel the taste for these drama which owe most to france and something to italy and spain have come in with the restoration they chief peculiarity be the complete subordination of the dramatic to the rhetorical element the predominance of pageant and the substitution of rhyme for blank verse dryden 's first experiment in this drama be the _ rival lady _ in which the tragic portion be compose in rhyme blank verse be reserve for the part approach comedy in he next play the _ indian queen _ write in conjunction with howard blank verse be wholly discard the dedication of the _ rival lady _ to orrery be appropriate roger boyle baron broghill and first earl of orrery be at this time lord president of munster and it be he who have revive these rhyme play in he _ henry v _ which be bring out in the same year as dryden 's comedy whoever have read this drama and orrery 's subsequent experiment _ mustapha _ -lrb- 1665 -rrb- the _ black prince _ -lrb- 1667 -rrb- _ tryphon _ -lrb- 1668 -rrb- will be able to estimate dryden 's absurd flattery at its proper value but these dramatic innovation be sure not to pass without protest though the protest come from a quarter where it might least have be expect sir robert howard be the sixth son of thoma first earl of berkshire he have distinguish himself on the royalist side in the civil war and have pay the penalty for he loyalty by a imprisonment in windsor castle during the commonwealth at the restoration he have be make a auditor of the exchequer dryden seem to have make he acquaintance shortly after arrive in london in 1660 howard publish a collection of poem and translation to which dryden prefix a address ` to he honor friend ' on ` he excellent poem ' howard 's rank and position make he a useful friend to dryden and dryden in he turn be no doubt of much service to howard howard introduce he to he family and in December 1663 dryden marry he friend 's eldest sister the lady elizabeth howard in the following year dryden assist he brother-in-law in the composition of the _ indian queen _ there have probably be some misunderstanding or dispute about the extent of the assistance which dryden have give which account for what follow in any case howard publish in 1665 professedly under pressure from herringman four play two comedy _ the surprisal _ and _ the committee _ and two tragedy the _ vestal virgin _ and _ indian queen _ and to the volume he prefix the preface which be here reprint it will be see that though he make no reference to dryden he combat all the doctrine lay down in the preface to the _ rival lady _ he exalt the english drama above the french the italian and the spanish and vindicate blank verse against rhyme make however a flattering exception of orrery 's drama if dryden be not pleased he appear to have have the grace to conceal he displeasure for he pass the greater part of 1666 at he father-in-law 's house and dedicate to howard he _ annus mirabili _ but howard be to have he answer in the _ essay of dramatic poesy _ he be introduce in the person of crite and in he mouth be place all the argument advance in the _ preface _ that they may be duly refute and demolish by dryden in the person of neander at this mode of retort howard become really angry and in the _ preface to the duke of lerma _ publish in the middle of 1668 he reply in a tone so contemptuous and insolent that dryden in turn completely lose he temper the sting of howard 's _ preface _ lie it will be see in he affect the air of a person to whom as a statesman and public man the point in dispute be mere trifle hardly worth consideration and in the patronising condescension with which he descend to a discussion with one to whom as a mere _ litterateur _ such trifle be of importance the _ defense of the essay of dramatic poesy _ dryden prefix to the second edition of the _ indian emperor _ one of the best of he heroic play the seriously critical portion of this admirable little treatise deal with howard 's attack on the employment of rhyme in tragedy on the observance of strict rule in dramatic composition and on the observance of the unity but irritated by the tone of howard 's tract dryden do not confine himself to answer he friend 's argument he ridicule what shadwell have ridicule before howard 's coxcombical affectation of universal knowledge make sarcastic reference to a absurdity of which he opponent have be guilty in the house of common mercilessly expose he ignorance of latin and the uncouthness and obscurity of he english the brother-in-law afterwards become reconcile and in token of that reconciliation dryden cancel this tract the _ essay of dramatic poesy _ be write at charleton park in the latter part of 1665 and publish by herringman in 1668 it be afterwards carefully revise and republish with a dedication to lord buckhurst in 1684 dryden spend more pain than be usual with he on the composition of this essay though he speak modestly of it as ` rude and indigested ' and it be indeed the most elaborate of he critical disquisition it be he say write ` chiefly to vindicate the honor of we english writer from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the french before they ' its more immediate and particular object be to regulate dramatic composition by reduce it to critical principle and these principle he discern in a judicious compromise between the licence of romantic drama as represent by shakespeare and he school and the austere restraint impose by the canon of the classical drama assume that a drama should be ' a just and lively image of human nature represent its passion and humor and the change of fortune to which it be subject for the delight and instruction of mankind ' it be show that this end can only be attain in a drama found on such a compromise that the ancient and modern classical drama fail in nature that the shakespearian drama fail in art at the conclusion of the essay he vindicate the employment of rhyme a contention which he afterwards abandon the dramatic setting of the essay be no doubt suggest by the platonic _ dialogue _ or by cicero and the essay itself may have be suggest by flecknoe 's short _ discourse of the english stage _ publish in 1664 the _ essay of dramatic poesy _ may be say to make a era in the history of english criticism and to mark a era in the history of english prose composition it be incomparably the best purely critical treatise which have hitherto appear in we language both synthetically in its definition and application of principle and particularly in its lucid exact and purely discriminate analysis it be also the most striking and successful illustration of what may be call the new prose style or that style which initiate by hobbe and develop by sprat cowley and denham -lrb- 1 -rrb- blended the ease and plasticity of colloquy with the solidity and dignity of rhetoric of that style in which dryden be soon to become a consummate master the _ advice to a young reviewer _ bring we into a very different sphere of criticism and have indeed a direct application to we own time it be write by edward copleston afterwards dean of st paul 's and bishop of llandaff bear in February 1776 at offwell in devonshire copleston gain in he sixteenth year a scholarship at corpus christus college oxford after carry off the prize for latin verse he be elect in 1795 fellow of oriel in 1800 have be ordain priest he become vicar of st mary 's in 1802 he be elect professor of poetry in which capacity he deliver the lecture subsequently publish under the title of _ praelectione academicae _ -- a favorite book of cardinal newman 's in 1814 he succeed dr eveleigh as provost of oriel in 1826 he be make dean of chester in 1828 bishop of llandaff and dean of st paul 's he die at llandaff on October 14th 1849 copleston be one of the father of modern oxford and from he provostship date many of the reform which transform the university of gibbon and southey into the university of whateley of newman of keble and of pusey the brochure which be print here be write when copleston be fellow and tutor of oriel it be immediately inspire not as be commonly suppose by the critique in the _ edinburgh review _ but by the critique in the _ british critic _ a periodical found in 1793 and exceedingly influential between that time and about 1812 archbishop whateley correct a statement in the _ life _ of copleston by wj copleston say that it be occasion by a review of mant 's poem in the _ british critic _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- but on refer to the review of these poem which appear in the November number of 1806 plainly the review refer to we find nothing in it to support whateley 's assertion that the review in the _ british critic _ be however what copleston be parody in the critique of _ l'allegro _ be abundantly clear but what he say about voyage and travels and about science and recondite learning appear to have reference to article particularly characteristic of the _ edinburgh review _ it be not however till after the date of copleston 's parody that the _ edinburgh review _ begin conspicuously to illustrate what copleston here satirise it be not till a time more recent still that periodical literature generally exemplify in literal seriousness what copleston intend as extravagant irony it be interesting to compare with copleston 's remark what thackeray say on the same subject in the twenty-fourth chapter of _ pendenni _ entitle ` the pall mall gazette ' this brochure be evidently model on swift 's ` digression concern critic ' in the third section of the _ tale of a tub _ and owe something also to the _ treatise on the bathos _ in pope 's and swift 's _ miscellany _ as the title may have be suggest by shaftesbury 's _ advice to a author _ the _ advice _ itself and the supplementary critique of milton be clever and have good point but they will not bear comparison with the satire of swift and pope the excerpt which come next in this miscellany link with the name of the author of the _ essay of dramatic poesy _ the name of the most illustrious of he contemporary the difference indeed between milton and dryden be a difference not in degree merely but in kind so immeasurably distant and alien be the sphere in which they move and work both as man and as writer it have sometimes be question whether dryden be a poet few would dispute that milton divide with shakespeare the supremacy in english poetry in dryden as a man there be little to attract or interest we in character and in private life he appear to have be perfectly commonplace we close he biography and we curiosity be satisfy with milton it be far otherwise we feel instinctively that he belong to the demi-god of we race we have the same curiosity about he as we have about homer aeschylus and shakespeare so that the merest trifle which throw any light on he personality assume a interest altogether out of proportion to they intrinsic importance we debt to ellwood be it must be admit much less than it might have be if he have think a little more of milton and a little less of he somewhat stupid self and the sect to which he belong but as the proverb say we must not look a gift-horse in the mouth and we be the richer for the quaker 's reminiscence with ellwood 's work the _ history of thoma ellwood write by himself _ we be only concern so far as it bear on he relation with milton bear in 1639 the son of a small squire and justice of the peace at crowell in oxfordshire ellwood have in 1659 be persuade by edward burrough one of the most distinguish of fox 's follower to join the quaker he be in he twenty-fourth year when he first meet milton milton be then live in jewin street have remove from he former lodging in holborn most probably in the autumn of 1661 the restoration have terminate he work as a controversialist and politician for a short time he life have be in peril but he have receive a pardon and could at least live in peace he could no longer be of service as a patriot and be now occupy with the composition of _ paradise lose _ since 1650 he have be blind and for study and recreation be dependent on assistance have little domestic comfort as a widower he have just marry he third wife ellwood 's narrative tell its own story what especially strike we in it and what make it particularly interesting be that it present milton in a light in which he be not present elsewhere ellwood seem to have have the same attraction for he as bonstetten have for gray no doubt the simplicity freshness and enthusiasm of the young quaker touch and interest the lonely and world-wearied poet who when ellwood first meet he have enter on he fifty-fifth year he have no doubt too the scholar 's sympathy with a disinterested love of learn in any case but for ellwood we should never have know the softer side of milton 's character never have know of what gentleness patience and courtesy he be capable and indeed when we remember milton 's position at this time as tragical as that of demosthene after chaeronea and of dante at the court of verona there be something inexpressibly touch in the picture here give with so much simplicity and with such evident unconsciousness on the part of the painter of the effect produce there be one passage which be quite delicious and yet its point may be as it commonly be easily miss it illustrate the density of ellwood 's stupidity and the delicate irony of the sadly courteous poet milton have lend he it will be see the manuscript of _ paradise lose _ and on ellwood return it to he ` he ask I how i like it and what i thought of it which i modestly but freely tell he and after some further discourse about it i pleasantly say to he thou have say much here of paradise lose but what have thou to say of paradise find ' now the whole point and scope of paradise lose be paradise find -- the redemption -- the substitution of a spiritual eden within man for a physical eden without man a point emphasise in the invocation and elaborately work out in the closing vision from the specular mount it be easy to understand the significance of what follow : ` he make I no answer but sit sometime in a muse then break off that discourse and fall upon another subject ' the result no doubt of that ` muse ' be the suspicion or perhaps the conviction that the rest of the world would in all probability be as obtuse as ellwood and to that suspicion or conviction we appear to owe _ paradise regain _ the plague over milton return to london settle in artillery walk bunhill field ` and when afterwards i go to wait on he there he shew I he second poem call _ paradise regain _ and in a pleasant tone say to I this be owe to you for you put it into my head by the question you put to I at chalfont which before i have not think of ' in ` the pleasant tone ' more and much more be imply of that we may be very sure than meet the ear we should like to have see the expression on milton 's face both on this occasion and also when on dryden request he permission to turn _ paradise lose _ into a opera he reply ` oh certainly you may tug my verse if you please mr dryden ' it may be add that _ paradise lose _ be not publish till 1667 and _ paradise regain _ do not see the light till 1671 ellwood seem to imply that _ paradise regain _ be compose between the end of August or the beginning of September 1665 and the end of the autumn of the same year which be of course incredible and quite at variance with what phillip tell we ellwood be no doubt express himself loosely and he ` afterwards ' need not necessarily relate to he first or to he second or even to he third visit to milton after the poet 's return to artillery walk but refer vaguely to one of those ` occasion which draw he to london ' when he last see milton we have no means of know he never refer to he again he autobiography close with the year 1683 for the rest of he life ellwood be engage for the most part in fight the battle of the quakers-esoterically in endeavor to compose they internal feud exoterically in defend they and they tenet against they common enemy -- and in write poetry which it be to be hope he do not communicate to he ` master ' after the death of he father in 1684 he live in retirement at amersham he most important literary service be he edition of george fox 's _ journal _ the manuscript of which he transcribe and publish he die at he house on hunger hill amersham in march 1714 and lie with penn in the quaker 's burying-ground at new jordan chalfont st gile we have now arrive at the pamphlet in we miscellany bearing on the reign of queen anne first come the partridge tract the history of the inimitable hoax of which they be the record be full of interest in November 1707 swift then vicar of laracor come over to england on a commission from archbishop king he two satire the _ battle of the book _ and the _ tale of a tub _ publish anonymously three year before have give he a foremost place among the wit for they authorship be a open secret though he be at this time principally engage in the cause of the established church in active opposition to what he consider the lax latitudinarianism of the whig on the one hand and the attack of the freethinker on the other he find leisure for do society another service nothing be more detestable to swift than charlatanry and imposture from time immemorial the commonest form which quackery have assume have be associate with astrology and prophecy it be the frequent theme or satire in the new comedy of the greek and in the comedy of rome it have fall under the lash of horace and juvenal nowhere be lucian more amusing than when deal with this species of roguery chaucer with exquisite humor expose it and its kindred alchemy in the fourteenth century and ben jonson and the author of _ albumazar _ in the seventeenth nothing in _ hudibra _ be more rich in wit and humor than the exposure of sidrophel and one of the best of dryden 's comedy be the _ mock astrologer _ but it be reserve for swift to produce the most amusing satire which have ever gibbet these mischievous mountebank john partridge whose real name be say to have be hewson be bear on the 18th of January 1644 he begin life it appear as a shoemaker but be a youth of some ability and ambition have acquire a fair knowledge of latin and a smattering of greek and hebrew he have then betaken himself to the study of astrology and of the occult science after publish the _ nativity of lewi xiv _ and a astrological essay entitle _ prodromus _ he set up in 1680 a regular prophetic almanac under the title of _ merlinus liberatus _ a protestant alarmist for such he affect to be be not likely to find favor under the government of jame ii and partridge accordingly make he way to holland on he return he resume he almanac the character of which be exactly describe in the introduction to the _ prediction _ and it appear to have have a wide sale partridge however be not the only impostor of he kind but have as we gather from notice in he almanac and from he other pamphlet many rival he be accordingly oblige to resort to every method of bring himself and he almanac into prominence which he do by extensive and impudent advertisement in the newspaper and elsewhere in he almanac for 1707 he issue a notice warn the public against impostor usurp he name it be this which probably attract swift 's attention and suggest he mischievous hoax the pamphlet tell they own tale and it be not necessary to tell it here the name isaac bickerstaff which have in sound the curious propriety so characteristic of dickens 's name be like so many of the name in dickens suggest by a name on a sign-board the name of a locksmith in long acre the second tract purport to be write by a revenue officer and give a account of partridge 's death be of course from the pen of swift the verse on partridge 's death appear anonymously on a separate sheet as a broadside it be amusing to learn that the tract announce partridge 's death and the approach death of the duke of noaille be take quite seriously for partridge 's name be strike off the roll of stationer ' hall and the inquisition in portugal order the tract contain the treasonable prediction to be burn as stationer ' hall have assume that partridge be dead -- a serious matter for the prospects of he almanac -- it become necessary for he to vindicate he title to be a live person whether the next tract _ squire bickerstaff detect _ be as scott assert the result of a appeal to rowe or yalden by partridge and they under the pretence of assist he treacherously make a fool of he or a independent _ j' eu d'esprit _ be not quite clear nor be it easy to settle with any certainty the authorship in the dublin edition of swift 's work it be attribute to nichola rowe scott assign it to thoma yalden the preacher of bridewell and a well-known poet congreve be also say to have have a hand in it it would have be well for partridge have he allow matter to rest here but unhappily he insert in the November issue of he almanac another solemn assurance to the public that he be still alive and be fool enough to add that he be not only alive at the time he be write but be also alive on the day on which bickerstaff have assert that he be dead swift see he opportunity and in the most amusing of this series of tract proceed to prove that partridge under whatever delusion as to he continued existence he might be labor be most certainly dead and bury the tract here print by no means exhaust the literature of the partridge hoax but nothing else which appear be worth revive it be surprising that scott should include in swift 's work a vapid and pointless contribution attribute to a ` person of quality ' the effect of all this on poor partridge be most disastrous for three year he almanac be discontinue when it be revive in 1714 he have discover that he enemy be swift what comment he make will be find at the end of these tract partridge do not long survive the resuscitation of he almanac what have be fiction become fact on June 24th 1715 and he virtue and accomplishment delineate by a hand more friendly than swift 's be long decipherable in most respectable latin on he tomb in mortlake churchyard the partridge hoax have leave a permanent trace in we classical literature when in the spring of 1709 steele be about to start the _ tatler _ he think he could best secure the ear of the public by adopt the name with which englishman be then as familiar as a century and a half afterwards they become with the name of pickwick it be under the title of the _ lucubration of isaac bickerstaff _ that the essay which initiate the most attractive and popular form of we periodical literature appear the next tract gay 's _ present state of wit _ take up the history of we popular literature during the period which immediately succeed the discomfiture of poor partridge its author john gay who be as we need scarcely add one of the most eminent of the minor poet of the augustan age be at the time of its appearance almost entirely unknown bear in September 1685 at barnstaple of a respectable but decayed family he have receive a good education at the free grammar school of that place on leave school he have be apprentice to a silk mercer in london but he have polite taste and employ he leisure time in scribble verse and in frequent with he friend aaron hill the literary coffee-house in 1708 he publish a vapid and stupid parody suggest by john philip 's _ splendid shilling _ and _ cider _ entitle _ wine _ he next performance be the tract which be here print and which be date may 3rd 1711 it be write with skill and sprightliness and certainly show a very exact and extensive acquaintance with the journalistic world of those time and it be this which give it its value the best and most useful form perhaps which we remark on it can take will be to furnish it with a run commentary explain its allusion both to publication and to person it begin with a reference to the unhappy plight of dr king this be dr william king who be not to be confound with he contemporary and namesake the archbishop of dublin or the principal of st mary hall oxford but who may be best perhaps describe as the dr william king ` who could write verse in a tavern three hour after he could not speak ' he have long be a prominent figure among wit and humorist he most important recent performance have be he _ art of cookery _ and he _ art of love _ publish respectively in 1708 and in 1709 in the latter year he have much to the disgust of sir john soame issue some very amusing parody of the _ philosophical transaction _ which he entitle _ useful transaction in philosophy and other sort of learn _ to be continue as long as it could find buyer it cease apparently to find buyer and after reach three number have collapse when the _ examiner _ be start in August 1710 king be one of the chief contributor latterly however thing have be go very badly with this ` poor starve wit ' as swift call he he be either imprison or on the point of be imprison in the fleet but death free he from he trouble at the end of 1712 john ozell be perhaps the most ridiculous of the scribbler then before the public mature steadily for the _ dunciad _ where many year afterwards he find he proper place he rarely aspire beyond ` translation ' and the _ monthly amusement _ refer to be not as might be suppose a periodical but simply he frequent appearance as a translator gay next pass to periodical and newspaper de foe be treat as he be always treat by the wit pope 's line be well know and the only reference to he in swift be : ` the fellow who be pillory -- i forget he name ' posterity have do he more justice the ` poor _ review _ ' be of course the _ weekly review _ start by de foe in 1704 the first number of which appear on Saturday February 19th of that year it have be continue weekly and still continue till 1712 extend to nine volume eight of which be extant -lrb- 3 -rrb- the _ observator _ which be also describe as in its decline have be set up by john tutchin in imitation of the paper issue by sir roger l'estrange in 1681 its first number appear April 1st 1702 tutchin die in 1707 the paper be continue for the benefit of he widow under the management of george ridpath the editor of the _ fly post _ and it continue to linger on till 1712 when it be extinguish by the stamp tax the first number of the _ examiner _ appear on the 3rd of August 1710 and it be set up by the tory to oppose the _ tatler _ the chief contributor to it be dr king bolingbroke then henry st john prior atterbury and dr freind with no 14 -lrb- Thursday October 26th 1710 -rrb- swift assume the management and write thirty-two papers successively make it the most influential political journal in the kingdom the ` letter to crassus ' appear on February 1st 1711 and be write by swift to oppose the _ examiner _ the whig set up what after the second number they call the _ whig examiner _ the first number of which appear on September 14th 1710 it be continue weekly till October 12th five number appear all of which be with one exception perhaps write by addison so that gay 's conjecture -- if bickerstaff may be extend to include addison -- be correct the _ medley _ to which gay next pass be another whig organ the first number appear on August 5th 1710 and it be continue weekly till August 6th 1711 it be conduct by arthur mainware a man of family and fortune and a ardent whig with the assistance of steele anthony henley and oldmixon with the reference to the _ tatler _ we pass from obscurity into daylight since April 12th 1709 that delightful periodical have regularly appear three time a week with the two hundredth and seventy-first number on January 2nd 1711 it suddenly cease of the great surprise and disappointment cause by its cessation of the cause assign for it and of the high appreciation of all it have effect for moral and intellectual improvement and pleasure gay give a vivid picture what he say conjecturally about the reason for its discontinuance be so near the truth that we may suspect he have have some light on the subject from steele himself it be of course from the preface to the edition of the first three volume of the collect _ tatler _ publish in 1710 that gay derive what he say about the contribution of addison -lrb- though steele have not mention he by name in accordance no doubt with addison 's request -rrb- and about the verse of swift in all probability this be the first public association of addison 's name with the _ tatler _ the mr henley refer to be anthony henley a man of family and fortune and one of the most distinguish of the wit of that age to whom garth dedicated _ the dispensary _ in politics he be a rabid whig and it be he who describe swift as ' a beast for ever after the order of melchisedec ' gay have not be misinform for henley be the author of the first letter in no 26 and of the letter in no 193 under the character of downe the cessation of the _ tatler _ have be the signal for the appearance of several spurious papers purport to be new number one entitle itself no 272 be publish by one john baker another purport to be no 273 be by ` isaac bickerstaff junior ' then on January 6th appear what purported to be no 272 and 273 of the original issue with a letter from charle lillie one of the publisher of the original _ tatler _ later in January william harrison a _ protg _ of swift a young man whose name will be familiar to all who be acquaint with swift 's _ journal to stellum _ be encourage by swift to start a new _ tatler _ swift liberally assist he with note and not only contribute himself but induce congreve also to contribute a paper and this new _ tatler _ actually run to fifty-two number appear twice a week between January 13th and may 19th 1711 but feeble from the first it then collapse nor have the _ tatler _ be without rival in the two hundred and twenty-ninth number of the _ tatler _ addison enumerate he antagonist say ' i be threaten to be answer weekly _ tit for tat _ i be undermine by the _ whisperer _ scold at by a _ female tatler _ and slander by another of the same character under the title of _ atalanti _ ' to confine ourselves however to the publication mention by gay the _ growler _ appear on the 27th of January 1711 on the discontinuance of the _ tatler _ the _ whisperer _ be first publish on October 11th 1709 under the character of ` mr jenny distaff half-sister to isaac bickerstaff ' the _ tell tale _ appear to be a facetious title for the _ female tatler _ the first number of which appear on July 8th 1709 and be continue for a hundred and eleven number under the editorship of thoma baker till march 3rd 1710 the allusion in the postscript to the _ british apollo _ be to a paper entitle _ the british apollo : or curious amusement for the ingenious _ the first number of which appear on Friday march 13th 1708 the paper regularly continue on wednesday and friday till march 16th 1711 selection from this curious miscellany be afterwards print in three volume and run into three edition gay do not appear to be aware that this periodical have cease the reference in ` the two statesman of the last reign whose character be well express in they motto ' be to lord somer and the earl of halifax as what follow refer respectively to addison and steele the tract close with a reference to the _ spectator _ the first number of which have appear on the first of the precede march gay 's brochure attract the attention of swift who thus refer to it in he _ journal to stellum _ may 14th 1711 : ` dr freind be with I and pull out a two-penny pamphlet just publish call _ the state of wit _ the author seem to be a whig yet he speak very highly of a paper call the _ examiner _ and say the suppose author of it be dr swift but above all he praise the _ tatler _ and _ spectator _ ' the two tract which follow consist of the life of addison which form the preface to addison 's collect work publish by tickell in 1721 and of the dedicatory epistle prefix by steele to a edition of addison 's _ drummer _ in 1722 to the student of the literary history of those time they be of great interest and importance of all addison 's friend steele have long be the most intimate of the younger man whom he have take under he patronage tickell be the most loyal and the most attach while still at oxford he have express he admiration of addison in extravagant term : on arrive in london he make he acquaintance tickell be a accomplished poet and man of letter and though not a profound a graceful scholar addison be please with a homage which be worth accept as he rise he _ protg _ rise with he on he appointment as chief secretary in ireland he take tickell with he when he be appoint secretary of state he choose he as under secretary and shortly before he death make he he literary executor instruct he to collect he writings in a final and authentic edition this for reason which will be explain directly be a task of no small difficulty but to this task tickell loyally address himself in the spring of 1721 appear in four sumptuous quarto the collect edition of addison 's work it be preface by the biography which be here reprint and to the biography be append that noble and pathetic elegy which will make tickell 's name as immortal as addison 's there can be very little doubt that steele have be greatly distressed and hurt by the rupture of the friendship which have so long exist between himself and addison but that tickell should have take he place in addison 's affection must have be inexpressibly galling to he naturally irritated he irritation have no doubt be intensify by addison appoint tickell under secretary of state and still more by he make he he literary executor -- office which steel might naturally have expect have all go well to fill himself it would not have be in human nature that he could regard tickell with any other feeling than hostility and jealousy tickell 's omission of the _ drummer _ from addison 's work be in all probability -- such at least be the impression which the letter make on I -- a mere pretext for the gratification of personal spite there be nothing to justify the interpretation which he put on tickell 's word all that steele here say about addison he have say publicly and quite as emphatically before as tickell have record as steele have in tickell 's own word give to addison ` the honor of the most applaud piece ' it be absurd to accuse tickell of insinuate that addison wish he papers to be marked because he be afraid steele would assume the credit of these piece in one important particular he flatly contradict himself at the beginning he ask ` whether it be a decent and reasonable thing that work write as a great part of mr addison 's be in correspondence with I ought to have be publish without my review of the catalogue of they ' three page afterward it appear that in compliance with the request of addison deliver to he by tickell he do mark with he own hand those _ tatler _ which be insert in addison 's work -- a statement of tickell 's but a statement to which steele take no exception so far from attempt to disparage steele tickell do ample justice to he and to accuse he of insensibility to addison 's virtue and of cold indifference to he personally be a charge refute not only by all we know of tickell but by every page in the tract itself many of the objection which he make to tickell 's remark be too absurd to discuss from nothing indeed which tickell say but from one of steele 's own admission it be impossible not to draw a conclusion very derogatory to steele 's honesty and to make we suspect that he sensitiveness be cause by he own uneasy conscience : ` what i never do declare be mr addison 's i have he direct injunction to hide ' this certainly seem to imply that steele have allow himself to be credit with what really belong to he friend a month after addison 's death he have write in great alarm to tonson on hearing that it have be propose to separate addison 's papers in the _ tatler _ from he own he base he objection it be true on the pecuniary injury which he and he family would suffer but this be plainly mere subterfuge the truth probably be that steele wish to leave as undefined as possible what belong to addison and what belong to himself that he be greatly annoy when he find that they respective share be by addison 's own or at least he alleged request to be define that in he assignation of the papers he have not be quite honest and that know this he suspect that tickell know it too there be nothing to support steele 's assertion that it be at he instigation that addison distinguish he contribution to the _ spectator _ and the _ guardian _ addison as he last injunction show must have contemplate a collective edition of he work and must have desire therefore that they should be identify steele 's ambition no doubt be that he and he friend should go down to posterity together but the appointment of tickell instead of himself as addison 's literary executor dash this hope to the ground few thing in literary biography be more pathetic than the estrangement between addison and steele they have play as boy together they have for nearly a quarter of a century share each other 's burden and the burden have not be light in misfortune and in prosperity in business and in pleasure they have never be part the wisdom and prudence of addison have more than once be the salvation of steele what he know of book and learn have be almost entirely derive from addison 's conversation what moral virtue he have from addison 's influence and he have repay this with a admiration and affection which border on idolatry a more generous and genial a more kindly a more warm-hearted man than steele never live and it be easy to conceive what he feeling must have be when he find he friend estrange from he and a rival in he place there be much to excuse what this letter to congreve plainly betray but excuse be not justification tickell have a delicate and difficult task to perform : a duty to he dead friend which be paramount a duty to steele and a duty to himself and he succeed in perform each with admirable tact whether tickell ever make any reply to steele 's stricture i have not be able to discover we pass now from the literary pamphlet to the extract and excerpt illustrate the condition of the church and the clergy at the end of the seventeenth and about the first half of the eighteenth century they be of particular interest not only in themselves but in they relation to swift and macaulay -- to swift as a church reformer to macaulay as a social historian few historical question in we own time provoke more controversy than the famous page delineate the clergy who accord to macaulay be typical of they order about the time of the restoration the first excerpt be from chamberlayne 's _ anglia notitium _ the author of that work edward chamberlayne be bear on the 13th of December 1616 he be educate at oxford where he graduate as ba in April 1638 for a short time he be reader in rhetoric to the university but on the break out of the civil war he leave for the continent where he visit nearly every country in europe at the restoration he return and about 1675 after have be secretary to the earl of carlisle he become tutor to the king 's natural son henry fitzroy afterwards duke of grafton and subsequently instructor in english to prince george of denmark he be also one of the earliest fellow of the royal society he die at chelsea in may 1703 in 1669 he publish anonymously _ anglia notitium or the present state of england with diver reflection upon the ancient state therefor _ a work no doubt suggest by and apparently model on the well-known _ l'estat nouveau de la france _ the work contain more statistics than reflection and be exactly what its title imply -- a succinct account of england beginning with its name its climate its topography and give information now invaluable about everything include in its constitution and in its economy the extract print here be as be indicate from pp 383-389 and p 401 the work pass through two edition in the year of its appearance the second bear the author 's name and at the time of chamberlayne 's death it have with successive amplification reach its twentieth edition of a very different order to chamberlayne 's work be the remarkable tract which follow the author john eachard be bear about 1636 at what date be doubtful but he be admit into catherine hall cambridge in may 1653 become fellow of the hall in 1658 he be choose on the death of dr lightfoot master he perfectly uneventful life close on the 7th of July 1697 personally he be a facetious and agreeable man and have the reputation of be rather a wit and humorist than a divine and scholar baker complain of he inferiority as a preacher and swift observe ` that man who be happy enough at ridicule be sometimes perfectly stupid upon grave subject ' give eachard as a instance _ the grounds and occasion of the contempt of the clergy and religion enquire into in a letter write to rl _ appear anonymously in 1670 this anonymity eachard carefully preserve during the controversy which it occasion it be difficult to understand how any one after read the preface could have misunderstand the purpose of the book but eachard 's fate be swift 's fate afterwards though there be more excuse for the high church party miss the point of the _ tale of a tub _ than for the clergy generally miss that of eachard 's plea for they ridicule be always a dangerous ally especially when direct against a institution or community for man naturally identify themselves with the body of which they be member and resent as individual what reflect on they collectively when one of the opponent of barnabus oley in he preface to herbert 's _ country parson _ observe : ` the pretence of you book be to _ show _ the occasion you book be _ become _ the occasion of the contempt of god 's minister ' he express what the majority of the clergy feel the storm burst at once and the storm rage for month ' i have have ' write eachard in one of he many rejoinder ` as many several name as the grand seignior have title of honor for set aside the vulgar and familiar one of rogue rascal dog and thief -lrb- which may be take by way of endearment as well as out of prejudice and offence -rrb- as also those of more certain signification as malicious rogue ill-natured rascal lay dog and spiteful thief ' he have also he say be call rebel traitor scot sadducee and socinian among the most elaborate reply to he work be : _ a answer to a letter of enquiry into the ground _ etc 1671 _ a vindication of the clergy from the contempt impose upon they by the author of the grounds _ etc 1672 _ hieragonisticon or corah 's doom be a answer to _ etc 1672 _ a answer to two letter of tb _ etc 1673 the occasional reference to it in the theological literature of these time be indeed innumerable many affect to treat he as a mere buffoon -- the concoctor as one bitterly put it of ' a pretty fardle of tale bundle together and they have have the hap to fall into such hand as have rather lose a friend not to say they country than a jest ' anthony wood write at the time of its appearance class it with ` the foolery playe poem and drolling book ' with which as he bitterly complain people be ` take with ' coupling with it marvell 's _ rehearsal transpose _ and butler 's _ hudibra _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- to some of he opponent eachard reply of he method of conduct controversy in which it be clear that he perfectly revel i give a short specimen it be from he letter to the author of _ hieragonisticon _ : -- ` you may possibly think sir that i have read you book but if you do you be most mistaken for as long as i can get tolambu 's _ history of mustard _ frederigo _ devastation of pepper the dragon _ with cut mandringo 's _ pismire rebuffet _ and _ retro-confounded be qui I dubitat or a flap against the maggot of heresie efflorescentina flosculorum _ or a choice collection of f -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- withers _ poem _ or the like i do not intend to meddle with it alas sir i be as unlikely to read you book that i can not get down the title no more than a duck can swallow a yoked heifer ' -- and then follow a imitation of gulp strain at the divide syllable of hieragonisticon there be no reason to suspect the sincerity of eachard or to doubt that he be in he own word a honest and hearty wisher that ` the best of the clergy might for ever continue as they be rich and learn and that the rest might be very useful and well esteem in they profession ' to describe the work as ' a series of jocose caricature -- as churchill babington in he animadversion on macaulay 's _ history _ do -- be absurd eachard be evidently a man of strong common sense of much shrewdness a close observer and one who have acquaint himself exactly and extensively with the subject which he treat but he be a humorist and like swift sometimes give the rein to he humor it must be remember that he remark apply only to the inferior clergy and there can be no doubt that since the reformation they have as a body sink very low chamberlayne have no motive for exaggeration but the language he use in describe they be stronger even than eachard 's swift have no motive for exaggeration and yet he picture of corusode and eugenio in he _ essay on the fate of clergyman _ and what we gather from he _ project for the advancement of religion _ he _ letter to a young clergyman _ and what may be gather generally from he writings very exactly corroborate eachard 's account the lighter literature of the later seventeenth and of the first half of the eighteenth century teem with proof of the contempt to which they ignorance and poverty expose they to the testimony of oldham and steele and to the authority quote by macaulay and mr lecky may be add innumerable passage from the _ observator _ from de foe 's _ review _ from pepy -lrb- 5 -rrb- from baxter 's _ life _ of himself from archbishop sharp 's _ life _ from burnet and many other it be remarkable that eachard say nothing about two cause which undoubtedly contribute to degrade the church in the eye of the laity : its close association with party politics and the spread of latitudinarianism a conspicuous epoch in which be mark some twenty-six year later in the bangorian controversy the appearance of the first volume of macaulay 's _ history _ in 1848 again bring eachard 's work into prominence macaulay 's famous description of the clergy of the seventeenth century in he third chapter be base mainly on eachard 's account the clergy and orthodox laity of we own day be as angry with eachard 's interpreter as they predecessor nearly two century before have be with eachard himself the controversy begin seriously after some preliminary skirmishing in the newspaper and lighter review with mr churchill babington 's _ mr macaulay 's character of the clergy in the latter part of the seventeenth century consider _ publish shortly after the appearance of the _ history _ what mr babington and those whom he represent forget be precisely what eachard 's opponent have forget that it be not the clergy universally who have be describe for macaulay like eachard have distinguish but the clergy as represent by its proletariat if eachard have occasionally give the rein to humor macaulay have occasionally perhaps give they to rhetoric but of the substantial accuracy of both there can be no doubt at all on the intelligent discriminate friend of the church eachard 's work have something of the same effect as jeremy collier 's _ short view of the profaneness and immorality of the english stage _ have in another sphere it direct serious attention to what all thoughtful and right-feeling people must have feel to be a national scandal it be a appeal to sentiment and reason on matter with respect to which in this country at least such appeal be seldom make in vain it do not indeed lead immediately to practical reform but it advance the cause of reform by inspiring and bring other initiator into the field and pre-eminent among these be swift swift be evidently well acquaint with eachard 's work in the apology prefix to the fourth edition of the _ tale of a tub _ in 1710 he speak of eachard with great respect contemptuously explain that he have no intention of answer the attack which have be make on the _ tale _ he observe : ` when dr eachard write he book about the _ contempt of the clergy _ number of these answerer immediately start up whose memory if he have not keep alive by he reply it would now be utterly unknown that he be ever answer at all ' no one who be familiar with swift 's tract on church reform can doubt that he have read eachard 's work with minute attention and be greatly influence by it in he _ project for the advancement of religion _ he largely attribute the scandalous immorality everywhere prevalent to the insufficiency of religious instruction and to the low character of the clergy the result mainly of they ignorance and poverty he _ letter to a young clergyman _ be little more than a didactic adaptation of that portion of eachard 's work which deal with the character and education of the clergy the _ essay on the fate of clergyman _ be another study from the _ contempt _ while the fragment of the tract which he have begin _ concern that universal hatred which prevail against the clergy _ bring we still more closely to eachard the likeness between they can not be trace further they be both it be true humorist but there be little in common between the austere and bitter yet at the same time delicious flavor of the one and the trenchant and graphic but coarse and rollicking humor of the other the essay reprint from the _ tatler _ give humorous expression to a grievance which not only wound the pride of the clergy but touch they on a equally sensitive part -- the stomach it be not usual for the chaplain in great house to remain at table for the second course when the sweet be bring in he be expect to retire as macaulay put it : ` he might fill himself with the corn beef and carrot but as soon as the tart and cheese-cake make they appearance he quit he seat and stand aloof till he be summon to return thanks for the repast from a great part of which he have be exclude ' gay refer to this churlish custom in the second book of _ trivia _ : -- ` cheese that the table 's closing rite deny and bid I with th ' unwilling chaplain rise ' possibly the custom originally arise not from any wish to mark the social inferiority of the chaplain but because he presence be a check on conversation it must be own however that this would have be more intelligible have he retire not with the corn beef and carrot but with the lady the passage quote by steele from oldham be from he _

and most indefatigable of philanthropist to he fellow-citizen be the establishment of what be commonly know as _ poor richard 's almanack _ of this periodical and of the particular number of it which be here reprint franklin give the follow account in he autobiography : -- ` in 1732 i first publish a almanack under the name of _ richard saunder _ it be continue by I about twenty-five year and

ten thousand and observe that it be generally read -lrb- scarce any neighborhood in the province be without it -rrb- i consider it as a proper vehicle for convey instruction among the common people who buy scarcely any other book i therefore fill all the little space that occur between the remarkable day in the calendar with proverbial sentence chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procure wealth and thereby secure virtue it be more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly as to use here one of these proverb it be hard for a empty sack to stand upright these proverb which contain the wisdom of many age and nation i assemble and form into a connected discourse prefix to the _ almanack _ of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attend a

in britain on a large sheet of paper to be stick up in house two translation be make of it in france and great number buy by the clergy to distribute grati among they poor parishioner and tenant in

continue regularly to appear the last number be that for the year 1758 and have for preface the discourse which become so extraordinarily popular the name assume by franklin be no doubt borrow from that of richard saunder a well-known astrologer of the seventeenth century of whom there be a notice in the _ dictionary of national biography _ but mr leicester ford -lrb- 7 -rrb- say that it be the

he brother robert sidney who be the first earl of leicester of that familiar name my dear brother for the money you have receive assure yourself -lrb- for it be true -rrb- there be nothing i spend so pleaseth I as that which be for you if ever i have ability you shall find it so : if not yet shall not any brother living be better beloved than you of I i can not write now to n white do you excuse I for he nephew they be but passion in my father which we must bear with reverence : but i be sorry he should return till he have the circuit of he travel for you shall never have such a servant as he would prove use you own discretion for you countenance i would -lrb- for no cause -rrb- have it diminish in germany in italy you greatest expense must be upon worthy man and not upon household look to you diet sweet robin and hold up you heart in courage and virtue truly great part of my comfort be in you i know not myself what i mean by bravery in you so greatly you may see i condemn you be careful of yourself and i shall never have care i have write to master savell i wish you keep still together he be a excellent man and there may if you list pass good exercise betwixt you and master nevell there be great expectation of you both for method of write history boden have write at large you may read he and gather out of many word some matter this i think in haste a story be either to be consider as a story or as a treatise which besides that addeth many thing for profit and ornament as a story he be nothing but a narration of thing do with the beginning cause and appendice thereof in that kind you method must be to have _ seriem temporum _ very exactly which the chronology of melancthon tarchagnora languet and such other will help you to then to consider by that as you note yourself xenophon to follow thucydide so doth thucydide follow herodotus and diodorus siculus follow xenophon so generally do the roman story follow the greek and the particular story of the present monarchy follow the roman in that kind you have principally to note the example of virtue and vice with they good or evil success the establishment or rain of great estate with the cause the time and circumstance of the law then write of the entering and ending of war and therein the stratagem against the enemy and the discipline upon the soldier and thus much as a very historiographer besides this the historian make himself a discourser for profit and a orator yea a poet sometimes for ornament a orator in make excellent oration _  re na _ which be to be marked but marked with the note of rhetorical remembrance : a poet in painting for the effect the motion the whispering of the people which though in disputation one might say be true -- yet who will mark they well shall find they taste of a poetical vein and in that kind be gallantly to be mark -- for though perchance they be not so yet it be enough they might be so the last point which tend to teach profit be of a discourser which name i give to whosoever speak _ non simpliciter de facto sed de qualitatibus et circumstantiis facti _ : and that be it which make I and many other rather note much with we pen than with we mind because we leave all these discourse to the confused trust of we memory because they be not tie to the tenor of a question : as philosopher use sometimes place the divine in tell he opinion and reason in religion sometimes the lawyer in show the cause and benefit of law sometimes a natural philosopher in set down the cause of any strange thing which the story bind he to speak of but most commonly a moral philosopher either in the ethic part where he set forth virtue or vice and the nature of passion or in the politic when he doth -lrb- as often he doth -rrb- meddle sententiously with matter of estate again sometimes he give precept of war both offensive and defensive and so lastly not profess any art as he matter lead he he deal with all art which -- because it carrieth the life of a lively example -- it be wonderful what light it give to the art themselves so as the great civilian help themselves with the discourse of the historian so do soldier and even philosopher and astronomer but that i wish herein be this that when you read any such thing you straight bring it to he head not only of what art but by you logical subdivision to the next member and parcel of the art and so -- as in a table -- be it witty word of which tacitus be full sentence of which livy or similitude whereof plutarch : straight to lay it up in the right place of he storehouse -- as either military or more specially defensive military or more particularly defensive by fortification -- and so lay it up so likewise in politic matter and such a little table you may easily make wherewith i would have you ever join the historical part which be only the example of some stratagem or good counsel or such like this write i to you in great haste of method without method : but with more leisure and study -- if i do not find some book that satisfy -- i will venture to write more largely of it unto you master savell will with ease help you to set down such a table of remembrance to yourself and for you sake i perceive he will do much and if ever i be able i will deserve it of he one only thing as it come into my mind let I remember you of that you consider wherein the historian excelleth and that to note : as dion nicaeus in the search the secret of government tacitus in the pithy opening of the venom of wickedness and so of the rest my time -- exceedingly short -- will suffer I to write no more leisurely stephen can tell you who stand with I while i be write now dear brother take delight likewise in the mathematical master savell be excellent in they i think you understand the sphere if you do i care little for any more astronomy in you arithmetic and geometry i would wish you well see in : so as both in matter of number and measure you might have a feeling and active judgment i would you do bear the mechanical instrument wherein the dutch excel i write this to you as one that for myself have give over the delight in the world but wish to you as much if not more than to myself so you can speak and write latin not barbarously i never require great study in ciceronianism the chief abuse of oxford _ quus dum verba sectantur re ipsa negligunt _ my toyful

estate of england remain you shall not fail of it use it to you best profit my lord of leicester send you # 40 as i understand by stephen and promiseth he will continue that stipend yearly at the least then that be above common in any case write largely and diligently unto he : for in truth i have good proof that he mean to be every way good unto you the odd # 30 shall come with the # 100 or else my father and i will jarle now sweet brother take a delight to keep and increase you music you will not believe what a want i find of it in my melancholy time at horsemanship when you exercise it read crison claudio and a book that be call _ la gloria de l'cavallo _ withal : that you may join the thorough contemplation of it with the exercise : and so shall you profit more in a month than other in a year and mark the bitting saddle and cur -lrb- ry -rrb- ing of horse i would by the way you worship would learn a better hand you write worse than i : and i write evil enough once again have a care of you diet and consequently of you complexion remember _ gratior est venien in pulchro corpore virtus _ now sir for news i refer myself to this bearer he can tell you how idly we look on we neighbor 's fire : and nothing be happen notable at home save only drake 's return of which yet i know not the secret point : but about the world he have be and rich he be return portugal we say be lose and to conclude my eye be almost close up overwatch with tedious business god bless you sweet boy and accomplish the joyful hope i conceive of you once again commend I to master nevell master savell and honest harry white and bid he be merry when you play at weapon i would have you get thick cap and bracer -lrb- _ glove _ -rrb- and play out you play lustily for indeed tick and dalliance be nothing in earnest : for the time of the one and the other greatly differ and use as well the blow as the thrust it be good in itself and besides increaseth you breath and strength and will make you a strong man at the tourney and barrier first in any case practice the single sword and then with the dagger let no day pass without a hour or two of such exercise the rest study or confer diligently : and so shall you come home to my comfort and credit lord how i have babble once again farewell dearest brother you most loving and careful brother philip sidney at leicester house this 18th of October 1580 franci mere ma _ sketch of english literature painting and music up to September _ 1598 _ a comparative discourse of we english poet -lrb- painter and musician -rrb- with the greek latin and italian poet -lrb- painter and musician -rrb- _ as greece have three poet of great antiquity orpheus linus and musaeus and italy other three ancient poet livius andronicus ennius and plautus : so have england three ancient poet chaucer gower and lydgate as homer be repute the prince of greek poet and petrarch of italian poet : so chaucer be account the god of english poet as homer be the first that adorn the greek tongue with true quantity : so -lrb- william langland the author of -rrb- _ pier plowman _ be the first that observe the true quantity of we verse without the curiosity of rhyme ovid writ a chronicle from the beginning of the world to he own time that be to the reign of augustus the emperor : so have hard the chronicler -lrb- after he manner of old harsh rhyming -rrb- from adam to he time that be to the reign of king edward iv as sotade maronite the iambic poet give himself wholly to write impure and lascivious thing : so skelton -lrb- i know not for what great worthiness surname the poet laureate -rrb- apply he wit to scurrility and ridiculous matter such -lrb- as -rrb- among the greek be call _ pantomimi _ with we buffoon as consalvo perez that excellent learn man and secretary to king philip -lrb- ii -rrb- of spain in translate the ulyss -lrb- _ odyssey _ -rrb- of homer out of greek into spanish have by good judgement avoid the fault of rhyme although -lrb- he have -rrb- not fully hit perfect and true versify : so have henry howard that true and noble earl of surrey in translate the fourth book of virgil 's _ aenea _ : whom michael drayton in he _ england 's heroical epistle _ have eternize for a _ epistle to he fair geraldine _ as these neoteric jovianus pontanus politianus marullus tarchaniota the two stroza the father and the son palingenius mantuanus philelphus quintianus stoa and germanus brixius have obtain renown and good place among the ancient latin poet : so also these englishman be latin poet walter haddon nichola carr gabriel harvey christopher ockland thoma newton with he _ leland _ thoma watson thoma campion -lrb- john -rrb- brunswerd and willey have attain -lrb- a -rrb- good report and honorable advancement in the latin empire -lrb- of letter -rrb- as the greek tongue be make famous and eloquent by homer hesiod euripide aeschylus sophocle pindarus phocylide and aristophane and the latin tongue by virgil ovid horace silius italicus lucanus lucretius ausonius and claudianus : so the english tongue be mightily enriched and gorgeously invest in rare ornament and resplendent habiliment by sir philip sydney spenser daniel drayton warner shakespeare marlow and chapman as xenophon who do imitate so excellently as to give we _ effigiem justus imperius _ the portraiture of a just empire under the name of _ cyrus _ -lrb- as cicero saith of he -rrb- make therein a absolute heroical poem and as heliodorus write in prose he sugared invention of that picture of love in _ theagine and cariclea _ and yet both excellent admire poet : so sir philip sidney writ he immortal poem _ the countess of pembroke 's arcadium _ in prose and yet we rarest poet as sexto propertius say _ nescio quid magis nascitur iliade _ : so i say of spenser 's _ fairy queen _ i know not what more excellent or exquisite poem may be write as achille have the advantage of hector because it be he fortune to be extol and renown by the heavenly verse of homer : so spenser 's _ eliza the fairy queen _ have the advantage of all the queen in the world to be eternize by so divine a poet as theocritus be famouse for he _ idyllium _ in greek and virgil for he _ eclogue _ in latin : so spenser they imitator in he _ shepherd calendar _ be renown for the like argument and honor for fine poetical invention and most exquisite wit as parthenius nicaeus excellently sing the praise of _ arete _ : so daniel have divinely sonnett the matchless beauty of _ delium _ as every one mourneth when he heareth of the lamentable plangor -lrb- plaint -rrb- of -lrb- the -rrb- thracian orpheus for he dearest _ eurydice _ : so every one passionateth when he readeth the afflict death of daniel 's distressed _ rosamond _ as lucan have mournfully depaint the civil war of pompey and caesar : so have daniel the civil war of york and lancaster and drayton the civil war of edward ii and the baron as virgil doth imitate catullus in the like matter of _ ariadne _ for he story of queen _ dido _ : so michael drayton doth imitate ovid in he _ england 's heroical epistle _ as sophocle be call a bee for the sweetness of he tongue : so in charle fitz-geffry 's _ drake _ drayton be term golden-mouthed for the purity and preciousness of he style and phrase as accius marcus atilius and milithus be call _ tragaediographi _ because they writ tragedy : so we may truly term michael drayton _ tragaediographus _ : for he passionate penning -lrb- _ the poem of _ -rrb- the downfall of valiant robert of normandy chaste matilda and great gaveston as joanne honterus in latin verse write three book of cosmography with geographical table so michael drayton be now in pen in english verse a poem call _ poly-olbion _ -lrb- which be -rrb- geographical and hydrographical of all the forest wood mountain fountain river lake flood bath -lrb- _ spa _ -rrb- and spring that be in england as aulus persius flaccus be report among all writer to -lrb- have -rrb- be of a honest life and upright conversation : so michael drayton _ quem toty honori et amoris causa nomino _ among scholar soldier poet and all sort of people be hold for a man of virtuous disposition honest conversation and well govern carriage : which be almost miraculous among good wit in these decline and corrupt time when there be nothing but roguery in villainous man and when cheating and craftiness be count the cleanest wit and soundest wisdom as decius ausonius gallus _ in libri fastorum _ pen the occurrence of the world from the first creation of it to this time that be to the reign of the emperor gratian : so warner in he absolute _ albion 's england _ have most admirably pen the history of he own country from noah to he time that be to the reign of queen elizabeth i have hear he term of the best wit of both we university we english homer as euripide be the most sententious among the greek poet : so be warner among we english poet as the soul of euphorbus be think to live in pythagora : so the sweet witty soul of ovid life in mellifluous and honey-tongued shakespeare witness he _ venus and adoni _ he _ lucrece _ he sugared _ sonnet _ among he private friend & c as plautus and seneca be account the best for comedy and tragedy among the latin : so shakespeare among the english be the most excellent in both kind for the stage for comedy : witness he _ gentleman of verona _ he -lrb- _ comedy of _ -rrb- _ error _ he _ love 's labor 's lose _ he _ love 's labor 's win _ -lrb- _ all 's well that end well _ -rrb- he _ midsummer night 's dream _ and he _ merchant of venice _ for tragedy : he _ richard ii richard iii henry iv king john titus andronicus _ and he _ romeo and juliet _ as epius stolo say that the muse would speak with plautus 's tongue if they would speak latin : so i say that the muse would speak with shakespeare 's fine file phrase if they would speak english as musaeus who write the love of hero and leander have two excellent scholar thamyra and hercule so have he -lrb- musaeus -rrb- in england two excellent poet imitator of he in the same argument and subject christopher marlow and george chapman as ovid saith of he work _ famque opus exegi quod nec fovis ira nec ignis nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere vetustas _ and as horace saith of he _ exegus monumentum oere perennius regalique situ pyramidum altius quod non imber edax non aquilo impoten possit disruere aut innumerabili annorum series et fuga temporum _ : so i say severally of sir philip sidney 's spenser 's daniel 's drayton 's shakespeare 's and warner 's work _ non fovi ira : imbre : mar : ferrum : flamma : senectus : hoc opus unda : lue : turbo : venena ruent et quanquam ad pulcherrimum hoc opus evertendum tres illi dii conspirabunt chronus vulcanus et pater ipse gentis non taman annorum series non flamma nec ensis aeternum potuit hoc abolere decus _ as italy have dante boccace -lrb- boccacio -rrb- petrarch tasso celiano and ariosto : so england have matthew roydon thoma atchelow thoma watson thoma kyd robert greene and george peele as there be eight famous and chief language hebrew greek latin syriac arabic italian spanish and french so there be eight notable several kind of poet -lrb- 1 -rrb- heroic -lrb- 2 -rrb- lyric -lrb- 3 -rrb- tragic -lrb- 4 -rrb- comic -lrb- 5 -rrb- satiric -lrb- 6 -rrb- iambic -lrb- 7 -rrb- elegiac and -lrb- 8 -rrb- pastoral -lrb- 1 -rrb- as homer and virgil among the greek and latin be the chief heroic poet : so spenser and warner be we chief heroical maker -lrb- 2 -rrb- as pindarus anacreon and callimachus among the greek and horace and cutallus among the latin be the best lyric poet : so in this faculty the best among we poet be spenser who excelleth in all kind daniel drayton shakespeare breton -lrb- 3 -rrb- as these tragic poet flourish in greece : aeschylus euripide sophocle alexander aetolus achaeus erithrioeus astydama atheniensis apollodorus tarsensis nicomachus phrygius thespi atticus and timon apolloniate and these among the latin accius marcus atilius pomponus secundus and seneca : so these be we best for tragedy the lord buckhurst doctor leg of cambridge doctor ede of oxford master edward ferris the author -lrb- s -rrb- of the _ mirror for magistrate _ marlow peele watson kyd shakespeare drayton chapman decker and benjamin johnson as marcus anneus lucanus writ two excellent tragedy one call _ medea _ the other _ de incendio trojoe cum priami calamitate _ : so doctor leg have pen two famous tragedy the one of _ richard iii _ the other of _ the destruction of jerusalem _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- the best poet for comedy among the greek be these : menander aristophane eupolis atheniensis alexis terius nicostratus amipsias atheniensis anaxandrides rhodeus aristonymus archippus atheniensis and callia atheniensis and among the latin plautus terence naevius sextus turpilius licinius imbrex and virgilius romanus : so the best for comedy amongst we be edward -lrb- vere -rrb- earl of oxford doctor gager of oxford master rowley once a rare scholar of learn pembroke hall in cambridge master edwarde one of she majesty 's chapel eloquent and witty john lilly lodge gascoigne greene shakespeare thoma nash thoma heywood anthony munday we best plotter chapman porter wilson hathway and henry chettle -lrb- 5 -rrb- as horace lucilius juvenal persius and lucullus be the best for satire among the latin : so with we in the same faculty these be chief -lrb- william langland the author of -rrb- _ pier plowman _ -lrb- t -rrb- lodge -lrb- joseph -rrb- hall of emmanuel college in cambridge -lrb- _ afterwards bishop of norwich _ -rrb- -lrb- john marston -rrb- the author of _ pygmalion 's image and certain satire _ the author of _ skialetheium _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- among the greek i will name but two for iambic archilochus parius and hipponax ephesius : so amongst we i name but two iambical poet gabriel harvey and richard stanyhurst because i have see no more in this kind -lrb- 7 -rrb- as these be famous among the greek for elegy melanthus mymnerus colophonius olympius mysius parthenius nicoeus phileta cous theogene megarensis and pigre halicarnassoeus and these among the latin maecena ovid tibullus propertius c valgius cassius severus and clodius sabinus : so these be the most passionate among we to bewail and bemoan the perplexity of love henry howard earl of surrey sir thoma wyatt the elder sir franci bryan sir philip sidney sir walter raleigh sir edward dyer spenser daniel drayton shakespeare whetstone gascoigne samuel page

aminta gaudium _ and _ walsingham 's meliboeus _ be the best for pastoral : so amongst we the best in this kind be sir philip sidney master challoner spenser stephen gosson abraham fraunce and barnfield these and many other epigrammatist the latin tongue have q catullus porcius licinius quintus cornificius martial cnoeus getulicus and witty sir thoma more : so in english we have these heywood drant kendal bastard davy as noble maecena that spring from the etruscan king not only grace poet by he bounty but also by be a poet himself and as jame vi now king of scotland be not only a favourer of poet but a poet as my friend master richard barnfeld have in this distich pass well record the king of scot now live be a poet as he _ lepanto _ and he _ fury _ show it : so elizabeth we

-lrb- which amount to above # 43 for every verse -rrb- : so learn mary the honorable countess of pembroke -lrb- and -rrb- the noble sister of the immortal sir philip sidney be very liberal unto poet besides she be a most delicate poet of whom i may say as antipater sidonius writeth of sappho : _ dulcium mnemosyne demiran carmina sapphus quaesivit decima pieris unde foret _ among other in time past poet have these favourer augustus maecena sophocle germanicus a emperor a nobleman a senator and a captain : so of later time poet have -lrb- have -rrb- these patron robert king of sicily the great king franci -lrb- i -rrb- of france king jame of scotland and queen elizabeth of england as in former time two great cardinal bemba and biena do countenance poet : so of late year two great preacher have give they they right hand in fellowship beza and melancthon as the learn philosopher fracastorius and scaliger have highly prize they : so have the eloquent orator pontanus and muretus very gloriously estimate they as georgius buchananus ' _ jepthae _ amongst all modern tragedy be able to abide the touch of aristotle 's precept and euripide 's example : so be bishop watson 's _

epigram _ out of -lrb- the -rrb- greek and doctor johnson for he _ frog-fight _ out of homer and watson for he _ antigone _ out of sophocle have get good commendation : so these versifier for they

googe for palingenius 's -lrb- _ zodiac of life _ -rrb- turberville for ovid 's _ epistle _ and mantuan and chapman for he inchoate homer as the latin have these emblematist andrea alciatus reusnerus

manifest in he challenge at the _ swan _ on the bank side as achille tortured the dead body of hector and as antonius and he wife fulvium torment the lifeless corpse of cicero so gabriel harvey have show the same inhumanity to greene that lie full low in he grave as eupoli of athen use great liberty in tax the vice of man : so doth thoma nash witness the brood of the harvey as actaeon be worry of he own hound : so be tom nash of he _ isle of dog _ dog be the death of euripide but be not disconsolate gallant young juvenal linus the son of apollo die the same death yet god forbid that so brave a

another day _ durato et temet rebus servato secundis _ as anacreon die by the pot : so george peele by the pox as archesilaus prytanoeus perish by wine at a drunken feast as hermippus testifieth in diogene : so robert greene die by a surfeit take of pickled herring and rhenish wine as witnesseth thoma nash who be at the fatal banquet as jodelle a french tragical poet be a epicure and a atheist make a pitiful end : so we tragical poet marlow for he epicurism and atheism have a tragical death as you may read of this marlow more at large in the _ theater of god 's judgment _ in the 25th chapter entreat of _ epicure and atheist _ as the poet lycophron be shoot to death by a certain rival of he : so christopher marlow be stab to death by a baudy servingman a rival of he in he lewd love _ painter _ apelle paint a mare and a dog so lively -lrb- _ lifelike _ -rrb- that horse and dog pass by would neigh and bark at they he grow so famous for he excellent art that great alexander come

greece moreover have these painter timante phidia polignotus paneus bularchus eumarus cimon cleonceus pythi appollodorus atheniensis aristide thebanus nicophane perseus antiphilus and nicearchus : so in england we have also these william and franci segar brethren thoma and john bette lockey lyne peake peter cole arnolde marcus jacque de bray cornelius peter golchi hieronimo and peter van de velde as lysippus praxitele and pyrgotele be excellent engraver : so we have these engraver roger christopher switser and cure _ music _ the loadstone draweth iron unto it but the stone of ethiopium call _ theamede _ driveth it away : so there be a kind of music that doth assuage and appease the affection and a kind that doth kindle and provoke the passion as there be no law that have sovereignty over love so there be no heart that have rule over music but music subdue it as one day take from we the credit of another : so one strain of music extinct -lrb- _ extinguish _ -rrb- the pleasure of another as the heart ruleth over all the member : so music overcometh the heart as beauty be not beauty without virtue : so music be not music without art as all thing love they likes : so the more curious ear the delicatest music as too much speaking hurt too much galling smart so too much music glut and distempereth as plato and aristotle be account prince in philosophy and logic hippocrate and galen in physic ptolomy in astromony euclid in geometry and cicero in eloquence : so boetius be esteem a prince and captain in music as priest be famous among the egyptian magus among the chaldean

surpass in music as greece have these excellent musician arion dorceus timotheus milesius chrysogonus terpander lesbius simon magnesius philamon linus stratonicus aristonus chiron achille clinia eumonius demodochus and ruffinus : so england have these master cooper master fairfax master talli master taverner master blithman master byrd doctor tie doctor dalli doctor bull master thoma mud sometime fellow of pembroke hall in cambridge master edward johnson master blanke master randall master philip master dowland and master morley _ a choice be to be have in reading of book _ as the lord de la noue in the sixth discourse of he _ politic and military discourse _ censureth the book of _ amadis de gaul _ which he saith be no less hurtful to youth than the work of machiavellus to age : so these book be accordingly to be censure of whose name follow _ bevi of hampton guy of warwick arthur of the round table huon of bordeaux oliver of castile the four son of aymon gargantua gireleon

afterwards bishop of norwich _ -rrb- -lrb- john marston -rrb- the author of _ pygmalion 's image and certain satire _ -lrb- john -rrb- rankin and such other be very profitable john dryden dedicatory epistle to _ the rival lady _ -lrb- print in 1664 -rrb- to the right honorable roger earl of orrery my lord this worthless present be design you long before it be a play when it be only a confused mass of thought tumble over one another in the dark : when the fancy be yet in its first work move the sleep image of thing towards the light there to be distinguish and then either choose or reject by the judgement it be yours my lord before i could call it mine and i confess in that first tumult of my thought there appear a disorderly kind of beauty in some of they which give I hope something worthy of my lord of orrery might be draw from they : but i be then in that eagerness of imagination which by over please fanciful man flatter they into the danger of write so that when i have mould it to that shape it now bear i look with such disgust upon it that the censure of we severest critic be charitable to what i think and still think of it myself ` tis so far from I to believe this perfect that i be apt to conclude we best play be scarcely so for the stage be the representation of the world and the action in it how can it be imagine that the picture of human life can be more exact than life itself be he may be allow sometimes to err who undertake to move so many character and humor -lrb- as be requisite in a play -rrb- in those narrow channel which be proper to each of they to conduct he imaginary person through so many various intrigue and chance as the labor audience shall think they lose under every billow : and then at length to work they so naturally out of they distress that when the whole plot be lay open the spectator may rest satisfied that every cause be powerful enough to produce the effect it have and that the whole chain of they be with such due order link together that the first accident -lrb- _ incident _ -rrb- would naturally beget the second till they all render the conclusion necessary these difficulty my lord may reasonably excuse the error of my undertaking : but for this confidence of my dedication i have a argument which be too advantageous for I not to publish it to the world ` tis the kindness you lordship have continually show to all my writings you have be pleased my lord they should sometimes cross the irish sea to kiss you hand which passage contrary to the experience of other i have find the least dangerous in the world you favor have shine upon I at a remote distance without the least knowledge of my person : and like the influence of the heavenly body you have do good without know to whom you do it ` tis this virtue in you lordship which embolden I to this attempt for do i not consider you as my patron i have little reason to desire you for my judge : and should appear with as much awe before you in the reading as i have when the full theater sate upon the action for who so severely judge of fault as he who have give testimony he commit none you excellent _ poem _ have afford that knowledge of it to the world that you enemy be ready to upbraid you with it as a crime for a man of business to write so well neither durst i have justify you lordship in it if example of it have not be in the world before you : if xenophon have not write a romance and a certain roman call augustus caesar a tragedy and epigram but they writing be the entertainment of they pleasure yours be only a diversion of you pain the muse have seldom employ you thought but when some violent fit of the gout have snatch you from affair of state : and like the priestess of apollo you never come to deliver he oracle but unwillingly and in torment so that we be oblige to you lordship 's misery for we delight you treat we with the cruel pleasure of a turkish triumph where those who cut and wind they body sing song of victory as they pass and divert other with they own suffering other man endure they disease you lordship only can enjoy they plot and write in this kind be certainly more troublesome employment than many which signify more and be of greater moment in the world the fancy memory and judgement be then extend like so many limb upon the rack all of they reach with they utmost stress at nature : a thing so almost infinite and boundless as can never fully be comprehend but where the image of all thing be always present yet i wonder not you lordship succeed so well in this attempt the knowledge of man be you daily practice in the world to work and bend they stubborn mind which go not all after the same grain but each of they so particular a way that the same common humor in several person must be work upon by several means thus my lord you sickness be but the imitation of you health the poet but subordinate to the statesman in you you still govern man with the same address and manage business with the same prudence : allow it here as in the world the due increase and growth till it come to the just height and then turn it when it be fully ripe and nature call out -lrb- as it be -rrb- to be deliver with this only advantage of ease to you in you poetry : that you have fortune here at you command : with which wisdom do often unsuccessfully struggle in the world here be no chance which you have not foresee all you hero be more than you subject they be you creature : and though they seem to move freely in all the sally of they passion yet you make destiny for they which they can not shun they be move if i may dare to say so like the rational creature of the almighty poet who walk at liberty in they own opinion because they fetter be invincible : when indeed the prison of they will be the more sure for be large and instead of a absolute power over they action they have only a wretched desire of do that which they can not choose but do i have dwell my lord thus long upon you write not because you deserve not greater and more noble commendation but because i be not equally able to express they in other subject like a ill swimmer i have willingly stay long in my own depth and though i be eager of perform more yet i be loath to venture out beyond my knowledge for beyond you poetry my lord all be ocean to I to speak of you as a soldier or a statesman be only to betray my own ignorance : and i could hope no better success from it than that miserable rhetorician have who solemnly declaim before hannibal of the conduct of army and the art of war i can only say in general that the soul of other man shine out at little crany they understand some one thing perhaps to admiration while they be darken on all the other part : but you lordship 's soul be a entire globe of light break out on every side and if i have only discover one beam of it ` tis not that the light fall unequally but because the body which receive it be of unequal part the acknowledgement of which be a fair occasion offer I to retire from the consideration of you lordship to that of myself i here present you my lord with that in print which you have the goodness not to dislike upon the stage and account it happy to have meet you here in england : it be at best like small wine to be drunk out upon the place -lrb- ie _ of vintage where produce _ -rrb- and have not body enough to endure the sea i know not whether i have be so careful of the plot and language as i ought : but for the latter i have endeavor to write english as near as i could distinguish it from the tongue of pedant and that of affect traveller only i be sorry that speak so noble a language as we do we have not a more certain measure of it as they have in france : where they have a academy erect for that purpose and endowed with large privilege by the present king -lrb- _ loui xiv _ -rrb- i wish we might at length leave to borrow word from other nation which be now a wantonness in we not a necessity : but so long as some affect to speak they there will not want other who will have the boldness to write they but i fear lest defend the receive word i shall be accuse for follow the new way : i mean of write scene in verse though to speak properly ` tis no so much a new way amongst we as a old way new revive for many year -lrb- ie 1561 -rrb- before shakespeare 's play be the tragedy of _ queen _ -lrb- or rather _ king _ -rrb- _ gorboduc _ -lrb- _ of which however the authentic title be ferrex and porrex _ -rrb- in english verse write by that famous lord buckhurst afterwards earl of dorset and progenitor to that excellent person -lrb- _ lord buckhurst see _ p 503 -rrb- who as he inherit he soul and title i wish may inherit he good fortune but suppose we countryman have not receive this write till of late shall we oppose ourselves to the most polished and civilised nation of europe shall we with the same singularity oppose the world in this as most of we do in pronounce latin or do we desire that the brand which barclay have i hope unjustly lay upon the english should still continue _ anglus suo ac sua omnium impense mirantur coeteras nationes despectui habent _ all the spanish and italian tragedy i have yet see be writ in rhyme for the french i do not name they : because it be the fate of we countryman to admit little of theirs among we but the basest of they man the extravagancy of they fashion and the frippery of they merchandise shakespeare who -lrb- with some error not to be avoid in that age -rrb- have undoubtedly a larger soul of poesy than ever any of we nation be the first who -lrb- to shun the pain of continual rhyming -rrb- invent that kind of write which we call blank verse -lrb- _ dryden be here wrong as to fact lord surrey write the earliest _ print _ english blank verse in he fourth book of the _ aeneid _ print in _ 1548 -rrb- but the french more properly _ prose mesure _ : into which the english tongue so naturally slide that in write prose ` tis hardly to be avoid and therefore i admire -lrb- _ marvel that _ -rrb- some man should perpetually stumble in a way so easy : and invert the order of they word constantly close they line with verb which though commend sometimes in write latin yet we be whipt at westminster if we use it twice together i know some who if they be to write in blank verse _ sir i ask you pardon _ would think it sound more heroically to write _ sir i you pardon ask _ i should judge he to have little command of english whom the necessity of a _ rhyme _ should force upon this rock though sometimes it can not be easily avoid and indeed this be the only inconvenience with which rhyme can be charge this be that which make they say rhyme be not natural it be only so when the poet either make a vicious choice of word or place they for rhyme 's sake so unnaturally as no man would in ordinary speaking but when ` tis so judiciously order that the first word in the verse seem to beget the second and that the next till that become the last word in the line which in the negligence of prose would be so : it must then be grant rhyme have all advantage of prose besides its own but the excellence and dignity of it be never fully know till mr waller teach it he first make write easily a art : first show we to conclude the sense most commonly in distich which in the verse of those before he run on for so many line together that the reader be out of breath to overtake it this sweetness of mr waller 's lyric poesy be afterwards follow in the epic by sir john denham in he _ cooper 's hill _ a poem which you lordship know for the majesty of the style be and ever will be the exact standard of good writing but if we owe the invention of it to mr waller we be acknowledge for the noblest use of it to sir william d'avenant who at once bring it upon the stage and make it perfect in _ the siege of rhode _ the advantage which rhyme have over blank verse be so many that it be lose time to name they sir philip sidney in he _ defense of poesy _ give we one which in my opinion be not the least considerable : i mean _ the help it bring to memory _ which rhyme so knit up by the affinity of sound that by remember the last word in one line we often call to mind both the verse then in the quickness of repartee which in discoursive scene fall very often : it have so particular a grace and be so aptly suit to they that _ the sudden smartness of the answer and the sweetness of the rhyme set off the beauty of each other _ but that benefit which i consider most in it because i have not seldom find it be that _ it bound and circumscribe the fancy _ for imagination in a poet be a faculty so wild and lawless that like a high range spaniel it must have clog tie to it lest it outrun the judgement the great easiness of blank verse render the poet too luxuriant he be tempt to say many thing which might better be omit or at least shut up in fewer word but when the difficulty of artful rhyming be interpose where the poet commonly confines he sense to he couplet and must contrive that sense into such word that the rhyme shall naturally follow they not they the rhyme -lrb- pp 571 581 -rrb- : the fancy then give leisure to the judgement to come in which see so heavy a tax impose be ready to cut off all unnecessary expense this last consideration have already answer a objection which some have make that rhyme be only a embroidery of sense to make that which be ordinary in itself pass for excellent with less examination but certainly that which most regulate the fancy and give the judgement its busiest employment be like -lrb- ly -rrb- to bring forth the richest and clearest thought the poet examine that most which he produceth with the greatest leisure and which he know must pass the severest test of the audience because they be aptest to have it ever in they memory : as the stomach make the best concoction when it strictly embrace the nourishment and take account of every little particle as it pass through but as the best medicine may lose they virtue by be ill apply so be it with verse if a fit subject be not choose for it neither must the argument alone but the character and person be great and noble : otherwise as scaliger say of claudian the poet will be _ ignobiliore materium depressus _ the scene which -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- most commend it be those of argumentation and discourse on the result of which the do or not do -lrb- of -rrb- some considerable action should depend but my lord though i have more to say upon this subject yet i must remember ` tis you lordship to whom i speak : who have much better commend this way by you write _ in _ it than i can do by write _ for _ it where my reason can not prevail i be sure you lordship 's example must you rhetoric have gain my cause as least the greatest part of my design have already succeed to my wish : which be to interest so noble a person in the quarrel and withal to testify to the world how happy i esteem myself in the honor of be my lord you lordship 's most humble and most obedient servant john dryden the honorable sir robert howard auditor of the exchequer preface to _ four new play _ -lrb- licensed 7 march 1665 print the same year -rrb- _ to the reader _ there be none more sensible than i be how great a charity the most ingenious may need that expose they private wit to a public judgement since the same phancy from whence the thought proceed must probably be kind to its own issue this render man no perfecter judge of they own writings than father be of they own child : who find out that wit in they which another discern not and see not those error which be evident to the unconcerned nor be this self kindness more fatal to man in they writings than in they action every man be a greater flatterer to himself than he know how to be to another : otherwise it be impossible that thing of such distant nature should find they own author so equally kind in they affection to they and man so different in part and virtue should rest equally contented in they own opinion this apprehension add to that greater -lrb- one -rrb- which i have of my own weakness may i hope incline the reader to believe I when i assure he that these folly be make public as much against my inclination as judgement but be pursue with so many solicitation of mr herringman 's -lrb- _ the publisher _ -rrb- and have receive civility from he if it be possible exceed he importunity : i at last yield to prefer that which he believe he interest before that which i apprehended my own disadvantage consider withal that he might pretend it would be a real loss to he : and could be but a imaginary prejudice to I : since thing of this nature though never so excellent or never so mean have seldom prove the foundation of man 's new build fortune or the ruin of they old it be the fate of poetry though of no other good part to be wholly separate from interest : and there be few that know I but will easily believe i be not much concern in a unprofitable reputation this clear account i have give the reader of this seeming contradiction to offer that to the world which i dislike myself : and in all thing i have no greater a ambition than to be believe -lrb- to be -rrb- a person that would rather be unkind to myself than ungrateful to other i have make this excuse for myself i offer none for my writings but freely leave the reader to condemn that which have receive my sentence already yet i shall presume to say something in the justification of we nation 's play though not of my own : since in my judgement without be partial to my country i do really prefer we play as much before any other nation 's as i do the best of ours before my own the manner of the stage entertainment have differ in all age and as it have increase in use it have enlarged itself in business the general manner of play among the ancient we find in seneca 's tragedy for serious subject and in terence and plautus for the comical in which latter we see some pretence to plot though certainly short of what we have see in some of mr -lrb- ben -rrb- johnson 's play and for they wit especially plautus i suppose it suit much better in those day than it would do in ours for be they play strictly translate and present on we stage they would hardly bring as many audience as they have now admirer the serious play be anciently compose of speech and chorus where all thing be related but no matter of _ fact _ present on the stage this pattern the french do at this time nearly follow : only leave out the chorus make up they play with almost entire and discoursive scene present the business in relation -lrb- p 535 -rrb- this way have very much affect some of we nation who possibly believe well of it more upon the account that what the french do ought to be a fashion than upon the reason of the thing it be first necessary to consider why probably the composition of the ancient especially in they serious play be after this manner and it will be find that the subject they commonly choose drave they upon the necessity which be usually the most known story and fable -lrb- p 522 -rrb- accordingly seneca make choice of medea hyppolitus and hercule _ oetaeus _ it be impossible to _ show _ medea throw old mangled aeson into she age-renewing caldron or to _ present _ the scatter limb of hyppolitus upon the stage and _ show _ hercule burn upon he own funeral pile and this the judicious horace clearly speak of in he _ arte poetica _ where he say _ non taman intus digna gerus prome in scenam : multaque tolle ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praesens nec pueros coram populo medea trucidet -lrb- 8 -rrb- aut humana palam coquat extra nefarius atreus aut in avem progne vertatur cadmus in anguem quodcunque ostendit mihus sic incredulus odus _ so that it appear a fault to choose such subject for the stage but much greater to affect that method which those subject enforce : and therefore the french seem much mistake who without the necessity sometimes commit the error and this be as plainly decide by the same author in he precede word _ aut agitur re in sceni aut acta refertur : segnius irritant animo demissa per aurem quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus et quae ipse sibi tradit spectator _ by which he directly declare he judgement that every thing make more impression present than related nor indeed can any one rationally assert the contrary for if they affirm otherwise they do by consequence maintain that a whole play might as well be relate as act therefore whoever choose a subject that enforce he to relation be to blame and he that do it without the necessity of the subject be much more if these premiss be grant ` tis no partiality to conclude that we english play justly challenge the pre-eminence yet i shall as candidly acknowledge that we best poet have differ from other nation though not so happily -lrb- _ felicitously _ -rrb- in usually mingle and interweave mirth and sadness through the whole course of they play ben johnson only except who keep himself entire to one argument and i confess i be now convince in my own judgement that it be most proper to keep the audience in one entire disposition both of concern and attention : for when scene of so different nature immediately succeed one another ` ti probable the audience may not so suddenly recollect themselves as to start into a enjoyment of mirth or into the concern for the sadness yet i dispute not but the variety of this world may afford pursue accident of such different nature but yet though possible in themselves to be they may not be so proper to be present a entire connection be the natural beauty of all play : and language the ornament to dress they in which in serious subject ought to be great and easy like a high bear person that express greatness without pride or affection the easier dictate of nature ought to flow in comedy yet separate from obsceneness there be nothing more impudent than the immodesty of word wit should be chaste and those that have it can only write well : _ si modo scimus in urbanum lepido se ponere dicto _ another way of the ancient which the french follow and we stage have now lately practice be to write in rhyme and this be the dispute betwixt many ingenious person _ whether verse in rhyme or verse without the sound which may be call blank verse _ -lrb- though a hard expression -rrb- _ be to be prefer _ but take the question largely and it be never to be decide -lrb- p 512 -rrb- but by right application i suppose it may for in the general they be both proper : that be one for a play the other for a poem or copy of verse : as blank verse be as much too low for one -lrb- _ ie a poem or verse _ -rrb- as rhyme be unnatural for the other -lrb- _ ie a play _ -rrb- a poem be a premeditated form of thought upon design occasion : ought not to be unfurnished of any harmony in word or sound the other -lrb- _ a play _ -rrb- be present as the _ present effect _ of accident not think of so that ` tis impossible it should be equally proper to both these unless it be possible that all person be bear so much more than poet that verse be not to be compose by they but already make in they some may object that this argument be trivial because whatever be show ` tis know still to be but a play but such may as well excuse a ill scene that be not naturally paint because they know ` tis only a scene and not really a city or country but there be yet another thing which make verse upon the stage appear more unnatural that be when a piece of a verse be make up by one that know not what the other mean to say and the former verse answer as perfectly in sound as the last be supply in measure so that the smartness of a reply which have its beauty by come from sudden thought seem lose by that which rather look like a design of two than the answer of one it may be say that rhyme be such a confinement to a quick and luxuriant phancy that it give a stop to its speed till slow judgement come in to assist it -lrb- p 492 -rrb- but this be no argument for the question in hand for the dispute be not which way a man may write best in but which be most proper for the subject he write upon and if this be let pass the argument be yet unsolved in itself for he that want judgement in the liberty of he phancy may as well shew the defect of it in its confinement : and to say truth he that have judgement will avoid the error and he that want it will commit they both it may be object ` tis improbable that any should speak _ ex tempore _ as well as beaumont and fletcher make they though in blank verse i do not only acknowledge that but that ` ti also improbable any will write so well that way but if that may be allow improbable i believe it may be conclude impossible that any should speak as good verse in rhyme as the best poet have writ : and therefore that which seem _ nearest _ to what he intend be ever to be prefer nor be great thought more adorn by verse than verse unbeautified by mean one so that verse seem not only unfit in the best use of it but much more in the worst when a servant be call or a door bid to be shut in rhyme -lrb- p 569 -rrb- verse i mean good one do in they height of phancy declare the labor that bring they forth like majesty that grow with care : and nature that make the poet capable seem to retire and leave its offer to be make perfect by pain and judgement against this i can raise no argument but my lord of orrery 's writings in whose verse the greatness of the majesty seem unsullied with the care and he inimitable phancy descend to we in such easy expression that they seem as if neither have ever be add to the other : but both together flow from a height like bird get so high that use no labor wing but only with a easy care preserve a steadiness in motion but this particular happiness among those multitude which that excellent person be owner of do not convince my reason but employ my wonder yet i be glad such verse have be write for we stage since it have so happily exceed those whom we seem to imitate but while i give these argument against verse i may seem faulty that i have not only writ ill one but writ any but since it be the fashion i be resolve as in all indifferent thing not to appear singular : the danger of the vanity be greater than the error and therefore i follow it as a fashion though very far off for the italian play i have see some of they which have be give I as the best : but they be so inconsiderable that the particulars of they be not at all worthy to entertain the reader but as much as they be short of other in this they exceed in they other performance on the stage i mean they opera : which consist of music and painting there be none but will believe it as much harder to equal they in that way than ` tis to excel they in the other the spanish play pretend to more but indeed be not much : be nothing but so many novel put into act and scene without the least attempt or design of make the reader more concerned than a well-told tale might do whereas a poet that endeavor not to heighten the accident which fortune seem to scatter in a well-knit design have better have tell he tale by a fireside than present it on a stage for these time wherein we write i admire to hear the poet so often cry out upon and wittily -lrb- as they believe -rrb- threaten they judge since the effect of they mercy have so much exceed they justice that other with I can not but remember how many favourable audience some of we ill play have have : and when i consider how severe the former age have be to some of the best of mr johnson 's never to be equal comedy i can not but wonder why any poet should speak of former time but rather acknowledge that the want of ability in this age be largely supply with the mercy of it i deny not but there be some who resolve to like nothing and such perhaps be not unwise since by that general resolution they may be certainly in the right sometimes : which perhaps they would seldom be if they should venture they understanding in different censure and be force to a general liking or disliking -lrb- lest they should discover too much they own weakness -rrb- ` tis to be expect they would rather choose to pretend to judgement than good nature though i wish they could find better way to shew either but i forget myself not consider that while i entertain the reader in the entrance with what a good play should be : when he be come beyond the entrance he must be treat with what ill play be but in this i resemble the greatest part of the world that better know how to talk of many thing than to perform they and live short of they own discourse and now i seem like a eager hunter that have long pursue a chase after a inconsiderable quarry and give over weary as i do -lrb- 8 -rrb- p 537 of dramatic poesy a essay by john dryden esq _ fungar vice coti acutum reddere quae ferrum valet exors ipsa secandi _ horat de arte poet 1668 to the right honorable charle lord buckhurst my lord _ as i be lately review my loose papers amongst the rest i find this essay the writing of which in this rude and indigested manner wherein you lordship now see it serve as a amusement to I in the country -lrb- in 1665 -rrb- when the violence of the last plague have drive I from the town see then we theater shut up i be engage in these kind -lrb- s -rrb- of thought with the same delight with which man think upon they absent mistress i confess i find many thing in this discourse which i do not now approve my judgement be a little altered since the writing of it : but whether for the better or worse i know not neither indeed be it much material in a _ essay _ where all i have say be problematical for the way of write play in verse which i have seem to favor -lrb- p 561 -rrb- i have since that time lay the practice of it aside till i have more leisure because i find it troublesome and slow but i be no way alter from my opinion of it at least with any reason which have oppose it for you lordship may easily observe that none be very violent against it but those who either have not attempt it or who have succeed ill in they attempt ` tis enough for I to have you lordship 's example for my excuse in that little which i have do in it : and i be sure my adversary can bring no such argument against verse as the fourth act of _ pompey _ will furnish I with in its defense yet my lord you must suffer I a little to complain of you that you too soon withdraw from we a contentment of which we expect the continuance because you give it we so early ` tis a revolt without occasion from you party where you merit have already raise you to the highest command : and where you have not the excuse of other man that you have be ill use and therefore lay down arm i know no other quarrel you can have to verse than that which _ spurina _ have to he beauty when he tear and mangled the feature of he face only because they please too well the looker on it be a honor which seem to wait for you to lead out a new colony of writer from the mother nation and upon the first spreading of you ensign there have be many in a readiness to have follow so fortunate a leader if not all yet the better part of writer _ par indocili melior grege molli et expes inominata perprimat cubilia _ i be almost of opinion that we should force you to accept of the command as sometimes the praetorian band have compel they captain to receive the empire the court which be the best and surest judge of writing have generally allow of verse and in the town it have find favourer of wit and quality as for you own particular my lord you have yet youth and time enough to give part of it to the divertisement of the of the public before you enter into the serious and more unpleasant business of the world that which the french poet say of the temple of love may be as well apply to the temple of muse the word as near -lrb- ly -rrb- as i can remember they be these -- _ la jeunesse a mauvaise grace n'ayant pa ador dan le temple d'amour il faut qu'il entre : et pour le sage si ce n'est son vrai sejor ce ` st un gte sur son passage _ i leave the word to work they effect upon you lordship in they own language because no other can so well express the nobleness of the thought : and wish you may be soon call to bear a part in the affaire of the nation where i know the world expect you and wonder why you have be so long forget there be no person amongst we young nobility on whom the eye of all man be so much bent but in the meantime you lordship may imitate the course of nature which give we the flower before the fruit that i may speak to you in the language of the muse which i have take from a excellent poem to the king -lrb- ie _ charle ii -rrb- _ as nature when she fruit design think fit by beauteous blossom to proceed to it and while she do accomplish all the spring bird to she secret operation sing i confess i have no greater reason in address this essay to you lordship than that it might awaken in you the desire of write something in whatever kind it be which might be a honor to we age and country and methink it might have the same effect upon you which homer tell we the fight of the greek and trojan before the fleet have on the spirit of achille who though he have resolve not to engage yet find a martial warmth to steal upon he at the sight of blow the sound of trumpet and the cry of fight man for my own part if in treat of this subject i sometimes dissent from the opinion of better wit i declare it be not so much to combat they opinion as to defend mine own which be first make public sometimes like a scholar in a fencing school i put forth myself and show my own ill play on purpose to be better teach sometimes i stand desperately to my arm like the foot when desert by they horse not in hope to overcome but only to yield on more honorable term and yet my lord this war of opinion you well know have fall out among the writer of all age and sometimes betwixt friend : only it have be persecute by some like pedant with violence of word and manage by other like gentleman with candor and civility even tully have a controversy with he dear atticus and in one of he _ dialogue _ make he sustain the part of a enemy in philosophy who in he _ letter _ be he confident of state and make privy to the most weighty affair of the roman senate : and the same respect which be pay by tully to atticus we find return to he afterwards by caesar on a like occasion : who answer he book in praise of cato make it not so much he business to condemn cato as to praise cicero but that i may decline some part of the encounter with my adversary whom i be neither willing to combat nor well able to resist i will give you lordship the relation of a dispute betwixt some of we wit upon this subject : in which they do not only speak of play in verse but mingle in the freedom of discourse some thing of the ancient many of the modern way of write compare those with these and the wit of we nation with those of other ` tis true they differ in they opinion as ` tis probable they would neither do i take upon I to reconcile but to relate they and that as tacitus profess of himself _ sine studio partium aut ira _ without passion or interest : leave you lordship to decide it in favor of which part you shall judge most reasonable and withal to pardon the many error of _ you lordship 's most obedient humble servant john dryden to the reader _ the drift of the ensue discourse be chiefly to vindicate the honor of we english writer from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the french before they this i intimate lest any should think I so exceed vain as to teach other a art which they understand much better than myself but if this incorrect essay write in the country without the help of book or advice of friend shall find any acceptance in the world : i promise to myself a better success of the second part wherein the virtue and fault of the english poet who have write either in this the epic or the lyric way will be more fully treat of and they several style impartially imitate _ a essay of dramatic poesy it be that memorable day -lrb- _ 3rd of June _ 1665 -rrb- in the first summer of the late war when we navy engage the dutch a day wherein the two most mighty and best appoint fleet which any age have ever see dispute the command of the greater half of the globe the commerce of nation and the riches of the universe while these vast float body on either side move against each other in parallel line and we countryman under the happy conduct of he royal highness -lrb- _ the duke of york _ -rrb- go breaking by little and little into the line of the enemy : the noise of the cannon from both navy reach we ear about the city so that all man be alarm with it and in a dreadful suspense of the event which we know be then decide every one go follow the sound as he fancy -lrb- _ imagination _ -rrb- lead he and leave the town almost empty some take towards the park some cross the river other down it : all seek the noise in the depth of silence among the rest it be the fortune of eugenius crites lisideius and neander to be in company together : three of they person whom they wit and quality have make know to all the town and whom i have choose to hide under these borrow name that they may not suffer by so ill a relation as i be go to make of they discourse take then a barge which a servant of lisideius have provide for they they make haste to shoot the bridge -lrb- _ ie london bridge _ -rrb- : and -lrb- so -rrb- leave behind they that great fall of water which hinder they from hear what they desire after which have disengage themselves from many vessel which ride at anchor in the thame and almost block up the passage towards greenwich : they order the waterman to let fall they oar more gently and then every one favor he own curiosity with a strict silence it be not long ere they perceive the air break about they like the noise of distant thunder or of swallow in a chimney those little undulation of sound though almost vanish before they reach they yet still seem to retain somewhat of they first horror which they have betwixt the fleet after they have attentively listen till such time as the sound by little and little go from they eugenius -lrb- _ ie lord buckhurst _ -rrb- lift up he head and take notice of it be the first to congratulate to the rest that happy omen of we nation 's victory : add we have but this to desire in confirmation of it that we might hear no more of that noise which be now leave the english coast when the rest have concur in the same opinion crite -lrb- _ ie sir robert howard _ -rrb- -lrb- a person of a sharp judgment and somewhat a too delicate a taste in wit which the world have mistake in he for ill nature -rrb- say smile to we that if the concernment of this battle have not be so exceed -lrb- ly -rrb- great he could scarce have wish the victory at the price he know must pay for it in be subject to the reading and hearing of so many ill verse he be sure would be make upon it add that no argument could ` scape some of those eternal rhymer who watch a battle with more diligence than the raven and bird of prey and the worst of they surest to be first in upon the quarry : while the better able either out of modesty writ not at all or set that due value upon they poem as to let they be often call for and long expect there be some of those impertinent people you speak of answer lisideius -lrb- _ ie sir charle sedley _ -rrb- who to my knowledge be already so provide either way that they can produce not only a panegyric upon the victory : but if need be a funeral elegy upon the duke and after they have crown he valor with many laurel at last deplore the odds under which he fall conclude that he courage deserve a better destiny all the company smile at the conceit of lisideius but crite more eager than before begin to make particular exception against some writer and say the public magistrate ought to send betime to forbid they : and that it concern the peace and quiet of all honest people that ill poet should be as well silence as seditious preacher in my opinion reply eugenius you pursue you point too far for as to my own particular i be so great a lover of poesy that i could wish they all reward who attempt but to do well at least i would not have they worse use than syllum the dictator do one of they brethren heretofore _ quem in concione vidimus _ -lrb- say tully speak of he -rrb- _ cum ei libellum malus poeta de populo subjecisset quod epigramma in eum fecisset tantummodo alternis versibus longiuculis statim ex iis rebus quae tunc vendebat jubere ei praemium tribui sub ea conditione ne quid postea scriberet _ i could wish with all my heart reply crite that many whom we know be as bountifully thank upon the same condition that they would never trouble we again for amongst other i have a mortal apprehension of two poet whom this victory with the help of both she wing will never be able to escape ` tis easy to guess whom you intend say lisideius and without name they i ask you if one -lrb- _ ie george wither _ -rrb- of they do not perpetually pay we with clench upon word and a certain clownish kind of raillery if now and then he do not offer at a catachresis -lrb- _ which cotgrave define as ` the abuse or necessary use of one word for lack of another more proper ' _ -rrb- or clevelandism wresting and torture a word into another meaning in fine if be not one of those whom the french would call _ un mauvai buffon _ one that be so much a well willer to the satire that he spare no man : and though he can not strike a blow to hurt any yet ought to be punish for the malice of the action as we witch be justly hang because they think themselves so and suffer deservedly for believe they do mischief because they mean it you have describe he say crite so exactly that i be afraid to come after you with my other extremity of poetry he -lrb- _ ie francis quarle _ -rrb- be one of those who have have some advantage of education and converse -lrb- _ ie conversation in the sense of culture through mixture with society _ -rrb- know better than the other what a poet should be but put it into practice more unluckily than any man he style and matter be everywhere alike he be the most calm peaceable writer you ever read he never disquiet you passion with the least concernment but still leave you in as even a temper as he find you he be a very leveller in poetry he creep along with ten little word in every line and help out he number with _ for to _ and _ unto _ and all the pretty expletive he can find till he drag they to the end of another line : while the sense be leave tired halfway behind it he doubly starve all he verse first for want of thought and then of expression he poetry neither have wit in it nor seem to have it like he in martial _ pauper viderus cinna vult et est pauper _ he affect plainness to cover he want of imagination when he write in the serious way the highest flight of he fancy be some miserable _ antithesis _ or seem contradiction : and in the comic he be still reach at some thin conceit the ghost of a jest and that too fly before he never to be catch these swallow which we see before we on the thame be the just resemblance of he wit you may observe how near the water they stoop how many proffer they make to dip and yet how seldom they touch it and when they do ` tis but the surface they skim over it but to catch a gnat and then mount in the air and leave it well gentleman say eugenics you may speak you pleasure of these author but though i and some few more about the town may give you a peaceable hearing : yet assure yourselve there be multitude who would think you malicious and they injured especially he whom you first describe he be the very _ withers _ of the city they have buy more edition of he work than would serve to lay under all they pie at the lord mayor 's christmas when he famous poem -lrb- _ ie speculum speculativium or a consider glass be a inspection into the present and late sad condition of these nation london write June xiii xdclx and there imprint the same year _ -rrb- first come out in the year 1660 i have see they read it in the midst of change time nay so vehement be they at it that they lose they bargain by the candle ' end but what will you say if he have be receive among the great one i can assure you he be this day the envy of a great person who be lord in the art of quibble and who do not take it well than any man should intrude so far into he province all i would wish reply crite be that they who love he writings may still admire he and he fellow poet _ quus bavium non odit & c _ be curse sufficient and farther add lisideius i believe there be no man who write well but would think himself very hardly deal with if they admirer should praise anything of he _ nam quo contemnimus eorum quoque laude contemnimus _ there be so few who write well in this age say crite that methink any praise should be welcome they neither rise to the dignity of the last age nor to any of the ancient : and we may cry out of the writer of this time with more reason than petronius of he _ pace vestra liceat dixisse primus omnium eloquentiam perdidisti _ ` you have debauch the true old poetry so far that nature -lrb- which be the soul of it -rrb- be not in any of you writings ' if you quarrel say eugenius to those who now write be ground only upon you reverence to antiquity there be no man more ready to adore those great greek and roman than i be : but on the other side i can not think so contemptibly of the age i live in or so dishonourably of my own country as not to judge -lrb- that -rrb- we equal the ancient in most kind of poesy and in some surpass they neither know i any reason why i may not be as zealous for the reputation of we age as we find the ancient themselves in reference to those who live before they for you hear horace say _ indignor quidquam reprehendus non quium crasse compositum ille pide have putetur sed quium nuper _ and after si meliora die ut vina poema reddit scire velim pretium charti quotus arroget annus _ but i see i be engage in a wide dispute where the argument be not like -lrb- ly -rrb- to reach close on either side -lrb- p 497 -rrb- : for poesy be of so large extent and so many -lrb- both of the ancient and modern -rrb- have do well in all kind of it that in cite one against the other we shall take up more time this evening than each man 's occasion will allow he therefore i would ask crite to what part of poesy he would confine he argument and whether he would defend the general cause of the ancient against the modern or oppose any age of the modern against this of ours crite a little while consider upon this demand tell eugenius he approve of he proposition and if he please he would limit they dispute to dramatic poesy : in which he think it not difficult to prove either that the ancient be superior to the modern or the last age to this of ours eugenius be somewhat surprise when he hear crite make choice of that subject for ought i see say he i have undertake a harder province than i imagine for though i never judge the play of the greek and roman poet comparable to ours : yet on the other side those we now see act come short of many which be write in the last age but my comfort be if we be o'ercome it will be only by we own countryman and if we yield to they in this one part of poesy we -lrb- the -rrb- more surpass they in all the other -lrb- s -rrb- for in the epic or lyric way it will be hard for they to shew we one such amongst they as we have many now live or who lately be so they can produce nothing so courtly writ or which express so much the conversation of a gentleman as sir john suckling nothing so even sweet and flow as mr waller nothing so majestic so correct as sir john denham nothing so elevated so copious and full of spirit as mr cowley as for the italian french and spanish play i can make it evident that those who now write surpass they and that the drama be wholly ours all of they be thus far of eugenius he opinion that the sweetness of english verse be never understand or practice by we father even crite himself do not much oppose it : and every one be willing to acknowledge how much we poesy be improve by the happiness of some writer yet live who first teach we to mould we thought into easy and significant word to retrench the superfluity of expression and to make we rhyme so properly a part of the verse that it should never mislead the sense but itself be lead and govern by it eugenius be go to continue this discourse when lisideius tell he that it be necessary before they proceed further to take a standing measure of they controversy for how be it possible to be decide who writ the best play before we know what a play should be but this once agree on by both party each might have recourse to it either to prove he own advantage or discover the failing of he adversary he have no sooner say this but all desire the favor of he to give the definition of a play : and they be the more importunate because neither aristotle nor horace nor any other who writ of that subject have ever do it lisideius after some modest denial at last confess he have a rude notion of it indeed rather a description than a definition but which serve to guide he in he private thought when he be to make a judgment of what other writ that he conceive a play ought to be a just and lively image of human nature represent its passion and humor and the change of fortune to which it be subject : for the delight and instruction of mankind this definition though crite raise a logical objection against it -lrb- that it be only _ a genere et fine _ and so not altogether perfect -rrb- be yet well receive by the rest and after they have give order to the waterman to turn they barge and row softly that they might take the cool of the evening in they return : crite be desire by the company to begin speak on behalf of the ancient in this manner if confidence presage a victory eugenius in he own opinion have already triumph over the ancient nothing seem more easy to he than to overcome those whom it be we greatest praise to have imitate well : for we do not only build upon they foundation but by they model dramatic poesy have time enough reckoning from thespis who first invent it to aristophane to be bear to grow up and to flourish in maturity _ it have be observe of art and science that in one and the same century they have arrive to a great perfection _ -lrb- p 520 -rrb- and no wonder since every age have a kind of universal genius which incline those that live in it to some particular study the work then be push on by many hand must of necessity go forward be it not evident in these last hundred year when the study of philosophy have be the business of all the _ virtuoso _ in christendom that almost a new nature have be reveal to we that more error of the school have be detect more useful experiment in philosophy have be make more noble secret in optics medicine anatomy astronomy discover than in all those credulous and doting age from aristotle to we -lrb- p 520 -rrb- so true it be that nothing spread more fast than science when rightly and generally cultivate add to this _ the more than common emulation that be in those time of write well _ : which though it be find in all age and all person that pretend to the same reputation : yet _ poesy be then in more esteem than now it be have greater honor decree to the professor of it and consequently the rivalship be more high between they _ they have judge ordain to decide they merit and prize to reward it : and historian have be diligent to record of aeschylus euripide sophocle lycophron and the rest of they both who they be that vanquish in these war of the theater and how often they be crown : while the asian king and grecian commonwealth scarce -lrb- ly -rrb- afford they a nobler subject than the unmanly luxury of a debauched court or giddy intrigue of a factious city _ alit oemulatio ingenia _ say paterculus _ et nunc invidia nunc admiratio incitationem accendit _ : 'em ulation be the spur of wit and sometimes envy sometimes admiration quicken we endeavor ' but now since the reward of honor be take away : that virtuous emulation be turn into direct malice yet so slothful that it contents itself to condemn and cry down other without attempt to do better ` tis a reputation too unprofitable to take the necessary pain for it yet wish they have it be incitement enough to hinder other from it and this in short eugenius be the reason why you have now so few good poet and so many severe judge certainly to imitate the ancient well much labor and long study be require : which pain i have already show we poet would want encouragement to take if yet they have ability to go through with it those ancient have be faithful imitator and wise observer of that nature which be so torn and ill-represented in we play they have hand down to we a perfect resemblance of she which we like ill copyer _ neglect to look on _ have render monstrous and disfigured but that you may know how much you be indebted to you master and be ashamed to have so ill-requited they i must remember you that all the rule by which we practice the drama at this day -lrb- either such as relate to the justness and symmetry of the plot or the episodical ornament such as description narration and other beauty which be not essential to the play -rrb- be deliver to we from the observation that aristotle make of those poet which either live before he or be he contemporary we have add nothing of we own except we have the confidence to say ` we wit be better ' which none boast of in we age but such as understand not theirs of that book which aristotle have leave we -lrb- greek : peri tae poietikae -rrb- horace he _ art of poetry _ be a excellent _ comment _ and i believe restore to we that second book of he -lrb- _ ie aristotle _ -rrb- concern _ comedy _ which be want in he out of these two -lrb- author -rrb- have be extract the famous rule which the french call _ des trois units _ or ` the three unity ' which ought to be observe in every _ regular _ play namely of time place and action the unity of time they comprehend in twenty-four hour _ the compass of a natural day _ or as near it as can be contrived and the reason of it be obvious to every one that _ the time _ of the feigned action or fable of the play _ should be proportion _ as near as can be _ to the duration of that time in which it be represent _ since therefore all play be act on the theater in a space of time _ much within _ the compass of twenty-four hour that play be to be think the _ nearest imitation _ of nature whose plot or action be confine within that time and by the same rule which conclude this general proportion of time it follow _ that all the part of it be to be equally subdivide _ as namely that one act take not up the suppose time of half a day which be out of proportion to the rest since the other four be then to be straiten within the compass of the remain half : for it be unnatural that one act which be speak or write be not longer than the rest should be suppose longer by the audience ` tis therefore the poet 's duty to take care _ that no act _ should be imagine to _ exceed the time in which it be represent on the stage _ and that the interval and inequality of time be suppose to fall out _ between _ the act this rule of time how well it have be observe by the ancient most of they play will witness you see they in they tragedy -lrb- wherein to follow this rule be certainly most difficult -rrb- from the very beginning of they play fall close into that part of the story which they intend for the action or principal object of it : leave the former part to be deliver by narration so that they set the audience as it be at the post where the race be to be conclude : and save they the tedious expectation of see the poet set out and ride the beginning of the course you behold he not till he be in sight of the goal and just upon you for the second unity which be that of place the ancient mean by it _ that the scene _ -lrb- locality -rrb- _ ought to be continue _ through the play _ in the same place where it be lay in the begin _ for _ the stage _ on which it be represent _ be but one and the same place it isunnatural to conceive it many and those far distant from one another _ i will not deny but by the variation of paint scene -lrb- _ scenery be introduce about this time into the english theater by sir william d'avenant and betterton the actor : see vol ii p 278 _ -rrb- the fancy which in these cast will contribute to its own deceit may sometimes imagine it several place upon some appearance of probability : yet it still carry _ the greater likelihood of truth _ if those place be suppose so near each other as in the same town or city which may all be comprehend under the larger denomination of one place for a greater distance will bear no proportion to the _ shortness of time which be allot in the act _ to pass from one of they to another for the observation of this next to the ancient the french be most to be commend they tie themselves so strictly to the unity of place that you never see in any of they play a scene -lrb- _ locality _ -rrb- change in the middle of a act if the act begin in a garden a street or -lrb- a -rrb- chamber ` tis end in the same place and that you may know it to be the same the stage be so supply with person that it be never empty all the time he that enter the second have business with he who be on before and before the second quit the stage a third appear who have business with he this corneille call _ la liaison des scene _ ` the continuity or join of the scene ' : and it be a good mark of a well contrived play when all the person be know to each other and every one of they have some affair with all the rest as for the third unity which be that of action the ancient mean no other by it than what the logician do by they _ fini _ the end or scope of any action that which be the first in intention and last in execution now the poet be to aim at _ one great and complete action _ to the carry on of which all thing in the play even the very obstacle be to be subservient and the reason of this be as evident as any of the former for two action equally labor and drive on by the writer would destroy the unity of the poem it would be no longer one play but two not but that there may be many action in a play -lrb- as ben johnson have observe in he _ discovery _ -rrb- but they must be all subservient to the great one which we language happily express in the name of under plot such as in terence 's _ eunuch _ be the deference and reconcilement of _ thai _ and _ phaedrium _ which be not the chief business of the play but promote the marriage of _ choerea _ and _ chreme 's sister _ principally intend by the poet ` there ought to be but one action ' say corneille ` that be one complete action which leave the mind of the audience in a full repose ' but this can not be bring to pass but by many other imperfect one which conduce to it and hold the audience in a delightful suspense of what will be if by these rule -lrb- to omit many other draw from the precept and practice of the ancient -rrb- we should judge we modern play ` tis probable that few of they would endure the trial that which should be the business of a day take up in some of they a age instead of one action they be the epitome of a man 's life and for one spot of ground which the stage should represent we be sometimes in more country than the map can show we but if we will allow the ancient to have _ contrived _ well we must acknowledge they to have _ writ _ better questionless we be deprive of a great stock of wit in the loss of menander among the greek poet and of coecilius affranius and varius among the roman we may guess of menander 's excellency by the play of terence who translate some of he and yet want so much of he that he be call by c caesar the half-menander : and of varius by the testimony of horace martial and velleius paterculus ` tis probable that these could they be recover would decide the controversy but so long as aristophane in the old comedy and plautus in the new be extant while the tragedy of euripide sophocle and seneca be to be have : i can never see one of those play which be now write but it increase my admiration of the ancient and yet i must acknowledge further that to admire they as we ought we should understand they better than we do doubtless many thing appear flat to we whose wit depend upon some custom or story which never come to we knowledge or perhaps upon some criticism in they language which be so long dead and only remain in they book it be not possible they should make we know it perfectly to read macrobius explain the propriety and elegancy of many word in virgil which i have before pass over without consideration as common thing be enough to assure I that i ought to think the same of terence and that in the purity of he style which tully so much value that he ever carry he _ work _ about he there be yet leave in he great room for admiration if i know but where to place it in the meantime i must desire you to take notice that the greatest man of the last age ben johnson be willing to give place to they in all thing he be not only a profess imitator of horace but a learn plagiary of all the other you track he everywhere in they snow if horace lucan petronius _ arbiter _ seneca and juvenal have they own from he there be few serious thought that be new in he you will pardon I therefore if i presume he love they fashion when he wear they clothes but since i have otherwise a great veneration for he and you eugenius prefer he above all other poet : i will use no farther argument to you than he example i will produce father ben to you dress in all the ornament and color of the ancient you will need no other guide to we party if you follow he : and whether you consider the bad play of we age or regard the good one of the last : both the best and worst of the modern poet will equally instruct you to esteem the ancient crite have no sooner left speaking but eugenius who wait with some impatience for it thus begin : i have observe in you speech that the former part of it be convince as to what the modern have profit by the rule of the ancient : but in the latter you be careful to conceal how much they have excel they we own all the help we have from they and want neither veneration nor gratitude while we acknowledge that to overcome they we must make use of all the advantage we have receive from they but to these assistance we have join we own industry : for have we sate down with a dull imitation of they we might then have lose somewhat of the old perfection but never acquire any that be new we draw not therefore after they line but those of nature : and have the life before we besides the experience of all they know it be no wonder if we hit some air and feature which they have miss i deny not what you urge of art and science -lrb- p 514 -rrb- that they have flourish in some age more than other : but you instance in philosophy -lrb- p 514 -rrb- make for I for if natural cause be more know now than in the time of aristotle because more study it follow that poesy and other art may with the same pain arrive still nearer to perfection and that grant it will rest for you to prove that they work more perfect image of human life than we which see in you discourse you have avoid to make good it shall now be my task to show you some of they defect and some few excellency of the modern and i think there be none amongst we can imagine i do it enviously or with purpose to detract from they : for what interest of fame or profit can the live lose by the reputation of the dead on the other side it be a great truth which velleius paterculus affirm _ audita visis libentius laudamus et proesentia invidium proeterita admiratione prosequimur et he no obruus illi instruus credimus _ ` that praise or censure be certainly the most sincere which unbribed posterity shall give we ' be pleased then in the first place to take notice that the greek poesy which crite have affirm to have arrive to perfection in the reign of the old comedy -lrb- p 514 -rrb- be so far from it that _ the distinction of it into act be not know to they _ or if it be it be yet so darkly deliver to we that we can not make it out all we know of it be from the singing of they chorus : and that too be so uncertain that in some of they play we have reason to conjecture they sing more than five time aristotle indeed divide the integral part of a play into four firstly the _ protasis _ or entrance which give light only to the character of the person and proceeds very little into any part of the action secondly the _ epitasis _ or work up of the plot where the play grow warmer the design or action of it be draw on and you see something promising that it will come to pass thirdly the _ catastasis _ or counter-turn which destroy that expectation embroil the action in new difficulty and leave you far distant from that hope in which it find you : as you may have observe in a violent stream resist by a narrow passage it turn round to a eddy and carry back the water with more swiftness than it bring they on lastly the _ catastrophe _ which the grecian call -lrb- greek : desis -rrb- the french _ le denoument _ and we the discovery or unravelling of the plot there you see all thing settle again upon the first foundation and the obstacle which hinder the design or action of the play once remove it end with that resemblance of truth or nature that the audience be satisfy with the conduct of it thus this great man deliver to we the image of a play and i must confess it be so lively that from thence much light have be derive to the form it more perfectly into act and scene but what poet first limit to five the number of the act i know not : only we see it so firmly establish in the time of horace that he give it for a rule in comedy _ neu brevier quinto neu sit productior actu : _ so that you see the grecian can not be say to have consumate this art : write rather by entrance than by act and have rather a general indigested notion of a play than know how and where to bestow the particular grace of it but since the spaniard at this day allow but three act which they call _ jornada _ to a play and the italian in many of theirs follow they : when i condemn the ancient i declare it _ be not altogether because they have not five act to every play but because they have not confine themselves to one certain number _ ` tis build a house without a model : and when they succeed in such undertaking they ought to have sacrifice to fortune not to the muse next for the plot which aristotle call -lrb- greek : to mutho -rrb- and often -lrb- greek : ton pragmaton sunthesis -rrb- and from he the roman _ fabulum _ it have already be judiciously observe by a late writer that ` in they _ tradgedy _ it be only some tale derive from thebe or troy or at least something that happen in those two age : which be worn so threadbare by the pen of all the epic poet and even by tradition itself of the _ talkative greekling _ as ben johnson call they that before it come upon the stage it be already know to all the audience and the people as soon as ever they hear the name of _ oedipus _ know as well as the poet that he have kill he father by a mistake and committed incest with he mother before the play that they be now to hear of a great plague a oracle and the ghost of _ laius _ : so that they sate with a yawning kind of expectation till he be to come with he eye pull out and speak a hundred or two of verse in a tragic tone in complaint of he misfortune ' but one _ oedipus _ _ hercule _ or _ medea _ have be tolerable poor people they scap not so good cheap they have still the _ chapon bouill _ set before they till they appetite be cloy with the same dish and the novelty be go the pleasure vanish so that one main end of dramatic poesy in its definition -lrb- p 513 -rrb- -lrb- which be to cause _ delight _ -rrb- be of consequence destroy in they _ comedy _ the roman generally borrow they plot from the greek poet : and theirs be commonly a little girl steal or wander from she parent bring back unknown to the same city there get with child by some lewd young fellow who -lrb- by the help of he servant -rrb- cheat he father and when she time come to cry _ juno lucina fer opem _ one or other see a little box or cabinet which be carry away with she and so discover she to she friend : if some god do not prevent -lrb- _ anticipate _ -rrb- it by come down in a machine -lrb- _ ie supernaturally _ -rrb- and take the thanks of it to himself by the plot you may guess much -lrb- _ many _ -rrb- of the character of the person a old father that would willingly before he die see he son well marry he debauched son kind in he nature to he wench but miserably in want of money a servant or slave who have so much wit -lrb- as -rrb- to strike in with he and help to dupe he father a braggadochio captain a parasite and a lady of pleasure as for the poor honest maid upon whom all the story be build and who ought to be one of the principal actor in the play she be commonly a mute in it she have the breeding of the old elizabeth -lrb- _ elizabethan _ -rrb- way for ` maid to be see and not to be hear ' : and it be enough you know she be willing to be marry when the fifth act require it these be plot build after the italian mode of house you see through they all at once the character indeed be imitation of nature : but so narrow as if they have imitate only a eye or a hand and do not dare to venture on the line of a face or the proportion of a body but in how strait a compass sorever they have bound they plot and character we will pass it by if they have regularly pursue they and perfectly observe those three unity of time place and action the knowledge of which you say be derive to we from they but in the first place give I leave to tell you that the unity of place however it might be practice by they be never any of they rule we neither find it in aristotle horace or any who have write of it till in we age the french poet first make it a precept of the stage the unity of time even terence himself who be the best and most regular of they have neglect he _ heautontimoroumeno _ or ` self punisher ' take up visibly two day ` therefore ' say scaliger ` the two first act conclude the first day be act overnight the last three on the ensue day ' and euripide in tie himself to one day have commit a absurdity never to be forgive he for in one of he tragedy he have make theseus go from athen to thebe which be about forty english mile under the wall of it to give battle and appear victorious in the next act : and yet from the time of he departure to the return of the _ nuntius _ who give relation of he victory _ aethra _ and the _ chorus _ have but thirty-six verse that be not for every mile a verse the like error be evident in terence he _ eunuch _ when _ lach _ the old man enter in a mistake the house of _ thai _ where between he _ exit _ and the entrance of _ pythia _ -lrb- who come to give a ample relation of the garboil he have raise within -rrb- _ parmeno _ who be leave upon the stage have not above five line to speak _ c'est bien employ un temp si court _ say the french poet who furnish I with one of the -lrb- se -rrb- observation and almost all they tragedy will afford we example of the like nature ` tis true they have keep the continuity or as you call it _ liaison des scene _ somewhat better two do not perpetually come in together talk and go out together and other two succeed they and do the same throughout the act : which the english call by the name of ` single scene ' but the reason be because they have seldom above two or three scene properly so call in every act for it be to be account a _ new _ scene not every time the stage be empty : but every person _ who enter _ though to other make it so because he introduce a new business now the plot of they play be narrow and the person few : one of they act be write in a less compass than one of we well-wrought scene and yet they be often deficient even in this to go no further than terence you find in the _ eunuch _ _ antipho _ enter single in the midst of the third act after _ chreme _ and _ pythia _ be go off in the same play you have likewise _ doria _ begin the fourth act alone and after she have make a relation of what be do at the soldier 's entertainment -lrb- which by the way be very inartificial to do because she be presume to speak directly to the audience and to acquaint they with what be necessary to be know : but yet should have be so contrived by the poet as to have be tell by person of the drama to one another and so by they to have come to the knowledge of the people -rrb- she quit the stage : and _ phaedrium _ enter next alone likewise he also give you a account of himself and of he return from the country in monologue : to which unnatural way of narration terence be subject in all he play in he _ adelphus _ or ` brother ' _ syrus _ and _ demea _ enter after the scene be break by the departure of _ sostra _ _ geta _ and _ canthara _ and indeed you can scarce look into any of he comedy where you will not presently discover the same interruption and as they have fail both in -lrb- the -rrb- lay of the plot and managing of they swerve from the rule of they own art by misrepresent nature to we in which they have ill satisfied one intention of a play which be delight : so in the instructive part -lrb- pp 513 582-4 -rrb- they have err worse instead of punish vice and rewarding virtue they have often show a prosperous wickedness and a unhappy piety they have set before we a bloody image of revenge in _ medea _ and give she dragon to convey she safe from punishment a _ priam _ and _ astyanax _ murder and _ cassandra _ ravish and lust and murder end in the victory of he that act they in short there be no indecorum in any of we modern play which if i would excuse i could not shadow with some authority from the ancient and one farther note of they let I leave you tragedy and comedy be not writ then as they be now promiscuously by the same person : but he who find he genius bend to the one never attempt the other way this be so plain that i need not instance to you that aristophane plautus terence never any of they writ a tragedy aeschylus euripide sophocle and seneca never meddle with comedy the sock and buskin be not worn by the same poet have then so much care to excel in one kind very little be to be pardon they if they miscarry in it and this would lead I to the consideration of they wit have not crites give I sufficient warn not to be too bold in my judgement of it because -lrb- the language be dead and many of the custom and little accident on which it depend lose to we -lrb- p 518 -rrb- -rrb- we be not competent judge of it but though i grant that here and there we may miss the application of a proverb or a custom yet a thing well say will be wit in all language : and though it may lose something in the translation yet to he who read it in the original ` tis still the same he have a idea of its excellency though it can not pass from he mind into any other expression or word than those in which he find it when _ phaedrium _ in the _ eunuch _ have a command from he mistress to be absent two day and encouraging himself to go through with it say _ tandem ego non illum caream si opus sit vel totum triduum parmeno _ to mock the softness of he master lift up he hand and eye cry out as it be in admiration _ huus universum triduum _ the elegancy of which _ universum _ though it can not be render in we language yet leave a impression of the wit on we soul but this happen seldom in he -lrb- _ ie terence _ -rrb- in plautus oftner who be infinitely too bold in he metaphor and coin word out of which many time he wit be nothing which questionless be one reason why horace fall upon he so severely in those verse _ sed proavus nostrus plautino el numero et laudavere sale nimium patienter utrumque ne dicam stolid _ for horace himself be cautious to obtrude -lrb- _ in obtrude _ -rrb- a new word upon he reader : and make custom and common use the best measure of receive it into we writings _ multa renascentur quae nunc cecidere cadentque quae nunc sunt in honore vocabulum si volet usus quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi _ the not observe of this rule be that which the world have blame in we satirist cleveland to express a thing hard and unnaturally be he new way of elocution ti true no poet but may sometimes use a _ catachresis _ virgil do it _ mistaque ridentus colocasium fundet acaniho _ -- in he eclogue of _ pollio _ and in he seventh aeneid -- _ mirantur et unda miratur nemus insuetam fulgentium longe scuta virum fluvio pictaque innare carina _ and ovid once so modestly that he ask leave to do it _ si verbo audacia detur haud metuam summus dixisse palatium coelus _ call the court of jupiter by the name of augustus he palace though in another place he be more bold where he say _ et longas visent capitolia pompas _ but to do this always and never be able to write a line without it though it may be admire by some few pedant will not pass upon those who know that _ wit be best convey to we in the most easy language : and be most to be admire when a great thought come dress in word so commonly receive that it be understand by the meanest apprehension as the best meat be the most easily digest _ but we can not read a verse of cleveland 's without make a face at it as if every word be a pill to swallow he give we many time a hard nut to break we tooth without a kernel for we pain so that there be this difference between he _ satire _ and doctor donne 's : that the one -lrb- _ donne _ -rrb- give we deep thought in common language though rough cadence the other -lrb- _ cleveland _ -rrb- give we common thought in abtruse word ` tis true in some place he wit be independent of he word as in that of the _ rebel scot _ -- have cain be scot god would have change he doom not force he wander but confine he home _ si sic omnium dixisset _ this be wit in all language ` tis like mercury never to be lose or kill and so that other for beauty like white powder make no noise and yet the silent hypocrite destroy you see the last line be highly metaphorical but it be so soft and gentle that it do not shock we as we read it but to return from whence i have digress to the consideration of the ancient ' writing and wit of which by this time you will grant we in some measure to be fit judge though i see many excellent thought in seneca : yet he of they who have a genius most proper for the stage be ovid he -lrb- _ ie ovid _ -rrb- have a way of write so fit to stir up a please admiration and concernment which be the object of a tragedy and to show the various movement of a soul combate betwixt different passion : that have he live in we age or -lrb- in he own -rrb- could have writ with we advantage no man but must have yield to he and therefore i be confident the _ medea _ be none of he for though i esteem it for the gravity and sentiousness of it -lrb- which he himself conclude to be suitable to a tragedy _ omne genus scriptus gravitate tragadium vincit _ -rrb- yet it move not my soul enough to judge that he who in the epic way write thing so near the drama -lrb- as the story of _ myrrha _ of _ caunus and bibli _ and the rest -rrb- should stir up no more concernment where he most endeavor it the masterpiece of seneca i hold to be that scene in the _ troade _ where _ ulyss _ be seek for _ astyanax _ to kill he there you see the tenderness of a mother so represent in _ andromache _ that it raise compassion to a high degree in the reader and bear the nearest resemblance of anything in they tragedy to the excellent scene of passion in shakespeare or in fletcher for love scene you will find but few among they they tragic poet deal not with that soft passion but with lust cruelty revenge ambition and those bloody action they produce which be more capable of raise horror than compassion in a audience : leave love untouched whose gentleness would have temper they which be the most frequent of all the passion and which -lrb- be the private concernment of every person -rrb- be soothe by view its own image -lrb- p 549 -rrb- in a public entertainment among they comedy we find a scene or two of tenderness : and that where you would least expect it in plautus but to speak generally they lover say little when they see each other but anima mea vita mea -lrb- greek : zoae kai psuchae -rrb- as the woman in juvenal 's time use to cry out in the fury of they kindness then indeed to speak sense be a offence any sudden gust of passion as a ecstasy of love in a unexpected meeting can not better be express than in a word and a sigh break one another nature be dumb on such occasion and to make she speak would be to represent she unlike herself but there be a thousand other concernment of lover as jealousy complaint contrivance and the like where not to open they mind at large to each other be to be want to they own love and to the expectation of the audience : who watch the movement of they mind as much as the change of they fortune for the imaging of the first -lrb- p 549 -rrb- be properly the work of a poet the latter he borrow of the historian eugenius be proceed in that part of he discourse when crite interrupt he i see say he eugenius and i be never likely to have this question decide betwixt we : for he maintain the modern have acquire a _ new perfection _ in write i only grant they have _ alter the mode _ of it homer describe he hero -lrb- as -rrb- man of great appetite lover of beef broil upon the coal and good fellow : contrary to the practice of the french romance whose hero neither eat nor drink nor sleep for love virgil make _ aenea _ a bold avower of he own virtue _ sum pius aeneas fama super aethera notus _ which in the civility of we poet be the character of a _ fanfaron _ or hector for with we the knight take occasion to walk out or sleep to avoid the vanity of tell he own story which the trusty squire be ever to perform for he -lrb- p 535 -rrb- so in they love scene of which eugenius speak last the ancient be more hearty we the more talkative they writ love as it be then the mode to make it and i will grant thus much to eugenius that perhaps one of they poet have he live in we age _ si foret hoc nostrum fato delupsus in aevum _ as horace say of lucilius he have alter many thing : not that they be not natural before but that he might accommodate himself to the age he live in yet in the meantime we be not to conclude anything rashly against those great man but preserve to they the dignity of master : and give that honor to they memory _ quo libitina sacravit _ part of which we expect may be pay to we in future time this moderation of crite as it be please to all the company so it put a end to that dispute : which eugenius who seem to have the better of the argument would urge no further but lisideius after he have acknowledge himself of eugenius he opinion concern the ancient yet tell he he have forborne till he discourse be end to ask he why he prefer the english play above those of other nation and whether we ought not to submit we stage to the exactness of we next neighbor though say eugenius i be at all time ready to defend the honor of my country against the french and to maintain we be as well able to vanquish they with we pen as we ancestor have be with they sword : yet if you please add he look upon neander i will commit this cause to my friend 's management he opinion of we play be the same with mine and besides there be no reason that crite and i who have now leave the stage should re-enter so suddenly upon it : which be against the law of comedy if the question have be state reply lisideius who have writ best the french or english forty year ago -lrb- _ ie in _ 1625 -rrb- i should have be of you opinion and adjudge the honor to we own nation : but since that time say he turn towards neander we have be so long bad englishman that we have not leisure to be good poet beaumont -lrb- _ d _ 1615 -rrb- fletcher -lrb- _ d _ 1625 -rrb- and johnson -lrb- _ d _ 1637 -rrb- who be only -lrb- _ alone _ -rrb- capable of bring we to that degree of perfection which we have be just then leave the world as if in a age of so much horror wit and those milder study of humanity have no farther business among we but the muse who ever follow peace go to plant in another country it be then that the great cardinal de richelieu begin to take they into he protection and that by he encouragement corneille and some other frenchman reform they _ theater _ : which before be so much below ours as it now surpass it and the rest of europe but because crite in he discourse for the ancient have prevent -lrb- _ anticipate _ -rrb- I by touch on many rule of the stage which the modern have borrow from they i shall only in short demand of you ` whether you be not convince that of all nation the french have best observe they ' in the unity of time you find they so scrupulous that it yet remain a dispute among they poet ` whether the artificial day of twelve hour more or less be not mean by aristotle rather that the natural one of twenty-four ' and consequently ` whether all play ought not to be reduce into that compass ' this i can testify that in all they drama writ within these last twenty year -lrb- 1645-1665 -rrb- and upward i have not observe any that have extend the time to thirty hour in the unity of place they be full -lrb- y -rrb- as scrupulous for many of they critic limit it to that spot of ground where the play be suppose to begin none of they exceed the compass of the same town or city the unity of action in all they play be yet more conspicuous for they do not burden they with under plot as the english do which be the reason why many scene of we tragi-comedy carry on a design that be nothing of kin to the main plot : and that we see two distinct web in a play like those in ill-wrought stuff and two action -lrb- that be two play carry on together -rrb- to the confounding of the audience : who before they be warm in they concernment for one part be divert to another and by that mean expouse the interest of neither from hence likewise it arise that one half of we actor -lrb- _ ie the character in a play _ -rrb- be not know to the other they keep they distance as if they be _ montague _ and _ capulet _ and seldom begin a acquaintance till the last scene of the fifth act when they be all to meet on the stage there be no _ theater _ in the world have anything so absurd as the english tragi-comedy ` tis a drama of we own invention and the fashion of it be enough to proclaim it so here a course of mirth there another of sadness and passion a third of honor and the fourth a duel thus in two hour and a half we run through all the fit of bedlam the french afford you as much variety on the same day but they do it not so unseasonably or _ mal apropo _ as we we poet present you the play and the farce together and we stage still retain somewhat of the original civility of the ` red bull ' _ atque ursum et pugiles media inter carmina poscunt _ ` the end of tragedy or serious play ' say aristotle ` be to beget admiration -lrb- _ wonderment _ -rrb- compassion or concernment ' but be not mirth and compassion thing incompatible and be it not evident that the poet must of necessity destroy the former by intermingle the latter that be he must ruin the sole end and object of he tragedy to introduce somewhat that be force in and be not of the body of it would you not think that physician mad who have prescribe a purge should immediately order you to take restringent upon it but to leave we play and return to theirs i have note one great advantage they have have in the plot of they tragedy that be they be always ground upon some known history accord to that of horace _ ex noto fictum carm n sequar _ : and in that they have so imitate the ancient that they have surpass they for the ancient as be observe before -lrb- p 522 -rrb- take for the foundation of they play some poetical fiction such as under that consideration could move but little concernment in the audience because they already know the event of it but the french -lrb- man -rrb- go farther _ atque ita mentitur sic veri falso remiscet primo ne medium media ne discrepet imum _ he so interweave truth with probable fiction that he put a please fallacy upon we mend the intrigue of fate and dispense with the severity of history to reward that virtue which have be render to we there unfortunate sometimes the story have leave the success so doubtful that the writer be free by the privilege of a poet to take that which of two or more relation will best suit he design as for example the death of cyrus whom justin and some other report to have perish in the scythian war but xenophon affirm to have die in he bed of extreme old age nay more when the event be past dispute even then we be willing to be deceive : and the poet if he contrive it with appearance of truth have all the audience of he party -lrb- _ on he side _ -rrb- at least during the time he play be act so naturally we be kind to virtue -lrb- when we own interest be not in question -rrb- that we take it up as the general concernment of mankind on the other side if you consider the historical play of shakespeare they be rather so many chronicle of king or the business many time of thirty or forty year crampt into a representation of two hour and a half : which be not to imitate or paint nature but rather to draw she in miniature to take she in little to look upon she through the wrong of a perspective -lrb- _ telescope _ -rrb- and receive she image -lrb- pp 528 549 -rrb- not only much less but infinitely more imperfect than the life this instead of make a play delightful render it ridiculous _ quodeunque ostendi mihus sic incredulus odus _ for the spirit of man can not be satisfied but with truth or at least verisimilitude : and a poem be to contain if not -lrb- greek ta hetuma -rrb- yet -lrb- greek : hetmoisiu homium -rrb- as one of the greek poet have express it -lrb- _ see _ p 589 -rrb- another thing in which the french differ from we and from the spaniard be that they do not embarrass or cumber themselves with too much plot they only represent so much of a story as will constitute one whole and great action sufficient for a play we who undertake more do but multiply _ adventure -lrb- pp 541 552 -rrb- which -lrb- not be produce from one another as effect from cause but barely follow -rrb- constitute many action in the drama and consequently make it many play but by pursue close -lrb- ly -rrb- one argument which be not cloy with many turn the french have gain more liberty for verse in which they write they have leisure to dwell upon a subject which deserve it and to represent the passion -lrb- p 542 -rrb- -lrb- which we have acknowledge to be the poet 's work -rrb- without be hurry from one thing to another as we be in the play of calderon which we have see lately upon we theater under the name of spanish plot i have take notice but of one tragedy of ours whose plot have that uniformity and unity of design in it which i have commend in the french and that be rollo or rather under the name of rollo the story of bassanius _ and _ goeta in herodian there indeed the plot be neither large nor intricate but just enough to fill the mind of the audience not to cloy they besides you see it found on the truth of history only the time of the action be not reduceable to the strictness of the rule and you see in some place a little farce mingle which be below the dignity of the other part and in this all we poet be extremely peccant even ben johnson himself in _ sefanus _ and _ catiline _ have give this oleo -lrb- _ hodge-podge _ -rrb- of a play this unnatural mixture of comedy and tragedy which to I sound just as ridiculous as _ the history of david with the merry humor of golia _ in _ sefanus _ you may take notice of the scene between _ livium _ and the _ physician _ which be a pleasant satire upon the artificial help of beauty in _ catiline _ you may see the parliament of woman the little envy of they to one another and all that pass betwixt _ curio _ and _ fulvium _ scene admirable in they kind but of a ill mingle with the rest but i return again to the french writer : who as i have say do not burden themselves too much with plot which have be reproach to they by a ingenious person of we nation as a fault for he say ` they commonly make but one person considerable in a play they dwell upon he and he concernment while the rest of the person be only subservient to set he off ' if he intend this by it that there be one person in the play who be of greater dignity than the rest he must tax not only theirs but those of the ancient and -lrb- which he would be loath to do -rrb- the best of ours for it ` tis impossible but that one person must be more conspicuous in it than any other and consequently the greatest share in the action must devolve on he we see it so in the management of all affair even in the most equal aristocracy the balance can not be so justly poise but some one will be superior to the rest either in part fortune interest or the consideration of some glorious exploit which will reduce -lrb- _ lead _ -rrb- the greatest part of business into he hand but if he would have we to imagine that in exalt of one character the rest of they be neglect and that all of they have not some share or other in the action of the play : i desire he to produce any of corneille 's tragedy wherein every person like so many servant in a well govern family have _ not _ some employment and who be _ not _ necessary to the carry on of the plot or at least to you understand it there be indeed some protactic person -lrb- _ precursor _ -rrb- in the ancient whom they make use of in they play either to hear or give the relation but the french avoid this with great address make they narration only to or by such who be some way interess -lrb- _ interested _ -rrb- in the main design and now i be speaking of relation i can not take a fitter opportunity to add this in favor of the french that they often use they with better judgement more _ apropo _ than the english do not that i commend narration in general but there be two sort of they : one of those thing which be antecedent to the play and be related to make the conduct of it more clear to we but ` tis a fault to choose such subject for the stage as will inforce we upon that rock : because we see that they be seldom listen to by the audience and that it be many time the ruin of the play for be once let pass without attention the audience can never recover themselves to understand the plot and indeed it be somewhat unreasonable that they should be put to so much trouble as that to comprehend what pass in they sight they must have recourse to what be do perhaps ten or twenty year ago but there be another sort of relation that be of thing happen in the action of a play and suppose to be do behind the scene : and this be many time both convenient and beautiful for by it the french avoid the tumult which we be subject to in england by represent duel battle and such like which render we stage too like the theater where they fight for prize -lrb- _ ie theater use as fencing school for assault of arm & c _ -rrb- for what be more ridiculous than to represent a army with a drum and five man behind it all which the hero on the other side be to drive in before he or to see a duel fight and one slay with two or three thrust of the foil which we know be so blunt that we might give a man a hour to kill another in good earnest with they i have observe that in all we tragedy the audience can not forbear laugh when the actor be to die ` tis the most comic part of the whole play all passion may be lively represent on the stage if to the well write of they the actor supply a good command voice and limb that move easily and without stiffness : but there be many action which can never be imitate to a just height die especially be a thing which none but a roman gladiator could naturally perform upon the stage when he do not imitate or represent it but naturally do it and therefore it be better to omit the representation of it the word of a good writer which describe it lively will make a deeper impression of belief in we than all the actor can persuade we to when he seem to fall dead before we : as the poet in the description of a beautiful garden or meadow will please we imagination more than the place itself will please we sight when we see death represent we be convinced it be but fiction but when we hear it related we eye -lrb- the strongest witness -rrb- be want which might have undeceived we : and we be all willing to favor the sleight when the poet do not too grossly impose upon we they therefore who imagine these relation would make no concernment in the audience be deceive by confound they with the other which be of thing antecedent to the play those be make often in cold blood as i may say to the audience but these be warm with we concernment which be before awaken in the play what the philosopher say of motion that ` when it be once begin it continue of itself and will do so to eternity without some stop be put to it ' be clearly true on this occasion the soul be move with the character and fortune of those imaginary person continue go of its own accord and we be no more weary to hear what become of they when they be not on the stage than we be to listen to the news of a absent mistress but it be object ` that if one part of the play may be related then why not all ' i answer some part of the action be more fit to be represent some to be related corneille say judiciously ` that the poet be not oblige to expose to view all particular action which conduce to the principal he ought to select such of they to be see which will appear with the greatest beauty either by the magnificence of the shew or the vehemence of the passion which they produce or some other charm which they have in they : and let the rest arrive to the audience by narration ' ` tis a great mistake in we to believe the french present no part of the action upon the stage every alteration or cross of a design every new spring passion and turn of it be a part of the action and much the noblest : except we conceive nothing to be action till they come to blow as if the painting of the hero 's mind be not more properly the poet 's work than the strength of he body nor do this anything contradict the opinion of horace where he tell we _ segnius irritant animo demissa per aurem quam quae sunt occulis subjecta fidelibus _ for he say immediately after _ non taman intus digna gerus prome in scenam multaque tolle ex occulis quae mox narret facundia praesens _ among which ` many ' he recount some _ nec puero coram populo medea trucidet aut in avem progne mutetur cadmus in anguem & c _ that be ` those action which by reason of they cruelty will cause aversion in we or -lrb- by reason of they impossibility -rrb- unbelief -lrb- pp 496 545 -rrb- ought either wholly to be avoid by a poet or only deliver by narration ' to which we may have leave to add such as ` to avoid tumult ' as be before hint -lrb- pp 535 544 -rrb- or ` to reduce the plot into a more reasonable compass of time ' or ` for defect of beauty in they ' be rather to be related than present to the eye example of all these kind be frequent not only among all the ancient but in the best receive of we english poet we find ben johnson use they in he _ magnetic lady _ where one come out from dinner and relate the quarrel and disorder of it to save the indecent appear of they on the stage and to abbreviate the story : and this in express imitation of terence who have do the same before he in he _ eunuch _ where _ pythia _ make the like relation of what have happen within at the soldier ' entertainment the relation likewise of _ sefanus _ 's death and the prodigy before it be remarkable the one of which be hide from sight to avoid the horror and tumult of the representation : the other to shun the introduce of thing impossible to be believe in that excellent play the _ king and no king _ fletcher go yet farther for the whole unravelling of the plot be do by narration in the fifth act after the manner of the ancient : and it move great concernment in the audience though it be only a relation of what be do many year before the play i could multiply other instance but these be sufficient to prove that there be no error in chose a subject which require this sort of narration in the ill managing of they they may but i find i have be too long in this discourse since the french have many other excellency not common to we as that _ you never see any of they play end with a conversion or simple change of will _ : which be the ordinary way we poet use -lrb- _ be accustomed _ -rrb- to end theirs it show little art in the conclusion of a dramatic poem when they who have hinder the felicity during the four act desist from it in the fifth without some powerful cause to take they off : and though i deny not but such reason may be find yet it be a path that be cautiously to be tread and the poet be to be sure he convince the audience that the motive be strong enough as for example the conversion of the _ usurer _ in the _ scornful lady _ seem to I a little forced for be a usurer which imply a lover of money in the highest degree of covetousness -lrb- and such the poet have represent he -rrb- the account he give for the sudden change be that he have be dupe by the wild young fellow : which in reason might render he more wary another time and make he punish himself with harder fare and coarser clothes to get it up again but that he should look upon it as a judgement and so repent we may expect to hear of in a sermon but i should never endure it in a play i pass by this neither will i insist upon _ the care they take that no person after he first entrance shall ever appear but the business which bring upon the stage shall be evident _ which if observe must need render all the event of the play more natural for there you see the probability of every accident in the cause that produce it and that which appear chance in the play will seem so reasonable to you that you will there find it almost necessary : so that in the exit of they actor you have a clear account of they purpose and design in the next entrance though if the scene be well work the event will commonly deceive you ` for there be nothing so absurd ' say corneille ` as for a actor to leave the stage only because he have no more to say ' i should now speak of _ the beauty of they rhyme _ and the just reason i have to prefer _ that way of write _ in tragedy _ before ours in blank verse _ but because it be partly receive by we and therefore not altogether peculiar to they i will say no more of it in relation to they play for we own i doubt not but it will exceedingly beautify they : and i can see but one reason why it should not generally obtain that be because we poet write so ill in it -lrb- pp 503578598 -rrb- this indeed may prove a more prevailing argument than all other which be use to destroy it : and therefore i be only trouble when great and judicious poet and those who be acknowledged such have writ or speak against it as for other they be to be answer by that one sentence of a ancient author _ sed ut primo ad consequendo eo quo priore ducimus accendimur ita ubus aut praeterirus aut aequarus eo posse desperavimus studium cum spe senescit : quod scilicet assequus non potest sequus desinit praeteritoque eo in quo eminere non possumus aliquid in quo nitamur conquirimus _ lisideius conclude in this manner and neander after a little pause thus answer he i shall grant lisideius without much dispute a great part of what he have urge against we for i acknowledge _ the french contrive they plot more regularly observe the law of comedy and decorum of the stage _ to speak generally _ with more exactness _ _ than the english _ farther i deny not but he have tax we justly in some irregularity of ours which he have mention yet after all i be of opinion that neither we fault nor they virtue be considerable enough to place they above we for _ the lively imitation of nature _ be the definition of a play -lrb- p 513 -rrb- those which best fulfil that law ought to be esteem superior to the other ` tis true those beauty of the french poesy be such as will raise perfection higher where it be but be not sufficient to give it where it be not they be indeed the beauty of a statue not of a man because not animated with the soul of poesy which be _ imitation of humor and passion _ and this lisideius himself or any other however bias to they party can not but acknowledge if he will either compare the humor of we comedy or the character of we serious play with theirs he that will look upon theirs which have be write till -lrb- within -rrb- these last ten year -lrb- _ ie _ 1655 _ when moliere begin to write _ -rrb- or thereabout will find it a hard matter to pick out two or three passable humor amongst they corneille himself they arch poet what have he produce except the _ liar _ and you know how it be cry up in france but when it come upon the english stage though well translate and that part of _ dorant _ act to so much advantage by mr hart as i be confident it never receive in its own country the most favourable to it would not put it in competition with many of fletcher 's or ben johnson 's in the rest of corneille 's comedy you have little humor he tell you himself he way be first to show two lover in good intelligence with each other in the work up of the play to embroil they by some mistake and in the latter end to clear it up but of late year de moliere the younger corneille quinault and some other have be imitate afar off the quick turn and grace of the english stage they have mix they serious play with mirth like we tragi-comedy since the death of cardinal richelieu -lrb- _ in _ 1642 -rrb- : which lisideius and many other not observe have commend that in they for a virtue -lrb- p 531 -rrb- which they themselves no longer practice most of they new play be like some of ours derive from the spanish novel there be scarce one of they without a veil and a trusty _ diego _ who droll much after the rate of the _ adventure _ -lrb- pp 533 553 -rrb- but they humor if i may grace they with that name be so thin sown that never above one of they come up in a play i dare take upon I to find more variety of they in one play of ben johnson 's than in all theirs together : as he who have see the _ alchemist _ the _ silent woman _ or _ bartholomew fair _ can not but acknowledge with I i grant the french have perform what be possible on the ground work of the spanish play what be pleasant before they have make regular but there be not above one good play to be writ upon all those plot they be too much alike to please often which we need not -lrb- adduce -rrb- the experience of we own stage to justify as for they new way of mingle mirth with serious plot i do not with lisideius condemn the thing though i can not approve they manner of do it he tell we we can not so speedily re-collect ourselves after a scene of great passion and concernment as to pass to another of mirth and humor and to enjoy it with any relish but why should he imagine the soul of man more heavy than he sens do not the eye pass from a unpleasant object to a pleasant in a much shorter time than be require to this and do not the unpleasantness of the first commend the beauty of the latter the old rule of logic might have convince he that ` contrary when place near set off each other ' a continue gravity keep the spirit too much bent we must refresh it sometimes as we bait -lrb- _ lunch _ -rrb- upon a journey that we may go on with greater ease a scene of mirth mix with tragedy have the same effect upon we which we music have betwixt the act and that we find a relief to we from the best plot and language of the stage if the discourse have be long i must therefore have stronger argument ere i be convince that compassion and mirth in the same subject destroy each other : and in the meantime can not but conclude to the honor of we nation that we have invent increase and perfect a more pleasant way of write for the stage than be ever know to the ancient or modern of any nation which be tragi-comedy and this lead I to wonder why lisideius -lrb- p 533 -rrb- and many other should cry up _ the barrenness of the french plot _ above _ the variety and copiousness of the english _ they plot be single they carry on one design which be push forward by all the actor every scene in the play contribute and move towards it ours besides the main design have under plot or by-concernment of less considerable person and intrigue which be carry on with the motion of the main plot : just as they say the orb -lrb- _ orbit _ -rrb- of the fix star and those of the planet -lrb- though they have motion of they own -rrb- be whirl about by the motion of the _ primum mobile _ in which they be contain that similitude express much of the english stage for if contrary motion may be find in nature to agree if a planet can go east and west at the same time one way by virtue of he own motion the other by the force of the first mover : it will not be difficult to imagine how the under plot which be only different -lrb- from -rrb- not contrary to the great design may naturally be conduct along with it eugenius -lrb- _ lisideius _ -rrb- have already show we -lrb- p 534 -rrb- from the confession of the french poet that the unity of action be sufficiently preserve if all the imperfect action of the play be conduce to the main design : but when those petty intrigue of a play be so ill order that they have no coherence with the other i must grant that lisideius have reason to tax that want of due connection for co-ordination in a play be as dangerous and unnatural as in a state in the meantime he must acknowledge we variety -lrb- if well order -rrb- will afford a greater pleasure to the audience as for he other argument that _ by pursue one single theme they gain a advantage to express and work up the passion _ -lrb- p 533 -rrb- i wish any example he could bring from they would make it good for i confess they verse be to I the coldest i have ever read neither indeed be it possible for they in the way they take so to express passion as that the effect of it should appear in the concernment of a audience they speech be so many declamation which tire we with the length : so that instead of persuade we to grieve for they imaginary hero we be concern for we own trouble as we be in the tedious visit of bad -lrb- _ dull _ -rrb- company we be in pain till they be go when the french stage come to be reform by cardinal richelieu those long harangue be introduce to comply with the gravity of a churchman look upon the _ cinna _ and _ pompey _ they be not so properly to be call play as long discourse of reason -lrb- s -rrb- of state : and _ polieucte _ in matter of religion be as solemn as the long stop upon we organ since that time it have grow into a custom and they actor speak by the hour glass as we parson do nay they account it the grace of they part and think themselves disparage by the poet if they may not twice or thrice in a play entertain the audience with a speech of a hundred or two hundred line i deny not but this may suit well enough with the french : for as we who be a more sullen people come to be divert at we play they who be of a airy and gay temper come thither to make themselves more serious and this i conceive to be one reason why comedy be more please to we and tragedy to they but to speak generally it can not be deny that _ short _ speech and reply be more apt to move the passion and beget concernment in we than the other for it be unnatural for any one in a gust of passion to speak long together or for another in the same condition to suffer he without interruption grief and passion be like flood raise in little brook by a sudden rain they be quickly up and if the concernment be pour unexpectedly in upon we it overflow we : but a long sober shower give they leisure to run out as they come in without trouble the ordinary current as for comedy repartee be one of its chiefest grace the greatest pleasure of the audience be a chase of wit keep up on both side and swiftly manage and this we forefather -lrb- if not we -rrb- have have in fletcher 's _ play _ to a much higher degree of perfection than the french poet can arrive at there be another part of lisideius he discourse in which he have rather excuse we neighbor than commend they that be _ for aim only _ -lrb- simply -rrb- _ to make one person considerable in they play _ ` tis very true what he have urge that one character in all play even without the poet 's care will have the advantage of all the other and that the design of the whole drama will chiefly depend on it but this hinder not that there may be more shine character in the play many person of a second magnitude nay some so very near so almost equal to the first that greatness may be oppose to greatness : and all the person be make considerable not only by they quality but they action ` tis evident that the more the person be the greater will be the variety of the plot if then the part be manage so regularly that the beauty of the whole be keep entire and that the variety become not a perplexed and confused mass of accident : you will find it infinitely please to be lead in a labyrinth of design where you see some of you way before you yet discern not the end till you arrive at it and that all this be practicable i can produce for example many of we english play as the _ maid 's tragedy _ the _ alchemist _ the _ silent woman _ i be go to have name the _ fox _ but that the unity of design seem not exactly observe in it for there appear two action in the play the first naturally end with the fourth act the second force from it in the fifth which yet be the less to be condemn in he because the disguise of _ volpone _ -lrb- though it suit not with he character as a crafty or covetous person -rrb- agree well enough with that of a voluptuary : and by it the poet gain the end he aim at the punishment of vice and reward of virtue which that disguise produce so that to judge equally of it it be a excellent fifth act but not so naturally proceed from the former but to leave this and to pass to the latter part of lisideius he discourse which concern relation i must acknowledge with he that the french have reason _ when they hide that part of the action which would occasion too much tumult on the stage _ and choose rather to have it make know by narration to the audience -lrb- p 535 -rrb- farther i think it very convenient for the reason he have give that _ all incredible action be remove _ -lrb- p 537 -rrb- : but whether custom have so insinuate itself into we countryman or nature have so form they to fierceness i know not but they will scarcely suffer combat or other object of horror to be take from they and indeed the _ indecency _ of tumult be all which can be object against fight for why may not we imagination as well suffer itself to be delude with the _ probability _ of it as any other thing in the play for my part i can with as great ease persuade myself that the blow which be strike be give in good earnest as i can that they who strike they be king or prince or those person which they represent for _ object of incredibility _ -lrb- p 537 -rrb- i would be satisfy from lisideius whether we have any so remove from all appearance of truth as be those in corneille 's _ andromede _ a play that have be frequent -lrb- _ repeat _ -rrb- the most of any he have writ if the _ perseus _ or the son of the heathen god the _ pegasus _ and the monster be not capable to choke a strong belief let he blame any representation of ours hereafter those indeed be object of delight yet the reason be the same as to the probability : for he make it not a ballette -lrb- _ ballet _ -rrb- or masque but a play which be _ to resemble truth _ as for _ death _ that _ it ought not to be represent _ -lrb- p 536 -rrb- : i have besides the argument allege by lisideius the authority of ben johnson who have foreborne it in he tragedy : for both the death of sejanus and catiline be related though in the latter i can not but observe one irregularity of that great poet he have remove the scene in the same act from rome to _ catiline _ 's army and from thence again to rome : and besides have allow a very inconsiderable time after _ catiline _ 's speech for the striking of the battle and the return of _ petreius _ who be to relate the event of it to the senate which i should not animadvert upon he who be otherwise a painful observer of -lrb- greek : to prepon -rrb- or the decorum of the stage : if he have not use extreme severity in he judgement -lrb- _ in he ` discovery ' _ -rrb- upon the incomparable shakespeare for the same fault to conclude on this subject of relation if we be to be blame for show too much of the action the french be as faulty for discover too little of it a mean betwixt both should be observe by every judicious writer so as the audience may neither be leave unsatisfied by not see what be beautiful or shock by behold what be either incredible or indecent i hope i have already prove in this discourse that though we be not altogether so punctual as the french in observe the law of comedy : yet we error be so few and -lrb- so -rrb- little and those thing wherein we excel they so considerable that we ought of right to be prefer before they but what will lisideius say if they themselves acknowledge they be too strictly tie up by those law : for the breaking which he have blame the english i will allege corneille 's word as i find they in the end of this _ discourse _ of _ the three unity _ _ il est facile aux speculatifs d'tre severe & c _ '' ti easy for speculative people to judge severely : but if they would produce to public view ten or twelve piece of this nature they would perhaps give more latitude to the rule than i have do : when by experience they have know how much we be bind up and constrain by they and how many beauty of the stage they banish from it ' to illustrate a little what he have say by they servile imitation of the unity of time and place and integrity of scene they have bring upon themselves the dearth of plot and narrowness of imagination which may be observe in all they play how many beautiful accident might naturally happen in two or three day which can not arrive with any probability in the compass of twenty-four hour there be time to be allow also for maturity of design : which amongst great and prudent person such as be often represent in tragedy can not with any likelihood of truth be bring to pass at so short a warning farther by tie themselves strictly to the unity of place and unbroken scene they be force many time to omit some beauty which can not be show where the act begin : but might if the scene be interrupted and the stage clear for the person to enter in another place and therefore the french poet be often force upon absurdity for if the act begin in a chamber all the person in the play must have some business or other to come thither or else they be not to be show in that act : and sometimes they character be very unfitting to appear there as suppose it be the king 's bedchamber yet the meanest man in the tragedy must come and despatch he business there rather than in the lobby or courtyard -lrb- which be -lrb- _ be _ -rrb- fitter for he -rrb- for fear the stage should be clear and the scene break many time they fall by it into a greater inconvenience : for they keep they scene unbroken and yet change the place as in one of they newest play -lrb- _ ie before 1665 _ -rrb- where the act begin in a street : there a gentleman be to meet he friend he see he with he man come out from he father 's house they talk together and the first go out the second who be a lover have make a appointment with he mistress : she appear at the window and then we be to imagine the scene lie under it this gentleman be call away and leave he servant with he mistress presently she father be hear from within the young lady be afraid the servingman should be discover and thrust he through a door which be suppose to be she closet -lrb- _ boudoir _ -rrb- after this the father enter to the daughter and now the scene be in a house : for he be seek from one room to another for he poor _ philipin _ or french _ diego _ : who be hear from within drolling and break many a miserable conceit upon he sad condition in this ridiculous manner the play go on the stage be never empty all the while so that the street the window the two house and the closet be make to walk about and the person to stand still now what i beseech you be more easy than to write a regular french play or more difficult than to write a irregular english one like those of fletcher or of shakespeare if they content themselves as corneille do with some flat design which -lrb- like a ill riddle -rrb- be find out ere it be half proposed such plot we can make every way regular as easily as they : but whene'er they endeavor to rise up to any quick turn or counter-turn of plot as some of they have attempt since corneille 's _ play _ have be less in vogue you see they write as irregularly as we though they cover it more speciously hence the reason be perspicuous why no french play when translate have or ever can succeed upon the english stage for if you consider the plot we own be fuller of variety if the write ours be more quick and fuller of spirit : and therefore ` tis a strange mistake in those who decry the way of write play in verse as if the english therein imitate the french we have borrow nothing from they we plot be weave in english loom we endeavor therein to follow the variety and greatness of character which be derive to we from shakespeare and fletcher the copiousness and well knitting of the intrigue we have from johnson and for the verse itself we have english precedent of elder date than any of corneille 's play not to name we old comedy before shakespeare which be all writ in verse of six foot or alexandrine such as the french now use : i can show in shakespeare many scene of rhyme together and the like in ben johnson 's tragedy in _ catiline _ and _ sejanus _ sometimes thirty or forty line i mean besides the chorus or the monologue which by the way show ben no enemy to this way of writing : especially if you look upon he _ sad shepherd _ which go sometimes upon rhyme sometimes upon blank verse like a horse who ease himself upon trot and amble you find he likewise commend fletcher 's pastoral of the _ faithful shepherdess _ : which be for the most part -lrb- in -rrb- rhyme though not refine to that purity to which it have since be bring and these example be enough to clear we from a servile imitation of the french but to return from whence i have digress i dare boldly affirm these two thing of the english drama first that we have many play of ours as regular as any of theirs and which besides have more variety of plot and character and secondly that in most of the irregular play of shakespeare or fletcher -lrb- for ben johnson 's be for the most part regular -rrb- there be a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing than there be in any of the french i could produce even in shakespeare 's and fletcher 's _ work _ some play which be almost exactly form as the _ merry wife of windsor _ and the _ scornful lady _ but because generally speak shakespeare who writ first do not perfectly observe the law of comedy and fletcher who come nearer to perfection -lrb- _ in this respect _ -rrb- yet through carelessness make many fault : i will take the pattern of a perfect play from ben johnson who be a careful and learn observer of the dramatic law and from all he comedy i shall select the _ silent woman _ -lrb- p 597 -rrb- of which i will make a short examan -lrb- _ examination _ -rrb- accord to those rule which the french observe as neander be begin to examine the _ silent woman _ : eugenius look earnestly upon he i beseech you neander say he gratify the company and I in particular so far as before you speak of the play to give we a character of the author : and tell we frankly you opinion whether you do not think all writer both french and english ought to give place to he i fear reply neander that in obey you command i shall draw a little envy upon myself besides in perform they it will be first necessary to speak somewhat of shakespeare and fletcher he rival in poesy and one of they in my opinion at least he equal perhaps he superior to begin then with shakespeare he be the man who of all modern and perhaps ancient poet have the largest and most comprehensive soul -lrb- p 540 -rrb- all the image of nature -lrb- pp 528 533 -rrb- be still present -lrb- _ apparent _ -rrb- to he -lrb- p 489 -rrb- : and he draw they not laboriously but luckily -lrb- _ felicitously _ -rrb- when he describe anything you more than see it you feel it too those who accuse he to have want learn give he the greater commendation he be naturally learn he need not the spectacles of book to read nature he look inwards and find she there i can not say he be everywhere alike be he so i should do he injury to compare he -lrb- _ even _ -rrb- with the greatest of mankind he be many time flat insipid : he comic wit degenerate into clench he serious swell into bombast but he be always great when some great occasion be present to he no man can say he ever have a fit subject for he wit and do not then raise himself as high above the rest of poet _ quantum lenta solent inter viberna cupressus _ the consideration of this make mr hale of eton say ` that there be no subject of which any poet ever writ but he would produce it much better treat of in shakespeare ' and however other be now generally prefer before he yet the age wherein he live -lrb- which have contemporary with he fletcher and johnson -rrb- never equal they to he in they esteem and in the last king 's -lrb- _ charle i _ -rrb- court when ben 's reputation be at -lrb- the -rrb- highest sir john suckling and with he the greater part of the courtier set we shakespeare far above he beaumont and fletcher -lrb- of whom i be next to speak -rrb- have with the advantage of shakespeare 's wit which be they precedent great natural gift improve by study beaumont especially be so accurate a judge of play that ben johnson while he -lrb- _ ie beaumont _ -rrb- live submit all he writings to he censure and ` tis think use he judgement in correct if not contrive all he plot what value he have for -lrb- _ ie attach to _ -rrb- he appear by the verse he writ to he : and therefore i need speak no farther of it the first play which bring fletcher and he in esteem be they _ philaster _ for before that they have write two or three very unsuccessfully : as the like be report of ben johnson before he writ _ every man in he humor _ -lrb- _ act in _ 1598 -rrb- they plot be generally more regular than shakespeare 's especially those which be make before beaumont 's death : and they understand and imitate the conversation of gentleman -lrb- _ in the conventional sense in which it be understand in dryden 's time _ -rrb- much better -lrb- _ ie than shakespeare _ -rrb- whose wild debauchery and quickness of wit in repartee no poet can ever paint as they have do this humor which ben johnson derive from particular person they make it not they business to describe they represent all the passion very lively but above all love i be apt to believe the english language in they arrive to its highest perfection what word have since be take in be rather superfluous than necessary they play be now the most pleasant and frequent entertainment of the stage two of theirs be act through the year for one of shakespeare 's or johnson 's the reason be because there be a certain gaiety in they comedy and pathos in they more serious play which suit generally with all man 's humor shakespeare 's language be likewise a little obsolete and ben johnson 's wit come short of theirs as for johnson to whose character i be now arrive if we look upon he while he be himself -lrb- for he last play be but he dotage -rrb- i think he the most learn and judicious writer which any _ theater _ ever have he be a most severe judge of himself as well as other one can not say he want wit but rather that he be frugal of it -lrb- p 572 -rrb- in he work you find little to retrench or alter wit and language and humor also in some measure we have before he but something of art be want to the drama till he come he manage he strength to more advantage than any who precede he you seldom find he make love in any of he scene or endeavor to move the passion : he genius be too sullen and saturnine to do it gracefully especially when he know he come after those who have perform both to such a height humor be he proper sphere and in that he delight most to represent mechanic -lrb- _ uncultivated _ -rrb- people he be deeply conversant in the ancient both greek and latin and he borrow boldly from they there be scarce a poet or historian among the roman author of those time whom he have not translate in _ sejanus _ and _ catiline _ : but he have do he robbery so openly that one may see he fear not to be tax by any law he invade author like a monarch and what would be theft in other poet be only victory in he with the spoil of these writer he so represent old rome to we in its rite ceremony and custom that if one of they own poet have write either of he tragedy we have see less of it than in he if there be any fault in he language 'twa that he weave it too closely and laboriously in he serious play perhaps too he do a little too much romanize we tongue leave the word which he translate almost as much latin as he find they : wherein though he learnedly follow the idiom of they language he do not enough comply with ours if i would compare he with shakespeare i must acknowledge he the more correct poet but shakespeare the greater wit shakespeare be the homer or father of we dramatic poet johnson be the virgil the pattern of elaborate write i admire he but i love shakespeare to conclude of he as he have give we the most correct play so in the precept which he have lay down in he _ discovery _ we have as many and profitable rule as any wherewith the french can furnish we have thus speak of this author i proceed to the examination of he comedy the _ silent woman _ _ examan of the silent woman _ to begin first with the length of the action it be so far from exceed the compass of a natural day that it take not up a artificial one ` tis all include in the limit of three hour and a half which be no more than be require for the presentment -lrb- _ representation of it _ -rrb- on the stage a beauty perhaps not much observe if it have -lrb- be -rrb- we should not have look upon the spanish translation -lrb- _ ie the adaptation from the spanish _ -rrb- of _ five hour _ -lrb- pp 533 541 -rrb- with so much wonder the scene of it be lay in london the latitude of place be almost as little as you can imagine : for it lie all within the compass of two house and after the first act in one the continuity of scene be observe more than in any of we play except he own _ fox _ and _ alchemist _ they be not break above twice or thrice at the most in the whole comedy : and in the two best of corneille 's play the _ cid _ and _ cinna _ they be interrupted once a piece the action of the play be entirely one : the end or aim of which be the settle _ mqrose 's _ estate on _ dauphine _ the intrigue of it be the greatest and most noble of any pure unmixed comedy in any language you see in it many person of various character and humor and all delightful as first _ morose _ a old man to whom all noise but he own talking be offensive some who would be think critic say ` this humor of he be force ' but to remove that objection we may consider he first to be naturally of a delicate hearing as many be to whom all sharp sound be unpleasant : and secondly we may attribute much of it to the peevishness of he age or the wayward authority of a old man in he own house where he may make himself obey and this the poet seem to allude to in he name _ morose _ besides this i be assure from diver person that ben johnson be actually acquaint with such a man one altogether as ridiculous as he be here represent other say ` it be not enough to find one man of such a humor it must he common to more and the more common the more natural ' to prove this they instance in the best of comical character _ falstaff _ there be many man resemble he old fat merry cowardly drunken amorous vain and lie but to convince these people i need but -lrb- to -rrb- tell they that _ humor be the ridiculous extravagance of conversation wherein one man differ from all other _ if then it be common or communicate to any how differ it from other man 's or what indeed cause it to be ridiculous so much as the singularity of it as for _ falstaff _ he be not properly one humor but a miscellany of humor or image draw from so many several man that wherein he be singular be he wit or those thing he say _ praeter expectatum _ ` unexpected by the audience ' he quick evasion when you imagine he surprise : which as they be extremely divert of themselves so receive a great addition from he person for the very sight of such a unwieldy old debauched fellow be a comedy alone and here have a place so proper for it i can not but enlarge somewhat upon this subject of humor into which i be fall the ancient have little of it in they comedy : for the -lrb- greek : no geloiou -rrb- -lrb- _ facetious absurdity _ -rrb- of the old comedy of which aristophane be chief be not so much to imitate a man as to make the people laugh at some odd conceit which have commonly somewhat of unnatural or obscene in it thus when you see _ socrate _ bring upon the stage you be not to imagine he make ridiculous by the imitation of he action : but rather by make he perform something very unlike himself something so childish and absurd as by compare it with the gravity of the true socrate make a ridiculous object for the spectator in the new comedy which succeed the poet seek indeed to express the -lrb- greek : aetho -rrb- -lrb- _ manners and habit _ -rrb- as in they tragedy the -lrb- greek : pathos -rrb- -lrb- _ suffering _ -rrb- of mankind but this -lrb- greek : aetho -rrb- contain only the general character of man and manners as -lrb- of -rrb- old man lover servingmen courtizan parasite and such other person as we see in they comedy all which they make alike : that be one old man or father one lover one courtizan so like another as if the first of they have beget the rest of every -lrb- _ each _ -rrb- sort _ ex homine hunc natum dica _ the same custom they observe likewise in they tragedy as for the french though they have the word _ humeur _ among they : yet they have small use of it in they comedy or farce : they be but ill imitation of the _ ridiculum _ or that which stir up laughter in the old comedy but among the english ` tis otherwise where by humor be mean _ some extravagant habit passion or affection particular _ as i say before _ to some one person by the oddness of which he be immediately distinguish from the rest of man _ : which be lively and naturally represent most frequently beget that malicious pleasure in the audience which be testify by laughter : as all thing which be deviation from common custom be ever the aptest to produce it though by the way this laughter be only accidental as the person represent be fantastic or bizarre but pleasure be essential to it as the imitation of what be natural this description of these humor -lrb- 9 -rrb- draw from the knowledge and observation of particular person be the peculiar genius and talent of ben johnson to whose play i now return besides _ morose _ there be at least nine or ten different character and humor in the _ silent woman _ : all which person have several concernment of they own yet be all use by the poet to the conducting of the main design to perfection i shall not waste time in commend the writing of this play : but i will give you my opinion that there be more wit and acuteness of fancy in it than in any of ben johnson 's besides that he have here describe the conversation of gentleman in the person of _ true wit _ and he friend with more gaiety air and freedom than in the rest of he comedy for the contrivance of the plot : ti extreme -lrb- ly -rrb- elaborate and yet withal easy for the -lrb- greek : _ desis _ -rrb- or untie of it : ` tis so admirable that when it be do no one of the audience would think the poet could have miss it and yet it be conceal so much before the last scene that any other way would sooner have enter into you thought but i dare not take upon I to commend the fabric of it because it be altogether so full of art that i must unravel every scene in it to commend it as i ought and this excellent contrivance be still the more to be admire because ` tis -lrb- a -rrb- comedy where the person be only of common rank and they business private not elevated by passion or high concernment as in serious play here every one be a proper judge of what he see nothing be represent but that with which he daily converse : so that by consequence all fault lie open to discovery and few be pardonable ` tis this which horace have judiciously observe -- _ creditur ex medio quia res arcessit habere sudoris minimum sed habet comedium tanto plus oneris quanto venice minus _ but we poet who be not ignorant of these difficulty have prevail -lrb- _ avail _ -rrb- himself of all advantage as he who design a large leap take he rise from the highest ground one of these advantage be that which corneille have lay down as _ the greatest which can arrive _ -lrb- happen -rrb- _ to any poem _ and which he himself could never compass above thrice in all he play viz _ the make choice of some signal and long expect day whereon the action of the play be to depend _ this day be that design by _ dauphine _ for the settling of he uncle 's estate upon he : which to compass he contrive to marry he that the marriage have be plot by he long beforehand be make evident by what he tell _ true wit _ in the second act that ` in one moment he -lrb- _ true wit _ -rrb- have destroy what he have be raise many month ' there be another artifice of the poet which i can not here omit because by the frequent practice of it in he comedy he have leave it to we almost as a rule : that be _ when he have any character or humor wherein he would show a _ coup de matre _ or he highest skill he recommend it to you observation by a pleasant description of it before the person first appear _ thus in _ bartholomew fair _ he give you the picture of _ nump and coke _ and in this those of _ daw lafoole morose _ and the _ collegiate lady _ : all which you hear describe before you see they so that before they come upon the stage you have a longing expectation of they which prepare you to receive they favourably : and when they be there even from they first appearance you be so far acquaint with they that nothing of they humor be lose to you i will observe yet one thing further of this admirable plot the business of it rise in every act the second be greater than the first the third than the second : and so forward to the fifth there too you see till the very last scene new difficulty arise to obstruct the action of the play : and when the audience be bring into despair that the business can naturally be effect then and not before the discovery be make but that the poet might entertain you with more variety all this while he reserve some new character to show you which he open not till the second and third act in the second _ morose daw the barber _ and _ otter _ in the third the _ collegiate lady _ all which he move afterwards in by-walk or under-plot as diversion to the main design least it grow tedious : though they be still naturally join with it and somewhere or other subservient to it thus like a skilful chess player by little and little he draw out he man and make he pawn of use to he greater person if this comedy and some other of he be translate into french prose -lrb- which would now be no wonder to they since moliere have lately give they play out of verse which have not displeased they -rrb- i believe the controversy would soon be decide betwixt the two nation : even make they the judge but we need not call we hero to we aid be it speak to the honor of the english we nation can never want in any age such who be able to dispute the empire of wit with any people in the universe and though the fury of a civil war and power -lrb- for twenty year together -lrb- 1640-1660 ad -rrb- -rrb- abandon to a barbarous race of man enemy of all good learning -lrb- 10 -rrb- have bury the muse under the ruin of monarchy : yet with the restoration of we happiness -lrb- 1660 -rrb- we see revive poesy lift up its head and already shake off the rubbish which lay so heavy upon it we have see since he majesty 's return many dramatic poem which yield not to those of any foreign nation and which deserve all laurel but the english i will set aside flattery and envy it can not be deny but we have have some little blemish either in the plot or writing of all those play which have be make within these seven year and perhaps there be no nation in the world so quick to discern they or so difficult to pardon they as ours : yet if we can persuade ourselves to use the candor of that poet -lrb- _ horace _ -rrb- who though the most severe of critic have leave we this caution by which to moderate we censure _ ubus plum nitent in carmine non ego pauci offendar maculi _ if in consideration of they many and great beauty we can wink at some slight and little imperfection if we i say can be thus equal to ourselves : i ask no favor from the french and if i do not venture upon any particular judgement of we late play : ` tis out of the consideration which a ancient writer give I _ vivorum ut magna admiratio ita censura difficili _ ` betwixt the extreme of admiration and malice ` tis hard to judge uprightly of the living ' only i think it may be permit I to say that as it be no lessen to we to yield to some play -lrb- and those not many -rrb- of we nation in the last age : so can it be no addition to pronounce of we present poet that _ they have far surpass all the ancient and the modern writer of other country _ this my lord -lrb- _ ie the dedicatee the lord buckhurst p 503 -rrb- be the substance of what be then speak on that occasion : and lisideius i think be go to reply when he be prevent thus by crite i be confident say he the most material thing that can be say have be already urge on either side if they have not i must beg of lisideius that he will defer he answer till another time for i confess i have a joint quarrel to you both : because you have conclude -lrb- pp 539 548 -rrb- without any reason give for it that _ rhyme be proper for the stage _ i will not dispute how ancient it have be among we to write this way perhaps we ancestor know no better till shakespeare 's time i will grant it be not altogether leave by he and that pletcher and ben johnson use it frequently in they pastoral and sometimes in other play farther i will not argue whether we receive it originally from we own countryman or from the french for that be a inquiry of as little benefit as theirs who in the midst of the great plague -lrb- 1665 -rrb- be not so solicitous to provide against it as to know whether we have it from the malignity of we own air or by transportation from holland i have therefore only to affirm that _ it be not allowable in serious play _ for comedy i find you be already conclude with I to prove this i might satisfy myself to tell you _ how much in vain it be for you to strive against the stream of the people 's inclination _ the greatest part of whom be prepossess so much with those excellent play of shakespeare fletcher and ben johnson which have be write _ out _ of rhyme that -lrb- except you could bring they such as be write better _ in _ it and those too by person of equal reputation with they -rrb- it will be impossible for you to gain you cause with they : who will -lrb- still -rrb- be judge this it be to which in fine all you reason must submit the unanimous consent of a audience be so powerful that even julius caesar -lrb- as macrobio report of he -rrb- when he be perpetual dictator be not able to balance it on the other side : but when laberius a roman knight at he request contend in the _ mime _ with another poet he be force to cry out _ etiam favente I victus es liberi _ but i will not on this occasion take the advantage of the greater number but only urge such reason against rhyme as i find in the writings of those who have argue for the other way first then i be of opinion that rhyme be unnatural in a play because _ dialogue _ there _ be present as the effect of sudden thought _ for a play be the imitation of nature : and since no man without premeditation speak in rhyme neither ought he to do it on the stage this hinder not but the fancy may be there elevated to a higher pitch of thought than it be in ordinary discourse for there be a probability that man of excellent and quick part may speak noble thing _ ex tempore _ : but those thought be never fetter with the number and sound of verse without study and therefore it can not be but unnatural _ to present the most free way of speak in that which be the most constrain _ ` for this reason ' say aristotle '' ti best to write tragedy in that kind of verse which be the least such or which be nearest prose ' : and this among the ancient be the _ iambic _ and with we be _ blank verse or the measure of verse keep exactly without rhyme _ these number therefore be fittest for a play : the other -lrb- _ ie rhymed verse _ -rrb- for a paper of verse or a poem -lrb- p 566 -rrb- blank verse be as much below they as rhyme be improper for the drama : and if it be object that neither be blank verse make _ ex tempore _ yet as nearest nature they be still to be prefer but there be two particular exception -lrb- _ objection _ -rrb- which many beside myself have have to verse -lrb- _ ie in rhyme _ -rrb- by which it will appear yet more plainly how improper it be in play and the first of they be ground upon that very reason for which some have commend rhyme they say ` the quickness of repartee in argumentative scene receive a ornament from verse -lrb- pp 492 498 -rrb- ' now _ what be more unreasonable than to imagine that a man should not only light upon the wit but the rhyme too upon the sudden _ this nicking of he who speak before both in sound and measure be so great a happiness -lrb- _ felicity _ -rrb- that you must at least suppose the person of you play to be poet _ arcade omne et cantare pare et respondere parati _ they must have arrive to the degree of _ quicquid conabar dicere _ to make verse almost whether they will or not if they be anything below this it will look rather like the design of two than the answer of one it will appear that you actor hold intelligence together that they perform they trick like fortune teller by confederacy the hand of art will be too visible in it against that maxim of all profession _ ar est celare artem _ ` that it be the greatest perfection of art to keep itself undiscovered ' nor will it serve you to object that however you manage it ` tis still know to be a play and consequently the dialogue of two person understand to be the labor of one poet for a play be still a imitation of nature we know we be to be deceive and we desire to be so but no man ever be deceive but with a _ probability of truth _ for who will suffer a gross lie to be fasten upon he thus we sufficiently understand that the scene -lrb- _ ie the scenery which be just now come into use on the english stage _ -rrb- which represent city and country to we be not really such but only paint on board and canvas but shall that excuse the ill painture -lrb- _ painting _ -rrb- or designment of they nay rather ought they not to be labor with so much the more diligence and exactness to help the imagination since the mind of man doth naturally bend to and seek after truth and therefore the nearer anything come to the imitation of it the more it please thus you see you rhyme be incapable of express the greatest thought naturally and the lowest it can not with any grace for what be more unbefitting the majesty of verse than ` to call a servant ' or ` bid a door be shut ' in rhyme and yet this miserable necessity you be force upon ` but verse ' you say ` circumscribe a quick and luxuriant fancy which would extend itself too far on every subject do not the labor which be require to well-turned and polished rhyme set bound to it -lrb- pp 492-493 -rrb- yet this argument if grant would only prove that _ we may write better in verse _ but not _ more naturally _ neither be it able to evince that for he who _ want _ judgement to confine he fancy in blank verse may want it as well in rhyme : and he who have it will avoid error in both kind -lrb- pp 498 571 -rrb- latin verse be as great a confinement to the imagination of those poet as rhyme to ours : and yet you find ovid say too much on every subject _ nescivit _ say seneca _ quod bene cessit relinquere _ : of which he -lrb- ovid -rrb- give you one famous instance in he description of the deluge _ omnium pontus erat deerant quoque litora ponto _ now all be sea nor have that sea a shore thus ovid 's fancy be not limit by verse and virgil need not verse to have bound he in we own language we see ben johnson confine himself to what ought to be say even in the liberty of blank verse and yet corneille the most judicious of the french poet be still vary the same sense a hundred way and dwelling eternally upon the same subject though confine by rhyme some other exception i have to verse but these i have name be for the most part already public : i conceive it reasonable they should first be answer it concern I less than any say neander see he have end to reply to this discourse because when i should have prove that verse may be _ natural _ in play yet i should always be ready to confess that those which i -lrb- _ ie dryden see _ pp 503 566 -rrb- have write in this kind come short of that perfection which be require yet since you be pleased i should undertake this province i will do it : though with all imaginable respect and deference both to that person -lrb- _ ie sir robert howard see _ p 494 -rrb- from whom you have borrow you strongest argument and to whose judgement when i have say all i finally submit but before i proceed to answer you objection i must first remember you that i exclude all comedy from my defense and next that i deny not but blank verse may be also use : and content myself only to assert that _ in serious play _ where the subject and character be great and the plot unmixed with mirth -lrb- which might allay or divert these concernment which be produce -rrb- _ rhyme be there as natural and more effectual than blank verse _ and now have lay down this as a foundation : to begin with crite i must crave leave to tell he that some of he argument against rhyme reach no farther that from _ the fault or defect of ill rhyme _ to conclude against _ the use of it in general _ -lrb- p 598 -rrb- may not i conclude against blank verse by the same reason if the word of some poet who write in it be either ill-chosen or ill-placed which make not only rhyme but all kind of verse in any language unnatural : shall i for they virtuous affectation condemn those excellent line of fletcher which be write in that kind be there anything in rhyme more constrain than this line in blank verse i heaven invoke and strong resistance make where you see both the clause be place unnaturally that be contrary to the common way of speaking and that without the excuse of a rhyme to cause it : yet you would think I very ridiculous if i should accuse the stubbornness of blank verse for this and not rather the stiffness of the poet therefore crite you must either prove that _ word though well choose and duly place yet render not rhyme natural in itself _ or that _ however natural and easy the rhyme may be yet it be not proper for a play _ if you insist on the former part i would ask you what other condition be require to make rhyme natural in itself besides a election of apt word and a right dispose of they for the due _ choice _ of you word express you sense naturally and the due _ place _ they adapt the rhyme to it if you object that _ one verse may be make for the sake of another though both the word and rhyme be apt _ i answer it can not possibly so fall out for either there be a dependence of sense betwixt the first line and the second or there be none if there be that connection then in the natural position of the word the latter line must of necessity flow from the former : if there be no dependence yet still the due order of word make the last line as natural in itself as the other so that the necessity of a rhyme never force any but bad or lazy writer to say what they would not otherwise ` tis true there be both care and art require to write in verse a good poet never conclude upon the first line till he have seek out such a rhyme as may fit the sense already prepare to heighten the second many time the close of the sense fall into the middle of the next verse or farther off and he may often prevail -lrb- _ avail _ -rrb- himself of the same advantage in english which virgil have in latin he may break off in the hemistich and begin another line indeed the not observe these two last thing make play that be writ in verse so tedious : for though most commonly the sense be to be confine to the couplet yet nothing that do _ perpetuo tenore fluere _ ` run in the same channel ' can please always ` tis like the murmuring of a stream : which not vary in the fall cause at first attention at last drowsiness variety of cadence be the best rule the greatest help to the actor and refreshment to the audience if then verse may be make _ natural in itself how become it improper to a play _ you say ` the stage be the representation of nature and no man in ordinary conversation speak in rhyme ' : but you foresee when you say this that it might be answer ` neither do any man speak in blank verse or in measure without rhyme ' therefore you conclude ` that which be nearest nature be still to be prefer ' but you take no notice that rhyme might be make as natural as blank verse by the well place of the word & c all the difference between they when they be both correct be the sound in one which the other want : and if so the sweetness of it and all the advantage result from it which be handle in the _ preface _ to the _ rival lady _ -lrb- pp 487-493 -rrb- will yet stand good as for that place of aristotle where he say ` play should be writ in that kind of verse which be nearest prose ' : it make little for you blank verse be properly but measure prose now measure alone in any modern language do not constitute verse those of the ancient in greek and latin consist in quantity of word and a determinate number of foot but when by the inundation of the goth and vandal into italy new language be bring in and barbarously mingle with the latin of which the italian spanish french and ours -lrb- make out of they and the teutonic -rrb- be dialect : a new way of poesy be practice new i say in those country for in all probability it be that of the conqueror in they own nation the new way consist of measure or number of foot _ and _ rhyme the sweetness of rhyme and observation of accent supply the place of quantity in word : which could neither exactly be observe by those barbarian who know not the rule of it neither be it suitable to they tongue as it have be to the greek and latin no man be tie in modern poesy to observe any farther rule in the foot of he verse but that they be dissyllable -lrb- whether spondee trochee or iambic it matter not -rrb- only he be oblige to rhyme neither do the spanish french italian or german acknowledge at all or very rarely any such kind of poesy as blank verse among they therefore at most ` tis but a poetic prose _ a sermo pedestri _ and as such most fit for comedy : where i acknowledge rhyme to be improper farther as to that quotation of aristotle we couplet verse may be render _ as near _ prose as blank verse itself by use those advantage i lately name as break in the hemistich or run the sense into another line : thereby make art and order appear as loose and free as nature or not tie ourselves to couplet strictly we may use the benefit of the pindaric way practice in the _ siege of rhode _ where the number vary and the rhyme be disposed carelessly and far from often chime neither be that other advantage of the ancient to be despise of change the kind of verse when they please with the change of the scene or some new entrance for they confine not themselves always to iambic but extend they liberty to all lyric number and sometimes even to hexameter but i need not go so far to prove that rhyme as it succeed to all other office of greek and latin verse so especially to this of play since the custom of all nation at this day confirm it all the french italian and spanish tragedy be generally writ in it and sure -lrb- ly -rrb- the universal consent of the most civilised part of the world ought in this as it doth in other custom -lrb- to -rrb- include the rest but perhaps you may tell I i have propose such a way to make rhyme _ natural _ and consequently proper to play as be impracticable and that i shall scarce find six or eight line together in a play where the word be so place and choose as be require to make it _ natural _ i answer no poet need constrain himself at all time to it it be enough he make it he general rule for i deny not but sometimes there may be a greatness in place the word otherwise and sometimes they may sound better sometimes also the variety itself be excuse enough but if for the most part the word be place as they be in the negligence of prose it be sufficient to denominate the way _ practicable _ : for we esteem that to be such which in the trial oftener succeed than miss and thus far you may find the practice make good in many play : where you do not remember still that if you can not find six natural rhyme together it will be as hard for you to produce as many line in blank verse even among the greatest of we poet against which i can not make some reasonable exception and this sir call to my remembrance the beginning of you discourse where you tell we _ we should never find the audience favourable to this kind of write _ till we could produce as good play _ in _ rhyme as ben johnson fletcher and shakespeare have writ _ out _ of it -lrb- p 558 -rrb- but it be to raise envy to the live to compare they with the dead they be honor and almost adore by we as they deserve neither do i know any so presumptuous of themselves as to contend with they yet give I leave to say thus much without injury to they ash that not only we shall never equal they but they could never equal themselves be they to rise and write again we acknowledge they we father in wit : but they have ruin they estate themselves before they come to they child 's hand there be scarce a humor a character or any kind of plot which they have not blow upon all come sullied or waste to we : and be they to entertain this age they could not make so plenteous treatment out of such decayed fortune this therefore will be a good argument to we either not to write at all or to attempt some other way there be no bay to be expect in they walk _ tentanda via est qua I quoque possum tollere humo _ this way of write in verse they have only left free to we we age be arrive to a perfection in it which they never know : and which -lrb- if we may guess by what of theirs we have see in verse as the _ faithful shepherdess _ and _ sad shepherd _ -rrb- ` tis probable they never could have reach for the genius of every age be different : and though ours excel in this i deny not but that to imitate nature in that perfection which they do in prose -lrb- _ ie blank verse _ -rrb- be a greater commendation than to write in verse exactly as for what you have add _ that the people be not generally incline to like this way _ : if it be true it would be no wonder but betwixt the shake off of a old habit and the introduce of a new there should be difficulty do we not see they stick to hopkin and sternhold 's psalm and forsake those of david i mean sandy he translation of they if by the _ people _ you understand the multitude the -lrb- greek : _ ous pollous _ -rrb- ` tis no matter what they think they be sometimes in the right sometimes in the wrong they judgement be a mere lottery _ est ubus pleb recte putat est ubus peccat _ horace say it of the vulgar judge poesy but if you mean the mixed audience of the populace and the noblesse : i dare confidently affirm that a great part of the latter sort be already favourable to verse and that no serious play write since the king 's return -lrb- _ may _ 1660 -rrb- have be more kindly receive by they than the _ siege of rhode _ the _ mustapha _ the _ indian queen _ and _ indian emperor _ -lrb- _ see _ p 503 -rrb- but i come now to the inference of you first argument you say ` the dialogue of play be present as the effect of sudden thought but no one speak suddenly or _ ex tempore _ in rhyme ' -lrb- p 498 -rrb- : and you infer from thence _ that rhyme _ which you acknowledge to be proper to epic poesy -lrb- p 559 -rrb- _ can not equally be proper to dramatic unless we could suppose all man bear so much more than poet that verse should be make _ in _ they not _ by _ they _ it have be formerly urge by you -lrb- p 499 -rrb- and confess by I -lrb- p 563 -rrb- that ` since no man speak any kind of verse _ ex tempore _ that which be _ nearest _ nature be to be prefer ' i answer you therefore by distinguish betwixt what be _ nearest _ to the nature of comedy : which be the imitation of common person and ordinary speaking : and what be _ nearest _ the nature of a serious play this last be indeed the representation of nature but ` tis nature work up to a higher pitch the plot the character the wit the passion the description be all exalt above the level of common converse -lrb- _ conversation _ -rrb- as high as the imagination of the poet can carry they with proportion to verisimility -lrb- _ verisimilitude _ -rrb- tragedy we know be wont to image to we the mind and fortune of noble person : and to pourtray these exactly heroic rhyme be _ nearest _ nature as be the noblest kind of modern verse _ indignatur enim privati et prope socco dignis carminibus narrari coena thyestoe _ say horace and in another place _ effutire levei indigna tragoedium versus _ blank verse be acknowledge to be too low for a poem nay more for a paper of verse -lrb- pp 473498559 -rrb- but if too low for a ordinary sonnet how much more for tragedy which be by aristotle in the dispute between the epic poesy and the dramatic -lrb- for many reason he there allege -rrb- rank above it but set this defense aside you argument be almost as strong against the use of rhyme in poem as in play for the epic way be everywhere interlace with dialogue or discoursive scene : and therefore you must either grant rhyme to be improper there which be contrary to you assertion or admit it into play by the same title which you have give it to poem for though tragedy be justly prefer above the other yet there be a great affinity between they as may easily be discover in that definition of a play which lisideius give we -lrb- p 513 -rrb- the genus of they be the same a just and lively image of human nature in its action passion and traverse of fortune : so be the end namely for the delight and benefit of mankind the character and person be still the same viz the greatest of both sort : only the _ manner of acquaint we _ with those action passion and fortune be different tragedy perform it _ viva voce _ or by action in dialogue : wherein it excel the epic poem which do it chiefly by narration and therefore be not so lively a image of human nature however the agreement betwixt they be such that if rhyme be proper for one it must be for the other verse ` tis true be not ` the effect of sudden thought ' but this hinder not that sudden thought may be represent in verse : since those thought be such as must be higher than nature can raise they without premeditation especially to a continuance of they even out of verse : and consequently you can not imagine they to have be sudden either in the poet or the actor a play as i have say to be like nature be to be set above it as statue which be place on high be make greater than the life that they may descend to the sight in they just proportion perhaps i have insist too long upon this objection but the clearing of it will make my stay shorter on the rest you tell we crite that ` rhyme be most unnatural in repartee or short reply : when he who answer it be presume he know not what the other would say yet make up that part of the verse which be leave incomplete and supplies both the sound and the measure of it this ' you say ` look rather like the confederacy of two than the answer of one ' this i confess be a objection which be in every one 's mouth who love not rhyme but suppose i beseech you the repartee be make only in blank verse might not part of the same argument be turn against you for the measure be as often supply there as it be in rhyme : the latter half of the hemistich as commonly make up or a second line subjoin as a reply to the former which any one leaf in johnson 's play will sufficiently make clear to you you will often find in the greek tragedian and in seneca that when a scene grow up into the warmth of repartee which be the close fighting of it the latter part of the trimeter be supply by he who answer : and yet it be never observe as a fault in they by any of the ancient or modern critic the case be the same in we verse as it be in theirs : rhyme to we be in lieu of quantity to they but if no latitude be to be allow a poet you take from he not only he license of _ quidlibet audendus _ : but you tie he up in a straighter compass than you would a philosopher this be indeed _ musa colere severiore _ you would have he follow nature but he must follow she on foot you have dismount he from he _ pegasus _ but you tell we ` this supply the last half of a verse or adjoining a whole second to the former look more like the design of two than the answer of one -lrb- pp 498 559 -rrb- ' suppose we acknowledge it how come this confederacy to be more displease to you than a dance which be well contrived you see there the united design of many person to make up one figure after they have separate themselves in many petty division they rejoin one by one into the gross the confederacy be plain amongst they for chance could never produce anything so beautiful and yet there be nothing in it that shock you sight i acknowledge that the hand of art appear in repartee as of necessity it must in all kind -lrb- s -rrb- of verse but there be also the quick and poignant brevity of it -lrb- which be a high imitation of nature in those sudden gust of passion -rrb- to mingle with it : and this join with the cadency and sweetness of the rhyme leave nothing in the soul of the hearer to desire ` tis a art which _ appear _ but it _ appear _ only like the shadowing of painture -lrb- _ painting _ -rrb- which be to cause the rounding of it can not be absent : but while that be consider they be lose so while we attend to the other beauty of the matter the care and labor of the rhyme be carry from we or at least drown in its own sweetness as bee be some time bury in they honey when a poet have find the repartee the last perfection he can add to it be to put it into verse however good the thought may be however apt the word in which ` tis couch yet he find himself at a little unrest while rhyme be want he can not leave it till that come naturally and then be at ease and sit down contented from reply which be the most _ elevated _ thought of verse you pass to the most _ mean _ one those which be common with the lowest of household conversation in these you say the majesty of the verse suffer you instance in ` the calling of a servant ' or ` command a door to be shut ' in rhyme this crite be a good observation of yours but no argument for it prove no more but that such thought should be wave as often as may be by the address of the poet but suppose they _ be _ necessary in the place where he use they yet there be no need to put they into rhyme he may place they in the beginning of a verse and break it off as unfit -lrb- when so debased -rrb- for any other use : or grant the worst that they require more room than the hemistich will allow yet still there be a choice to be make of best word and least vulgar -lrb- provide they be apt -rrb- to express such thought many have blame rhyme in general for this fault when the poet with a little care might have redress it : but they do it with no more justice than if english poesy should be make ridiculous for the sake of -lrb- john taylor -rrb- the water poet 's rhyme we language be noble full and significant and i know not why he who be master of it may not clothe ordinary thing in it as decently as the latin if he use the same diligence in he choice of word _ delectus verborum origo est eloquentiae _ be the say of julius caesar one so curious in he that none of they can be change but for the worse one would think ` unlock the door ' be a thing as vulgar as could be speak and yet seneca could make it sound high and lofty in he latin -- _ reserate cluso regii poste lari _ but i turn from this exception both because it happen not above twice or thrice in any play that those vulgar thought be use : and then too be there no other apology to be make yet the necessity of they -lrb- which be alike in all kind -lrb- s -rrb- of write -rrb- may excuse they besides that the great eagerness and precipitation with which they be speak make we rather mind the substance than the dress that for which they be speak rather than what be speak -lrb- n -rrb- for they be always the effect of some hasty concernment and something of consequence depend upon they thus crite i have endeavor to answer you objection it remain only that i should vindicate a argument for verse which you have go about to overthrow it have formerly be say -lrb- p 492 -rrb- that ` the easiness of blank verse render the poet too luxuriant but that the labor of rhyme bound and circumscribe a over fruitful fancy : the sense there be commonly confine to the couplet and the word so order that the rhyme naturally follow they not they the rhyme ' to this you answer that ` it be no argument to the question in hand : for the dispute be not which way _ a man may write best _ but which be _ most proper for the subject on which he write _ ' first give I leave sir to remember you that the argument on which you raise this objection be only secondary it be build upon the hypothesis that to write in verse be proper for serious play which supposition be grant -lrb- as it be briefly make out in that discourse by shew how verse might be make _ natural _ -rrb- : it assert that this way of write be a help to the poet 's judgement by put bound to a wild overflow fancy i think therefore it will not be hard for I to make good what it be to prove but you add that ` be this let pass yet he who want judgement in the liberty of the fancy may as well shew the defect of it when he be confine to verse : for he who have judgement will avoid error and he who have it not will commit they in all kind of write ' this argument as you have take it from a most acute person so i confess it carry much weight in it but by use the word judgement here indefinitely you seem to have put a fallacy upon we i grant he who have judgement that be so profound so strong so infallible a judgement that he need no help to keep it always poise and upright will commit no fault either in rhyme or out of it : and on the other extreme he who have a judgement so weak and craze that no help can correct or amend it shall write scurvily out of rhyme and worse in it but the first of these judgement be nowhere to be find and the latter be not fit to write at all to speak therefore of judgement as it be in the best poet they who have the greatest proportion of it want other help than from it within : as for example you would be loath to say that he who be endue with a sound judgement have no need of history geography or moral philosophy to write correctly judgement be indeed the master workman in a play but he require many subordinate hand many tool to he assistance and verse i affirm to be one of these ` tis a ` rule and line ' by which he keep he building compact and even which otherwise lawless imagination would raise either irregularly or loosely at least if the poet commit error with this help he would make greater and more without it ` tis in short a slow and painful but the surest kind of work ovid whom you accuse -lrb- p 561 -rrb- for luxuriancy in verse have perhaps be farther guilty of it have he writ in prose and for you instance of ben johnson -lrb- p 561 -rrb- who you say writ exactly without the help of rhyme : you be to remember ` tis only a aid to a _ luxuriant _ fancy which he be not -lrb- p 551 -rrb- as he do not want imagination so none ever say he have much to spare neither be verse then refine so much to be a help to that age as it be to ours thus then the second thought be usually the best as receive the maturest digestion from judgement and the last and most mature product of those thought be artfull and labor verse : it may well be infer that verse be a great help to a luxuriant fancy and this be what that argument which you oppose be to evince neander be pursue this discourse so eagerly that eugenius have call to he twice or thrice ere he take notice that the barge stand still and that they be at the foot of somerset stair where they have appoint it to land the company be all sorry to separate so soon though a great part of the evening be already spend : and stand a while look back upon the water which the moonbeam play upon and make it appear like float quicksilver at last they go up through a crowd of french people who be merrily dancing in the open air and nothing concerned for the noise of the gun which have alarm the town that afternoon walk thence together to the piazza they part there eugenius and lisideius to some pleasant appointment they

the publisher _ -rrb- to print it : not for any great opinion that i have entertain but for the opinion that other be please to express which be tell I by some friend i be concern to let the world judge what subject matter of offence be contain in it some be please to believe little of it mine but they be both oblige to I though perhaps not intentionally : the last by think there be anything in it that be worth so ill design a envy as to place it to another author the other perhaps the best breed informer by continue they displeasure towards I since i most gratefully acknowledge to have receive some advantage in the opinion of the sober part of the world by the loss of theirs for the subject i come accidentally to write upon it for a gentleman bring a play to the king 's company call _ the duke of lerma _ and by they i be desire to peruse it and return my opinion whether i think it fit for the stage after i have read it i acquaint they that in my judgement it would not be of much use for such a design since the contrivance scarce would merit the name of a plot and some of that assist by a disguise : and it end abruptly and on the person of philip iii there be fix such a mean character and on the daughter of the duke of lerma such a vicious one : that i could not but judge it unfit to be present by any that have a respect not only to prince but indeed to either man or woman and about that time be to go in the country i be persuade by mr hart to make it my diversion there that so great a hint might not be lose as the duke of lerma saving himself in he last extremity by he unexpected disguise : which be as well in the true story -lrb- _ history _ -rrb- as the old play and besides that and the name my alter the most part of the character and the whole design make I uncapable to use much more though perhaps write with higher style and thought than i could attain to i intend not to trouble myself nor the world any more in such subject but take my leave of these my too long acquaintance : since that little fancy and liberty i once enjoy be now fetter in business of more unpleasant nature yet be i free to apply my thought as my own choice direct they i should hardly again venture into the civil war of censure _ ubus nullo habitura triumpho _ in the next place i must ingeniously confess that the manner of play which now be in most esteem be beyond my power to perform -lrb- p 587 -rrb- nor do i condemn in the least anything of what nature soever that please since nothing could appear to I a ruder folly than to censure the satisfaction of other i rather blame the unnecessary understanding of some that have labor to give strict rule to thing that be not mathematical and with such eagerness pursue they own seeming reason that at last we be to apprehend such argumentative poet will grow as strict as sancho panza 's doctor be to we very appetite : for in the difference of tragedy and comedy and of far -lrb- _ farce _ -rrb- itself there can be no determination but by the taste nor in the manner of they composure and whoever would endeavor to like or dislike by the rule of other he will be as unsuccessful as if he should try to be persuade into a power of believe not what he must but what other direct he to believe but i confess ` tis not necessary for poet to study strict reason : since they be so use to a greater latitude -lrb- pp 568 588 -rrb- than be allow by that severe inquisition that they must infringe they own jurisdiction to profess themselves oblige to argue well i will not therefore pretend to say why i writ this play some scene in blank verse other in rhyme since i have no better a reason to give than chance which wait upon my present fancy : and i expect no better reason from any ingenious person than he fancy for which he best relish i can not therefore but beg leave of the reader to take a little notice of the great pain the author of a _ essay of dramatic poesy _ have take to prove rhyme as _ natural _ in a serious play and more _ effectual _ than blank verse -lrb- pp 561 581 -rrb- thus he state the question but pursue that which he call natural in a wrong application : for ` tis not the question whether rhyme or not rhyme be best or most natural for a grave or serious subject : but what be _ nearest the nature _ of that which it present now after all the endeavor of that ingenious person a play will still be suppose to be a composition of several person speak _ ex tempore _ and ` tis as certain that good verse be the hardest thing that can be imagine to be so speak -lrb- p 582 -rrb- so that if any will be please to impose the rule of measure thing to be the best by _ be nearest _ nature it be grant by consequence that which be most remote from the thing suppose must need be most improper : and therefore i may justly say that both i and the question be equally mistaken for i do own i have rather read good verse than either blank verse or prose and therefore the author do himself injury if he like verse so well in play to lay down rule to raise argument only unanswerable against himself but the same author be fill with the precedent of the ancient write they play in verse commend the thing and assure we that we language be noble full and significant charge all defect upon the ill placing of word and prove it by quote seneca loftily express such a ordinary thing as shut a door _ reserate cluso regii poste lari _ i suppose he be himself highly affect with the sound of these word but to have complete he dictate -lrb- _ injunction _ -rrb- together with he argument he should have oblige we by charming we ear with such a art of place word as in a english verse to express so loftily the shut of a door : that we might have be as much affect with the sound of he word this instead of be a argument upon the question rightly state be a attempt to prove that nothing may seem something by the help of a verse which i easily grant to be the ill fortune of it : and therefore the question be so much mistaken i wonder to see that author trouble himself twice about it with such a absolute triumph declare by he own imagination but i have hear that a gentleman in parliament go to speak twice and be interrupt by another member as against the order of the house : he be excuse by a third -lrb- member -rrb- assure the house he have not yet speak to the question but if we examine the general rule lay down for play by strict reason we shall find the error equally gross : for the great foundation that be lay to build upon be nothing as it be generally state which will appear on the examination of the particulars first we be tell the plot should not be so ridiculously contrived as to crowd several country into one stage secondly to cramp the accident of many year or day into the representation of two hour and a half and lastly a conclusion draw that the only remain dispute be concern time whether it should be contain in twelve or four and twenty hour and the place to be limit to the spot of ground either in town or city where the play be suppose to begin -lrb- p 531 -rrb- and this be call _ nearest _ to nature for that be conclude most natural which be most _ probable _ and _ nearest _ to that which it present i be so well pleased with any ingenious offer as all these be that i should not examine this strictly do not the confidence of other force I to it : there be not anything more unreasonable to my judgement than the attempt to infringe the liberty of opinion by rule so little demonstrative to shew therefore upon what ill grounds they dictate law for dramatic poesy i shall endeavor to make it evident that there be no such thing as what they all pretend -lrb- p 592 -rrb- for if strictly and duly weigh ` tis as impossible for one stage to represent two house or two room truly as two country or kingdom and as impossible that five hour or four and twenty hour should be two hour and a half as that a thousand hour or year should be less than what they be or the greatest part of time to be comprehend in the less for _ all _ be impossible they be none of they nearest the truth or nature of what they present for impossibility be all equal and admit no degree and then if all those poet that have so fervently labor to give rule as maxim would but be please to abbreviate or endure to hear they reason reduce into one strict definition it must be that there be _ degree _ in impossibility and that many thing which be not possible may yet be more or less impossible and from this proceed to give rule to observe the least absurdity in thing which be not at all i suppose i need not trouble the reader with so impertinent a delay to attempt a further confutation of such ill ground reason than thus by open the true state of the case nor do i design to make any further use of it than from hence to draw this modest conclusion : that i would have all attempt of this nature be submit to the fancy of other and bear the name of proposition -lrb- p 590 -rrb- not of confident law or rule make by demonstration and then i shall not discommend any poet that dress he play in such a fashion as he fancy best approve : and fairly leave it for other to follow if it appear to they most convenient and fullest of ornament but write this _ epistle _ in much haste i have almost forget one argument or observation which that author have most good fortune in it be in he _ epistle dedicatory _ before he _ essay of dramatic poesy _ where speaking of rhyme in play he desire it may be observe that none be violent against it but such as have not attempt it or who have succeed ill in the attempt -lrb- pp 503539598 -rrb- which as to myself and he i easily acknowledge : for i confess none have write in that way better than himself nor few worse than i yet i hope he be so ingenious that he would not wish this argument should extend further than to he and I for if it should be receive as a good one : all divine and philosopher would find a readier way of confutation than they yet have do of any that should oppose the least thesis or definition by say they be deny by none but such as never attempt to write or succeed ill in the attempt thus as i be one that be extremely well pleased with most of the _ proposition _ which be ingeniously lay down in that _ essay _ for regulate the stage : so i be also always concern for the true honor of reason and would have no spurious issue father upon she fancy may be allow she wantonness but reason be always pure and chaste : and as it resemble the sun in make all thing clear it also resemble it in its several position when it shine in full height and directly ascendant over any subject it leave but little shadow : but when descend and grow low its oblique shine render the shadow larger than the substance and give the deceive person -lrb- _ ie dryden _ -rrb- a wrong measure of he own proportion thus beg the reader 's excuse for this seeming impertinency i submit what i have write to the liberty of he unconfined opinion : which be all the favor i ask of other to afford I john dryden _ a defense of _ a essay of dramatic poesy be a answer to the preface of _ the great favorite or the duke of lerma _ -lrb- preface to the second edition of _ the indian emperor _ 1668 -rrb- the former edition of the _ indian emperor _ be full of fault which have escape the printer i have be willing to overlook this second with more care : and though i could not allow myself so much time as be necessary yet by that little i have do the press be free from some gross error which it have to answer for before as for the more material fault of write which be properly mine though i see many of they i want leisure to amend they ` tis enough for those who make one poem the business of they life to leave that correct yet except virgil i never meet with any which be so in any language but while i be thus employ about this impression there come to my hand a new print play call _ the great favorite or the duke of lerma _ the author of which a noble and most ingenious person have do I the favor to make some observation and animadversion upon my _ dramatic essay _ i must confess he might have better consult he reputation than by match himself with so weak a adversary but if he honor be diminish in the choice of he antagonist it be sufficiently recompense in the election of he cause : which be the weaker in all appearance -lrb- as combate the receive opinion of the best ancient and modern author -rrb- will add to he glory if he overcome and to the opinion of he generosity if he be vanquish since he engage at so great odds and so -lrb- like a cavalier -rrb- undertake the protection of the weaker party i have only to fear on my own behalf that so good a cause as mine may not suffer by my ill management or weak defense yet i can not in honor but take the glove when ` tis offer I : though i be only a champion by succession and no more able to defend the right of aristotle and horace than a infant dymock to maintain the title of a king for my own concernment in the controversy it be so small that i can easily be contented to be drive from a few notion of dramatic poesy especially by one who have the reputation of understand all thing -lrb- -rrb- : and i might justly make that excuse for my yield to he which the philosopher make to the emperor why should i offer to contend with he who be master of more than twenty legion of art and science but i be force to fight and therefore it will be no shame to be overcome yet i be so much he servant as not to meddle with anything which do not concern _ I _ in he preface therefore i leave the good sense and other excellency of the first twenty line -lrb- _ ie of the preface see _ p 573 -rrb- to be consider by the critic as for the play of _ the duke of lerma _ have so much altered and beautify it as he have do it can be justly belong to none but he indeed they must be extreme -lrb- ly -rrb- ignorant as well as envious who would rob he of that honor : for you see he put in he claim to it even in the first two line _ repulse upon repulse like wave throw back that slide to hang upon obdurate rock _ after this let detraction do its worst for if this be not he it deserve to be for my part i declare for distributive justice and from this and what follow he certainly deserve _ those advantage _ which he acknowledge to _ have receive from the opinion of sober man _ in the next place i must beg leave to observe he great address in court the reader to he party for intend to assault all poet both ancient and modern he discover not he whole design at once but seem only to aim at I and attack I on my weakest side my defense of verse to begin with I he give I the compellation of the author of a _ dramatic essay _ which be a little discourse in dialogue for the most part borrow from the observation of other therefore that i may not be want to he in civility i return he compliment by call he the author of _ the duke of lerma _ but that i may pass over he salute he take notice -lrb- p 575 -rrb- of my great pain to prove rhyme as _ natural _ in a serious play and more _ effectual _ than blank verse -lrb- p 561 -rrb- thus indeed i do state the question but he tell I _ i pursue that which i call _ natural _ in a wrong application for ` tis not the question whether _ rhyme _ or _ not rhyme _ be best or most natural for a serious subject but what be nearest the nature of that it represent _ if i have formerly mistake the question i must confess my ignorance so far as to say i continue still in my mistake but he ought to have prove that i mistook it for ` tis yet but _ grati dictum _ i still shall think i have gain my point if i can prove that rhyme be best or most _ natural _ for a serious subject as for the question as he state it whether rhyme be nearest the nature of what it represent i wonder he should think I so ridiculous as to dispute whether prose or verse be nearest to ordinary conversation it still remain for he to prove he inference that since verse be grant to be more remote than prose from ordinary conversation therefore no serious play ought to be writ in verse : and when he clearly make that good i will acknowledge he victory as absolute as he can desire it the question now be which of we two have mistake it and if it appear i have not the world will suspect _ what gentleman that be who be allow to speak twice in parliament because he have not yet speak to the question _ -lrb- p 576 -rrb- : and perhaps conclude it to be the same who -lrb- as ` tis report -rrb- maintain a contradiction _ in termini _ in the face of three hundred person but to return to verse whether it be natural or not in play be a problem which be not demonstrable of either side ` tis enough for I that he acknowledge that he have rather read good verse than prose -lrb- p 575 -rrb- : for if all the enemy of verse will confess as much i shall not need to prove that it be _ natural _ i be satisfied if it cause delight for delight be the chief if not the only end of poesy instruction can be admit but in the second place for poesy only instruct as it delight ` tis true that to imitate well be a poet 's work : but to affect the soul and excite the passion and above all to move admiration -lrb- _ wonder astonishment _ -rrb- -lrb- which be the delight of serious play -rrb- a bare imitation will not serve the converse -lrb- _ conversation _ -rrb- therefore which a poet be to _ imitate _ must be _ heighten _ with all the art and ornament of poesy and must be such as _ strictly consider _ could never be suppose -lrb- to be -rrb- speak by any without premeditation as for what he urge that _ a play will still be suppose to be a composition of several person speak _ ex tempore and that good verse be the hardest thing which can be imagine to be so speak _ -lrb- p 575 -rrb- : i must crave leave to dissent from he opinion as to the former part of it for if i be not deceive a play be suppose to be the work of the poet _ imitate _ or _ represent _ the conversation of several person : and this i think to be as clear as he think the contrary but i will be bolder and do not doubt to make it good though a paradox that one great reason why prose be not to be use in serious play be because it be too near the nature of converse -lrb- _ conversation _ -rrb- there may be too great a likeness as the most skilful painter affirm there may be too near a resemblance in a picture to take every lineament and feature be not to make a excellent piece but to take so much only as will make a beautiful resemblance of the whole and with a ingenious flattery of nature to heighten the beauty of some part and hide the deformity of the rest for so say horace -- _ ut pictura poesis erit haec amat obscurum vult haec sub luce viderus judici argutum quae non formidat acumen et quae desperat tracta nitescere posse relinquit _ in _ bartholomew fair _ or the lowest kind of comedy that degree of heighten be use which be proper to set off that subject ` tis true the author be not there to go out of prose as he do in he higher argument of comedy the _ fox _ and _ alchemist _ yet he do so raise he matter in that prose as to render it delightful : which he could never have perform have he only say or do those very thing that be daily speak or practice in the fair for then the fair itself would be as full of pleasure to a ingenious person as the play which we manifestly see it be not : but he have make a excellent lazar of it the copy be of price though the origin be vile you see in _ catiline _ and _ sejanus _ where the argument be great he sometimes ascend to verse which shew he think it not unnatural in serious play : and have he genius be as proper for rhyme as it be for humor or have the age in which he live attain to as much knowledge in verse as ours ` tis probable he would have adorn those subject with that kind of write thus prose though the rightful prince yet be by common consent depose as too weak for the government of serious play : and he fail there now start up two competitor one the nearer in blood which be blank verse the other more fit for the end of government which be rhyme blank verse be indeed the nearer prose but he be blemish with the weakness of he predecessor rhyme -lrb- for i will deal clearly -rrb- have somewhat of the usurper in he but he be brave and generous and he dominion please for this reason of delight the ancient -lrb- whom i will still believe as wise as those who so confidently correct they -rrb- write all they tragedy in verse though they know it most remote from conversation but i perceive i be fall into the danger of another rebuke from my opponent : for when i plead that the ancient use verse i prove not that they would have admit rhyme have it then be write all i can say be that it seem to have succeed verse by the general consent of poet in all modern language for almost all they serious play be write in it : which though it be no demonstration that therefore it ought to be so yet at least the practice first and then the continuation of it shew that it attain the end which be to please and if that can not be compass here i will be the first who shall lay it down for i confess my chief endeavor be _ to delight the age in which i live _ -lrb- p 582 -rrb- if the humor of this be for low comedy small accident -lrb- _ incident _ -rrb- and raillery i will force my genius to obey it : though with more reputation i could write in verse i know i be not so fit by nature to write comedy i want that gaiety of humor which be require to it my conversation be dull and slow my humor be saturnine and reserve in short i be none of those who endeavor to break jest in company or make repartee so that those who decry my comedy do I no injury except it be in point of profit reputation in _ they _ be the last thing to which i shall pretend i beg pardon for entertain the reader with so ill a subject : but before i quit that argument which be the cause of this digression i can not but take notice how i be correct for my quotation of seneca in my defense of play in verse my word be these -lrb- p 570 -rrb- : we language be noble full and significant and i know not why he who be master of it may not clothe ordinary thing in it as decently as the latin if he use the same diligence in he _ choice of word _ one would think unlock the door be a thing as vulgar as could be speak : yet seneca could make it sound high and lofty in he latin _ reserate cluso regii poste lari _ but he say of I _ that be fill with the precedent of the ancient who writ they play in verse i commend the thing declare we language to be full noble and significant and charge all the defect upon the _ ill place of word _ which i prove by quote seneca 's loftily express such a ordinary thing as _ shut the door here he manifestly mistake for i speak not of the place but the choice of word : for which i quote that aphorism of julius caesar _ delectus verborum est origo eloquentia _ but _ delectus verborum _ be no more latin for the placing of word than _ reserate _ be latin for _ shut _ the door as he interpret it which i ignorantly construe _ unlock _ or _ open _ it he suppose i be highly affect with the sound of these word and i suppose i may more justly imagine it of he : for if he have not be extremely satisfy with the sound he would have mind the sense a little better but these be now to be no fault for ten day after he book be publish and that he mistake be grow so famous that they be come back to he he send he _ erratum _ to be print and annex to he play and desire that instead of _ shut _ you should read _ open _ which it seem be the printer 's fault i wonder at he modesty that he do not rather say it be seneca 's or mine : and that in some author _ reserate _ be to _ shut _ as well as to _ open _ as the word _ barach _ say the learn be -lrb- _ in hebrew _ -rrb- both to _ bless _ and _ curse _ well since it be the printer -lrb- 's fault -rrb- he be a naughty man to commit the same mistake twice in six line i warrant you _ delectus verborum _ for _ place _ of word be he mistake too though the author forget to tell he of it if it be my book i assure you it should -lrb- be -rrb- for those rascal ought to be the proxy of every gentleman-author and to be chastise for he when he be not please to own a error yet since he have give the _ erratum _ i wish he would have enlarged they only a few sheet more and then he would have spare I the labor of a answer for this cursed printer be so give to mistake that there be scarce a sentence in the preface without some false grammar or hard sense -lrb- _ ie difficulty in gather the meaning _ -rrb- in it which will all be charge upon the poet : because he be so good natured as to lay but three error to the printer 's account and to take the rest upon himself who be better able to support they but he need not -lrb- to -rrb- apprehend that i should strictly examine those little fault except i be call upon to do it i shall return therefore to that quotation of seneca and answer not to what he _ write _ but to what he _ mean _ i never intend it as a argument but only as a illustration of what i have say before -lrb- p 570 -rrb- concern the election of word and all he can charge I with be only this that if seneca could make a ordinary thing sound well in latin by the choice of word the same with like care might be perform in english if it can not i have commit a error on the right hand by commend too much the copiousness and well sound of we language : which i hope my countryman will pardon I at least the word which follow in my _ dramatic essay _ will plead somewhat in my behalf for i say there -lrb- p 570 -rrb- that this objection happen but seldom in a play and then too either the meanness of the expression may be avoid or shut out from the verse by break it in the midst but i have say too much in the defense of verse for after all ` tis a very indifferent thing to I whether it obtain or not i be content hereafter to be order by he rule that be to write it sometimes because it please I -lrb- p 575 -rrb- and so much the rather because he have declare that it please he but he have take he last farewell of the muse and he have do it civilly by honor they with the name of _ he long acquaintance _ -lrb- p 574 -rrb- : which be a compliment they have scarce deserve from he for my own part i bear a share in the public loss and how emulous soever i may be of he fame and reputation i can not but give this testimony of he style that it be extreme -lrb- ly -rrb- poetical even in oratory he thought elevated sometimes above common apprehension he notion politic and grave and tend to the instruction of prince and reformation of state : that they be abundantly interlaced with variety of fancy trope and figure which the critic have enviously brand with the name of obscurity and false grammar well _ he be now fetter in business of more unpleasant nature _ -lrb- p 574 -rrb- the muse have lose he but the commonwealth gain by it the corruption of a poet be the generation of a statesman _ he will not venture again into the civil war of censure _ -lrb- criticism -rrb- _ ubus nullo habitura triumpho _ if he have not tell we he have leave the muse we might have half suspect it by that word _ ubus _ which do not any way belong to _ they _ in that place the rest of the verse be indeed lucan 's : but that _ ubus _ i will answer for it be he own yet he have another reason for this disgust of poesy for he say immediately after that _ the manner of play which be now in most esteem be beyond he power to perform _ -lrb- p 574 -rrb- to _ perform _ the _ manner _ of a thing be new english to I _ however he condemn not the satisfaction of other but rather they unnecessary understanding who like sancho panza 's doctor prescribe too strictly to we appetite for _ say he _ in the difference of tragedy and comedy and of farce itself there can be no determination but by the taste nor in the manner of they composure _ we shall see he now as great a critic as he be a poet : and the reason why he excel so much in poetry will be evident for it will have proceed from the exactness of he judgement _ in the difference of tragedy comedy and farce itself there can be no determination but by the taste _ i will not quarrel with the obscurity of this phrase though i justly might : but beg he pardon if i do not rightly understand he if he mean that there be no essential difference betwixt comedy tragedy and farce but only what be make by people 's taste which distinguish one of they from the other : that be so manifest a error that i need lose no time to contradict it be there neither judge taste or opinion in the world yet they would differ in they nature for the action character and language of tragedy would still be great and high : that of comedy lower and more familiar admiration would be the delight of the one : satire of the other i have but briefly touch upon these thing because whatever he word be i can scarce -lrb- ly -rrb- imagine that _ he who be always concern for the true honor of reason and would have no spurious issue father upon she _ -lrb- p 578 -rrb- should mean anything so absurd as to affirm _ that there be no difference between comedy and tragedy but what be make by taste only _ : unless he would have we understand the comedy of my lord l -lrb- -rrb- where the first act should be _ potage _ the second _ fricass & c _ and the fifth a _ chre entire _ of woman i rather guess he mean that betwixt one comedy or tragedy and another there be no other difference but what be make by the liking or disliking of the audience this be indeed a less error than the former but yet it be a great one the liking or disliking of the people give the play the _ denomination _ of good or bad but do not really make or constitute it such to please the people ought to be the poet 's aim -lrb- pp 513582584 -rrb- because play be make for they delight : but it do not follow that they be always please with good play or that the play which please they be always good the humor of the people be now for comedy therefore in hope to please they i write comedy rather than serious play and so far they taste prescribe to I but it do not follow from that reason that comedy be to be prefer before tragedy in its own nature for that which be so in its own nature can not be otherwise as a man can not but be a rational creature : but the opinion of the people may alter and in another age or perhaps in this serious play may be set up above comedy this i think a sufficient answer if it be not he have provide I of -lrb- _ with _ -rrb- a excuse it seem in he wisdom he foresee my weakness and have find out this expedient for I _ that it be not necessary for poet to study strict reason since they be so use to a greater latitude than be allow by that severe inquisition that they must infringe they own jurisdiction to profess themselves oblige to argue well _ i be oblige to he for discover to I this back door but i be not yet resolve on my retreat for i be of opinion that they can not be good poet who be not accustom to argue well false reasoning and color of speech be the certain mark of one who do not understand the stage for moral truth be the mistress of the poet as much as of the philosopher poesy must _ resemble _ natural truth but it must _ be _ ethical indeed the poet dress truth and adorn nature but do not alter they _ ficta voluptati causa sint proxima veris _ therefore that be not the best poesy which resemble notion of _ thing which be not _ to _ thing which be _ : though the fancy may be great and the word flow yet the soul be but half satisfied when there be not truth in the foundation -lrb- p 560 -rrb- this be that which make virgil -lrb- to -rrb- be prefer before the rest of poet in variety of fancy and sweetness of expression you see ovid far above he for virgil reject many of those thing which ovid write a great wit 's great work be to refuse as my worthy friend sir john birkenhead have ingeniously express it you rarely meet with anything in virgil but truth which therefore leave the strongest impression of pleasure in the soul this i think myself oblige to say in behalf of poesy : and to declare -lrb- though it be against myself -rrb- that when poet do not argue well the defect be in the workman not in the art and now i come to the boldest part of he discourse wherein he attack not I but all the ancient and modern and undermine as he think the very foundation on which dramatic poesy be build i could wish he would have decline that envy which must of necessity follow such a undertaking : and contented himself with triumph over I in my opinion of verse which i will never hereafter dispute with he but he must pardon I if i have that veneration for aristotle horace ben johnson and corneille that i dare not serve he in such a cause and against such hero : but rather fight under they protection as homer report of little teucer who shoot the trojan from under the large buckler of ajax telamon -- -lrb- greek : _ stae d'ar hap aiautos sakeus telamoniadao _ -rrb- & c he stand beneath he brother 's ample shield and cover there shoot death through all the field the word of my noble adversary be these -- _ but if we examine the general rule lay down for play by strict reason we shall find the error equally gross : for the great foundation which be lay to build upon be nothing as it be generally state : as will appear upon the examination of the particulars _ these particulars in due time shall be examine in the meanwhile let we consider what this great foundation be which he say be nothing as it be generally state i never hear of any other foundation of dramatic poesy than the imitation of nature : neither be there ever pretend any other by the ancient or modern or I who endeavor to follow they in that rule this i have plainly say in my definition of a play that it be a just and lively image of human nature & c thus ` the foundation as it be generally state ' will stand sure if this definition of a play be true if it be not he ought to have make he exception against it by prove that a play be _ not _ a imitation of nature but somewhat else which he be pleased to think it but ` tis very plain that he have mistake the foundation for that which be build upon it though not immediately for the direct and immediate consequence be this if nature be to be imitate then there be a rule for imitate nature rightly otherwise there may be a end and no means conduce to it hitherto i have proceed by demonstration but as we divine when they have prove a deity -lrb- because there be order -rrb- and have infer that this deity ought to be worship differ afterwards in the manner of the worship : so have lay down that nature be to be imitate and that proposition -lrb- p 577 -rrb- prove the next that then there be means which conduce to the imitating of nature i dare proceed no farther positively but have only lay down some opinion of the ancient and modern and of my own as means which they use and which i think probable for the attaining of that end those means be the same which my antagonist call the foundation : how properly the world may judge and to prove that this be he meaning he clear it immediately to you by enumerate those rule or proposition against which he make he particular exception as namely those of time and place in these word _ first we be tell the plot should not be so ridiculously contrived as to crowd several country into one stage secondly to cramp the accident of many year or day into the representation of two hour and a half and lastly a conclusion draw that the only remain dispute be concern time whether it should be contain in twelve or four and twenty hour and the place to be limit to the spot of ground -lrb- either in town or city -rrb- where the play be suppose to begin and this be call nearest to nature for that be conclude most natural which be most probable and nearest to that which it present _ thus he have only make a small mistake of the means conduce to the end for the end itself and of the superstructure for the foundation but he proceed _ to show therefore upon what ill grounds they dictate law for dramatic poesy & c _ he be here please to charge I with be magisterial as he have do in many other place of he preface therefore in vindication of myself i must crave leave to say that my whole discourse be sceptical accord to that way of reasoning which be use by socrate plato and all the academic of old which tully and the best of the ancient follow and which be imitate by the modest inquisition of the royal society that it be so not only the name will show which be _ a essay _ but the frame and composition of the work you see it be a dialogue sustain by person of several opinion all of they leave doubtful to be determine by the reader in general and more particularly defer to the accurate judgement of my lord buckhurst to whom i make a dedication of my book these be my word in my epistle speaking of the person whom i introduce in my dialogue ` tis true they differ in they opinion as ` tis probable they would neither do i take upon I to reconcile but to relate they : leave you lordship to decide it in favor of that part which you shall judge most reasonable and after that in my _ advertisement to the reader _ i say this the drift of the ensue discourse be chiefly to vindicate the honor of we english writer from the censure of those who injustly prefer the french before they this i intimate lest any should think I so exceed vain as to teach other a art which they understand much better than myself but this be more than -lrb- be -rrb- necessary to clear my modesty in that point : and i be very confident that there be scarce any man who have lose so much time as to read that trifle but will be my compurgator as to that arrogance whereof i be accuse the truth be if i have be naturally guilty of so much vanity as to dictate my opinion yet i do not find that the character of a positive or self conceited person be of such advantage to any in this age that i should labor to be publicly admit of that order but i be not now to defend my own cause when that of all the ancient and modern be in question for this gentleman who accuse I of arrogance have take a course not to be tax with the other extreme of modesty those proposition which be lay down in my discourse as help to the better imitation of nature be _ not _ mine as i have say nor be ever pretend so to be : but be derive from the authority of aristotle and horace and from the rule and example of ben johnson and corneille these be the man with whom be properly he contend : and against _ whom he will endeavor to make it evident that then be no such thing as what they all pretend _ he argument against the unity of place and time be this _ that ` tis as impossible for one stage to present two room or house truly as two country or kingdom and as impossible that five hour or twenty-four hour should be two hour as that a thousand year or hour should be less than what they be or the greatest part of time to be comprehend in the less : for all of they be impossible they be none of they nearest the truth or nature of what they present for impossibility be all equal and admit of no degree _ this argument be so scatter into part that it can scarce be unite into a syllogism : yet in obedience to he _ i will abbreviate _ and comprehend as much of it as i can in few word that my answer to it may be more perspicuous i conceive he mean to be what follow as to the unity of place if i mistake i beg he pardon profess it be not out of any design to play the _ argumentative poet _ if one stage can not properly present two room or house much less two country or kingdom then there can be no unity of place : but one stage can not properly perform this therefore there can be no unity of place i plainly deny he minor proposition : the force of which if i mistake not depend on this that the stage be one place can not be two this indeed be as great a secret as that we be all mortal but to requite it with another i must crave leave to tell he that though the stage can not be two place yet it may properly represent they successively or at several time he argument be indeed no more than a mere fallacy : which will evidently appear when we distinguish place as it relate to play into real and imaginary the real place be that theater or piece of ground on which the play be act the imaginary that house town or country where the action of the drama be suppose to be or more plainly where the scene of the play be lay let we now apply this to that herculean argument _ which if strictly and duly weigh be to make it evident that there be no such thing as what they all pretend ` tis impossible _ he say _ for one stage to present two room or house _ i answer ti neither impossible nor improper for one _ real _ place to represent two or more _ imaginary _ place : so it be do successively which in other word be no more than this that the imagination of the audience aid by the word of the poet and paint scene -lrb- _ scenery _ -rrb- nay _ suppose _ the stage to be sometimes one place sometimes another now a garden or wood and immediately a camp which i appeal to every man 's imagination if it be not true neither the ancient nor modern -lrb- as much fool as he be pleased to think they -rrb- ever assert that they could make one place two : but they might hope by the good leave of this author that the change of a scene might lead the imagination to suppose the place alter so that he can not fasten those absurdity upon this scene of a play or imaginary place of action that it be one place and yet two and this be so clearly prove that ` tis past any shew of a reasonable denial it will not be hard to destroy that other part of he argument which depend upon it that _ ` tis as impossible for a stage to represent two room or house as two country or kingdom _ : for he reason be already overthrow which be _ because both be alike impossible _ this be manifestly otherwise : for ` tis prove that a stage may properly represent two room or house for the imagination be judge of what be represent will in reason be less chocqued -lrb- shocked -rrb- with the appearance of two room in the same house or two house in the same city than with two distant city in the same country or two remote country in the same universe imagination in a man or reasonable creature be suppose to participate of reason and when that govern -lrb- as it do in the belief of fiction -rrb- reason be not destroy but mislead or blind that can prescribe to the reason during the time of the representation somewhat like a weak belief of what it see and hear and reason suffer itself to be so hoodwink that it may better enjoy the pleasure of the fiction : but it be never so wholly make a captive as to be draw headlong into a persuasion of those thing which be most remote from probability ` tis in that case a free bear subject not a slave it will contribute willingly its assent as far as it see convenient : but will not be force now there be a greater vicinity in nature betwixt two room than betwixt two house betwixt two house than betwixt two city and so of the rest reason therefore can sooner be lead by imagination to step from one room to another than to walk to two distant house : and yet rather to go thither than to fly like a witch through the air and be hurry from one region to another fancy and reason go hand in hand the first can not leave the last behind : and though fancy when it see the wide gulf would venture over as the nimbler yet it be withhold by reason which will refuse to take the leap when the distance over it appear too large if ben johnson himself will remove the scene from rome into tuscany in the same act and from thence return to rome in the scene which immediate follow reason will consider there be no proportionable allowance of time to perform the journey and therefore will choose to stay at home so then the less change of place there be the less time be take up in transport the person of the drama with analogy to reason : and in that analogy or resemblance of fiction to truth consist the excellency of the play for what else concern the unity of place i have already give my opinion of it in my _ essay _ that there be a latitude to be allow to it as several place in the same town or city or place adjacent to each other in the same country which may all be comprehend under the larger denomination of one place yet with this restriction the nearer and fewer those imaginary place be the greater resemblance they will have to truth : and reason which can not _ make _ they one will be more easily lead to _ suppose _ they so what have be say of the unity of place may easily be apply to that of time i grant it to be impossible that _ the greater part of time should be comprehend in the less _ that _ twenty-four hour should be crowd into three _ but there be no necessity of that supposition for as place so time relate to a play be either imaginary or real the real be comprehend in those three hour more or less in the space of which the play be represent the imaginary be that which be suppose to be take up in the representation as twenty-four hour more or less now no man ever could suppose that twenty-four _ real _ hour could be include in the space of three : but where be the absurdity of affirm that the feigned business of twenty-four _ imagine _ hour may not more naturally be represent in the compass of three _ real _ hour than the like feigned business of twenty-four year in the same proportion of real time for the _ proportion _ be always real and much nearer by he permission of twenty-four to three than of 4000 to it i be almost fearful of illustrate _ anything _ by similitude lest he should confute it for a argument : yet i think the comparison of a glass will discover very aptly the fallacy of he argument both concern time and place the strength of he reason depend on this that the less can not comprehend the greater i have already answer that we need not suppose it do i say not that the less can _ comprehend _ the greater but only that it may _ represent _ it as in a mirror of half a yard -lrb- in -rrb- diameter a whole room and many person in it may be see at once : not that it can _ comprehend _ that room or those person but that it _ represent they to the sight _ but the author of _ the duke of lerma _ be to be excuse for he declare against the unity of time for if i be not much mistaken he be a interessed -lrb- _ interested _ -rrb- person the time of that play take up so many year as the favor of the duke of lerma continue : nay the second and third act include all the time of he prosperity which be a great part of the reign of philip iii for in the beginning of the second act he be not yet a favorite and before the end of the third be in disgrace i say not this with the least design of limit the stage too servilely to twenty-four hour : however he be please to tax I with dogmatize in that point in my dialogue as i before hint several person maintain they several opinion one of they indeed who support the cause of the french poesy say how strict they be in that particular -lrb- p 531 -rrb- but he who answer in behalf of we nation be willing to give more latitude to the rule and cite the word of corneille himself complain against the severity of it and observe what beauty it banish from the stage page 44 of my _ essay _ in few word my own opinion be this and i willingly submit it to my adversary when he will please impartially to consider it that the imaginary time of every play ought to be contrived into as narrow a compass as the nature of the plot the quality of the person and variety of accident will allow in comedy i would not exceed twenty-four or thirty hour for the plot accident and person of comedy be small and may be naturally turn in a little compass but in tragedy the design be weighty and the person great therefore there will naturally be require a greater space of time in which to move they and this though ben johnson have not tell we yet ` tis manifestly he opinion for you see that to he comedy he allow generally but twenty-four hour : to he two tragedy _ sejanus _ and _ catiline _ a much larger time though he draw both of they into as narrow a compass as he can for he show you only the latter end of _ sejanus _ he favor and the conspiracy of _ catiline _ already ripe and just break out into action but as it be a error on the one side to make too great a disproportion betwixt the _ imaginary _ time of the play and the _ real _ time of its representation : so on the other side ` tis a oversight to compress the accident of a play into a narrower compass than that in which they could naturally be produce of this last error the french be seldom guilty because the thinness of they plot prevent they from it : but few englishman except ben johnson have ever make a plot with variety of design in it include in twenty-four hour which be altogether natural for this reason i prefer the _ silent woman _ before all other play i think justly : as i do its author in judgement above all other poet yet of the two i think that error the most pardonable which in too straight a compass crowd together many accident : since it produce more variety and consequently more pleasure to the audience and because the nearness of proportion betwixt the imaginary and real time do speciously cover the compression of the accident thus i have endeavor to answer the _ meaning _ of he argument for as he draw it i humbly conceive it be none as will appear by he proposition and the proof of it he proposition be this _ if strictly and duly weigh ` tis as impossible for one stage to present two room or house as two country or kingdom & c _ and he proof this _ for all be impossible they be none of they nearest the truth or nature of what they present _ here you see instead of a proof or reason there be only a _ petitio principius _ for in plain word he sense be this two thing be as impossible as one another : because they be both equally impossible but he take those two thing to be _ grant _ as impossible which he ought to have _ prove _ such before he have proceed to prove they equally impossible he should have make out first that it be impossible for one stage to represent two house and then have go forward to prove that it be as equally impossible for a stage to present two house as two country after all this the very absurdity to which he would reduce I be none at all for he only drive at this that if he argument be true i must then acknowledge that there be degree in impossibility which i easily grant he without dispute and if i mistake not aristotle and the school be of my opinion for there be some thing which be absolutely impossible and other which be only so _ ex parte _ as ` tis absolutely impossible for a thing _ to be _ and _ not to be _ at the same time : but for a stone to move naturally upward be only impossible _ ex parte materiae _ but it be not impossible for the first mover to alter the nature of it he last assault like that of a frenchman be most feeble for where i have observe that none have be violent against verse but such only as have not attempt it or have succeed ill in they attempt -lrb- pp 503539561578 -rrb- he will need accord to he usual custom improve my observation into a argument that he might have the glory to confute it but i lay my observation at he foot : as i do my pen which i have often employ willingly in he deserve commendation and now most unwillingly against he judgement for he person and part i honor they as much as any man living : and have have so many particular obligation to he that i should be very ungrateful if i do not acknowledge they to the world but i give not the first occasion of this difference in opinion in my _ epistle dedicatory _ before my _ rival lady _ -lrb- pp 487-493 -rrb- i say somewhat in behalf of verse : which he be please to answer in he _ preface _ to he _ play _ -lrb- pp 494-500 -rrb- that occasion my reply in my _ essay _ -lrb- pp 501-572 -rrb- : and that reply beget he rejoinder in he _ preface _ to _ the duke of lerma _ -lrb- pp 573-578 -rrb- but as i be the last who take up arm i will be the first to lay they down for what i have here write i submit it wholly to he -lrb- p 561 -rrb- and if i do not hereafter answer what may be object to this paper i hope the world will not impute it to any other reason than only the due respect which i have for so noble a opponent thoma ellwood _ relation with john milton _ i mention before that when i be a boy i make some good progress in learning and lose it all again before i come to be a man : nor be i rightly sensible of my loss therein until i come amongst the quaker but then i both see my loss and lament it and apply myself with the utmost diligence at all leisure time to recover it : so false i find that charge to be which in those time be cast as a reproach upon the quaker that they despise and decry all human learning because they deny it to be _ essentially necessary _ to a gospel ministry which be one of the controversy of those time but though i toil hard and spare no pain to regain what once i have be master of yet i find it a matter of so great difficulty that i be ready to say as the noble eunuch to philip in another case how can i unless i have some man to guide I this i have formerly complain of to my especial friend isaac penington but now more earnestly which put he upon consider and contrive a means for my assistance he have a intimate acquaintance with dr paget a physician of note in london and he with john milton a gentleman of great note in learn throughout the learn world for the accurate piece he have write on various subject and occasion this person have fill a public station in the former time live now a private and retired life in london : and have wholly lose he sight keep a man to read to he which usually be the son of some gentleman of he acquaintance whom in kindness he take to improve in he learn thus by the mediation of my friend isaac penington with dr paget and of dr paget with john milton be i admit to come to he : not as a servant to he -lrb- which at that time he need not -rrb- nor to be in the house with he but only to have the liberty of come to he house at certain hour when i would and to read to he what book he should appoint I which be all the favor i desire but this be a matter which would require some time to bring it about i in the meanwhile return to my father 's house -lrb- at crowell -rrb- in oxfordshire i have before receive direction by letter from my eldest sister write by my father 's command to put off -lrb- _ dispose of _ -rrb- what cattle he have leave about he house and to discharge he servant which i have do at the time call michaelma -lrb- 1661 -rrb- before so that all that winter when i be at home i live like a hermit all alone have a pretty large house and nobody in it but myself at night especially but a elderly woman whose father have be a old servant to the family come every morning and make my bed and do what else i have occasion for she to do : till i fall ill of the small-pox and then i have she with I and the nurse but now understand by letter from my sister that my father do not intend to return and settle there i make off -lrb- _ sell _ -rrb- those provision which be in the house that they might not be spoil when i be go : and because they be what i should have spend if i have tarry there i take the money make of they to myself for my support at london if the project succeed for my go thither this do i commit the care of the house to a tenant of my father 's who live in the town and take my leave of crowell go up to my sure friend isaac penington again where understand that the mediation use for my admittance to john milton have succeed so well that i might come when i would : i hasten to london -lrb- _ in the spring of 1662 _ -rrb- and in the first place go to wait upon he he receive I courteously as well for the sake of dr paget who introduce I as of isaac penington who recommend I : to both of whom he bear a good respect and have inquire diver thing of I with respect to my former progression in learn he dismiss I to provide myself of such accommodation as might be most suitable to my future study i go therefore and take myself a lodging as near to he house which be then in jewin street as conveniently as i could and from thenceforward go every day in the afternoon except on the first day of the week and sit by he in he dining-room read to he in such book in the latin tongue as he please to hear I read at my first sit to read to he observe that i use the english pronounciation he tell I if i would have the benefit of the latin tongue not only to read and understand latin author but to converse with foreigner either abroad or at home i must learn the foreign pronounciation to this i consent he instruct I how to sound the vowel so different -lrb- ly -rrb- from the common pronounciation use by the english who speak _ anglice _ they latin that -lrb- with some few other variation in sound some consonant : in particular case -lrb- s -rrb- as _ c _ before _ e _ or _ i _ like _ ch _ _ sc _ before _ i _ like _ sh _ & c -rrb- the latin thus speak seem as different from that which be deliver as the english generally speak it as if it be another language i have before during my retired life at my father 's by unwearied diligence and industry so far recover the rule of grammar -lrb- in which i have once be very ready -rrb- that i could both read a latin author and after a sort hammer out he meaning but this change of pronounciation prove a new difficulty to I it be now harder for I to read than it be before to understand when read but _ labor omnium vincit improbus _ incessant pain the end obtain and so do i : which make my read the more acceptable to my master he on the other hand perceive with what earnest desire i pursued learning give I not only all the encouragement but all the help he could for have a curious ear he understand by my tone when i understand what i read and when i do not and accordingly would stop I examine I and open the most difficult passage thus i go on for about six week ' time read to he in the afternoon and exercise myself with my own book in my chamber in the forenoon i be sensible of a improvement but alas i have fix my study in a wrong place london and i could never agree for health my lung as i suppose be too tender to bear the sulphurous air of that city so that i soon begin to droop and in less than two month ' time i be fain to leave both my study and the city and return into the country to preserve life and much ado i have to get thither i choose to go down to wiccombe and to john rance 's house there : both as he be a physician and he wife a honest hearty discreet and grave matron whom i have a very good esteem of and who i know have a good regard for I there i lay ill a considerable time and to that degree of weakness that scarcely any who see I expect my life -lrb- _ that i should live _ -rrb- : but the lord be both gracious to I in my illness and be please to raise I up again that i might serve he in my generation as soon as i have recover so much strength as to be fit to travel i obtain of my father -lrb- who be then at he house in crowell to dispose of some thing he have there and who in my illness have come to see I -rrb- so much money as would clear all charge in the house for physic food and attendance : and have fully discharge all i take leave of my friend in that family and town and return -lrb- _ in October 1662 _ -rrb- to my study at london i be very kindly receive by my master who have conceive so good a opinion of I that my conversation i find be acceptable to he and he seem heartily glad of my recovery and return : and into we old method of study we fall again i read to he and he explain to I as occasion require but as if learning have be a forbid fruit to I scarce be i well settle in my work before i meet with another diversion -lrb- _ hindrance _ -rrb- which turn I quite out of my work for a sudden storm arise -lrb- from i know not what surmise of a plot and thereby danger to the government -rrb- the meeting of dissenter such i mean as could be find -lrb- which perhaps be not many besides the quaker -rrb- be break up throughout the city : and the prison mostly fill with we friend i be that morning which be the 26th day of the 8th month -lrb- _ which accord to the reckoning of the society of friend be October they first month down to 1752 be march _ -rrb- 1662 at the meeting at the _ bull and mouth _ by alder gate : when on a sudden a party of soldier of the trained band of the city rush in with noise and clamor : be lead by one who be call major rosewell : a apothecary if i misremember not and at that time under the ill name of a papist -lrb- so the friend there with ellwood be take and send to bridewell till the 19th December following : when they be take to newgate expect to be call at the old bailey session : but not be call be send back to bridewell again on the 29th December they be bring up at the session and refuse to swear be all commit to the common side of newgate but that prison be so full they be send back to bridewell again then we have the follow extraordinary circumstance -rrb- have make up we pack and take we leave of we friend whom we be to leave behind we take we bundle on we shoulder and walk two and two a breast through the old bailey into fleet street and so to old bridewell and it be about the middle of the afternoon and the street pretty full of people both the shopkeeper at they door and passenger in the way would stop we and ask we what we be and whither we be go and when we have tell they we be prisoner go from one prison to another -lrb- from newgate to bridewell -rrb- what say they without a keeper no say we for we word which we have give be we keeper some thereupon would advise we not to go to prison but to go home but we tell they we could not do so we could suffer for we testimony but could not fly from it i do not remember we have any abuse offer we but be generally pity by the people when we be come to bridewell we be not put up into the great room in which we have be before but into a low room in another fair court which have a pump in the middle of it and here we be not shut up as before but have the liberty of the court to walk in and of the pump to wash and drink at and indeed we might easily have go quite away if we would there be a passage through the court into the street : but we be true and steady prisoner and look upon this liberty arise from they confidence in we to be a kind of _ parole _ upon we so that both conscience and honor stand now engage for we true imprisonment and this privilege we enjoy by the indulgence of we keeper whose heart god dispose to favor we so that both the master and he porter be very civil and kind to we and have be so indeed all along for when we be shut up before the porter would readily let some of we go home in a evening and stay at home till next morning which be a great conveniency to man of trade and business which i be free from forbore ask for myself that i might not hinder other under this easy restraint we lay till the court sate at the old bailey again and then -lrb- whether it be that the heat of the storm be somewhat abate or by what other means providence work it i know not -rrb- we be call to the bar and without further question discharge whereupon we return to bridewell again and have raise some money among we and therewith gratify both the master and he porter for they kindness to we we spend some time in a solemn meeting to return we thankful acknowledgment to the lord both for he preservation of we in prison and deliverance of we out of it and then take a solemn farewell of each other we depart with bag and baggage -lrb- _ at the end of January 1663 _ -rrb- -lrb- thus by such magnificent patience under arbitrary injustice these invincible quaker shame the reckless crime which in those day go by the name of the law and such story as ellwood 's _ life _ and george fox 's _ journal _ abound with like splendid victory of patience by man who be incapable of tell a lie or of intentionally break they word john bunyan 's imprisonment at this time be much of the same kind as ellwood 's as soon as the keeper of bedford gaol find he could trust he -rrb- be now at liberty i visit more generally my friend that be still in prison : and more particularly my friend and benefactor william penington at he house and then go to wait upon my master milton with whom yet i could not propose to enter upon my intermitted study until i have be in buckinghamshire to visit my worthy friend isaac penington and he virtuous wife with other friend in that country -lrb- _ district or county _ -rrb- thither therefore i betook myself and the weather be frosty and the way by that mean clean and good i walk it through in a day : and be receive by my friend there with such demonstration of hearty kindness as make my journey very easy to I i intend only a visit hither not a continuance and therefore purpose after i have stay a few day to return to my lodging and former course -lrb- _ ie of read to milton _ -rrb- in london but providence order otherwise isaac penington have at that time two son and one daughter all then very young : of whom the eldest son john penington and the daughter mary -lrb- the wife of daniel wharley -rrb- be yet live at the writing of this -lrb- _ 1713 _ -rrb- and be himself both skilful and curious in pronounciation he be very desirous to have they well ground in the rudiment of the english tongue to which end he have send for a man out of lancashire whom upon inquiry he have hear of who be undoubtedly the most accurate english teacher that ever i meet with or have hear of he name be richard bradley but as he pretend no higher than the english tongue and have lead they by grammar rule to the highest improvement they be capable of in that he have then take he leave and be go up to london to teach a english school of friend ' child there this put my friend to a fresh strait he have seek for a new teacher to instruct he child in the latin tongue as the old have do in the english : but have not yet find one wherefore one evening as we sate together by the fire in he bedchamber which for want of health he keep : he ask I he wife be by if i would be so kind to he as to stay a while with he till he could hear of such a man as he aim at and in the meantime enter he child in the rudiment of the latin tongue this question be not more unexpected than surprising to I and the more because it seem directly to thwart my former purpose and undertaking of endeavor to improve myself by follow my study with my master milton which this would give at least a present diversion from and for how long i could not foresee but the sense i have of the manifold obligation i lay under to these worthy friend of mine shut out all reasoning and disposed my mind to a absolute resignation to they desire that i might testify my gratitude by a willingness to do they any friendly service that i could be capable of and though i question my ability to carry on that work to its due height and proportion yet as that be not propose but a initiation only by accidence into grammar i consent to the proposal as a present expedient till a more qualified person should be find without further treaty or mention of term between we than that of mutual friendship and to render this digression from my own study the less uneasy to my mind i recollect and often think of that rule of lilly -- _ quus docet indocto licet indoctissimus esset ipse brevus reliqui doctior esse queat _ he that th ` unlearned doth teach may quickly be more learn than they though most unlearned he with this consideration i undertake this province and leave it not until i marry which be not till -lrb- _ the 28th October in _ -rrb- the year 1669 near -lrb- ly -rrb- seven year from the time i come thither in which time have the use of my friend 's book as well as of my own i spend my leisure hour much in read not without some improvement to myself in my private study : which -lrb- with the good success of my labor bestow on the child and the agreeableness of conversation which i find in the family -rrb- render my undertaking more satisfactory and my stay there more easy to I although the storm raise by the _ act for banishment -lrb- 16 car ii c 4 1664 _ -rrb- fall with the greatest weight and force upon some other part as at london hertford & c : yet be we in buckinghamshire not wholly exempt therefrom for a part of that shower reach we also for a friend of amersham whose name be edward perot or parret depart this life and notice be give that he body would be bury there on such a day -lrb- which be the first day of the fifth month -lrb- _ July _ -rrb- 1665 -rrb- : the friend of the adjacent part of the country resort pretty generally to the burial so that there be a fair appearance of friend and neighbor the deceased have be well beloved by both after we have spend some time together in the house -lrb- morgan watkin who at that time happen to be at isaac penington 's be with we -rrb- the body be take up and bear on friend ' shoulder along the street in order to be carry to the burying-ground : which be at the town 's end be part of a orchard belong to the deceased which he in he lifetime have appoint for that service it so happen that one ambrose bennet a barrister at law and a justice of the peace for that county be ride through the town -lrb- of amersham -rrb- that morning in he way to aylesbury : and be by some ill-disposed person or other inform that there be a quaker to be bury there that day and that most of the quaker in the country -lrb- _ county _ -rrb- be come thither to the burial upon this he set up he horse and stay and when we not know anything of he design against we go innocently forward to perform we christian duty for the interment of we friend he rush out of he inn upon we with the constable and a rabble of rude fellow whom he have gather together : and have he draw sword in he hand strike one of the foremost of the bearer with it command they to set down the coffin but the friend who be so stricken whose name be thomas dell -lrb- be more concerned for the safety of the dead body than he own lest it should fall from he shoulder and any indecency thereupon follow -rrb- hold the coffin fast which the justice observe and be enrage that he word -lrb- how unjust soever -rrb- be not forthwith obeyed set he hand to the coffin and with a forcible thrust throw it off the bearer ' shoulder so that it fall to the ground in the midst of the street : and there we be force to leave it for immediately thereupon the justice give command for the apprehend we the constable with the rabble fall on we and draw some and drive other in the inn : give thereby a opportunity to the rest to walk away of those that be thus take i be one and be with many more put into a room under a guard we be keep there till another justice call sir thoma clayton whom justice bennet have send for to join with he in commit we be come and then be call forth severally before they they pick out ten of we and commit we to aylesbury gaol : for what neither we nor _ they _ know for we be not convict of have either do or say anything which the law could take hold of for they take we up in the open street the king 's highway not do any unlawful act but peaceably carry and accompany the corpse of we deceased friend to bury it which they would not suffer we to do but cause the body to lie in the open street and in the cartway : so that all the traveller that pass by -lrb- whether horseman coach cart or waggon -rrb- be fain to break out of the way to go by it that they might not drive over it until it be almost night and then have cause a grave to be make in the unconsecrated part as it be account of that which be call the church yard : they forcibly take the body from the widow -lrb- whose right and property it be -rrb- and bury it there when the justice have deliver we prisoner to the constable it be then late in the day which be the seventh day of the week : he -lrb- not willing to go so far as aylesbury nine long mile with we that night nor to put the town -lrb- of amersham -rrb- to the charge of keep we there that night and the first day and night follow -rrb- dismiss we upon we _ parole _ to come to he again at a set hour on the second day morning whereupon we all go home to we respective habitation and come to he punctually -lrb- _ on Monday 3rd July _ 1665 -rrb- accord to promise be by he without guard conduct to the prison the gaoler whose name be nathaniel birch have not long before behave himself very wickedly with great rudeness and cruelty to some of we friend of the lower side of the country -lrb- _ ie buckinghamshire _ -rrb- whom he combine with the clerk of the peace whose name be henry well have contrived to get into he gaol : and after they be legally discharge in court detain they in prison use great violence and shut they up close in the common gaol among the felon because they would not give he he unrighteous demand of fee which they be the more straitened in from he treacherous deal with they and they have through suffer maintain they freedom and obtain they liberty : we be the more concerned to keep what they have so hardly gain and therefore resolve not to make any contract or term for either chamber rent or fee but to demand a free prison which we do when we come in the gaoler be ride out to wait on the judge who come in that day -lrb- _ 3rd July 1665 _ -rrb- to begin the assize and he wife be somewhat at a loss how to deal with we but be a cunning woman she treat we with a great appearance of courtesy offer we the choice of all she room and when we ask upon what term she still refer we to she husband tell we she do not doubt but that he would be very reasonable and civil to we thus she endeavor to have draw we to take possession of some of she chamber at a venture and trust to she husband 's kind usage : but we who at the cost of we friend have a proof of he kindness be too wary to be draw in by the fair word of a woman : and therefore tell she we would not settle anywhere till she husband come home and then would have a free prison wheresoever he put we accordingly walk all together into the court of the prison in which be a well of very good water and have beforehand send to a friend in the town a widow woman whose name be sarah lambarn to bring we some bread and cheese : we sate down upon the ground round about the well and when we have eat we drink of the water out of the well we great concern be for we friend isaac penington because of the tenderness of he constitution : but he be so lively in he spirit and so cheerfully give up to suffer that he rather encourage we than need any encouragement from we in this posture the gaoler when he come home find we and have before he come to we consult he wife and by she understand on what term we stand : when he come to we he hide he tooth and put on a shew of kindness seem much trouble that we should sit there abroad -lrb- _ in the open air _ -rrb- especially he old friend mr penington and thereupon invite we to come in and take what room in he house we please we ask upon what term let he know withal that we be determine to have a free prison he -lrb- like the sun and the wind in the fable that strive which of they should take from the traveller he cloak -rrb- have like the wind try rough boisterous violent means to we friend before but in vain resolve now to imitate the sun and shine as pleasantly as he could upon we wherefore he tell we we should make the term ourselves and be as free as we desire if we think fit when we be release to give he anything he would thank we for it : and if not he would demand nothing upon these term we go in : and dispose ourselves some in the dwelling-house other in the malt-house : where they choose to be during the assize we be bring before judge morton -lrb- _ sir william morton recorder of gloucester _ -rrb- a sour angry man who -lrb- _ be a old cavalier officer naturally _ -rrb- very rudely revile we but would not hear either we or the cause refer the matter to the two justice who have commit we they when the assize be end send for we to be bring before they at they inn -lrb- at aylesbury -rrb- and fine we as i remember 6 8d a piece : which we not consent to pay they commit we to prison again for one month from that time on the _ act for banishment _ when we have lie there that month -lrb- _ ie not later than the middle of August 1665 _ -rrb- i with another go to the gaoler to demand we liberty : which he readily grant tell we the door should be open when we please to go this answer of he i report to the rest of my friend there and thereupon we raise among we a small sum of money which they put into my hand for the gaoler whereupon i take another with I go to the gaoler with the money in my hand and remind he of the term upon which we accept the use of he room i tell he that though we could not pay chamber rent nor fee yet inasmuch as he have now be civil to we we be willing to acknowledge it by a small token : and thereupon give he the money he put it into he pocket say i thank you and you friend for it and to let you see that i take it as a gift not a debt i will not look on it to see how much it be the prison door be then set open for we we go out and depart to we respective home some little time before i go to aylesbury prison -lrb- _ on 3rd July 1665 _ -rrb- i be desire by my quondam master milton to take a house for he in the neighborhood where i dwelt that he might get out of the city for the safety of himself and he family : the pestilence then grow hot in london i take a pretty box for he -lrb- _ ie in June 1665 _ -rrb- in giles-chalfont -lrb- _ chalfont st gile _ -rrb- a mile from I -lrb- _ ellwood be then live in isaac penington 's house call the grange at chalfont st peter or peter 's chalfont as he call it _ -rrb- of which i give he notice : and intend to have wait on he and see he well settle in it but be prevent by that imprisonment -lrb- _ therefore milton do not come into buckinghamshire at this time till after the 3rd July 1665 _ -rrb- but now -lrb- _ ie not later than the middle of August 1665 _ -rrb- be release and return home i soon make a visit to he to welcome he into the country -lrb- _ county _ -rrb- after some common discourse have pass between we -lrb- _ evidently at ellwood 's first visit _ -rrb- call for a manuscript of he : which be bring he deliver to I bid I take it home with I and read it at my leisure and when i have so do return it to he with my judgement thereupon when i come home -lrb- _ ie the grange from which isaac pbnington with he family -lrb- include thoma ellwood -rrb- be _ by military force _ expel about a month after they first return from aylesbury gaol -lrb- ie about the middle of September -rrb- and he again send to the same prison _ -rrb- and have set myself to read it i find it be that excellent poem which he entitle _ paradise lose _ after i have with the best attention read it through : i make he another visit and return he he book with due acknowledgment of the favor he have do I in communicate it to I he ask I how i like it and what i thought of it which i modestly but freely tell he and after some further discourse about it i pleasantly say to he thou hast say much here of _ paradise lose _ : but what hast thou to say of _ paradise find _ he make I no answer but sate some time in a muse : then brake off that discourse and fall upon another subject after the sickness -lrb- _ plague _ -rrb- be over and the city well cleansed and become safely habitable again : he return thither and when afterwards -lrb- _ probably in 1668 or 1669 _ -rrb- i go to wait on he there -lrb- which i seldom fail of do whenever my occasion draw I to london -rrb- he show I he second poem call _ paradise regain _ : and in a pleasant tone say to I this be owe to you for you put it into my head by the question you put to I at chalfont which before i have not think of -lrb- _ paradise regain _ be license for publication on 2nd July 1670 -rrb- advice to a young reviewer with a specimen of the art 1807 advice to a young reviewer & c you be now about to enter on a profession which have the means of do much good to society and scarcely any temptation to do harm you may encourage genius you may chastise superficial arrogance expose falsehood correct error and guide the taste and opinion of the age in no small degree by the book you praise and recommend and this too may be do without run the risk of make any enemy or subject yourself to be call to account for you criticism however severe while you name be unknown you person be invulnerable : at the same time you aim be sure for you may take it at you leisure and you blow fall heavier than those of any writer whose name be give or who be simply anonymous there be a mysterious authority in the plural _ we _ which no single name whatever may be its reputation can acquire and under the sanction of this impose style you stricture you praise and you dogma will command universal attention and be receive as the fruit of unite talent act on one common principle -- as the judgment of a tribunal who decide only on mature deliberation and who protect the interest of literature with unceasing vigilance such be the high importance of that office and such its opportunity i can not bestow a few hour of leisure better than in furnish you with some hint for the more easy and effectual discharge of it : hint which be i confess loosely throw together but which be the result of long experience and of frequent reflection and comparison and if anything should strike you at first sight as rather equivocal in point of morality or deficient in liberality and feeling i beg you will suppress all such scruple and consider they as the offspring of a contract education and narrow way of think which a little intercourse with the world and sober reasoning will speedily overcome now as in the conduct of life nothing be more to be desire than some govern principle of action to which all other principle and motive must be make subservient so in the art of review i would lay down as a fundamental position which you must never lose sight of and which must be the mainspring of all you criticism -- _ write what will sell _ to this golden rule every minor canon must be subordinate and must be either immediately deducible from it or at least be make consistent with it be not stagger at the sound of a precept which upon examination will be find as honest and virtuous as it be discreet i have already sketch out the great service which it be in you power to render mankind but all you effort will be unavailing if man do not read what you write you utility therefore it be plain depend upon you popularity and popularity can not be attain without humor the taste and inclination of man be assure that by a similar train of sound and judicious reasoning the conscience of thousand in public life be daily quiet it be better for the state that they party should govern than any other the good which they can effect by the exercise of power be infinitely greater than any which could arise from a rigid adherence to certain subordinate moral precept which therefore should be violate without scruple whenever they stand in the way of they lead purpose he who stick at these can never act a great part in the world and be not fit to act it if he could such maxim may be very useful in ordinary affair and for the guidance of ordinary man : but when we mount into the sphere of public utility we must adopt more enlarged principle and not suffer ourselves to be cramped and fetter by petty notion of right and moral duty when you have reconcile yourself to this liberal way of think you will find many inferior advantage result from it which at first do not enter into you consideration in particular it will greatly lighten you labor to _ follow _ the public taste instead of take upon you to _ direct _ it the task of pleasing be at all time easier than that of instruct : at least it do not stand in need of painful research and preparation and may be effect in general by a little vivacity of manner and a dexterous morigeration -lrb- _ compliance or obsequiousness _ -rrb- as lord bacon call it to the humor and frailty of man you responsibility too be thereby much lessen justice and candor can only be require of you so far as they coincide with this main principle : and a little experience will convince you that these be not the happiest means of accomplish you purpose it have be idly say that a reviewer act in a judicial capacity and that he conduct should be regulate by the same rule by which the judge of a civil court be govern : that he should rid himself of every bias be patient cautious sedate and rigidly impartial that he should not seek to shew off himself and should check every disposition to enter into the case as a partizan such be the language of superficial thinker but in reality there be no analogy between the two case a judge be promote to that office by the authority of the state a reviewer by he own the former be independent of control and may therefore freely follow the dictate of he own conscience : the latter depend for he very bread upon the breath of public opinion the great law of self-preservation therefore point out to he a different line of action besides as we have already observe if he cease to please he be no longer read and consequently be no longer useful in a court of justice too the part of amusing the bystander rest with the counsel : in the case of criticism if the reviewer himself do not undertake it who will instead of vainly aspire to the gravity of a magistrate i would advise he when he sit down to write to place himself in the imaginary situation of a cross-examining pleader he may comment in a vein of agreeable irony upon the profession the manner of life the look dress or even the name of the witness he be examine : when he have raise a contemptuous opinion of he in the mind of the court he may proceed to draw answer from he capable of a ludicrous turn and he may carve and garble these to he own liking this mode of proceed you will find most practicable in poetry where the boldness of the image or the delicacy of thought -lrb- for which the reader 's mind be prepare in the original -rrb- will easily be make to appear extravagant or affect if judiciously single out and detach from the group to which it belong again since much depend upon the rhythm and the terseness of expression -lrb- both of which be sometimes destroy by drop a single word or transpose a phrase -rrb- i have know much advantage arise from _ not _ quote in the form of a literal extract : but give a brief summary in prose of the contents of a poetical passage and interlard you own language with occasional phrase of the poem mark with inverted comma these and a thousand other little expedient by which the art of quiz and banter flourish practice will soon teach you if it should be necessary to transcribe a dull passage not very fertile in topic of humor and raillery you may introduce it as a favourable specimen of the author 's manner few people be aware of the powerful effect of what be philosophically term association without any positive violation of truth the whole dignity of a passage may be undermine by contrive to raise some vulgar and ridiculous notion in the mind of the reader : and language teem with example of word by which the same idea be express with the difference only that one excite a feeling of respect the other of contempt thus you may call a fit of melancholy the sulk resentment a pet a steed a nag a feast a junketing sorrow and affliction whining and blubber by transfer the term peculiar to one state of society to analogous situation and character in another the same object be attain a drill serjeant or a cat and nine tail in the trojan war a lesbo smack put into the piraeus the penny post of jerusalem and other combination of the like nature which when you have a little indulged in that vein of thought will readily suggest themselves never fail to raise a smile if not immediately at the expense of the author yet entirely destructive of that frame of mind which he poem require in order to be relish i have dwell the longer on this branch of literature because you be chiefly to look here for material of fun and irony voyage and travels indeed be no barren ground and you must seldom let a number of you _ review _ go abroad without a article of this description the charm of this species of write so universally feel arise chiefly from its unite narrative with information the interest we take in the story can only be keep alive by minute incident and occasional detail which put we in possession of the traveller 's feeling he hope he fear he disappointment and he pleasure at the same time the thirst for knowledge and love of novelty be gratify by continual information respect the people and country he visit if you wish therefore to run down the book you have only to play off these two part against each other when the writer 's object be to satisfy the first inclination you be to thank he for communicate to the world such valuable fact as whether he lose he way in the night or sprain he ankle or have no appetite for he dinner if he be busy about describe the mineralogy natural history agriculture trade etc of a country : you may mention a hundred book from whence the same information may be obtain and deprecate the practice of empty old musty folio into new quarto to gratify that sickly taste for a smattering about everything which distinguish the present age in work of science and recondite learn the task you have undertake will not be so difficult as you may imagine table of contents and index be bless help in the hand of a reviewer but more than all the preface be the field from which he richest harvest be to be gather in the preface the author usually give a summary of what have be write on the same subject before he acknowledge the assistance he have receive from different source and the reason of he dissent from former writer he confess that certain part have be less attentively consider than other and that information have come to he hand too late to be make use of he point out many thing in the composition of he work which he think may provoke animadversion and endeavor to defend or palliate he own practice here then be a fund of wealth for the reviewer lie upon the very surface if he know anything of he business he will turn all these material against the author : carefully suppress the source of he information and as if draw from the store of he own mind long ago lay up for this very purpose if the author 's reference be correct a great point be gain for by consult a few passage of the original work it will be easy to discuss the subject with the air of have a previous knowledge of the whole you chief vantage ground be that you may fasten upon any position in the book you be review and treat it as principal and essential when perhaps it be of little weight in the main argument : but by allot a large share of you criticism to it the reader will naturally be lead to give it a proportionate importance and to consider the merit of the treatise at issue upon that single question if anybody complain that the greater and more valuable part remain unnoticed you answer be that it be impossible to pay attention to all and that you duty be rather to prevent the propagation of error than to lavish praise upon that which if really excellent will work its way in the world without you help indeed if the plan of you _ review _ admit of selection you have better not meddle with work of deep research and original speculation such as have already attract much notice and can not be treat superficially without fear of be find out the time require for make yourself thoroughly master of the subject be so great that you may depend upon it they will never pay for the review they be generally the fruit of long study and of talent concentrate in the steady pursuit of one object : it be not likely therefore that you can throw much new light on a question of this nature or even plausibly combat the author 's proposition in the course of a few hour which be all you can well afford to devote to they and without accomplish one or the other of these point you _ review _ will gain no celebrity and of course no good will be do enough have be say to give you some insight into the facility with which you new employment abound i will only mention one more because of its extensive and almost universal application to all branch of literature the topic i mean which by the old rhetorician be call -lrb- greek : _ ex enantion _ -rrb- that be when a work excel in one quality you may blame it for not have the opposite for instance if the biographical sketch of a literary character be minute and full of anecdote you may enlarge on the advantage of philosophical reflection and the superior mind require to give a judicious analysis of the opinion and work of deceased author on the contrary if the latter method be pursue by the biographer you can with equal ease extol the lively coloring and truth and interest of exact delineation and detail this topic you will perceive enter into style as well as matter where many virtue might be name _ which be incompatible _ : and whichever the author have prefer it will be the signal for you to launch forth on the praise of its opposite and continually to hold up that to you reader as the model of excellence in this species of write you will perhaps wonder why all my instruction be pointed towards the censure and not the praise of book but many reason might be give why it should be so the chief be that this part be both easier and will sell better let we hear the word of mr burke on a subject not very dissimilar : in such case say he the writer have a certain fire and alacrity inspire into he by a consciousness that -lrb- let it fare how it will with the subject -rrb- he ingenuity will be sure of applause : and this alacrity become much greater if he act upon the offensive by the impetuosity that always accompany a attack and the unfortunate propensity which mankind have to finding and exaggerate fault pref _ vindic nat soc _ p 6 you will perceive that i have on no occasion sanction the baser motive of private pique envy revenge and love of detraction at least i have not recommend harsh treatment upon any of these grounds i have argue simply on the abstract moral principle which a reviewer should ever have present to he mind : but if any of these motive insinuate themselves as secondary spring of action i would not condemn they they may come in aid of the grand lead principle and powerfully second its operation but it be time to close these tedious precept and to furnish you with what speak plainer than any precept a specimen of the art itself in which several of they be embody it be hastily do : but it exemplify well enough what i have say of the poetical department and exhibit most of those quality which disappoint author be fond of railing at under the name of flippancy arrogance conceit misrepresentation and malevolence : reproach which you will only regard as so many acknowledgment of success in you undertaking and infallible test of a established fame and -lrb- a -rrb- rapidly increase circulation _ l'allegro _ a poem by john milton no printer 's name it have become a practice of late with a certain description of people who have no visible means of subsistence to string together a few trite image of rural scenery intersperse with vulgarism in dialect and trait of vulgar manners to dress up these material in a sing-song jingle and to offer they for sale as a poem accord to the most approved recipe something about the heathen god and goddess and the schoolboy topic of styx and cerberus and elysium be occasionally throw in and the composition be complete the stock in trade of these adventurer be in general scanty enough and they art therefore consist in dispose it to the best advantage but if such be the aim of the writer it be the critic 's business to detect and defeat the imposture to warn the public against the purchase of shop-worn goods and tinsel wares to protect the fair trader by expose the trick of needy quack and mountebank and to chastise that forward and noisy importunity with which they present themselves to the public notice how far mr milton be amenable to this discipline will best appear from a brief analysis of the poem before we in the very open he assume a tone of authority which might better suit some veteran bard than a raw candidate for the delphic bay : for before he proceed to the regular process of invocation he clear the way by drive from he presence -lrb- with sundry hard name and bitter reproach on she father mother and all the family -rrb- a venerable personage whose age at least and staid matron-like appearance might have entitle she to more civil language hence loathd melancholy of cerberus and blackest midnight bear in stygian cave forlorn & c there be no give rule however in these matter without a knowledge of the case perhaps the old lady have be frequently warn off before and provoke this violence by continue still to lurk about the poet 's dwelling and to say the truth the reader will have but too good reason to remark before he get through the poem that it be one thing to tell the spirit of dulness to depart and another to get rid of she in reality like glendower 's spirit any one may order they away but will they go when you do order they but let we suppose for a moment that the parnassian decree be obey and accord to the letter of the _ order _ -lrb- which be as precise and wordy as if justice shallow himself have draw it -rrb- that the obnoxious female be send back to the place of she birth ` mongst horrid shape shriek sight & c at which we beg we fair reader not to be alarm for we can assure they they be only word of course in all poetical instrument of this nature and mean no more than the force and arm and instigation of the devil in a common indictment this nuisance then be abate we be leave at liberty to contemplate a character of a different complexion buxom blithe and debonair : one who although evidently a great favorite of the poet 's and therefore to be receive with all due courtesy be notwithstanding introduce under the suspicious description of a _ alia _ in heaven clepe euphrosyne and by man heart-easing mirth judge indeed from the light and easy deportment of this gay nymph one might guess there be good reason for a change of name as she change she residence but of all vice there be none we abhor more than that of slanderous insinuation we shall therefore confine we moral stricture to the nymph 's mother in whose defense the poet have little to say himself here too as in the case of the _ name _ there be some doubt for the uncertainty of descent on the father 's side have become trite to a proverb the author scorn that beat track have leave we to choose between two mother for he favorite and without much to guide we choice for whichever we fix upon it be plain she be no better than she should be as he seem however himself inclined to the latter of the two we will even suppose it so to be or whether -lrb- as some sager say -rrb- the frolic _ wind that breathe the spring _ zephyr with aurora playing _ as he meet she once a maying _ there on bed of violet blue and fresh-blown rose wash in dew _ & c _ some dull people might imagine that _ the wind _ be more like _ the breath of spring _ than _ spring the breath of the wind _ : but we be more disposed to question the author 's ethic than he physics and accordingly can not dismiss these may gambol without some observation in the first place mr m seem to have higher notion of the antiquity of the may pole than we have be accustom to attach to it or perhaps he seek to shelter the equivocal nature of this affair under that sanction to we however who can hardly subscribe to the doctrine that vice lose half its evil by lose all its grossness neither the remoteness of time nor the gaiety of the season furnish a sufficient palliation violet blue and fresh-blown rose be to be sure more agreeable object of the imagination than a gin shop in wapping or a booth in bartholomew fair but in point of morality these be distinction without a difference : or it may be the cultivation of mind -lrb- which teach we to reject and nauseate these latter object -rrb- aggravate the case if we improvement in taste be not accompany by a proportionate improvement of moral if the reader can reconcile himself to this latitude of principle the anachronism will not long stand in he way much indeed may be say in favor of this union of ancient mythology with modern notion and manners it be a sort of chronological metaphor -- a artificial analogy by which idea widely remote and heterogeneous be bring into contact and the mind be delighted by this unexpected assemblage as it be by the combination of figurative language thus in that elegant interlude which the pen of ben jonson have transmit to we of the love of hero and leander : gentle that no longer you expectation may wander behold we chief actor amorous leander with a great deal of cloth lapped about he like a scarf : for he yet serve he father a dyer in puddle wharf : which place we 'll make bold with to call it we abydus as the bankside be we sesto and _ let it not be deny we _ and far be it from we to deny the use of so reasonable a liberty especially if the request be back -lrb- as it be in the case of mr m -rrb- by the craving and imperious necessity of rhyme what man who have ever bestrode pegasus for a hour will be insensible to such a claim _ haud ignara malus miseri succurrere disco _ we be next favor with a enumeration of the attendant of this debonair nymph in all the minuteness of a german _ dramati persona _ or a ropedancer 's handbill haste thee nymph and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity quip and crank and wanton wiles nod and beck and wreathd smile such as hang on hebe 's cheek and love to live in dimple sleek sport that wrinkle care deride and laughter holding both he side the author to prove himself worthy of be admit of the crew skip and caper about upon the light fantastic toe that there be no follow he he scamper through all the category in search of he imaginary being from substance to quality and back again from thence to action passion habit & c with incredible celerity who for instance would have expect _ crank nod beck _ and _ wreathd smile _ as part of a group in which jest jollity sport and laughter figure away as full-formed entire personage the family likeness be certainly very strong in the two last and if we have not be tell we should perhaps have think the act of _ deride _ as appropriate to laughter as to sport but how be we to understand the stage direction _ come _ and trip it as you _ go _ be the word use synonymously or be it mean that this airy gentry shall come in a minuet step and go off in a jig the phenomenon of a _ trip crank _ be indeed novel and would doubtless attract numerous spectator but it be difficult to guess to whom among this jolly company the poet address himself : for immediately after the plural appellative _ you _ he proceed and in _ thy _ right hand lead with _ thee _ the mountain nymph sweet liberty no sooner be this fair damsel introduce but mr m with most unbecoming levity fall in love with she : and make a request of she companion which be rather greedy that he may live with both of they to live with she and live with thee even the gay libertine who sing how happy could i be with either do not go so far as this but we have already have occasion to remark on the laxity of mr m 's amatory notion the poet intoxicate with the charm of he mistress now rapidly run over the pleasure which he propose to himself in the enjoyment of she society but though he have the advantage of be he own caterer either he palate be of a peculiar structure or he have not make the most judicious selection to begin the day well he will have the _ sky-lark _ to come _ in spite of sorrow _ and at he window bid good morrow the sky-lark if we know anything of the nature of that bird must come in spite of something else as well as of sorrow to the performance of this office in the next image the natural history be better preserved and as the thought be appropriate to the time of day we will venture to transcribe the passage as a favourable specimen of the author 's manner : while the cock with lively din scatter the rear of darkness thin and to the stack or the barn door stoutly strut he dame before oft listen how the hound and horn cheerly rouse the slumbering morn from the side of some hoar hill through the high wood echo still be it not lamentable that after all whether it be the cock or the poet that listen should be leave entirely to the reader 's conjecture perhaps also he embarrassment may be increase by a slight resemblance of character in these two illustrious personage at least as far as relate to the extent and number of they seraglio after a _ flame _ description of sunrise on which the cloud attend in they very best livery the bill of fare for the day proceed in the usual manner whistle ploughman singing milkmaid and sentimental shepherd be always to be have at a moment 's notice and if well group serve to fill up the landscape agreeably enough on this part of the poem we have only to remark that if mr john milton proposeth to make himself merry with russet lawn and fallow gray where the nibble flock _ do _ stray mountain on whose barren breast the labor cloud _ do _ often rest meadow trim with daisy pie shallow brook and river wide tower and battlements & c & c & c he will either find himself egregiously disappointed or he must possess a disposition to merriment which even democritus himself might envy to such a pitch indeed do this solemn indication of joy sometimes rise that we be incline to give he credit for a literal adherence to the apostolic precept be any merry let he sing psalm at length however he hie away at the sound of bell-ringing and seem for some time to enjoy the tippling and fiddling and dancing of a village wake : but he fancy be soon haunt again by spectre and goblin a set of being not in general esteem the companion or inspirer of mirth with story tell of many a feat how fairy mab the junket eat she be pinch and pull she say : and he by friar 's lanthern lead tell how the drudging goblin sweat to earn he cream-bowl duly set when in one night ere glimpse of morn he shadowy flail have thresh the corn that ten day-labourer could not end then lie he down the lubbar fiend and stretch out all the chimney 's length bask at the fire he hairy strength : and crop-full out of door he fling ere the first cock he matins ring mr m seem indeed to have a turn for this species of nursery tale and prattle lullaby and if he will studiously cultivate he talent he need not despair of figure in a conspicuous corner of mr newbery 's shop window : unless indeed mrs trimmer should think fit to proscribe those empty levity and idle superstition by which the world have be too long abuse from these rustic fiction we be transport to another species of _ hum _ tower city please we then and the busy hum of man where throng of knight and baron bold in weed of peace high triumph hold : with _ store of lady _ whose bright eye _ rain influence _ and judge the prize of wit or arm while both contend to win she grace whom all commend to talk of the bright eye of lady judge the prize of wit be indeed with the poet a legitimate species of hum : but would not we may ask the _ rain _ from these lady ' bright eye rather tend to dim they lustre or be there any quality in a shower of _ influence _ which instead of deadening serve only to brighten and exhilarate whatever the case may be we would advise mr m by all means to keep out of the way of these knight and baron bold : for if he have nothing but he wit to trust to we will venture to predict that without a large share of most undue influence he must be content to see the prize adjudge to he competitor of the latter part of the poem little need be say the author do seem somewhat more at home when he get among the actor and musician : though he head be still run upon orpheus and eurydice and pluto and other sombre personage who be ever thrust themselves in where we least expect they and who chill every rise emotion of mirth and gaiety he appear however to be so ravish with this sketch of festive pleasure or perhaps with himself for have sketch they so well that he close with a couplet which would not have disgrace a sternhold these delight if thou canst give mirth with thee i _ mean _ to live of mr m 's good _ intention _ there can be no doubt but we beg leave to remind he that there be two opinion to be consult he presume perhaps upon the poetical power he have display and consider they as irresistible : for every one must observe in how different a strain he avow he attachment now and at the opening of the poem then it be if i give thee honor due mirth admit I of thy crew but have it should seem established he pretension he now think it sufficient to give notice that he mean to live with she because he like she upon the whole mr milton seem to be possess of some fancy and talent for rhyme two most dangerous endowment which often unfit man for act a useful part in life without qualify they for that which be great and brilliant if it be true as we have hear that he have decline advantageous prospects in business for the sake of indulge he poetical humor we hope it be not yet too late to prevail upon he to retract he resolution with the help of cocker and common industry he may become a respectable scrivener : but it be not all the zephyr and aurora and corydon and thyrsis 's aye nor he junketing queen mab and drudging goblin that will ever make he a poet prediction for the year 1708 wherein the month and day of the month be set down the person name and the great action and event of next year particularly related as they will come to pass _ write to prevent the people of england from be further impose on by vulgar _ almanack _ maker _ by isaac bickerstaff esq mdccviii prediction for the year 1708 & c i have long consider the gross abuse of astrology in this kingdom and upon debate the matter with myself i could not possibly lay the fault upon the art but upon those gross impostor who set up to be the artist i know several learn man have contend that the whole be a cheat that it be absurd and ridiculous to imagine the star can have any influence at all on human action thought or inclination : and whoever have not bent he study that way may be excuse for think so when he see in how wretched a manner this noble art be treat by a few mean illiterate trader between we and the star who import a yearly stock of nonsense lie folly and impertinence which they offer to the world as genuine from the planet although they descend from no greater height than they own brain i intend in a short time to publish a large and rational defense of this art and therefore shall say no more in its justification at present than that it have be in all age defend by many learn man and among the rest by socrate himself whom i look upon as undoubtedly the wisest of uninspired mortal to which if we add that those who have condemn this art although otherwise learn have be such as either do not apply they study this way or at least do not succeed in they application they testimony will not be of much weight to its disadvantage since they be liable to the common objection of condemn what they do not understand nor be i at all offended or think it a injury to the art when i see the common dealer in it the _ student in astronomy _ the _ philomath _ and the rest of that tribe treat by wise man with the utmost scorn and contempt : but i rather wonder when i observe gentleman in the country rich enough to serve the nation in parliament pore in partridge 's _ almanack _ to find out the event of the year at home and abroad not daring to propose a hunting match unless gadbury or he have fix the weather i will allow either of the two i have mention or any other of the fraternity to be not only astrologer but conjurer too if i do not produce a hundred instance in all they _ almanack _ to convince any reasonable man that they do not so much as understand grammar and syntax that they be not able to spell any word out of the usual road nor even in they _ preface _ to write common sense or intelligible english then as they observation or prediction they be such as will suit any age or country in the world _ this month a certain great person will be threaten with death or sickness _ this the news paper will tell they for there we find at the end of the year that no month passeth without the death of some person of note : and it would be hard if it should be otherwise where there be at least two thousand person of note in this kingdom many of they old and the _ almanack _ maker have the liberty of choose the sickliest season of the year where he may fix he prediction again _ this month a eminent clergyman will be prefer _ of which there may be some hundred half of they with one foot in the grave then _ such a planet in such a house shew great machination plot and conspiracy that may in time be bring to light _ after which if we hear of any discovery the astrologer get the honor if not he prediction still stand good and at last _ god preserve king william from all he open and secret enemy amen _ when if the king should happen to have die the astrologer plainly foretell it otherwise it passeth but for the pious ejaculation of a loyal subject : although it unluckily happen in some of they _ almanack _ that poor king william be pray for many month after he be dead because it fall out that he die about the beginning of the year to mention no more of they impertinent prediction what have we to do with they advertisement about pill or they mutual quarrel in verse and prose of whig and tory wherewith the star have little to do have long observe and lament these and a hundred other abuse of this art too tedious to repeat i resolve to proceed in a new way which i doubt not will be to the general satisfaction of the kingdom i can this year produce but a specimen of what i design for the future : have employ the most part of my time in adjust and correct the calculation i make for some year past because i would offer nothing to the world of which i be not as fully satisfy as that i be now alive for these last two year i have not fail in above one or two particulars and those of no very great moment i exactly foretell the miscarriage at toulon -lrb- _ fruitlessly besiege by prince eugene between 26th July and 21st August _ 1707 -rrb- with all its particulars : and the loss of admiral -lrb- sir cloudesly -rrb- shovel -lrb- _ at the scilly isle on 22nd October _ 1707 -rrb- although i be mistake as to the day place that accident about thirty-six hour sooner than it happen but upon review my scheme i quickly find the cause of that error i likewise foretell the battle of almanza -lrb- _ 25th April _ 1707 -rrb- to the very day and hour with the loss on both side and the consequence thereof all which i shewed to some friend many month before they happen : that be i give they papers seal up to open in such a time after which they be at liberty to read they and there they find my prediction true in every article except one or two very minute as for the few follow prediction i now offer the world i forbore to publish they until i have peruse the several _ almanack _ for the year we be now enter upon i find they all in the usual strain and i beg the reader will compare they manner with mine and here i make bold to tell the world that i lay the whole credit of my art upon the truth of these prediction and i will be content that partridge and the rest of he clan may hoot I for a cheat and impostor if i fail in any single particular of moment i believe any man who read this paper -lrb- _ pamphlet _ -rrb- will look upon I to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as the common maker of _ almanack _ i do not lurk in the dark i be not wholly unknown to the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive they in one thing i must desire to be forgive : that i talk more sparingly of home affair as it would be imprudence to discover secret of state so it would be dangerous to my person : but in smaller matter and that as be not of public consequence i shall be very free : and the truth of my conjecture will as much appear from these as the other as for the most signal event abroad in france flander italy and spain : i shall make no scruple to predict they in plain term some of they be of importance and i hope i shall seldom mistake the day they will happen therefore i think good to inform the reader that i all along make use of the old style observe in england which i desire he will compare with that of the news papers at the time they relate the action i mention i must add one word more i know it have be the opinion of several learn -lrb- person -rrb- who think well enough of the true art of astrology that the star do only _ incline _ and not _ force _ the action or will of man : and therefore however i may proceed by right rule yet i can not in prudence so confidently assure that the event will follow exactly as i predict they i hope i have maturely consider this objection which in some case be of no little weight for example a man may by the influence of a overrule planet be dispose or incline to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that evil influence and this be the case of socrate but the great event of the world usually depend upon number of man it can not be expect they should _ all _ unite to cross they inclination from pursue a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the star reacheth to many action and event which be not in any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accident with many more needless to repeat but now it be time to proceed to my prediction : which i have begin to calculate from the time that the sun entereth into _ aries -lrb- April -rrb- _ and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue they to the time that he entereth _ libra -lrb- September -rrb- _ or somewhat more which be the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjust upon account of several impediment needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this be but a specimen of what i design in succeed year to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement my first prediction be but a trifle yet i will mention it to shew how ignorant those sottish pretender to astrology be in they own concern it relateth to partridge the _ almanack _ maker i have consult the star of he nativity by my own rule and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th of march -lrb- 1708 -rrb- next about eleven at night of a rage fever therefore i advise he to consider of it and settle he affair in time the month of April will be observable for the death of many great person on the 4th will die the cardinal de noailles archbishop of pari on the 11th the young prince of the asturias son to the duke of anjou on the 14th a great peer of this realm will die at he country house on the 19th a old layman of great fame and learning and on the 23rd a eminent goldsmith in lombard street i could mention other both at home and abroad if i do not consider it be of very little use or instruction to the reader or to the world as to public affair on the 7th of this month there will be a insurrection in dauphiny occasion by the oppression of the people which will not be quiet in some month on the 15th there will be a violent storm on the southeast coast of france which will destroy many of they ship and some in the very harbor the 19th will be famous for the revolt of a whole province or kingdom except one city : by which the affair of a certain prince in the alliance will take a better face may against common conjecture will be no very busy month in europe but very signal for the death of the dauphin -lrb- _ note how swift be kill off all the great man on the french side one after another : become that would jump with the inclination of the nation just at the moment _ -rrb- which will happen on the 7th after a short fit of sickness and grievous torment with the stranguary he die less lament by the court than the kingdom on the 9th a marshal of france will break he leg by a fall from he horse i have not be able to discover whether he will then die or not on the 11th will begin a most important siege which the eye of all europe will be upon i can not be more particular for in relate affair that so nearly concern the confederate and consequently this kingdom i be force to confine myself for several reason very obvious to the reader on the 15th news will arrive of a _ very surprising _ event than which nothing could be more unexpected on the 19th three noble lady of this kingdom will against all expectation prove with child to the great joy of they husband on the 23rd a famous buffoon of the play house will die a ridiculous death suitable to he vocation June this month will be distinguish at home by the utter disperse of those ridiculous deluded enthusiast commonly call prophet -lrb- _ scotch and english jesuit affect inspiration under the name of the french prophet _ -rrb- occasion chiefly by see the time come when many of they prophecy be to be fulfil and then find themselves deceive by the contrary event it be indeed to be admire -lrb- _ astonish at _ -rrb- how any deceiver can be so weak to foretell thing near at hand when a very few month must of necessity discover the imposture to all the world : in this point less prudent than common _ almanack _ maker who be so wise -lrb- as -rrb- to wander in general talk dubiously and leave to the reader the business of interpret on the 1st of this month a french general will be kill by a random shot of a cannon ball on the 6th a fire will break out in all the suburb of pari which will destroy above a thousand house and seem to be the foreboding of what will happen to the surprise of all europe about the end of the follow month on the 10th a great battle will be fight which will begin at four of the clock in the afternoon and last until nine at night with great obstinacy but no very decisive event i shall not name the place for the reason aforesaid but the commander of each left wing will be kill i see bonfire and hear the noise of gun for a victory on the 14th there will be a false report of the french king 's death on the 20th cardinal portocarrero will die of a dysentery with great suspicion of poison : but the report of he intention to revolt to king charle will prove false July the 6th of this month a certain general will by a glorious action recover the reputation he lose by former misfortune on the 12th a great commander will die a prisoner in the hand of he enemy on the 14th a shameful discovery will be make of a french jesuit give poison to a great foreign general and when he be put to the torture -lrb- he -rrb- will make wonderful discovery in short this will prove a month of great action if i might have liberty to relate the particulars at home the death of a old famous senator will happen on the 15th at he country house worn -lrb- out -rrb- with age and disease but that which will make this month memorable to all posterity be the death of the french king lewi xiv after a week 's sickness at marlus which will happen on the 29th about six o'clock in the evening it seemeth to be a effect of the gout in he stomach follow by a flux and in three day after monsieur chamillard will follow he master die suddenly of a apoplexy in this month likewise a ambassador will die in london but i can not assign the day August the affair of france will seem to suffer no change for a while under the duke of burgundy 's administration but the genius that animated the whole machine be go will be the cause of mighty turn and revolution in the following year the new king maketh yet little change either in the army or the ministry but the libel against he -lrb- grand -rrb- father that fly about he very court give he uneasiness i see a express in mighty haste with joy and wonder in he look arrive by the break of day on the 26th of this month have travel in three day a prodigious journey by land and sea in the evening i hear bell and gun and see the blaze of a thousand bonfire a young admiral of noble birth doth likewise this month gain immortal honor by a great achievement the affair of poland be this month entirely settle augustus resign he pretension which he have again take up for some time stanislaus be peaceably possess of the throne : and the king of sweden declare for the emperor i can not omit one particular accident here at home : that near the end of this month much mischief will be do at bartholomew fair -lrb- _ hold on August 24th _ -rrb- by the fall of a booth September this month begin with a very surprising fit of frosty weather which will last near -lrb- ly -rrb- twelve day the pope have long languish last month the swelling in he leg break and the flesh mortifying he will die on the 11th instant and in three week ' time after a mighty contest he will be succeed by a cardinal of the imperial faction but a native of tuscany who be now about 61 year old the french army act now wholly on the defensive strongly fortify in they trench : and the young french king sendeth overture for a treaty of peace by the duke of mantua which because it be a matter of state that concerneth we here at home i shall speak no further of i shall add but one prediction more and that in mystical term which shall be include in a verse out of virgil _ alter erit jam tethy et altera quae vehat argo dilectos heroas _ upon the 25th day of this month the fulfil of this prediction will be manifest to everybody this be the furthest i have proceed in my calculation for the present year i do not pretend that these be all the great event which will happen in this period but that those i have set down will infallibly come to pass it may perhaps still be object why i have not speak more particularly of affair at home or of the success of we army abroad which i might and could very largely have do but those in power have wisely discourage man from meddle in public concern : and i be resolve by no means to give the least offence this i _ will _ venture to say that it will be a glorious campaign for the ally wherein the english force both by sea and land will have they full share of honor that she majesty queen anne will continue in health and prosperity and that no ill accident will arrive to any in the chief ministry as to the particular event i have mention the reader may judge by the fulfil of they whether i be of the level with common astrologer who with a old paltry cant and a few pothook for planet to amuse the vulgar have in my opinion too long be suffer to abuse the world but a honest physician ought not to be despise because there be such thing as mountebank i hope i have some share of reputation which i would not willingly forfeit for a frolic or humor : and i believe no gentleman who read this paper will look upon it to be of the same last and mould with the common scribble that be every day hawk about my fortune have place I above the little regard of write for a few penny which i neither value nor want therefore let not any wise man too hastily condemn this essay intend for a good design to cultivate and improve a ancient art long in disgrace by have fall into mean unskilful hand a little time will determine whether i have deceive other or myself : and i think it be no very unreasonable request that man would please to suspend they judgement till then i be once of the opinion with those who despise all prediction from the star till in the year 1686 a man of quality shew I write in he album that the most learn astronomer captain h -lrb- alley -rrb- assure he he would never believe anything of the star ' influence if there be not a great revolution in england in the year 1688 since that time i begin to have other thought -lrb- swift _ do not say on what subject _ -rrb- and after eighteen year ' -lrb- 1690-1708 -rrb- diligent study and application -lrb- _ in what _ -rrb- i think i have no reason to repent of my pain i shall detain the reader no longer than to let he know that the account i design to give of next year 's event shall take in the principal affair that happen in europe and if i be deny the liberty of offer it to my own country i shall appeal to the learn world by publish it in latin and give order to have it print in holland fini a revenue officer -lrb- _ jonathan swift _ -rrb- _ a letter to a lord _ -lrb- 30 march 1708 -rrb- my lord in obedience to you lordship 's command as well as to satisfy my own curiosity i have for some day past inquire constantly after partridge the _ almanack _ maker : of whom it be foretell in mr bickerstaff 's _ prediction _ publish about a month ago that he should die the 29th instant about eleven at night of a rage fever i have some sort of knowledge of he when i be employ in the revenue because he use every year to present I with he _ almanack _ as he do other gentleman upon the score of some little gratuity we give he i see he accidentally once or twice about ten day before he die : and observe he begin very much to droop and languish although i hear he friend do not seem to apprehend he in any danger about two or three day ago he grow ill be confine first to he chamber and in a few hour after to he bed : where dr case and mr kirleus -lrb- _ two london quack _ -rrb- be send for to visit and to prescribe to he upon this intelligence i send thrice every day a servant or other to inquire after he health : and yesterday about four in the afternoon word be bring I that he be past hope upon which i prevail with myself to go and see he : partly out of commiseration : and i confess partly out of curiosity he know I very well seem surprise at my condescension and make I compliment upon it as well as he could in the condition he be the people about he say he have be delirious : but when i see he he have he understanding as well as ever i know and speak strong and hearty without any seeming uneasiness or constraint after i have tell he i be sorry to see he in those melancholy circumstance and say some other civility suitable to the occasion i desire he to tell I freely and ingenuously whether the _ prediction _ mr bickerstaff have publish relate to he death have not too much affect and work on he imagination he confess he often have it in he head but never with much apprehension till about a fortnight before : since which time it have the perpetual possession of he mind and thought and he do verily believe be the true natural cause of he present distemper for say he i be thoroughly persuade and i think i have very good reason that mr bickerstaff speak altogether by guess and know no more what will happen this year than i do myself i tell he he discourse surprise I and i would be glad he be in a state of health to be able to tell I what reason he have to be convince of mr bickerstaff 's ignorance he reply i be a poor ignorant fellow breed to a mean trade yet i have sense enough to know that all pretence of foretell by astrology be deceit : for this manifest reason because the wise and learn -lrb- who can only judge whether there be any truth in this science -rrb- do all unanimously agree to laugh at and despise it and none but the poor ignorant vulgar give it any credit and that only upon the word of such silly wretch as i and my fellow who can hardly write or read i then ask he why he have not calculate he own nativity to see whether it agree with bickerstaff 's prediction at which he shake he head and say o sir this be no time for jest but for repent those foolery as i do now from the very bottom of my heart by what i can gather from you say i the observation and prediction you print with you _ almanack _ be mere imposition upon the people he reply if it be otherwise i should have the less to answer for we have a common form for all those thing as to foretell the weather we never meddle with that but leave it to the printer who taketh it out of any old _ almanack _ as he thinketh fit the rest be my own invention to make my _ almanack _ sell have a wife to maintain and no other way to get my bread : for mend old shoe be a poor livelihood and add he sigh i wish i may not have do more mischief by my physic than by astrology although i have some good receipt from my grandmother and my own composition be such as i think could at least do no hurt i have some other discourse with he which now i can not call to mind : and i fear i have already tired you lordship i shall only add one circumstance that on he deathb he declare himself a nonconformist and have a fanatic -lrb- _ the political designation of dissenter _ -rrb- preacher to be he spiritual guide after half a hour 's conversation i take my leave be almost stifle by the closeness of the room i imagine he could not hold out long and therefore withdraw to a little coffee-house hard by leave a servant at the house with order to come immediately and tell I as near as he could the minute when partrige should expire : which be not above two hour after when look upon my watch i find it to be above five minute after seven by which it be clear that mr bickerstaff be mistaken almost four hour in he calculation -lrb- _ see _ p 173 -rrb- in the other circumstance he be exact enough but whether he have not be the cause of this poor man 's death as well as the predictor may be very reasonably dispute however it must be confess the matter be odd enough whether we should endeavor to account for it by chance or the effect of imagination for my own part although i believe no man have less faith in these matter yet i shall wait with some impatience and not without expectation the fulfil of mr bickerstaff 's second prediction that the cardinal de noailles be to die upon the 4th of April -lrb- 1708 -rrb- and if that should be verify as exactly as this of poor partridge i must own i shall be wholly surprised and at a loss and infallibly expect the accomplishment of all the rest -lrb- in the original broadside there be death

and astrologer must make diversion for the vulgar why then farewell say i to all government ecclesiastical and civil but i thank my better star i be alive to confront this false and audacious predictor and to make he rue the hour he ever affront a man of science and resentment the cardinal may take what measure he please with he : as he excellency be a foreigner and a papist he have no reason to rely on I for he justification i shall only assure the world that he be alive but as he be breed to letter and be master of a pen let he use it in he own defense in the meantime i shall

this evening the poor girl provoke tell he he lie like a rascal the other very sedately reply the sexton have so informed he and if false he be to blame for impose on a stranger she ask a second and a third as they pass and every one be in the same tone now i do not say these be accomplice to a certain astrological squire and that one bickerstaff might be saunter thereabout because i will assert nothing here but what i dare attest and plain matter of fact my wife at this fall into a violent disorder and i must own i be a little discomposed at the oddness of the accident in the meantime one knock at the door betty runneth down and open find a sober grave person who modestly inquire if this be dr partridge 's she take he for some cautious city patient that come at that time for privacy shew he into the dining-room as soon as i could compose myself i go to he and be surprise to find my gentleman mount on a table with a two-foot rule in he hand measure my wall and take the dimension of the room pray sir say i not to interrupt you have you any business with I only sir reply he to order the girl to bring I a better light : for this be but a dim one sir sayeth i my name be partridge

the impudence to assert that these be entirely stranger to he he good man knoweth nothing of the matter and honest isaac bickerstaff i warrant you be more a man of honor than to be a accomplice with a pack of rascal that walk the street on night and disturb good people in they bed but he be out if he think the whole world be blind for there be one john partridge can smell a knave as far as grub street although he lie in the most exalted garret and writeth himself squire but i will keep my temper and proceed in the narration i could not stir out of door for the space of three month after this but presently one come up to I in the street : mr partridge that coffin you be last bury in i have not yet be pay for doctor cry another dog how do you think people can live by make grave for nothing

almost run distract with be call widow partridge when she know it be false : and once a term she be cite into the court to take out letter of administration but the greatest grievance be a paltry quack that take up my call just under my nose and in he print direction with a _ nb _ say : _ he live in the house of the late ingenious mr john partridge a eminent practitioner in leather physic and astrology _ but to shew how far the wicked spirit of envy malice and resentment can hurry some man my nameless old persecutor have provide a monument at the stone-cutter 's and would have it erect in the parish church : and this piece of notorious and expensive villany have actually succeed if i have not use my utmost interest with the vestry where it be carry at last but by two voice that i be alive that stratagem fail out cometh a long sable _ elegy _ bedeck with hour-glass mattock skull spade and skeleton with a _ epitaph _ -lrb- _ see _ p 486 -rrb- as confidently write to abuse I and my

when a man of science and character shall be openly insult in the midst of the many useful service he be daily pay the public be it ever hear even in turkey or algier that a state astrologer be banter out of he life by a ignorant impostor or bawl out of the world by a pack of villanous deep-mouthed hawker though i print _ almanack _ and publish _ advertisement _ although i produce certificate under

bear down attestation neglect the testimony of sober person despise : and a man be look upon by he neighbor as if he have be seven year dead and be bury alive in the midst of he friend and acquaintance now can any man of common sense think it consistent with the honor of my profession and not much beneath the dignity of a philosopher to stand bawl before he own door alive alive ho the famous doctor partridge no counterfeit but all alive as if i have the twelve celestial monster of the zodiac to shew within or be force for a livelihood to turn retailer to may and bartholomew fair

and falsehood in every assertion to the great detriment and scandal of astrology i shall further demonstrate to the judicious that france and rome be at the bottom of this horrid conspiracy against I and that the culprit aforesaid be a popish emissary have pay he visit to st germain and be now in the measure of lewi xiv that in attempt my reputation there be a general massacre of learn design in these realm and through my side there be a wound give to all the protestant _ almanack _ maker in the universe _ vivat regina not satisfy with this _ impartial account _ when next almanack time come -lrb- in the follow November 1708 -rrb- partridge 's _ almanack _ for 1709 -lrb- pp 2465\/8 -rrb- contain the following : you may remember that there be a paper publish predict my death upon the 29th

still alive and -lrb- except my age -rrb- as well as ever i be in my life : as i be also at that 29th of march and that paper be say to be do by one bickerstaff esq but that be a sham name it be do by a impudent lie fellow but he prediction do not prove true what will he say to that for the fool have consider the star of my nativity as he say why the truth be he will be hard put to it to find a _ salvo _ for he honor it be a bold touch and he do not know but it might prove true one hardly know whether to wonder most at the self-delusion or credulity of this last paragraph by the old quack this call forth from swift : a vindication of isaac bickerstaff esq & c mr partridge have be lately pleased to treat I after a very rough manner in that which be call he _ almanack _ for the present year such usage be very undecent from one gentleman to another and do not at all contribute to the discovery of truth which ought to be the great end in all dispute of the learn to call a man _ fool _ and _ villain _ and _ impudent fellow _ only for differ from he in a point merely speculative be in my humble opinion a very improper style for a person of he education i appeal to the learn world whether in my last year 's _ prediction _ i give he the least provocation for such unworthy treatment philosopher have differ in all age but the discreetest among they have always differ as become philosopher scurrility and passion in a controversy among scholar be just so much of nothing to the purpose and at best a tacit confession of a weak cause my concern be not so much for my own reputation as that of the republic of letter which mr partridge have endeavor to wind through my side if man of public spirit must be superciliously treat for they ingenious attempt how will true useful knowledge be ever advance i wish mr partridge know the thought which foreign university have conceive of he ungenerous proceeding with I : but i be too tender of he reputation to publish they to the world that spirit of envy and pride which blast so many rise genius in we nation be yet unknown among professor abroad the necessity of justify myself will excuse my vanity when i tell the reader that i have receive nearly a hundred honorary letter from several part of europe some as far as muscovey in praise of my performance : besides several other which -lrb- as i have be credibly inform -rrb- be open in the p -lrb- ost -rrb- office and never send I it be true the inquisition in p -lrb- ortuga -rrb- l be please to burn my _ prediction _ -lrb- _ a fact as sir paul methuen the english ambassador there inform swift _ -rrb- and condemn the author and the reader of they : but i hope at the same time it will be consider in how deplorable a state learn lieth at present in that kingdom and with the profoundest reverence for crown head i will presume to add that it a little concerned he majesty of portugal to interpose he authority in behalf of a scholar and a gentleman the subject of a nation with which he be now in so strict a alliance but the other kingdom and state of europe have treat I with more candor and generosity if i have leave to print the latin letter transmit to I from foreign part they would fill a volume and be a full defense against all that mr partridge or he accomplice of the p -lrb- ortuga -rrb- l inquisition will be ever able to object : who by the way be the only enemy my _ prediction _ have ever meet with at home or abroad but i hope i know better what be due to the honor of a learn correspondence in so tender a point yet some of those illustrious person will perhaps excuse I for transcribe a passage or two in my own vindication -lrb- 15 -rrb- the most learn monsieur leibnitz thus addresseth to I he third letter _ illustrissimo bickerstaffio astrologico instauratorus & c _ monsieur le clerc quote my _ prediction _ in a treatise he publish last year be pleased to say _ ita nuperrime bickerstaffius magnum illud anglia sidus _ another great professor writing of I have these word _ bickerstaffius nobili anglus astrologarum hujusce seculus facile princep _ signior magliabecchus the great duke 's famous library keeper spendeth almost he whole letter in compliment and praise it be true the renowned professor of astronomy at utrecht seemeth to differ from I in one article but it be after the modest manner that becometh a philosopher as _ pace tantus viri dixerim _ : and page 55 he seemeth to lay the error upon the printer as indeed it ought and sayeth _ vel forsan error typographus cum alioquin bickerstaffius vir doctissimus & c _ if mr partridge have follow these example in the controversy between we he might have spare I the trouble of justify myself in so public a manner i believe few man be readier to own they error than i or more thankful to those who will please to inform he of they but it seem this gentleman instead of encourage the progress of he own art be pleased to look upon all attempt of this kind as a invasion of he province he have be indeed so wise as to make no objection against the truth of my _ prediction _ except in one single point relate to himself and to demonstrate how much man be blind by they own partiality i do solemnly assure the reader that he be the _ only _ person from whom i ever hear that objection offer which consideration alone i think will take off its weight with my utmost endeavor i have not be able to trace above two objection ever make against the truth of my last year 's _ prophecy _ the first be of a frenchman who be please to publish to the world that _ the cardinal de noailles be still alive notwithstanding the pretended prophecy of monsieur biquerstaffe _ but how far a frenchman a papist and a enemy be to be believe in he own cause against a english protestant who be _ true to the government _ i shall leave to the candid and impartial reader the other objection be the unhappy occasion of this discourse and relateth to a article in my _ prediction _ which foretell the death of mr partridge to happen on march 29 1708 _ this _ he be pleased to contradict absolutely in the _ almanack _ he have publish for the present year and in that ungentlemanly manner -lrb- pardon the expression -rrb- as i have above related in that work he very roundly assert that _ he be not only now alive but be likewise alive upon that very 29th of march when i have foretell he should die _ this be the subject of the present controversy between we which i design to handle with all brevity perspicuity and calmness in this dispute i be sensible the eye not only of england but of all europe will be upon we : and the learn in every country will i doubt not take part on that side where they find most appearance of reason and truth without enter into criticism of chronology about the hour of he death i shall only prove that _ mr partridge be not alive _ and my first argument be thus above a thousand gentleman have buy he _ almanack _ for this year merely to find what he say against I : at every line they read they would lift up they eye and cry out between rage and laughter _ they be sure no man alive ever write such stuff as this _ neither do i ever hear that opinion dispute so that mr partridge lieth under a dilemma either of disown he _ almanack _ or allow himself to be _ no man alive _ death be define by all philosopher -lrb- as -rrb- a separation of the soul and body now it be certain that the poor woman -lrb- _ mr partridge _ -rrb- who have best reason to know have go about for some time to every alley in the neighborhood and swear to she gossip that _ she husband have neither life nor soul in he _ therefore if a _ uninformed _ carcass walk still about and be pleased to call itself partridge mr bickerstaff doth not think himself any way answerable for that neither have the say carcass any right to beat the poor boy who happen to pass by it in the street cry _ a full and true account of dr partridge 's death & c _ secondly mr partridge pretendeth to tell fortune and recover steal goods which all the parish say he must do by converse with the devil and other evil spirit : and no wise man will ever allow he could converse personally with either until after he be dead thirdly i will plainly prove he to be dead out of he own _ almanack _ for this year and from the very passage which he produceth to make we think he alive he there sayeth _ he be not only _ now _ alive but be also alive upon that very 29th of march which i foretold he should die on _ by this he declareth he opinion that a man may be alive _ now _ who be not alive a twelve month ago and indeed here lie the sophistry of he argument he dareth not assert he be alive _ ever since the 29th of march _ but that he be _ now alive _ and _ be so on that day _ i grant the latter for he do not die until night as appeareth in a print account of he death in a _ letter to a lord _ and whether he be since revive i leave the world to judge this indeed be perfect cavilling and i be ashamed to dwell any longer upon it fourthly i will appeal to mr partridge himself whether it be probable i could have be so indiscreet as to begin my _ prediction _ with the _ only _ falsehood that ever be pretend to be in they and this in a affair at home where i have so many opportunity to be exact and must have give such advantage against I to a person of mr partridge 's wit and learning : who if he could possibly have raise one single objection more against the truth of my prophecy would hardly have spare I and here i must take occasion to reprove the above-mentioned writer -lrb- ie swift _ himself see _ p 482 -rrb- of the relation of mr partridge 's death in a _ letter to a lord _ who be please to tax I with a mistake of _ four whole hour _ in my calculation of that event i must confess this censure pronounce with a air of certainty in a matter that so nearly concerned I and by a grave _ judicious _ author move I not a little but though i be at that time out of town yet several of my friend whose curiosity have lead they to be exactly inform -lrb- as for my own part have no doubt at all of the matter i never once think of it -rrb- assure I i compute to something under half a hour : which -lrb- i speak my private opinion -rrb- be a error of no very great magnitude that man should raise clamor about it i shall only say it would not be amiss if that author would henceforth be more tender of other man 's reputation as well as of he own it be well there be no more mistake of that kind : if there have be i presume he would have tell I of they with as little ceremony there be one objection against mr partridge 's death which i have sometimes meet with although indeed very slightly offer that he still continueth to write _ almanack _ but this be no more than what be common to all of that profession _ gadbury poor robin dive wing _ and several other do yearly publish they _ almanack _ though several of they have be dead since before the revolution now the natural reason of this i take to be that whereas it be the privilege of other author _ to live _ after they death _ almanack _ maker be only exclude because they dissertation treat only upon the minute as they pass become useless as those go off : in consideration of which time whose register they be give they a lease in reversion to continue they work after they death or perhaps a _ name _ can _ make _ a _ almanack _ as well as _ sell _ one and to strengthen this conjecture i have hear the bookseller affirm that they have desire mr partridge to spare himself further trouble and only to lend he name which could make _ almanack _ much better than himself i should not have give the public or myself the trouble of this _ vindication _ if my name have not be make use of by several person to whom i never lend it : one of which a few day ago be please to father on I a new set of _ prediction _ but i think these be thing too serious to be trifle with it grieve I to the heart when i see my labor which have cost I so much thought and watch bawl about by the common hawker of grub street which i only intend for the weighty consideration of the gravest person this prejudice the world so much at first that several of my friend have the assurance to ask I whether i be in jest to which i only answer coldly that the event will shew but it be the talent of we age and nation to turn thing of the greatest importance into ridicule when the end of the year have _ verify all _ my _ prediction _ out cometh mr partridge 's _ almanack _ dispute the point of he death so that i be employ like the general who be force to kill he enemy twice over whom a necromancer have raise to life if mr partridge have practice the same experiment upon himself and be again alive long may he continue so but that doth not in the least contradict my veracity for i think i have clearly prove _ by invincible demonstration _ that he die at farthest within half a hour of the time i foretold -lrb- and not four hour sooner as the above-mentioned author in he _ letter to a lord _ have maliciously suggest with a design to blast my credit by charge I with so gross a mistake -rrb- finis under the combined assault of the wit partridge cease to publish he _ almanack _ for a while but afterwards take heart again publish he _ merlinus redivivus _ be a almanack for the year 1714 by john partridge a lover of truth -lrb- pp 2465\/6 -rrb- at p 2 of which be the follow epistle to isaac bickerstaff esq sir there seem to be a kind of fantastical propriety in a dead man 's address himself to a person not in be isaac bickerstaff -lrb- _ ie richard steele _ -rrb- be no more -lrb- _ the _ tatler _ have come to a end _ -rrb- and i have now nothing to dispute with on the subject of he fiction concern I _ sed magni nominis umbra _ a shadow only and a mighty name i have indeed be for some year silent or in the language of mr bickerstaff dead yet like many a old man that be report so by he heir i have live long enough to bury my successor -lrb- _ the _ tatler _ have be discontinue _ -rrb- in short i be return to be after you have leave it and since you be once pleased to call yourself my brother-astrologer the world may be apt to compare we story to that of the twin-stars castor and pollux and say it be we destiny not to appear together but accord to the fable to live and die by turn now sir my intention in this epistle be to let you know that i shall behave myself in my new be with as much moderation as possible and that i have no longer any quarrel with you -lrb- _ ie steele _ -rrb- for the account you insert in you writings -lrb- _ the joke be continue in the _ tatler -rrb- concern my death be sensible that you be no less abused in that particular than myself the person from whom you take up that report i know be you namesake the author of bickerstaff 's _ prediction _ a notorious cheat -lrb- 16 -rrb- and if you have be indeed as much a astrologer as you pretend you might have know that he word be no more to be take than that of a irish evidence -lrb- _ swift be now dean of st patrick 's _ -rrb- : that not be the only _ tale of a tub _ he have vent the only satisfaction therefore i expect be that you bookseller in the next edition of you work -lrb- _ the tatler _ -rrb- do strike out my name and insert he in the room of it i have some thought of oblige the world with he nativity but shall defer that till another opportunity i have nothing to add further but only that when you think fit to return to life again in whatever shape of censor -lrb- _ the designation of the suppose writer of the _ tatler -rrb- a _ guardian _ a _ englishman _ or any other figure i shall hope you will do justice to you revive friend and servant john partridge on the last leaf of this _ almanack _ be the follow notice : -- this be to give notice to all people that all those _ prophecy prediction almanack _ and other pamphlet that have my name either true or shammed with the want of a letter -lrb- _ ie spell he name partrige instead of partridge _ -rrb- : i say they be all impudent forgery by a breed of villain and wholly without my knowledge or consent and i doubt not but those beggarly villain that have scarce bread to eat without be rogue two or three poor printer and a bookbinder with honest ben will be at they old trade again of prophesy in my name this be therefore to give notice that if there be anything in print in my name beside this _ almanack _ you may depend on it that it be a lie and he be a villain that write and print it in he _

so busy building at -- that you friend must not hope to see you in town this year : at the same time you desire I that you may not be quite at a loss in conversation among the _ beau monde _ next winter to send you a account of the present state of wit in town : which without further preface i shall endeavor to perform and give you the history and character of all we periodical papers whether monthly weekly or diurnal with the same freedom i use to send you we other town news i shall only premise that as you know i never care one farthe either for whig or tory : so i shall consider we writer purely as they be such without any respect to which party they belong dr king have for some time lie down he monthly _ philosophical transaction _ which the title-page inform we at first be only to be continue as they sell and though that gentleman have a world of wit yet as it lie in one particular way of raillery the town soon grow weary of he writings : though i can not but think that they author deserve a much better fate than to languish out the small remainder of he life in the fleet prison about the same time that the doctor leave off write one mr ozell put out he _ monthly amusement _ which be still continue : and as it be generally some french novel or play indifferently translate it be more or less take notice of as the original piece be more or less agreeable as to we weekly papers the poor _ review _ -lrb- _ by daniel defoe _ -rrb- be quite exhaust and grow so very contemptible that though he have provoke all he brother of the quill round none of they will enter into a controversy with he this fellow who have excellent natural part but want a small foundation of learning be a lively instance of those wit who as a ingenious author say will endure but one skimming -lrb- -rrb- the _ observator _ be almost in the same condition but since we party struggle have run so high he be much mend for the better : which be imputed to the charitable assistance of some outlying friend these two author might however have flourish some time longer have not the controversy be take up by abler hand the _ examiner _ be a paper which all man who speak without prejudice allow to be well write though he subject will admit of no great variety he be continually place it in so many different light and endeavor to inculcate the same thing by so many beautiful change of expression that man who be concern in no party may read he with pleasure he way of assume the question in debate be extremely artful and he _ letter to crassus _ be i think a masterpiece as these papers be suppose to have be write by several hand the critic will tell you that they can discern a difference in they style and beauty and pretend to observe that the first _ examiner _ abound chiefly in wit the last in humor soon after they first appearance come out a paper from the other side call the _ whig examiner _ write with so much fire and in so excellent a style as put the tory in no small pain for they favorite hero every one cry _ bickerstaff _ must be the author and people be the more confirm in this opinion upon its be so soon lay down : which seem to shew that it be only write to bind the _ examiner _ to they good behavior and be never design to be a weekly paper the _ examiner _ therefore have no one to combat with at present but they friend the _ medley _ : the author of which paper though he seem to be a man of good sense and express it luckily now and then be i think for the most part perfectly a stranger to fine writing i presume i need not tell you that the _ examiner _ carry much the more sail as it be suppose to be write by the direction and under the eye of some great person who sit at the helm of affair and be consequently look on as a sort of public notice which way they be steer we the reputed author be dr s -lrb- wif -rrb- t with the assistance sometimes of dr att -lrb- erbur -rrb- y and mr p -lrb- rio -rrb- r the _ medley _ be say to be write by mr old -lrb- mixo -rrb- n and supervise by mr mayn -lrb- warin -rrb- g who perhaps might entirely write those few papers which be so much better than the rest before i proceed further in the account of we weekly papers it will be necessary to inform you that at the beginning of the winter -lrb- _ on jan 2 _ 1711 -rrb- to the infinite surprise of all man mr steele flang up he _ tatler _ and instead of _ isaac bickerstaff esquire _ subscribe himself richard steele to the last of those papers after a handsome compliment to the town for they kind acceptance of he endeavor to divert they the chief reason he think fit to give for he leave off write be that have be so long look on in all public place and company as the author of those papers he find that he most intimate friend and acquaintance be in pain to speak or act before he the town be very far from be satisfy with this reason and most people judge the true cause to be either that he be quite spend and want matter to continue he undertake any longer or that he lay it down as a sort of submission to and composition with the government for some past offence or lastly that he have a mind to vary he shape and appear again in some new light however that be he disappearance seem to be bewail as some general calamity every one want so agreeable a amusement and the coffee-house begin to be sensible that the _ esquire 's lucubration _ alone have bring they more customer than all they other news papers put together it must indeed be confess that never man throw up he pen under stronger temptation to have employ it longer he reputation be at a greater height than i believe ever any live author 's be before he it be reasonable to suppose that he gain be proportionably considerable every one read he with pleasure and good-will and the tory in respect to he other good quality have almost forgive he unaccountable imprudence in declare against they lastly it be highly improbable that if he throw off a character the idea of which be so strongly impressed in every one 's mind however finely he might write in any new form that he should meet with the same reception to give you my own thought of this gentleman 's writings i shall in the first place observe that there be a noble difference between he and all the rest of we polite and gallant author the latter have endeavor to please the age by fall in with they and encourage they in they fashionable vice and false notion of thing it would have be a jest some time since for a man to have assert that anything witty could be say in praise of a married state or that devotion and virtue be any way necessary to the character of a fine gentleman _ bickerstaff _ venture to tell the town that they be a parcel of fop fool and coquette but in such a manner as even pleased they and make they more than half inclined to believe that he speak truth instead of comply with the false sentiment or vicious taste of the age -- either in morality criticism or good breeding -- he have boldly assure they that they be altogether in the wrong and command they with a authority which perfectly well become he to surrender themselves to he argument for virtue and good sense it be incredible to conceive the effect he writings have have on the town how many thousand folly they have either quite banish or give a very great check to how much countenance they have add to virtue and religion how many people they have render happy by shew they it be they own fault if they be not so and lastly how entirely they have convince we young fop and young fellow of the value and advantage of learn he have indeed rescue it out of the hand of pedant and fool and discover the true method of make it amiable and lovely to all mankind in the dress he give it it be a most welcome guest at tea-table and assembly and be relish and caress by the merchant on the change accordingly there be not a lady at court nor a banker in lombard street who be not verily persuade that captain steele be the greatest scholar and best casuist of any man in england lastly he writings have set all we wit and man of letter on a new way of thinking of which they have little or no notion before : and although we can not say that any of they have come up to the beauty of the original i think we may venture to affirm that every one of they write and think much more justly than they do some time since the vast variety of subject which mr steele have treat of in so different manners and yet all so perfectly well make the world believe that it be impossible they should all come from the same hand this set every one upon guess who be the _ esquire 's _ friend and most people at first fancy it must be doctor swift but it be now no longer a secret that he only great and constant assistant be mr addison this be that excellent friend to whom mr steele owe so much and who refuse to have he name set before those piece which the greatest pen in england would be proud to own indeed they could hardly add to this gentleman 's reputation : whose work in latin and english poetry long since convince the world that he be the greatest master in europe of those two language i be assure from good hand that all the vision and other tract of that way of write with a very great number of the most exquisite piece of wit and raillery throughout the _ lucubration _ be entirely of this gentleman 's composing : which may in some measure account for that different genius which appear in the winter papers from those of the summer at which time as the _ examiner _ often hint this friend of mr steele be in ireland mr steele confess in he last volume of the _ tatler _ that he be oblige to dr swift for he _ town shower _ and the _ description of the morn _ with some other hint receive from he in private conversation i have also hear that several of those _ letter _ which come as from unknown hand be write by mr henley : which be a answer to you query who those friend be whom mr steele speak of in he last _ tatler _ but to proceed with my account of we other papers the expiration of _ bickerstaff 's lucubration _ be attend with much the same consequence as the death of _ meliboeus 's ox _ in virgil : as the latter engendered swarm of bee the former immediately produce whole swarm of little satirical scribbler one of these author call himself the _ growler _ and assure we that to make amends for mr steele 's silence he be resolve to _ growl _ at we weekly as long as we should think fit to give he any encouragement another gentleman with more modesty call he paper the _ whisperer _ and a third to please the lady christen he the _ telltale _ at the same time come out several _ tatler _ each of which with equal truth and wit assure we that he be the genuine _ isaac bickerstaff _ it may be observe that when the _ esquire _ lay down he pen though he could not but foresee that several scribbler would soon snatch it up which he might -lrb- one would think -rrb- easily have prevent : he scorn to take any further care about it but leave the field fairly open to any worthy successor immediately some of we wit be for form themselves into a club head by one mr harrison and try how they could shoot in this bow of ulyss but soon find that this sort of write require so fine and particular a manner of think with so exact a knowledge of the world as must make they utterly despair of success they seem indeed at first to think that what be only the garnish of the former _ tatler _ be that which recommend they and not those substantial entertainment which they everywhere abound in accord they be continually talk of they _ maid night cap spectacles _ and charle lillie however there be now and then some faint endeavor at humor and spark of wit : which the town for want of better entertainment be content to hunt after through a heap of impertinence but even those be at present become wholly invisible and quite swallow up in the blaze of the _ spectator _ you may remember i tell you before that one cause assign for the lay down the _ tatler _ be want of matter and indeed this be the prevailing opinion in town : when we be surprise all at once by a paper call the _ spectator _ which be promise to be continue every day and be write in so excellent a style with so nice a judgment and such a noble profusion of wit and humor that it be not difficult to determine it could come from no other hand but those which have pen the _ lucubration _ this immediately alarm these gentleman who as it be say mr steele phrase it have the censorship in commission they find the new _ spectator _ come on like a torrent and sweep away all before he they despair ever to equal he in wit humor or learning which have be they true and certain way of oppose he : and therefore rather choose to fall on the author and to call out for help to all good christian by assure they again and again that they be the first original true and undisputed _ isaac bickerstaff _ meanwhile the _ spectator _ whom we regard as we shelter from that flood of false wit and impertinence which be break in upon we be in every one 's hand and a constant topic for we morning conversation at tea-table and coffee-house we have at first indeed no manner of notion how a diurnal paper could be continue in the spirit and style of we present _ spectator _ : but to we no small surprise we find they still rise upon we and can only wonder from whence so prodigious a run of wit and learning can proceed since some of we best judge seem to think that they have hitherto in general outshone even the _ esquire _ 's first _ tatler _ most people fancy from they frequency that they must be compose by a society : i withal assign the first place to mr steele and he friend i have often think that the conjunction of those two great genius who seem to stand in a class by themselves so high above all we other wit resemble that of two statesman in a late reign whose character be very well express in they two motto viz _ prodesse quam conspicus _ -lrb- lord somer -rrb- and _ otium cum dignitate _ -lrb- charle montagu earl of halifax -rrb- accordingly the first -lrb- _ addison _ -rrb- be continually at work behind the curtain draw up and prepare all those scheme which the latter still drive on and stand out expose to the world to receive its praise or censure meantime all we unbiassed well-wisher to learn be in hope that the known temper and prudence of one of these gentleman will hinder the other from ever lash out into party and render that wit which be at present a common good odious and ungrateful to the better part of the nation -lrb- _ by which of course gay mean the tory _ -rrb- if this piece of imprudence do not spoil so excellent a paper i propose to myself the highest satisfaction in read it with you over a dish of tea every morning next winter as we have yet have nothing new since the _ spectator _ it only remain for I to assure you that i be yours & c j -lrb- ohn -rrb- g -lrb- ay -rrb- _ westminster may _ 3 1711 _ postcript _ upon a review of my letter i find i have quite forget the _ british apollo _ which might possibly have

study of the old greek and roman writer whose language and manner he catch at that time of life as strongly as other young people gain a french accent or a genteel air a early acquaintance with the classic be what may be call the good breeding of poetry as it give a certain gracefulness which never forsake a mind that contract it in youth but be seldom or never hit by those who would learn it too late he first distinguish himself by he latin composition publish in the _ musae anglicanae _ : and be admire as one of the best author since the augustan age in the two university and the greatest part of europe before he be talk of as a poet in town there be not perhaps any harder task than to tame the natural wildness of wit and to civilize the fancy the generality of we old english poet abound in forced conceit and affect phrase and even those who be say to come the nearest to exactness be but too often fond of unnatural beauty and aim at something better than perfection if mr addison 's example and precept be the occasion that there now begin to be a great demand for correctness we may justly attribute it to he be first fashion by the ancient model and familiarize to propriety of thought and chastity of style we country owe it to he that the famous monsieur boileau first conceive a opinion of the english genius for poetry by peruse the present he make he of the _ musae anglicanae _ it have be currently report that this famous french poet among the civility he shew mr addison on that occasion affirm that he would not have write against perrault have he before see such excellent piece by a modern hand such a say would have be impertinent and unworthy -lrb- of -rrb- boileau whose dispute with perrault turn chiefly upon some passage in the ancient which he rescue from the misinterpretation of he adversary the true and natural compliment make by he be that those book have give he a very new idea of the english politeness and that he do not question but there be excellent composition in the native language of a country that profess the roman genius in so eminent a degree the first english performance make public by he be a short copy of verse _ to mr dryden _ with a view particularly to he translation this be soon follow by a version of the fourth _ georgic _ of virgil of which mr dryden make very honorable mention in the _ postscript _ to he own translation of virgil 's _ work _ : wherein i have often wonder that he do not at the same time acknowledge he obligation to mr addison for give the _ essay upon the georgic _ prefix to mr dryden 's translation lest the honor of so exquisite a piece of criticism should hereafter be transfer to a wrong author i have take care to insert it in this collection of he _ work _ of some other copy of

to purchase politeness to they country he poem upon one of king william 's campaign address to he lordship be receive with great humanity and occasion a message from he to the author to desire he acquaintance he soon after obtain by he interest a yearly pension of three hundred pound from the crown to support he in he travels if the uncommonness of a favor and the distinction of the person who confer it enhance its value nothing could be more honorable to a young man of learning than such a bounty from so eminent a patron how well mr addison answer the expectation of my lord somer can not appear better than from the book of _ travel _ he dedicate to he lordship at he return it be not hard to conceive why that performance be at first but indifferently relish by the bulk of reader who

of the volume which make more than half of it and wonder how a author who seem to have so solid a understanding when he treat of more weighty subject in the other page should dwell upon such trifle and give up so much room to matter of mere amusement there be indeed but few man so fond of the ancient as to be transport with every little accident which introduce to they intimate acquaintance person of that cast may here have the satisfaction of see annotation upon a old roman poem gather from the hill and valley where it be write the tiber and the po serve to explain the verse which be make upon they bank and the alp and apennine be make commentator on those author to whom they be subject so many century ago next to personal conversation with the writer themselves this be the surest way of come at they sense a compendious and engaging kind of criticism which convince at first sight and shew the vanity of conjecture make by antiquary at a distance if the knowledge of polite literature have its use there be certainly a merit in illustrate the perfect model of it and the learn world will think some year of a man 's life not misspend in so elegant a employment i shall conclude what i have to say on this performance by observe that the fame of it increase from year to year and the demand for copy be so urgent that they price rise to four or five time the original value before it come out in a second edition the _ letter from italy _ to my lord halifax may be consider as the text upon which the book of _ travel _ be a large comment and have be esteem by those who have a relish for antiquity as the most exquisite of he poetical performance a translation of it by signor salvinus professor of the greek tongue at florence be insert in this edition not only on account of its merit but because it be the language of the country which be the subject of the poem the material for the _ dialogue upon medal _ now first print from a manuscript of the author be

before the date of this letter mr addison have design to return to england when he receive advice from he friend that he be pitch upon to attend the army under prince eugene who have just begin the war in italy as secretary from he majesty but a account of the death of king william which he meet with at geneva put a end to that thought : and as he hope of advancement in he own country be fall with the credit of he friend who be out of power at the beginning of she late majesty 's reign he have leisure to make the tour of germany in he way home he remain for some time after he return to england without any public employment : which he do not obtain till the year 1704 when the duke of marlborough arrive at the highest pitch of glory by deliver all europe from slavery and furnished mr

and he unblemished integrity in this and other employment it must not be omit here that the salary of keeper of the record in ireland be considerably raise and that post bestow upon he at this time as a mark of the queen 's favor he be in that kingdom when he first discover sir richard steele to be the author of the _ tatler _ by a observation upon _ virgil _ which have be by he communicate to he

author and of the several character that compose he club be project in concert with sir richard steele and because many passage in the course of the work would otherwise be obscure i have take leave to insert one single paper write by sir richard steele wherein those character be draw which may serve as a _ dramati persona _ or as so many picture for a ornament and explication of the whole as for the distinct papers they be never or seldom shewn to each other by they respective author who fully answer the promise they have make and far outwent the expectation they have raise of pursue they labor in the same spirit and strength with which it be begin it would have be impossible for mr addison -lrb- who make little or no use of letter send in by the numerous correspondent of the _ spectator _ -rrb- to have execute he large share of he task in so exquisite a manner if he have not engraft into it many piece that have lie by he in little hint and minute which he from time to time collect and range in order and mould into the form in which they now appear such be the essay upon _ wit _ the _ pleasure of the imagination _ the _ critique upon milton _ and some other : which i think to have connect in a continued series in this edition though they be at first publish with the interruption of writings on different subject but as such a scheme would have oblige I to cut off several graceful introduction and circumstance peculiarly adapt to the time and occasion of printing then i durst not pursue that attempt the tragedy of cato appear in public in the year 1713 when the greatest part of the last _ act _ be add by the author to the foregoing which he have keep by he for many year he take up a design of write a play upon this subject when he be very young at the university and even attempt something in it there though not a line as it now stand the work be perform by he in he travels and retouch in england without any form resolution of bring it upon the stage until he friend of the first quality and distinction prevail on he to put the last finish to it at a time when they think the doctrine of liberty very seasonable it be in everybody 's memory with what applause it be receive by the public that the first run of it last for a month and then stop only because one of the performer become incapable of act a principal part the author receive a message that the queen would be please to have it dedicate to she : but as he have design that compliment elsewhere he find himself oblige by he duty on the one side and he honor on the other to send it into the world without any _ dedication _ the fame of this tragedy soon spread through europe and it have not only be translate but act in most of the language of christendom the translation of it into italian by signor salvinus be very well know : but i have not be able to learn whether that of signor valetta a young neapolitan nobleman have ever be make public if he have find time for the writing of another tragedy the death of socrate would have be the story and however unpromising that subject may appear it would be presumptuous to censure he choice who be so famous for raise the noblest plant from the most barren soil it serve to shew that he think the whole labor of such a performance unworthy to be throw away upon those intrigue and adventure to which the romantic taste have confine modern tragedy : and after the example of he predecessor in greece would have employ the drama _ to wear out of we mind everything that be mean or little to cherish and cultivate that

by the editor and one of he friend who have the good nature to assist he during he avocation of business it be think better to add these translation such as they be than to let the work come out unintelligible to those who do not possess the learn language the scheme for the treatise upon the _ christian religion _ be form by the author about the end of the late queen 's reign at which time he carefully peruse the ancient writings which furnish the material for it he continual employment in business prevent he from execute it until he resign he office of secretary of state and he death

for you own sake in receive compliment of this nature i depend upon you known humanity for pardon when i acknowledge that you have this present trouble for mine when i take myself to be ill treat with regard to my behavior to the merit of other man my conduct towards you be a argument of my candor that way as well as that you name and authority will be my protection in it you will give I leave therefore in a matter that concern we in the poetical world to make you my judge whether i be not injure in the highest manner for with man of you taste and delicacy it be a high crime and misdemeanor to be guilty of anything that be disingenuous but i will go into my matter upon my return from scotland i visit mr tonson 's shop and thank he for he care in send to my house the volume of my dear and honor friend mr addison which be at last publish by he secretary mr tickell : but take occasion to observe that i have not see the work before it come out which he do not think fit to excuse any otherwise than by a recrimination that i have put into he hand at a high price a comedy call _ the drummer _ which by my zeal for it he take to be write by mr addison and of which after he -lrb- _ addison 's _ -rrb- death he say i directly acknowlege he be the author to urge this hardship still more home he produce a receipt under my hand in these word -- _ march 12 1715 -lrb- -16 -rrb- _ _ receive then the sum of fifty guinea for the copy _ -lrb- copyright -rrb- _ of the comedy call _ the drummer or the haunt house _ i say receive by order of the author of the say comedy _ _ richard

_ ie tonson throw the onus of the authenticity of the _ drummer _ on steele _ -rrb- this be represent thus circumstantially to shew how incumbent it be upon I as well in justice to the bookseller as for many other consideration to produce this comedy a second time -lrb- _ it be first print in _ 1716 -rrb- and take this occasion to vindicate myself against certain insinuation throw out by the publisher -lrb- _ thoma tickell _ -rrb- of mr addison 's writings concern my behavior in the nicest circumstance -- that of do justice to the merit of my friend i shall take the liberty before i have end this letter to say why i believe the _ drummer _ a performance of mr addison : and after i have declare this any survive writer may be at ease if there be any one who have hitherto be vain enough to hope or silly enough to fear it may be give to himself before i go any further i must make my public appeal to you and all the learn world and humbly demand whether it be a decent and reasonable thing that work write as a great part of mr addison 's be in correspondence -lrb- _ coadjutorship _ -rrb- with I ought to have be publish without my review of the catalogue of they or if there be any exception to be make against any circumstance in my conduct whether a opportunity to explain myself should not have be allow I before any reflection be make on I in print when i have peruse mr tickell 's _ preface _ i have soon so many objection besides he omission to say anything of the _ drummer _ against he long-expected performance : the chief intention of which -lrb- and which it concern I first to examine -rrb- seem to aim at do the deceased author justice against I whom he insinuate to have assume to myself part of the merit of my friend he be pleased sir to express himself concern the present writer in the follow manner -- _ the comedy call _ the tender husband _ appear much about the same time to which mr addison write the _ prologue : _ sir richard steele surprise he with a very handsome _ dedication _ of this play and have since acquaint the public that he owe some of the most take scene of it to mr addison _ mr tickell 's _ preface _ pag 11 _ he be in that kingdom _

it related to the feigned person of the author and of the several character that compose he club be project in concert with sir _ richard steele : _ and because many passage in the course of the work

expectation they have raise of pursue they labor in the same spirit and strength with which it be begin _ pag 13 it need not be explain that it be here intimate that i have not sufficiently acknowledge what be due to mr addison in these writings i shall make a full answer to what seem intend by the word _ he be too delicate to take any part of that which belong to other _ if i can recite out of my own papers anything that may make it appear groundless the subsequent -lrb- _ follow _ -rrb- encomium bestow by I on mr addison will i hope be of service to I in this particular _ but i have only one gentleman _ who will be nameless _ to thank for any frequent assistance to I : which indeed it would have be barbarous in he to have deny in one with whom he have live in a intimacy from childhood consider the great ease with which he be able to despatch the most entertaining piece of this nature this good office he perform with such force of genius humor wit and learn that i fare like a distressed prince who call in a powerful neighbor to he aid i be undo by my auxiliary when i have once call he in i could not subsist without dependence on he _ _ the same hand write the distinguish character of man and woman under the name of _ musical instrument _ the _ distress of the news-writer _ the _ inventory of the play house _ and the _ description of the thermometer _ which i can not but look upon as the greatest embellishment of this work pref _ to the 4th vol of the _ tatler _ _ as to the work itself the acceptance it have meet with be the best proof of its value : but i should err against that candor which a honest man should always carry about he if i do not own that the most approved piece in it be write by other and those which have be most except against by myself the hand that have assist I in those noble discourse upon the immortality of the soul the glorious prospects of another life and the most sublime idea of religion and virtue be a person who be too fondly my friend ever to own they : but i should little deserve to be he if i usurp the glory of they i must acknowledge at the same time that i think the finest stroke of wit and humor in all mr _ bickerstaff 's lucubration _ be those for which he be also beholden to he tatler _ no 271 _ i hope the apology i have make as to the license allowable to a feigned character may excuse anything which have be say in these discourse of the _ spectator _ and he work but the imputation of the grossest vanity would still dwell upon I if i do not give some account by what mean i be enable to keep up the spirit of so long and approve a performance all the papers mark with _ a c l i _ or _ o -- _ that be to say all the papers which i have distinguish by any letter in the name of the muse _ clio -- _ be give I by the gentleman of whose assistance i formerly boast in the _ preface _ and conclude leaf of the _ tatler _ i be indeed much more proud of he long-continued friendship than i should be of the fame of be think the author of any writings which he himself be capable of produce _ _ i remember when i finish the _ tender husband _ i tell he there be nothing i so ardently wish as that we might some time or other publish a work write by we both which should bear the name of the monument in memory of we friendship i heartily wish what i have do here be as honorary to that sacred name as learn wit and humanity render those piece which i have teach the reader how to distinguish for he _ _ when the play above mention be last act there be so many applaud stroke in it which i have from the same hand that i think very meanly of myself that i have never publicly acknowledge they _ _ after i have put other friend upon importune he to publish dramatic as well as other writings he have by he i shall end what i think i be oblige to say on this head by give the reader this hint for the better judgement of my production : that the best comment upon they would be a account when the patron _ -lrb- ie addison -rrb- _ to the _ tender husband _ be in england or abroad _ -lrb- ie ireland -rrb- _ spectator _ no 555 _ my purpose in this application be only to shew the esteem i have for you and that i look upon my intimacy with you as one of the most valuable enjoyment of my life dedication _ before the _ tender husband _ i be sure you have read my quotation with indignation against the little -lrb- _ petty _ -rrb- zeal which prompt the editor -lrb- who by the way have himself do nothing in applause of the work which he preface -rrb- to the mean endeavor of add to mr addison by disparage a man who have -lrb- for the greatest part of he life -rrb- be he known bosom friend and shield he from all the resentment which many of he own work would have bring upon he at the time they be write it be really a good office to society to expose the indiscretion of intermedler in the friendship and correspondence -lrb- _ coadjutorship _ -rrb- of man whose sentiment passion and resentment be too great for they proportion of soul could the editor 's indiscretion provoke I even so far as -lrb- within the rule of strictest honor -rrb- i could go and i be not restrain by supererogatory affection to dear mr addison i would ask this unskilful creature what he mean when he speak in a air of a reproach _ that the _ tatler _ be lay down as it be take up without he participation _ let he speak out and say why _ without he knowledge _ would not serve he purpose as well if as he say he restrain himself to mr addison 's character as a writer while he attempt to lessen I he exalt I for he have declare to all the world what i never have so explicitly do that i be to all intent and purpose _ the author of the _ tatler he very justly say the occasional assistance mr addison give I in the course of that paper do not a little contribute to advance its reputation especially when upon the change of ministry -lrb- _ August 1710 _ -rrb- he find leisure to engage more constantly in it it be advance indeed for it be raise to a greater thing than i intend it for the elegance purity and correctness which appear in he writings be not so much my purpose as -lrb- in any intelligible manner as i could -rrb- to rally all those singularity of human life through the different profession and character in it which obstruct anything that be truly good and great after this acknowledgement you will see that be such a man as you will see that i rejoiced in be excel and make those little talent -lrb- whatever they be -rrb- which i have give way and be subservient to the superior quality of a friend whom i loved and whose modesty would never have admit they to come into daylight but under such a shelter so that all which the editor have say -lrb- either out of design or incapacity -rrb- mr congreve must end in this : that steele have be so candid and upright that he owe nothing to mr addison as a writer but whether he do or do not whatever steele owe to mr addison the public owe addison to steele but the editor have such a fantastical and ignorant zeal for he patron that he will not allow he correspondent -lrb- _ coadjutor _ -rrb- to conceal anything of he though in obedience to he command what i never do declare be mr addison 's i have he direct injunction to hide against the natural warmth and passion of my own temper towards my friend many of the writings now publish as he i have be very patiently traduce and culminate for as they be pleasantry and oblique stroke upon certain of the wittiest man of the age : who will now restore I to they goodwill in proportion to the abatement of -lrb- the -rrb- wit which they think i employ against they but i be say that the editor will not allow we to obey he patron 's command in anything which he think would redound to he credit if discover and because i would shew a little wit in my anger i shall have the discretion to shew you that he have be guilty in this particular towards a much greater man than you humble servant and one whom you be much more oblige to vindicate mr dryden in he _ virgil _ after have acknowledge that a certain excellent young man -lrb- _ ie w congreve himself _ -rrb- have shew he many fault in he translation of _ virgil _ which he have endeavor to correct go on to say two other worthy friend of mine who desire to have they name conceal see I straighten in my time take pity on I and give I the _ life of virgil _ the two _ preface _ to the _ pastoral _ and the _ georgic _ and all the argument in prose to the whole translation if mr addison be one of the two friend and the _ preface _ to the _ georgic _ be what the editor call the _ essay upon the georgic _ as one may adventure to say they be from they be word for word the same he have cast a inhuman reflection upon mr dryden : who though tie down not to name mr addison point at he so as all mankind conservant in these matter know he with a eulogium equal to the highest merit consider who it be that bestow it i could not avoid remark upon this circumstance out of justice to mr dryden : but confess at the same time i take a great pleasure in do it because i know in expose this outrage i make my court to mr congreve i have observe that the editor will not let I or any one else obey mr addison 's command in hide anything he desire to be conceal i can not but take further notice that the circumstance of mark he _ spectator _ -lrb- _ with the letter c l i o _ -rrb- which i do not know till i have do with the work i make my own act because i think it too great a sensibility in my friend and think it -lrb- since it be do -rrb- better to be suppose mark by I than the author himself the real state of which this zealot rashly and injudiciously expose i ask the reader whether anything but a earnestness to disparage I could provoke the editor in behalf of mr addison to say that he mark it out of caution against I : when i have take upon I to say it be i that do it out of tenderness to he as the imputation of any the least attempt of arrogate to myself or detract from mr addison be without any color of truth : you will give I leave to go on in the same ardor towards he and resent the cold unaffectionate dry and barren manner in which this gentleman give a account of as great a benefactor as any one learn man ever have of another would any man who have be produce from a college life and push into one of the most considerable employment of the kingdom as to its weight and trust and greatly lucrative with respect to a fellowship -lrb- _ ie of a college _ -rrb- : and who have be daily and hourly with one of the greatest man of the age be satisfy with himself in say _ nothing _ of such a person besides what all the world know except a particularity -lrb- and that to he disadvantage -rrb- which i he friend from a boy do not know to be true to wit that he never have a regular pulse as for the fact and considerable period of he life he either know nothing of they or injudiciously place they in a worse light than that in which they really stand when he speak of mr addison 's decline to go into order he way of do it be to lament _ he seriousness and modesty _ which might have recommend he _ prove the chief obstacle to it it seem these quality by which the priesthood be so much adorn represent the duty of it as too weighty for he and render he still more worthy of that honor which they make he decline _ these you know very well be not the reason which make mr addison turn he thought to the civil world and as you be the instrument of he become acquaint with my lord halifax i doubt not but you remember the warm instance that noble lord make to the head of the college not to insist upon mr addison 's go into order he argument be found on the general pravity -lrb- _ depravity _ -rrb- and corruption of man of business -lrb- _ public man _ -rrb- who want liberal education and i remember as if i read the letter yesterday that my lord end with a compliment that however he might be represent as no friend to the church he would never do it any other injury than keep mr addison out of it the contention for this man in he early youth among the people of greatest power mr secretary tickell the executor for he fame be pleased to ascribe to a serious visage and modesty of behavior when a writer be grossly and essentially faulty it be a jest to take notice of a false expression or a phrase otherwise _ priesthood _ in that place might be observe upon as a term not use by the real well-wisher to clergyman except when they would express some solemn act and not when that order be speak of as a profession among gentleman i will not therefore busy myself about the unconcerning part of knowledge but be content like a reader of plain sense without politeness and since mr secretary will give we no account of this gentleman i admit the alp and apennine instead of the editor to be commentator of he work which as the editor say have raise a demand for correctness this demand by the way ought to be more strong upon those who be most about he and have the greatest advantage of he example but as we editor say that those who come nearest to exactness be but too often fond of unnatural beauty and aim at something better than perfection believe I sir mr addison 's example will carry no man further than that height for which nature capacitate he : and the affectation of follow great man in work above the genius of they imitator will never rise farther than the production of uncommon and unsuitable ornament in a barren discourse like flower upon a heath such as the author 's phrase of something better than perfection but in he _ preface _ if ever anything be be that something better : for it be so extraordinary that we can not say it be too long or too short or deny but that it be both i think i abstract myself from all manner of prejudice when i aver that no man though without any obligation to mr addison would have represent he in he family and in he friendship or he personal character so disadvantageously as he secretary -lrb- in preference of whom he incur the warmest resentment of other gentleman -rrb- have be please to describe he in those particulars mr dean addison father of this memorable man leave behind he four child each of whom for excellent talent and singular preferment be as much above the ordinary world as they brother joseph be above they be thing of this nature to be expose to public view i could shew under the dean 's own hand in the warmest term he blessing on the friendship between he son and I nor have he a child who do not prefer I in the first place of kindness and esteem as they father love I like one of they : and i can with pleasure say i never omit any opportunity of shew that zeal for they person and interest as become a gentleman and a friend be i now to indulge myself i could talk a great deal to you which i be sure would be entertaining : but as i be speak at the same time to all the world i consider it would be impertinent let I then confine myself awhile to the follow play -lrb- _ the drummer _ -rrb- which i at first recommend to the stage and carry to the press no one who read the _ preface _ which i publish with it will imagine i could be induce to say so much as i then do have i not know the man i best loved have have a part in it or have i believe that any other concerned have much more to do than as a amanuensis but indeed have i not know at the time of the transaction concern the act on the stage and the sale of the copy i should i think have see mr addison in every page of it for he be above all man in that talent we call humor and enjoy it in such perfection that i have often reflect after a night spend with he apart from the world that i have have the pleasure of converse with a intimate acquaintance of terence and catullus who have all they wit and nature heighten with humor more exquisite and delightful than any other man ever possess they who shall read this play after be let into the secret that it be write by mr addison or under he direction will probably be attentive to those excellency which they before overlook and wonder they do not till now observe that there be not a expression in the whole piece which have not in it the most nice propriety and aptitude to the character which utter it here be that smile mirth that delicate satire and genteel raillery which appear in mr addison when he be free among intimate i say when he be free from he _ remarkable _ bashfulness which be a cloak that hide and muffle merit : and he ability be cover only by modesty which double the beauty which be see and give credit and esteem to all that be conceal the _ drummer _ make no great figure on the stage though exquisitely well act : but when i observe this i say a much harder thing of the stage than of the comedy when i say the stage in this place i be understand to mean in general the present taste of theatrical representation : where nothing that be not violent and as i may say grossly delightful can come on without hazard of be condemn or slight it be here republish and recommend as a closet piece -lrb- _ ie for private reading _ -rrb- to recreate a intelligent mind in a vacant hour : for vacant the reader must be from every strong prepossession in order to relish a entertainment _ quod nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum _ which can not be enjoy to the degree it deserve but by those of the most polite taste among scholar the best breeding among gentleman and the least acquaint with sensual pleasure among the lady the editor -lrb- _ thoma tickell _ -rrb- be pleased to relate concern _ cato _ that a play under that design be project by the author very early and wholly lay aside in advanced year he reassume the same design and many year after four act be finish he write the fifth and bring it upon the stage all the town know how officious i be in bring it on and you -lrb- that know the town the theater and mankind very well -rrb- can judge how necessary it be to take measure for make a performance of that sort excellent as it be run into popular applause i promise before it be act -lrb- and perform my duty accordingly to the author -rrb- that i would bring together so just a audience on the first day of it it should be impossible for the vulgar to put its success or due applause at any hazard : but i do not mention this only to shew how good a aide-de-camp i be to mr addison but to shew also that the editor do as much to cloud the merit of this work as i do to set it forth mr tickell 's account of its be take up lay down and at last perfect after such long interval and pause would make any one believe who do not know mr addison that it be accomplish with the greatest pain and labor and the issue rather of learning and industry than capacity and genius : but i do assure you that never play which could bring the author any reputation for wit and conduct notwithstanding it be so long before it be finish employ the author so little a time in write if i remember right the fifth act be write in less than a week 's time for this be particular in this writer that when he have take he resolution or make he plan for what he design to write he would walk about the room and dictate it into language with as much freedom and ease as any one could write it down : and attend to the coherence and grammar of what he dictate i have be often thus employ by he and never take it into my head though he only speak it and i take all the pain of throw it upon paper that i ought to call myself the writer of it i will put all my credit among man of wit for the truth of my averment when i presume to say that no one but mr addison be in any other way the writer of the _ drummer _ at the same time i will allow that he send for I -lrb- which he could always do from he natural power over I as much as he could send for any of he clerk when he be secretary of state -rrb- and tell I that a gentleman then in the room have write a play that he be sure i would like but it be to be a secret : and he know i would take as much pain since he recommend it as i would for he i hope nobody will be wrong or think himself aggrieved that i give this reject work -lrb- _ the comedy of _ the drummer _ not include by tickell in he collect edition of addison 's work _ -rrb- where i do : and if a certain gentleman -lrb- _ tickell _ -rrb- be injure by it i will allow i have wrong he upon this issue that if the reputed translator -lrb- _ tickell _ -rrb- of the _ first book of homer _ shall please to give we another _ book _ there shall appear another good judge in poetry besides mr alexander pope who shall like it but i detain you too long upon thing that be too personal to myself and will defer give the world a true notion of the character and talent of mr addison till i can speak of that amiable gentleman on a occasion void of controversy i shall then perhaps say many thing of he which will be new even to you with regard to he in all part of he character : for which i be so zealous that i could not be contented with praise and adorn he as much as lay in my own power but be ever solicit and put my friend upon the same office and since the editor -lrb- _ tickell _ -rrb- have adorn he heavy discourse with prose in rhyme at the end of it upon mr addison 's death : give I leave to atone for this long and tedious _ epistle _ by give after it what i dare say you will esteem a excellent poem on he marriage -lrb- _ by mr welsted _ -rrb- i must conclude without satisfy as strong a desire as every man have of say something remarkably handsome to the person to whom i be write : for you be so good a judge that you would find out the endeavourer to be witty and therefore as i have tire you and myself i will be contented with assure you which i do very honestly i would rather have you satisfy with I on this subject than any other man living you will please pardon I that i have thus lay this nice affair before a person who have the acknowledged superiority to all other not only in the most excellent talent but possess they with a equanimity candor and benevolence which render those advantage a pleasure as great to the rest of the world as they can be to the owner of they and since fame consist in the opinion of wise and good man : you must not blame I for take the readiest way to baffle any attempt upon my reputation by a address to one whom every wise and good man look

presently imagine that the author do either want the great tithe lie under the pressure of some pitiful vicarage or that he be much out of humor and dissatisfied with the present condition of affair or lastly that he write to no purpose at all there have be a abundance of unprofitable adviser in this kind as to my be under some low church dispensation you may know i write not out of a pinch necessity or out of any rise design you may please to believe that although i have a most solemn reverence for the clergy in general and especially for that of england yet for my own part i must confess to you i be not of that holy employment and have as little thought of be dean or bishop as they that think so have hope of be all lord keeper nor less mistaken will they be that shall judge I in the least discontented or any way dispose to disturb the peace of the present settle church : for in good truth i have neither lose king 's nor bishop 's land that should incline I to a surly and quarrelsome complain as many be who would have be glad enough to see he majesty restore and would have endure bishop daintily well have they lose no money by they come in i be not i will assure you any of those occasional writer that miss preferment in the university can presently write you they new way of education or be a little tormented with a ill-chosen wife set forth the doctrine of divorce to be truly evangelical the cause of these few sheet be honest and innocent and as free from all passion as any design as for the last thing which i suppose object _ viz _ that this book be altogether needless there have be a infinite number of church and clergy-mender that have make many tedious and unsuccessful offer : i must need confess that it be very unreasonable for I to expect a better reward only thus much i think with modesty may be say that i can not at present call to mind anything that be propound but what be very hopeful and easily accomplish for indeed should i go about to tell you that a child can never prove a profitable instructor of the people unless bear when the sun be in _ aries _ or bring up in a school that stand full south : that he can never be able to govern a parish unless he can ride the great horse or that he can never go through the great work of the ministry unless for three hundred year backward it can be prove that none of he family ever have cough ague or gray hair then i should very patiently endure to be reckon among the vainest that ever make attempt but believe I reader i be not as you will easily see any contriver of a incorruptible and pure crystaline church or any expecter of a reign of nothing but saint and worthy : but only a honest and hearty wisher that the best of we clergy might for ever continue as they be rich and learn and that the rest might be very useful and well esteem in they profession _ the grounds & occasion of the contempt of the clergy and religion enquire into sir that short discourse which we lately have concern the clergy continue so fresh in you mind that i perceive by you last you be more than a little troubled to observe that disesteem that lie upon several of those holy man you good wish for the church i know be very strong and unfeigned and you hope of the world receive much more advantage and better advice from some of the clergy than usually it be find by experience to do be neither needless nor impossible and as i have always be a devout admirer as well as strict observer of you action so i have constantly take a great delight to concur with you in you very thought whereupon it be sir that i have spend some few hour upon that which be the occasion of you last letter and the subject of we late discourse and before sir i enter upon tell you what be my apprehension i must most heartily profess that for my own part i do never think since at all i understand the excellency and perfection of a church but that ours now lately restore as formerly establish do far outgo as to all christian end and purpose either the pomp and bravery of rome herself or the best of free spiritual state -lrb- _ nonconformist _ -rrb- but if so be it be allowable -lrb- where we have so undoubtedly learn and honorable a clergy -rrb- to suppose that some of that sacred profession might possibly have attain to a greater degree of esteem and usefulness to the world : then i hope what have thus long hinder so great and desirable a blessing to the nation may be modestly guess at either without give any wilful offence to the present church or any great trouble dear sir to yourself and if i be not very much mistaken whatever have heretofore or do at present lessen the value of we clergy or render it in any degree less serviceable to the world than might be reasonably hope may be easily refer to two very plain thing -- the ignorance of some and the poverty of other of the clergy and first as to _ the ignorance of some of we clergy _ if we would make a search to purpose we must go as deep as the very beginning of education and doubtless may lay a great part of we misfortune to the old-fashioned method and discipline of schooling itself : upon the well order of which although much of the improvement of we clergy can not be deny mainly to depend : yet by reason this be so well know to yourself as also that there have be many of undoubted learning and experience that have set out they several model for this purpose i shall therefore only mention such loss of time and abuse of youth as be most remarkable and mischievous and as could not be conveniently omit in a discourse of this nature though ever so short and first of all it be certainly worth the consider whether it be unavoidably necessary to keep lad to 16 or 17 year of age _ in pure slavery to a few latin or greek word _ or whether it may not be more convenient especially if we call to mind they natural inclination to ease and idleness and how hardly they be persuade of the excellency of the liberal art and science -lrb- any further than the smart of the last piece of discipline be fresh in they memory -rrb- whether i say it be not more proper and beneficial to mix with those unpleasant task and drudgery something that in probability might not only take much better with they but might also be much easier obtain as suppose some part of time be allot they for the reading of some innocent english author where they need not go every line so unwillingly to a torment dictionary and whereby they might come in a short time to apprehend common sense and to begin to judge what be true for you shall have lad that be arch knave at the nominative case and that have a notable quick eye at spy out of the verb who for want of read such common and familiar book shall understand no more of what be very plain and easy than a well educate dog or horse or suppose they be teach as they might much easier be than what be commonly offer to they the principle of arithmetic geometry and such alluring part of learn as these thing undoubtedly would be much more useful so much more delightful to they than to be torment with a tedious story how phaeton break he neck or how many nut and apple tityrus have for he supper for most certainly youth if handsomely deal with be much inclinable to emulation and to a very useful esteem of glory and more especially if it be the reward of knowledge : and therefore if such thing be carefully and discreetly propound to they wherein they might not only earnestly contend amongst themselves but might also see how far they outskill the rest of the world a lad hereby would think himself high and mighty and would certainly take great delight in contemn the next unlearned mortal he meet withal but if instead hereof you diet he with nothing but with rule and exception with tiresome repetition of _ amo _ and -lrb- greek : _ tupto _ -rrb- set a day also apart also to recite _ verbatim _ all the burdensome task of the foregoing week -lrb- which i be confident be usually as dreadful as a old parliament fast -rrb- we must need believe that such a one thus manage will scarce think to prove immortal by such performance and accomplishment as these you know very well sir that lad in general have but a kind of ugly and odd conception of learning and look upon it as such a starving thing and unnecessary perfection especially as it be usually dispense out unto they that nine-pin or span-counter be judge much more heavenly employment and therefore what pleasure do we think can such a one take in be bind to get against breakfast two or three hundred rumbler out of homer in commendation of achille 's toe or the grecian ' boot or to have measure out to he very early in the morning fifteen or twenty well lay on lash for let a syllable slip too soon or hang too long on it doubtless instant execution upon such grand miscarriage as these will eternally engage he to a most admirable opinion of the muse lad certainly ought to be win by all possible art and device : and though many have invent fine picture and game to cheat they into the undertaking of unreasonable burden yet this by no means be such a lasting temptation as the propounding of that which in itself be pleasant and alluring for we shall find very many though of no excelling quickness will soon perceive the design of the landscape and so look through the veil will then begin to take as little delight in those pretty contrivance as in get by heart three or four leaf of ungayed nonsense neither seem the stratagem of money to be so prevailing and catch as a right down offer of such book which be ingenious and convenient : there be but very few so intolerably careful of they belly as to look upon the hope of a cake or a few apple to be a sufficient recompense for crack they pate with a heap of independent word i be not sensible that i have say anything in disparagement of those two famous tongue the greek and latin there be much reason to value they beyond other because the best of human learning have be deliver unto we in those language but he that worship they purely out of honor to rome and athen have little or no respect to the usefulness and excellency of the book themselves as many do : it be a sign he have a great esteem and reverence of antiquity but i think he by no means comparable for happiness to he who catch frog or hunt butterfly that some language therefore ought to be study be in a manner absolutely necessary : unless all be bring to one which would be the happiest thing that the world could wish for but whether the beginning of they might not be more insensibly instil and more advantageously obtain by read philosophical as well as other ingenious author than _ janua linguarum _ crabbed poem and cross-grained prose as it have be heretofore by other : so it ought to be afresh consider by all well-wisher either to the clergy or learn i know where it be the fashion of some school to prescribe to a lad for he evening refreshment out of commenius all the term of art -lrb- _ technical term _ -rrb- belong to anatomy mathematics or some such piece of learn now be it not a very likely thing that a lad should take most absolute delight in conquer such a pleasant task where perhaps he have two or three hundred word to keep in mind with a very small proportion of sense thereunto belong : whereas the use and full meaning of all those difficult term would have be most insensibly obtain by leisurely reading in particular this or the other science be it not also likely to be very savoury and of comfortable use to one that can scarce distinguish between virtue and vice to be task with high and moral poem it be usually say by those that be intimately acquaint with he that homer 's _ iliad _ and _ odyssey _ contain mystically all the moral law for certain if not a great part of the gospel -lrb- i suppose much after that rate that rabelai say he _ gargantua _ contain all the ten commandment -rrb- but perceivable only to those that have a poetical discerning spirit : with which gift i suppose few at school be so early qualify those admirable verse sir of yours both english and other which you have sometimes favor I with a sight of will not suffer I to be so sottish as to slight and undervalue so great and noble a accomplishment but the commit of such high and brave sense poem to a schoolboy -lrb- whose main business be to search out cunningly the antecedent and the relative to lie at catch for a spruce phrase a proverb or a quaint and pithy sentence -rrb- be not only to very little purpose but that have gargle only those elegant book at school this serve they instead of read they afterwards and do in a manner prevent they be further look into so that all improvement whatsoever it be that may be reap out of the best and choicest poet be for the most part utterly lose in that a time be usually choose of read they when discretion be much want to gain thence any true advantage thus that admirable and highly useful morality tully 's _ office _ because it be a book commonly construe at school be generally afterwards so contemn by academic that it be a long hour 's work to convince they that it be worthy of be look into again because they reckon it as a book read over at school and no question notably digest if therefore the ill method of schooling do not only occasion a great loss of time there but also do beget in lad a very odd opinion and apprehension of learning and much dispose they to be idle when they be get a little free from the usual severity and that the hope of more or less improvement in the university very much depend hereupon : it be without all doubt the great concernment of all that wish to the church that such care and regard be have to the management of school that the clergy be not so much obstruct in they first attempt and preparation to learn i can not sir possibly be so ignorant as not to consider that what have be now offer upon this argument have not only be largely insist on by other but also refer not particularly to the clergy -lrb- whose welfare and esteem i seem at present in a special manner solicitous about -rrb- but in general to all learn profession and therefore might reasonably have be omit : which certainly i have do have not i call to mind that of those many that propound to themselves learn for a profession there be scarce one in ten but that he lot choice or necessity determine he to the study of divinity thus sir i have give you my thought concern the order and custom of common school a consideration in my apprehension not slightly to be weigh : be that upon which to I seem very much to depend the learning and wisdom of the clergy and the prosperity of the church the next unhappiness that seem to have hinder some of we clergy from arrive to that degree of understand that become such a holy office whereby they company and discourse might be much more than they commonly be value and desire be the inconsiderate send of all kind of lad to the university let they part be ever so low and pitiful the instruction they have lie under ever so mean and contemptible and the purse of they friend ever so short to maintain they there if they have but the commendation of some lamentable and pitiful construe master it pass for sufficient evidence that they will prove person very eminent in the church that be to say if a lad have but a lusty and well bear memory this be the usual and almost only thing whereby they judge of they ability if he can sing over very tunably three or four stanza of lilly 's poetry be very quick and ready to tell what be latin for all the instrument belong to he father 's shop if presently -lrb- _ at sight _ -rrb- upon the first scanning he know a spondee from a dactyl and can fit a few of those same without any sense to he finger ' end if lastly he can say perfectly by heart he academic catechism in pure and pass latin _ ie _ what be he name where go he to school and what author be he best and chiefly skilled in a forward boy cry the schoolmaster : a very pregnant child ten thousand pity but he should be a scholar he prove a brave clergyman i 'll warrant you away to the university he must need go then for a little logic a little ethic and god know a very little of everything else and the next time you meet he he be in the pulpit neither ought the mischief which arise from small country school to pass unconsidered the little mighty governor whereof have for the most part not suck in above six or seven mouthsful of university air must yet by all means suppose themselves so notably furnish with all sort of instruction and be so ambitious of the glory of be count able to send forth now and then to oxford or cambridge from the little house by the churchyard 's side one of they ill-educated disciple that to such as these ofttime be commit the guidance and instruction of a whole parish : whose part and improvement duly consider will scarce render they fit governor of a small grammar castle not that it be necessary to believe that there never be a learn or useful person in the church but such whose education have be at westminster or st paul 's but whereas most of the small school be by they first founder design only for the advantage of poor parish child and also that the stipend be usually so small and discourage that very few who can do much more than teach to write and read will accept of such preferment : for these to pretend to rig out they small one for a university life prove ofttime a very great inconvenience and damage to the church and as many such dismal thing be send forth thus with very small tackle so not a few be predestinate thither by they friend from the foresight of a good benefice if there be rich pasture profitable custom and that henry viii have take out no toll the holy land be a very good land and afford abundance of milk and honey far be it from they conscience the consider whether the lad be likely to be serviceable to the church or to make wiser and better any of he parishioner all this may seem at first sight to be easily avoid by a strict examination at the university and so return by the next carrier all that be send up not fit for they purpose but because many of they relation be ofttime person of a inferior condition and who -lrb- either by imprudent counsellor or else out of a tickle conceit of they son be forsooth a university scholar -rrb- have purposely omit all other opportunity of a livelihood to return such would seem a very sharp and severe disappointment possibly it might be much better if parent themselves or they friend would be much more wary of determine they child to the trade of learning and if some of undoubted knowledge and judgement would offer they advice and speak they hope of a lad about 13 or 14 year of age -lrb- which i will assure you sir may be do without conjure -rrb- and never omit to inquire whether he relation be able and willing to maintain he seven year at the university or see some certain way of be continue there so long by the help of friend or other as also upon no such condition as shall in likelihood deprive he of the greatest part of he study for it be a common fashion of a great many to compliment and invite inferior people 's child to the university and there pretend to make such a all bountiful provision for they as they shall not fail of come to a very eminent degree of learning but when they come there they shall save a servant 's wages they take therefore heretofore a very good method to prevent sizar overheate they brain bed-making chamber-sweeping and water-fetching be doubtless great preservative against too much vain philosophy now certainly such pretended favor and kindness as these be the most right down discourtesy in the world for it be ten time more happy both for the lad and the church to be a corn-cutter or tooth-drawer to make or mend shoe or to be of any inferior profession than to be invite to and promise the convenience of a learn education and to have he name only stand air upon the college table -lrb- _ notice-board _ -rrb- and he chief business shall be to buy egg and butter neither ought lad ' part before they be determine to the university be only consider and the likelihood of be disappoint in they study but also ability or hope of be maintain until they be master of art for whereas 200 for the most part yearly commence -lrb- _ matriculate _ -rrb- scarce the fifth part of these continue after they take the first degree -lrb- _ ba _ -rrb- as for the rest have exactly learn _ quid est logica _ and _ quot sunt virtute morale _ down they go by the first carrier on the top of the pack into the west or north or elsewhere accord as they estate lie with burgesdicius eustachius and such great help of divinity and then for propagation of the gospel by that time they can say the _ predicament _ and _ creed _ they have they choice of preach or starve now what a champion of truth be such a thing likely to be what a huge blaze he make in the church what a raiser of doctrine what a confounder of heresy what a able interpreter of hard place what a resolver of case of conscience and what a prudent guide must he need be to all he parish you may possibly think sir that this so early preaching might be easily avoid by withhold holy order the church have very prudently constitute in she _ canon _ that none under twenty-three year of age which be the usual age after seven year be at the university should be admit to that great employment this indeed might seem to do some service be it carefully observe and be there not a thing to be get call a _ dispensation _ which will presently -lrb- _ at once _ -rrb- make you as old as you please but if you will sir we will suppose that order be strictly deny to all unless qualify accord to _ canon _ i can not foresee any other remedy but that most of those university youngster must fall to the parish and become a town charge until they be of spiritual age for philosophy be a very idle thing when one be cold and a small _ system of divinity _ though it be wollebius himself be not sufficient when one be hungry what then shall we do with they and where shall we dispose of they until they come to a holy ripeness may we venture they into the desk to read _ service _ that can not be because not capable besides the tempting pulpit usually stand too near or shall we trust they in some good gentleman 's house there to perform holy thing with all my heart so that they may not be call down from they study to say grace to every health that they may have a little better wages than the cook or butler as also that there be a groom in the house besides the chaplain -lrb- for sometimes to the # 10 a year they crowd -lrb- in -rrb- the look after couple of gelding -rrb- : and that he may not be send from table pick he tooth and sigh with he hat under he arm whilst the knight and my lady eat up the tart and chicken it may be also convenient if he be suffer to speak now and then in the parlor besides at grace and prayer time and that my cousin abigail and he sit not too near one another at meal nor be present together to the little vicarage all this sir must be think on for in good earnest a person at all thoughtful of himself and conscience have much better choose to live with nothing but bean and pea pottage so that he might have the command of he thought and time than to have he second and third course and to obey the unreasonable humor of some family and as some think two or three year ' continuance in the university to be time sufficient for be very great instrument in the church : so other we have so moderate as to count that a solemn admission and a formal pay of college detriment without the trouble of philosophical discourse disputation and the like be virtue that will influence as far as newcastle and improve though at ever such a distance so strangely possess be people in general with the easiness and small preparation that be requisite to the undertaking of the ministry that whereas in other profession they plainly see what considerable time be spend before they have any hope of arrive to skill enough to practice with any confidence what they have design yet to preach to ordinary people and govern a country parish be usually judge such a easy performance that anybody count himself fit for the employment we find very few so unreasonably confident of they part as to profess either law or physic without either a considerable continuance in some of the inn of court or a industrious search in herb anatomy chemistry and the like unless it be only to make a bond -lrb- _ bandage _ -rrb- or give a glyster -lrb- _ a injection _ -rrb- but as for the knack of preach as they call it that be such a very easy attainment that he be count dull to purpose that be not able at a very small warn to fasten upon any text of scripture and to tear and tumble it till the glass -lrb- _ the hourglass on the pulpit _ -rrb- be out many i know very well be force to discontinue -lrb- _ at college _ -rrb- have neither stock -lrb- _ capital _ -rrb- of they own nor friend to maintain they in the university but whereas a man 's profession and employment in this world be very much in he own or in the choice of such who be most nearly concern for he he therefore that foresee that he be not likely to have the advantage of a continued education he have much better commit himself to a approved-of cobbler or tinker wherein he may be duly respect accord to he office and condition of life than to be only a disesteemed pettifogger or empiric in divinity by this time sir i hope you begin to consider what a great disadvantage it have be to the church and religion the mere venturous and inconsiderate determining of youth to the profession of learn there be still one thing by very few at all mind that ought also not to be overlook : and that be a good constitution and health of body and therefore discreet and wise physician ought also to be consult before a absolute resolve be make to live the life of the learn for he that have strength enough to buy and bargain may be of a very unfit habit of body to sit still so much as in general be requisite to a competent degree of learn for although reading and think break neither leg nor arm yet certainly there be nothing that flag the spirit disorder the blood and enfeeble the whole body of man as intense study as for he that rive block or carry pack there be no great expense of part no anxiety of mind no great intellectual pensiveness let he but wipe he forehead and he be perfectly recover but he that have many language to remember the nature of almost the whole world to consult many history father and council to search into if the fabric of he body be not strong and healthful you will soon find he as thin as a piece of metaphysics and look as pierce as a school subtilty this sir could not be conveniently omit not only because many be very careless in this point and at a venture determine they young relation to learning : but because for the most part if amongst many there be but one of all the family that be weak and sickly that be languish and consumptive this of all the rest as count not fit for any coarse employment shall be pick out as a choice vessel for the church whereas most evidently he be much more able to dig daily in the mine than to set cross-legged musing upon he book i be very sensible how obvious it might be here to hint that this so curious and severe inquiry would much hinder the practice and abate the flourish of the university : as also there have be several and be still many live creature in the world who whilst young be of a very slow and meek apprehension have yet afterward cheer up into a great briskness and become master of much reason and other there have be who although force to a short continuance in the university and that ofttime interrupt by unavoidable service have yet by singular care and industry prove very famous in they generation and lastly some also of very feeble and crazy constitution in they childhood have out-study they distemper and have become very healthful and serviceable in the church as for the flourish sir of the university -- what have be before say aim not in the least at gentleman whose coming thither be chiefly for the hope of single -lrb- _ personal _ -rrb- improvement and whose estate do free they from the necessity of make a gain of art and science : but only at such as intend to make learn they profession as well as -lrb- they -rrb- accomplishment so that we school may be still as full of flourishing of fine clothes rich gown and future benefactor as ever and suppose we do imagine as it be necessary we should that the number should be a little lessen this surely will not abate the true splendor of a university in any man 's opinion but he who reckon the flourish thereof rather from the multitude of mere gown than from the ingenuity and learning of those that wear they : no more than we have reason to count the flourish of the church from that vast number of people that crowd into holy order rather than from those learn and useful person that defend she truth and manifest she way but i say i do not see any perfect necessity that we school should hereupon be thin and less frequent : have say nothing against the multitude but the _ indiscreet choice _ if therefore instead of such either of inferior part or a feeble constitution or of unable friend there be pick out those that be of a tolerable ingenuity -lrb- _ natural capacity _ -rrb- of a study-bearing body and have good hope of be continue as hence there be nothing to hinder we university from be full so likewise from be of great credit and learn not to deny then but that now and then there have be a lad of very submissive part and perhaps no great share of time allow he for he study who have prove beyond all expectation brave and glorious : yet surely we be not to over-reckon this so rare a hit as to think that one such prove lad should make recompense and satisfaction for those many weak one as the common people love to phrase they that be in the church and that no care ought to be take no choice make no maintenance provide or consider because -lrb- now and then in a age -rrb- one miraculously beyond all hope prove learn and useful be a practice whereby never greater mischief and disesteem have be bring upon the clergy i have in short sir run over what seem to I the first occasion of that small learning that be to be find amongst some of the clergy i shall now pass from schooling to the university i be not so unmindful of that devotion which i owe to those place nor of that great esteem i profess to have of the guide and governor thereof as to go about to prescribe new form and scheme of education where wisdom have lay she top-stone neither shall i here examine which philosophy the old or new make the best sermon it be hard to say that exhortation can be to _ no _ purpose if the preacher believe that the earth turn round or that he reproof can take _ no _ effect unless he will suppose a vacuum there have be good sermon no question make in the day of _ materia prima _ and occult quality : and there be doubtless still good discourse now under the reign of atom there be but two thing wherein i count the clergy chiefly concern as to university improvement that at present i shall make inquiry into and the first be this : whether or not it be not highly useful especially for the clergy who be suppose to speak english to the people that _ english exercise be impose upon lad _ if not in public school yet at least privately not but that i be abundantly satisfy that latin -lrb- o latin it be the all in all and the very cream of the jest -rrb- as also that oratory be the same in all language the same rule be observe the same method the same argument and art of persuasion : but yet it seem somewhat beyond the reach of ordinary youth so to apprehend those general law as to make a just and allowable use of they in all language unless exercise particularly in they now we know the language that the very learn part of this nation must trust to live by unless it be to make a bond -lrb- _ bandage _ -rrb- or prescribe a purge -lrb- which possibly may not oblige or work so well in any other language as latin -rrb- be the english : and after a lad have take he leave of madame university god bless he he be not likely to deal afterwards with much latin unless it be to checker -lrb- _ variegate _ -rrb- a sermon or to say _ salveto _ to some travel _ dominatio vestra _ neither be it enough to say that the english be the language with which we be swaddle and rock asleep and therefore there need none of this artificial and superadded care for there be those that speak very well plainly and to the purpose and yet write most pernicious and fantastical stuff : think that whatsoever be write must be more than ordinary must be beyond the guise -lrb- _ manner _ -rrb- of common speech must savor of reading and learn though it be altogether needless and perfectly ridiculous neither ought we to suppose it sufficient that english book be frequently read because there be of all sort good and bad and the worst be likely to be admire by youth more than the best : unless exercise be require of lad whereby it may be guess what they judgement be where they be mistaken and what author they propound to themselves for imitation for by this mean they may be correct and advise early accord as occasion shall require : which if not do they ill style will be so confirm they impropriety of speech will become so natural that it will be a very hard matter to stir or alter they fashion of write it be very curious to observe what delicate letter you young student write after they have get a little smack of university learning in what elaborate height and toss nonsense will they greet a right down english father or country friend if there be a plain word in it and such as be use at home this taste not say they of education among philosopher and be count damnable duncery and want of fancy because you loving friend or humble servant be a common phrase in country letter therefore the young epistler be yours to the antipode or at least to the center of the earth : and because ordinary folk love and respect you therefore you be to he a pole star a jacob 's staff a loadstone and a damask rise and the misery of it be that this pernicious accustomed way of expression do not only ofttimes go along with they to they benefice but accompany they to the very grave and for the most part a ordinary cheesemonger or plum-seller that scarce -lrb- ly -rrb- ever hear of a university shall write much better sense and more to the purpose than these young philosopher who injudiciously hunting only for great word make themselves learnedly ridiculous neither can it be easily apprehend how the use of english exercise should any way hinder the improvement in the latin tongue but rather be much to its advantage : and this may be easily believe consider what dainty stuff be usually produce for a latin entertainment chicken broth be not thinner than that which be commonly offer for a piece of most plead and convince sense for i will but suppose a academic youngster to be put upon a latin oration away he go presently to he magazine of collect phrase he pick out all the glittering he can find he haul in all proverb flower poetical snap -lrb- _ snatch _ -rrb- tale out of the _ dictionary _ or else ready latine to he hand out of lycosthene this do he come to the end of the table and have make a submissive leg -lrb- _ make a submissive bow _ -rrb- and a little admire -lrb- _ gaze at _ -rrb- the number and understanding countenance of he auditor : let the subject be what it will he fall presently into a most lamentable complaint of he insufficiency and tenuity -lrb- _ slenderness _ -rrb- that he poor thing have no acquaintance with above a muse and a half and that he never drink above six quart of helicon and you have put he here upon such a task -lrb- perhaps the business be only which be the nobler creature a flea or a louse -rrb- that would much better fit some old soaker at parnassus than he sip unexperienced bibbership alas poor child he be sorry at the very soul that he have no better speech and wonder in he heart that you will lose so much time as to hear he for he have neither squib nor firework star nor glory the cursed carrier lose he best book of phrase and the malicious mouse and rat eat up all he _ pearl _ and _ golden sentence _ then he tickle over a little the skirt of the business by and by for similitude from the sun and moon or if they be not at leisure from the grey-eyed morn or a shady grove or a purling stream this do he tell you that _ barnaby bright _ would be much too short for he to tell you all that he could say : and so fear he should break the thread of you patience he conclude now it seem sir very probable that if lad do but first of all determine in english what they intend to say in latin they would of themselves soon discern the triflingness of such apology the pitifulness of they matter and the impertinency of they tale and fancy : and would -lrb- accord to they subject age and part -rrb- offer that which would be much more manly and towards tolerable sense and if i may tell you sir what i really think most of that ridiculousness of those phantastical phrase harsh and sometimes blasphemous metaphor abundantly foppish similitude childish and empty transition and the like so commonly utter out of pulpit and so fatally redound to the discredit of the clergy may in a great measure be charge upon the want of that which we have here so much contend for the second inquiry that may be make be this : _ whether or not punning quibble and that which they call joque _ -lrb- joking -rrb- _ and such delicacy of wit _ highly admire in some academic exercise _ might not be very conveniently omit _ for one may desire but to know this one thing : in what profession shall that sort of wit prove of advantage as for law where nothing but the most reach subtility and the closest argue be allow of it be not to be imagine that blend now and then a piece of a dry verse and wreathing here and there a odd latin say into a dismal jingle should give title to a estate or clear out a obscure evidence and as little serviceable can it be to physic which be make up of severe reason and well try experiment and as for divinity in this place i shall say no more but that those usually that have be rope dancer in the school ofttime prove jack pudding in the pulpit for he that in he youth have allow himself this liberty of academic wit by this mean he have usually so thin he judgement become so prejudice against sober sense and so altogether dispose to trifling and jingle that so soon as he get hold of a text he presently think he have catch one of he old school question and so fall a fling it out of one hand into another toss it this way and that let it run a little upon the line then _ tanutus _ high jingo come again here catch at a word there lie nibble and suck at a _ and _ a _ by _ a _ qui _ or a _ quid _ a _ sic _ or a _ sicut _ and thus mince the text so small that he parishioner until he _ rendezvous _ -lrb- _ reassemble _ -rrb- it again can scarce tell what be become of it but shall we debar youth of such a innocent and harmless recreation of such a great quickener of part and promoter of sagacity as for the first its innocency of be allow of for a time i be so far from that persuasion that from what have be before hint i count it perfectly contagious and as a thing that for the most part infect the whole life and influence most action for he that find himself to have the right knack of let off a joque and of please the humster he be not only very hardly bring off from admire those goodly applause and heavenly shout but it be ten to one if he direct not the whole bent of he study to such idle and contemptible book as shall only furnish he with material for a laugh and so neglect all that should inform he judgement and reason and make he a man of sense and reputation in this world and as for the pretence of make people sagacious and pestilently witty i shall only desire that the nature of that kind of wit may be consider which will be find to depend upon some such foolery as these -- as first of all the lucky ambiguity of some word or sentence o what a happiness be it and how much do a youngster count himself beholden to the star that should help he to such a take jest and whereas there be so many thousand word in the world and that he should luck upon the right one that be so very much to he purpose and that at the explosion make such a goodly report or else they rake lilly 's _ grammar _ and if they can but find two or three letter of any name in any of the _ rule _ or _ example _ of that good man 's work it be as very a piece of wit as any have pass in the town since the king come in -lrb- 1660 -rrb- o how the freshman will skip to hear one of those line well laugh at that they have be so often yerked -lrb- _ chide _ -rrb- for it be true such thing as these go for wit so long as they continue in latin but what dismally shrimp thing would they appear if turn into english and if we search into what be or might be pretend we shall find the advantage of latin-wit to be very small and slender when it come into the world i mean not only among strict philosopher and man of mere notion or amongst all-damning and illiterate hector but amongst those that be truly ingenious and judicious master of fancy we shall find that a quotation out of _ qui mihi _ a axiom out of logic a say of a philosopher or the like though manage with some quickness and apply with some seeming ingenuity will not in we day pass or be accept for wit for we must know that as we be now in a age of great philosopher and man of reason so of great quickness and fancy and that greek and latin which heretofore -lrb- though never so impertinently fetch in -rrb- be count admirable because it have a learn twang yet now such stuff be out of fashion be esteem but very bad company for the world be now especially in discourse for one language and he that have somewhat in he mind of greek and latin be request now-a-day to be civil and translate it into english for the benefit of the company and he that have make it he whole business to accomplish himself for the applause of boy schoolmaster and the easiest of country divine and have be shoulder out of the cockpit for he wit : when he come into the world be the most likely person to be kick out of the company for he pedantry and overweening opinion of himself and be it necessary it be a easy matter to appeal to wit both ancient and modern that -lrb- beyond all controversy -rrb- have be sufficiently approve of that never i be confident receive they improvement by employ they time in pun and quibble there be the prodigious lucian the great don -lrb- _ quixote _ -rrb- of mancha and there be many now live wit of we own who never certainly be at all inspire from a _ tripus _ 's _ terras-filius _ 's or _ praevarecator _ 's speech i have venture sir thus far not to find fault with but only to inquire into a ancient custom or two of the university wherein the clergy seem to be a little concerned as to they education there i shall now look on they as beneficed and consider they preach wherein i pretend to give no rule have neither any gift at it nor authority to do it : but only shall make some conjecture at those useless and ridiculous thing commonly utter in pulpit that be generally disgusted -lrb- _ dislike _ -rrb- and be very apt to bring contempt upon the preacher and that religion which he profess amongst the first thing that seem to be useless may be reckon _ the high toss and swagger preach _ either mountingly eloquent or profoundly learn for there be a sort of divine who if they but happen of a unlucky hard word all the week they think themselves not careful of they flock if they lay it not up till Sunday and bestow it amongst they in they next preachment or if they light upon some difficult and obscure notion which they curiosity incline they to be better acquaint with how useless soever nothing so frequent as for they for a month or two month together to tear and tumble this doctrine and the poor people once a week shall come and gaze upon they by the hour until they preach themselves as they think into a right understanding those that be inclinable to make these useless speech to the people they do it for the most part upon one of these two consideration either out of simple phantastic glory and a great studiousness of be wonder at as if get into the pulpit be a kind of staging -lrb- _ act _ -rrb- where nothing be to be consider but how much the sermon take and how much stare at or else they do this to gain a respect and reverence from they people : who say they be to be puzzle now and then and carry into the cloud for if the minister 's word be such as the constable use he matter plain and practical such as come to the common market he may pass possibly for a honest and well-meaning man but by no means for any scholar whereas if he spring forth now and then in high rapture towards the uppermost heaven dash here and there a all-confounding word if he soar aloft in unintelligible huff preach point deep and mystical and deliver they as darkly and phantastically this be the way say they of be account a most able and learn instructor other there be whose part stand not so much towards tall word and lofty notion but consist in scatter up and down and besprinkle all they sermon with plenty of greek and latin and because st paul once or so be please to make use of a little heathen greek and that only when he have occasion to discourse with some of the learn one that well understand he : therefore must they need bring in twenty poet and philosopher if they can catch they into a hour 's talk -lrb- _ evidently the ordinary length of a sermon at this time see _ pp 259 313 -rrb- spread themselves in abundance of greek and latin to a company perhaps of farmer and shepherd neither will they rest there but have at the hebrew also not content themselves to tell the people in general that they have skill in the text and the exposition they offer agree with the original but must swagger also over the poor parishioner with the dreadful hebrew itself with they ben-israel ben-manass and many more ben that they be intimately acquaint with whereas there be nothing in the church or near it by a mile that understand they but god almighty whom it be suppose they go not about to inform or satisfy this learn way of talk though for the most part it be do merely out of ostentation : yet sometimes -lrb- which make not the case much better -rrb- it be do in compliment and civility to the all-wise patron or all-understanding justice of the peace in the parish who by the common farmer of the town must be think to understand the most intricate notion and the most difficult language now what a admirable thing this be suppose there should be one or so in the whole church that understand somewhat besides english : shall i not think that he understand that better must i -lrb- out of courtship to he worship and understanding and because perhaps i be to dine with he -rrb- prate abundance of such stuff which i must need know nobody understand or that will be the better for it but himself and perhaps scarcely he this i say because i certainly know several of that disposition : who if they chance to have a man of any learning or understand more than the rest in the parish preach wholly at he and level most of they discourse at he suppose capacity and the rest of the good people shall have only a handsome gaze or view of the parson as if plain word useful and intelligible instruction be not as good for a esquire or one that be in commission from the king as for he that hold the plough or mend hedge certainly he that consider the design of he office and have a conscience answerable to that holy undertaking must need conceive himself engage not only to mind this or that accomplished or well-dressed person but must have a universal care and regard of all he parish and as he must think himself bind not only to visit down bed and silken curtain but also flock and straw -lrb- _ mattress _ -rrb- if there be need : so ought he care to be as large to instruct the poor the weak and despicable part of he parish as those that sit in the best pew he that do otherwise think not at all of a man 's soul : but only accommodate himself to fine clothes a abundance of ribbon and the highest seat in the church not think that it will be as much to he reward in the next world by sober advice care and instruction to have save one that take collection -lrb- _ alms _ -rrb- as he that be able to relieve half the town it be very plain that neither we savior when he be upon earth and teach the world make any such distinction in he discourse what be more intelligible to all mankind than he _ sermon upon the mount _ neither do the apostle think of any such way i wonder whom they take for a pattern i will suppose once again that the design of these person be to gain glory : and i shall ask they can there be any greater in the world than do general good to omit future reward be it not always esteem of old that correct evil practice reduce people that live amiss be much better than make a high rant about a shuttlecock and talk _ tara-tantara _ about a feather or if they would be only admire then would i gladly have they consider what a thin and delicate kind of admiration be likely to be produce by that which be not at all understand certainly that man have a design of build up to himself real fame in good earnest by thing well lay and speak : he way to effect it be not by talk staringly and cast a mist before the people 's eye but by offer such thing by which he may be esteem with knowledge and understanding thus far concern hard word high notion and unprofitable quotation out of learn language i shall now consider such thing _ as be ridiculous _ that serve for chimney and market talk after the sermon be do and that do cause more immediately the preacher to be scorn and undervalue i have no reason sir to go about to determine what style or method be best for the improvement and advantage of _ all _ people for i question not but there have be as many several sort of preacher as orator and though very different yet useful and commendable in they kind tully take very deservedly with many seneca with other and cato no question say thing wisely and well so doubtless the same place of scripture may by several be variously consider : and although they method and style be altogether different yet they may all speak thing very convenient for the people to know and be advise of but yet certainly what be most undoubtedly useless and empty or what be judge absolutely ridiculous not by this or that curious or squeamish auditor but by every man in the corporation that understand but plain english and common sense ought to be avoid for all people be naturally bear with such a judgement of true and allowable rhetoric that be of what be decorous and convenient to be speak that whatever be grossly otherwise be usually ungrateful not only to the wise and skilful part of the congregation but shall seem also ridiculous to the very unlearned tradesman -lrb- _ mechanic _ -rrb- and they young apprentice amongst which may be chiefly reckon these follow _ harsh metaphor childish similitude _ and _ ill-applied tale _ the first main thing i say that make many sermon so ridicuous and the preacher of they so much disparaged and undervalue be _ a inconsiderate use of frightful metaphor _ : which make such a remarkable impression upon the ear and leave such a jarring twang behind they be oftentimes remember to the discredit of the minister as long as he continue in the parish i have hear the very child in the street and the little boy close about the fire refresh themselves strangely but with the repetition of a few of such far-fetched and odd sound expression tully therefore and caesar the two greatest master of roman eloquence be very wary and sparing of that sort of rhetoric we may read many a page in they work before we meet with any of those bear and if you do light upon one or so it shall not make you hair stand right up or put you into a fit of convulsion but it shall be so soft significant and familiar as if it be make for the very purpose but as for the common sort of people that be addict to this sort of expression in they discourse away presently to both the indy rake heaven and earth down to the bottom of the sea then tumble over all art and science ransack all shop and warehouse spare neither camp nor city but that they will have they so fond be such deceive one of these same gay word that they count all discourse empty dull and cloudy unless bespangled with these glittering nay so injudicious and impudent together will they sometimes be that the almighty himself be often in danger of be dishonour by these indiscreet and horrid metaphor-monger and when they thus blaspheme the god of heaven by such unhallowed expression to make amends they will put you in a as it be forsooth or as i may so say that be they will make bold to speak what they please concern god himself rather than omit what they judge though never so falsely to be witty and then they come in hobble with they lame submission and with they reverence be it speak : as if it be not much better to leave out what they foresee be likely to be interpret for blasphemy or at least great extravagancy than to utter that for which they own reason and conscience tell they they be bind to lay in beforehand a excuse to which may be further subjoin that metaphor though very apt and allowable be intelligible but to some sort of man of this or that kind of life of this or that profession for example perhaps one gentleman 's metaphorical knack of preaching come of the sea and then we shall hear of nothing but starboard and larboard of stem stern and forecastle and such salt-water language : so that one have need take a voyage to smyrna or aleppo and very warily attend to all the sailor ' term before i shall in the least understand my teacher now though such a sermon may possibly do some good in a coast town yet upward into the country in a inland parish it will do no more than syriac or arabic another he fall a fight with he text and make a pitched battle of it divide it into the right wing and leave wing then he _ rear _ it _ flank _ it _ intrench _ it _ storm _ it and then he _ muster _ all again to see what word be lose or lame in the skirmish : and so fall on again with fresh valor he fight backward and forward charge through and through rout kill take and then gentleman as you be now to such of he parish as have be in the late war this be not very formidable for they do but suppose themselves at edgehill or naseby and they be not much scare at he doctrine : but as for other who have not have such fight opportunity it be very lamentable to consider how shiver they sit without understand till the battle be over like instance might be easily give of many more discourse the metaphorical phrasing whereof depend upon peculiar art custom trade and profession make they useful and intelligible only to such who have be very well busy in such like employment another thing sir that bring great disrespect and mischief upon the clergy and that differ not much from what go immediately before be they _ pack they sermon so full of similitude _ which all the world know carry with they but very small force of argument unless there be _ a exact agreement with that which be compare _ of which there be very seldom any sufficient care take besides those that be addict to this slender way of discourse for the most part do so weaken and enfeeble they judgement by content themselves to understand by color feature and glimpse that they perfectly omit all the more profitable search into the nature and cause of thing themselves by which mean it necessarily come to pass that what they undertake to prove and clear out to the congregation must need be so faintly do and with such little force of argument that the conviction or persuasion will last no longer in the parishioner ' mind than the warmth of those similitude shall glow in they fancy so that he that have either be instruct in some part of he duty or excite to the performance of the same not by any judicious dependence of thing and lasting reason but by such faint and toyish evidence : he understanding upon all occasion will be as apt to be mislead as ever and he affection as troublesome and ungovernable but they be not so unserviceable as usually they be ridiculous for people of the weakest part be most commonly overborn with these foolery which together with the great difficulty of they be prudently manage must need occasion they for the most part to be very trifling and childish especially if we consider the choiceness of the author out of which they be furnish there be the never-to-be-commended-enough lycosthene there be also the admirable piece -lrb- by franci mere -rrb- call the _ second part of wit commonwealth _ -lrb- 1598 -rrb- : i pray mind it it be the _ second part _ and not the _ first _ and there be besides a book wholly consist of similitude -lrb- john spencer 's _ thing new and old or a storehouse of simily sentence allegory & c _ 1658 -rrb- apply and ready fit to most preach subject for the help of young beginner who sometimes will not make they hit handsomely it be very well know that such as be possess with a admiration of such eloquence think that they be very much encourage in they way by the scripture itself for say they do not we bless savior himself use many metaphor and many parable and do not he disciple follow he so excellent a example do the like and be not this not only warrant enough but near upon a command to we so to do if you please therefore we will see what we savior do in this case in _ st matthew _ he tell he disciple that they be the salt of the earth that they be the light of the world that they be a city set on a hill furthermore he tell he apostle that he send they forth as sheep in the midst of wolf and bid they therefore be as wise as serpent and harmless as dove now be not all these thing plain and familiar even almost to child themselves that can but taste and see and to man of the lowest education and meanest capacity i shall not here insist upon those special and admirable reason for which we savior make use of so many parable only thus much be needful to be say namely that they be very much mistaken that from hence think themselves tolerate to turn all the world into frivolous and abominable similitude as for we savior when he speak a parable he be please to go no further than the field the seashore a garden a vineyard or the like which be thing without the knowledge whereof scarcely any man can be suppose to live in this world but as for we metaphorical - and similitude-man of the pulpit these thing to they be too still and languid they do not rattle and rumble these lie too near home and within vulgar ken there be little on this side the moon that will content they up presently to the _ primum mobile _ and the trepidation of the firmament dive into the bowels and hide treasure of the earth despatch forthwith for peru and jamaica a town breed or country breed similitude be worth nothing it be report of a tree grow upon the bank of euphrate the great river euphrate that it bring forth a apple to the eye very fair and tempting but inwardly it be fill with nothing but useless and deceiving dust even so dust we be and to dust we must all go now what a lucky discovery be this that a man 's body should be so exactly like a apple and i will assure you that this be not think on till within these few year and i be afraid too he have a kind of a hint of this from another who have formerly find out that a man 's soul be like a oyster for say he in he prayer we soul be constantly gaping after thee o lord yea verily we soul do gape even as a oyster gapeth it seem pretty hard at first sight to bring into a sermon all the circle of the globe and all the frightful term of astronomy but i will assure you sir it be to be do because it have be but not by every bungler and ordinary text-divider but by a man of great cunning and experience there be a place in the prophet _ malachus _ where it will do very nicely and that be chapter iv ver 2 but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in he wing from which word in the first place it plainly appear that we savior pass through all the twelve sign of the zodiac and more than that too all prove by very apt and familiar place of scripture first then we savior be in _ aries _ or else what mean that of the psalmist the mountain skip like ram and the little hill like lamb and again that in second of the _ king _ chap iii ver 4 and mesha king of moab be a sheep master and render unto the king of israel a hundred thousand lamb and what follow and a hundred thousand ram with the wool mind it it be the king of israel in like manner be he in _ taurus psalm _ xxii 12 many bull have compass I strong bull of bashan have beset I round they be not ordinary bull they be _ compass _ bull they be _ beset _ bull they be _ strong bashan _ bull what need i speak of _ geminus _ surely you can not but remember esau and jacob _ genesis _ xxv 24 and when she day to be deliver be fulfil behold there be twin in she womb or of _ cancer _ when as the psalmist say so plainly what ail thee o thou sea that thou fleddest thou jordan that thou wast drive back nothing more plain it be as easy to shew the like in all the rest of the sign but instead of that i shall rather choose to make this one practical observation that the mercy of god to mankind in send he son into the world be a very _ signal _ mercy it be a _ zodiacal _ mercy i say it be truly zodiacal for christ keep within the tropics he go not out of the pale of the church but yet he be not always at the same distance from a believer sometimes he withdraw himself into the _ apogaeum _ of doubt sorrow and despair but then he come again into the _ perigaeum _ of joy content and assurance but as for heathen and unbeliever they be all arctic and antarctic reprobate now when such stuff as this as sometimes it be be vent in a poor parish where people can scarce tell what day of the month it be by the almanack how seasonable and savoury it be likely to be it seem also not very easy for a man in he sermon to learn -lrb- _ teach _ -rrb- he parishioner how to dissolve gold of what and how the stuff be make now to ring the bell and call the people on purpose together would be but a blunt business but to do it neatly and when nobody look for it that be the rarity and art of it suppose then that he take for he text that of _ st matthew _ repent ye for the kingdom of god be at hand now tell I sir do you not perceive the gold to be in a dismal fear to curl and quiver at the first reading of these word it must come in thus the blot and blur of we sin must be take out by the _ aqua-forti _ of we tear to which _ aqua-fortis _ if you put a fifth part of _ sal-ammoniac _ and set they in a gentle heat it make _ aqua-regia _ which dissolve gold and now it be out wonderful be the thing that be to be do by the help of metaphor and similitude and i will undertake that with a little more pain and consideration out of the very same word he could have teach the people how to make custard or marmalade or to stew prune but pray why the _ aqua-forti _ of tear for if it so fall out that there should chance to be neither apothecary nor druggist at church there be a excellent jest wholly lose now have he be so considerate as to have lay he wit in some more common and intelligible material for example have he say the blot of sin will be easily take out by the soap of sorrow and the fullers-earth of contrition then possibly the parson and the parish might all have admire one another for there be many a good-wife that understand very well all the intrigue of pepper salt and vinegar who know not anything of the all-powerfulness of _ aqua-forti _ how that it be such a spot-removing liquor i can not but consider with what understand the people sigh and cry when the minister make for they this metaphysical confession : omnipotent all thou art only because thou art all and because thou only art as for we we be not but we seem to be and only seem to be because we be not for we be but mite of entity and crumb of something and so on as if a company of country people be bind to understand suarez and all the school divine and as some be very high and learn in they attempt so other there be who be of somewhat too mean and dirty imagination such be he who go by the name of parson slipstocking who preach about the grace and assistance of god and that of ourselves we be able to do nothing advise he beloved to take he this plain similitude a father call he child to he say ` child pull off this stock ' the child mightily joyful that it should pull off father 's stock take hold of the stock and tug and pull and sweat but to no purpose : for stock stir not for it be but a child that pull then the father bid the child to rest a little and try again so then the child set on again tug again but no stock come : for child be but a child then the father take pity upon he child put he hand behind and slip down the stock and off come the stock then how do the child rejoice for child have pull off father 's stock alas poor child it be not child 's strength it be not child 's sweating that get off the stock but yet it be the father 's hand that slip down the stock even so -- not much unlike to this be he that preach about the sacrament and faith make christ a shopkeeper tell you that christ be a treasury of all wares and commodity and thereupon open he wide throat cry aloud good people what do you lack what do you buy will you buy any balm of gilead any eye salve any myrrh aloe or cassium shall i fit you with a robe of righteousness or with a white garment see here what be it you want here be a choice armoury shall i shew you a helmet of salvation a shield or breastplate of faith or will you please to walk in and see some precious stone a jasper a sapphire a chalcedony speak what do you buy now for my part i must need say -lrb- and i much fancy i speak the mind of thousand -rrb- that it have be much better for such a imprudent and ridiculous bawler as this to have be condemn to have cry oyster or broom than to discredit after this unsanctified rate he profession and we religion it would be a endless thing sir to count up to you all the folly for a hundred year last past that have be preach and print of this kind but yet i can not omit that of the famous divine in he time who advise the people in day of danger to run unto the lord tell they that they can not go to the lord much less run without foot that there be therefore two foot to run to the lord faith and prayer it be plain that faith be a foot for ` by faith we stand ' 2 _ cor _ i 24 therefore by faith we must run to the lord who be faithful the second be prayer a spiritual leg to bear we thither now that prayer be a spiritual leg appear from several place in scripture as from that of jonah speaking of _ come _ chap ii ver 7 ` and my prayer _ come _ unto thy holy temple ' and likewise from that of the apostle who say _ heb _ iv 16 ` let we therefore _ go _ unto the throne of grace ' both intimate that prayer be a spiritual leg : there be no _ come _ or _ go _ to the lord without the leg of prayer he further add now that these foot may be able to bear we thither we must put on the hose -lrb- _ stocking _ -rrb- of faith for the apostle say ` we foot must be shoe with the preparation of the gospel of peace ' the truth of it be the author be somewhat obscure : for at first faith be a foot and by-and-by it be a hose and at last it prove a shoe if he have please he could have make it anything neither can i let pass that of a later author who tell we it be goodness by which we must ascend to heaven and that goodness be the milky way to jupiter 's palace could not rest there but must tell we further that to strengthen we in we journey we must not take morning milk but some morning meditation : fear i suppose lest some people should mistake and think to go to heaven by eat now and then a mess of morning milk because the way be milky neither ought that to be omit not long since print upon those word of st john these thing write i unto you that ye sin not the observation be that it be the purpose of scripture to drive man from sin these scripture contain doctrine precept promise threatening and history now say he take these five smooth stone and put they into the scrip of the heart and throw they with the sling of faith by the hand of a strong resolution against the forehead of sin : and we shall see it like goliath fall before we but i shall not trouble you any further upon this subject : but if you have a mind to hear any more of this stuff i shall refer you to the learn and judicious author of the _ friendly debate _ -lrb- _ ie _ simon patrick afterwards bishop of ely who write _ a friendly debate between a conformist and a nonconformist _ in two part 1669 -rrb- : who particularly have at large discover the intolerable foolery of this way of talk i shall only add thus much that such as go about to fetch blood into they pale and lean discourse by the help of they brisk and sparkling similitude ought well to consider whether they similitude be true i be confident sir you have hear it many and many a time or if need be i can shew you it in a book that when the preacher happen to talk how that the thing here below will not satisfy the mind of man then come in the round world which can not fill the triangular heart of man whereas every butcher know that the heart be no more triangular than a ordinary pear or a child 's top but because _ triangular _ be a hard word and perhaps a jest therefore people have steal it one from another these two or three hundred year and for aught i know much longer for i can not direct to the first inventor of the fancy in like manner they be to consider what thing either in the heaven or belong to the earth have be find out by experience to contradict what have be formerly allow of thus because some ancient astronomer have observe that both the distance as well as the revolution of the planet be in some proportion or harmony one to another : therefore people that abound with more imagination than skill presently fancy the moon mercury and venus to be a kind of violin or treble to jupiter or saturn that the sun and mar supply the room of tenor and the _ primum mobile _ run division all the tune so that one could scarce hear a sermon but they must give you a touch of the harmony of the sphere thus sir you shall have they take that of st paul about faith hope and charity and instead of a sober instruct of the people in those eminent and excellent grace they shall only ring you over a few change upon the three word cry faith hope and charity hope faith and charity and so on : and when they have do they peal they shall tell you that this be much better than the harmony of the sphere at other time i have hear a long chime only between two word as suppose divinity and philosophy or revelation and reason setting forth with revelation first revelation be a lady reason a handmaid revelation be the esquire reason the page revelation be the sun reason but the moon revelation be manna reason be but a acorn revelation a wedge of gold reason a small piece of silver then by and by reason get it and lead it away reason indeed be very good but revelation be much better reason be a councillor but revelation be the lawgiver reason be a candle but revelation be the snuffer certainly those people be possess with a very great degree of dulness who live under the means of such enlighten preach should not be mightily settle in the right notion and true bound of faith and reason no less ably methought be the difference between the old covenant and the new lately determine the old covenant be of work the new covenant of faith the old covenant be by mose the new by christ the old be heretofore the new afterwards the old be first the new be second old thing be pass away : behold all thing be become new and so the business be very fundamentally do i shall say no more upon this subject but this one thing which relate to what be say a little before he that have get a set of similitude calculate accord to the old philosophy and ptolemy 's system of the world must burn he commonplace book and go a-gleaning for new one it be nowadays much more gentle and warrantable to take a similitude from the man in the moon than from _ solid _ orb : for though few people do absolutely believe that there be any such eminent person there yet the thing be possible whereas the other be not i have now do sir with that imprudent way of speaking by metaphor and simile there be many other thing commonly speak out of the pulpit that be much to the disadvantage and discredit of the clergy that ought also to be briefly hint and that i may the better light upon they i shall observe they _ common method of preach _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- before the text be divide a _ preface _ be to be make and it be a great chance if first of all the minister do not make he text to be _ like something or other _ for example one he tell you and now methink my text like a ingenious -lrb- _ clever _ -rrb- picture look upon all here present : in which both noble and people may behold they sin and danger represent this be a text out of _ hosea _ now have it be out of any other place of the _ bible _ the gentleman be sufficiently resolve to make it like a ingenious picture another take perhaps the very same word say i might compare my text to the mountain of bether where the lord disport himself like a young hart or a pleasant roe among the spice another man 's text be like the rod of mose to divide the wave of sorrow or like the mantle of elijah to restrain the swell flood of grief another get to he text thus as solomon go up six step to come to the great throne of ivory so must i ascend six degree to come to the high top-meaning of my text another thus as deborah arise and go with barak to kadesh so if you will go with he and call in the third verse of the chapter he will shew you the meaning of he text another he fancy he text to be extraordinarily like to a orchard of pomegranate or like st matthew sit at the receipt of custom or like the dive that noah send out of the ark i believe there be above forty place of scripture that have be like rachel and leah : and there be one in _ genesis _ as i well remember that be like a pair of compass stradle and if i be not much mistaken there be one somewhere else that be like a man go to jericho now sir have thus make the way to the text as smooth and plain as anything with a _ preface _ perhaps from adam though he business lie at the other end of the _ bible _ : in the next place -lrb- 2 -rrb- he come to _ divide the text _ _ hic labor hoc opus per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum silvestrem tenuus _ now come off the glove and the hand be well chafe -lrb- _ rub together _ -rrb- he shrink up he shoulder and stretch forth himself as if he be go to cleave a bullock 's head or rive the body of a oak but we must observe that there be a great difference of text for all text come not asunder alike for sometimes the word naturally _ fall _ asunder sometimes they _ drop _ asunder sometimes they _ melt _ sometimes they _ untwist _ and there be some word so willing to be part that they _ divide themselves _ to the great ease and rejoicing of the minister but if they will not easily come to piece then he fall to hacking and hew as if he would make all fly into shiver the truth of it be i have know now and then some knotty text that have be divide seven or eight time over before they could make they _ split _ handsomely accord to they mind but then come the joy of joy when the part jingle or begin with the same letter and especially if in latin o how it tickle the divider when he get he text into those two excellent branch _ accusatio vera : comminatio severa _ : a charge full of verity : a discharge of severity and i will warrant you that do not please a little viz there be in the word _ duplex miraculum miraculum in modo _ and _ miraculum in nodo _ but the luckiest i have meet withal both for wit and keep of the letter be upon these word of _ st matthew _ xii 43 44 45 : when the unclean spirit be go out of a man he walketh through dry place seek rest and finding none then he saith i will return & c in which word all these strange thing be find out first there be a _ captain _ and a _ castle _ -lrb- do you see sir the same letter -rrb- then there be a _ ingress _ a _ egress _ and a _ regress _ or _ reingress _ then there be _ unroosting _ and _ unresting _ then there be _ number _ and _ name manner _ and _ measure trouble _ and _ trial resolution _ and _ revolution assault _ and _ assassination voidness _ and _ vacuity _ this be do at the same time by the same man but to confess the truth of it it be a good long text and so he have the greater advantage but for a short text that certainly be the greatest _ break _ that ever be which be occasion from those word of _ st luke _ xxiii 28 weep not for I weep for yourselve or as some read it but weep for yourselve it be a plain case sir here be but eight word and the business be cunningly order that there spring out eight part here be say the doctor eight word and eight part 1 weep not 2 but weep 3 weep not but weep 4 weep for I 5 for yourselve 6 for I for yourselve 7 weep not for I 8 but weep for yourselve that be to say north north-and-by-east north-north-east north-east and by north north-east north-east and by east east-north-east east and by north east now it seem not very easy to determine who have oblige the world most he that find out the compass or he that divide the fore-mentioned text but i suppose the crack -lrb- _ clap _ -rrb- will go generally upon the doctor 's side by reason what he do be do by undoubted art and absolute industry : but as for the other the common report be that it be find out by mere foolish fortune well let it go how it will questionless they will be both famous in they way and honourably mention to posterity neither ought he to be altogether slight who take that of _ genesis _ xlviii 2 for he text viz and one tell jacob and say ` behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee ' presently perceive and make it out to he people that he text be a spiritual dial for say he here be in my text twelve word which do plainly represent the twelve hour _ and one tell jacob and say ` thy son joseph cometh unto thee ' _ and here be besides _ behold _ which be the hand of the dial that turn and point at every word of the text _ and one tell jacob and say ` behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee ' _ for it be not say _ behold jacob _ or _ behold joseph _ but it be _ and one tell jacob and say behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee _ that it be say behold _ and _ behold _ one _ behold _ tell _ behold _ jacob _ again behold _ and _ behold _ say _ and also behold _ behold _ & c which be the reason that this word _ behold _ be place in the middle of the other twelve word indifferently point to each word now as it need must be one of the clock before it can be two or three so i shall handle this word _ and _ the first word of the text before i meddle with the following and _ one tell jacob _ the word _ and _ be but a particle and a small one : but small thing be not to be despise _ st matthew _ xviii 10 _ take heed that you despise not one of these little one _ for this _ and _ be as the tack and loop amongst the curtain of the tabernacle the tack put into the loop do couple the curtain of the tent and sew the tent together : so this particle _ and _ be put into the loop of the word immediately before the text do couple the text to the foregoing verse and sew they close together i shall not trouble you sir with the rest : be much after this witty rate and to as much purpose but we will go on if you please sir to -lrb- 3 -rrb- the cunning _ observation doctrine and inference _ that be commonly make and raise from place of scripture one take that for he text _ psalm _ lxviii 3 _ but let the righteous be glad _ from whence he raise this doctrine that there be a spirit of singularity in the saint of god : but let the righteous -- a doctrine i will warrant he of he own raise it be not very easy for anybody to prevent he another he take that of _ isaiah _ xli 14 15 _ fear not thou worm jacob _ & c _ thou shalt thresh the mountain _ whence he observe that the worm jacob be a threshing worm another that of _ genesis _ xliv 1 _ and he command the steward of the house say fill the man 's sack with food as much as they can carry _ : and make this note from the word that great sack and many sack will hold more than few sack and little one for look say he how they come prepare with sack and beast so they be send back with corn the greater and the more sack they have prepare the more corn they carry away if they have prepare but small sack and a few they have carry away the less verily and indeed extraordinarily true another he fall upon that of _ isaiah _ lviii 5 _ be it such a fast that i have choose a day for a man to afflict he soul be it to bow down he head like a bulrush _ the observation be that repentance for a hour or a day be not worth a bulrush and there i think he hit the business but of these sir i can shew you a whole book full in a treatise call _ flame and discovery _ consist of very notable and extraordinary thing which the inquisitive author have privately observe and discover upon read the evangelist as for example : upon read that of _ st john _ chapter ii verse 15 _ and when he have make a scourge of small cord he drive they all out of the temple _ this prying divine make these discovery i discover say he in the first place that in the church or temple a scourge may be make _ and when he have make a scourge _ secondly that it may be make use of _ he drive they all out of the temple _ and it be a great chance that he have not discover a third thing and that be that the scourge be make before it be make use of upon _ matthew _ iv 25 _ and there follow he great multitude of people from galilee _ i discover say he when jesus prevail with we we shall soon leave we galilee i discover also say he a great miracle viz : that the way after jesus be straight that such a multitude should follow he _ matthew _ v 1 _ and see the multitude he go up into a mountain _ upon this he discover several very remarkable thing first he discover that christ go _ from the multitude _ secondly that it be safe to take warning at we eye for _ see the multitude he go up _ thirdly it be not fit to be always upon the plain and flat with the multitude : but _ if we be rise with christ to seek those thing that be above _ he discover also very strange thing from the latter part of the fore-mentioned verse _ and when he be set he disciple come unto he _ 1 christ be not always in motion _ and when he be set _ 2 he walk not on the mountain but sit _ and when he be set _ from whence also in the third place he advise people that when they be teach they should not move too much for that be to be _ carry to and fro with every wind of doctrine _ now certainly never be this place of scripture more seasonably bring in now sir if you be for a very short and witty discovery let it be upon that of _ st matthew _ vi 27 _ which of you by take thought can add one cubit unto he stature _ the discovery be this that whilst the disciple be take think for a cubit christ take they down a cubit lower notable also be two discovery make upon _ st matthew _ viii 1 1 that christ go down as well as go up _ when he come down from the mountain _ 2 that the multitude do not go ` hail fellow well meet ' with he nor before he _ for great multitude follow he _ i love with all my heart when people can prove what they say for there be many that will talk of they discovery and spiritual observation and when all come to all they be nothing but pitiful guess and slender conjecture in like manner that be no contemptible discovery that be make upon _ st matthew _ viii 19 _ and a certain scribe come and say master i will follow thee wheresoever thou goest _ a _ thou _ shall be follow more than a _ that _ _ i will follow _ thee _ wheresoever thou goest _ and in my opinion that be not altogether amiss upon _ st matthew _ xi 2 _ now when john have hear in prison the work of christ he send two of he disciple _ the discovery be this that it be not good send single to christ _ he send two of he disciple _ some also possibly may not dislike that upon _ st luke _ xii 35 _ let you loin be gird _ i discover say he there must be a holy gird and truss up for heaven but i shall end all with that very politic one that he make upon _ st matthew _ xii 47 _ then say one unto he behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desire to speak with thee but he answer and say who be my mother and who be my brethren _ i discover now say he that jesus be upon business doubtless this be one of the greatest discoverer of hidden mystery and one of the most pryer into spiritual secret that ever the world be owner of it be very well that he happen upon the godly calling and no secular employment : or else in good truth down have they all go turk pope and emperor for he would have discover they one way or another every man not much unlike to these wonderful discoverer be they who choose to preach on some point in divinity shall purposely avoid all such plain text as might give they very just occasion to discourse upon they intended subject and shall pitch upon some other place of scripture which no creature in the world but themselves do ever imagine that which they offer to be therein design my meaning sir be this suppose you have a mind to make a sermon concern episcopacy as in the late time -lrb- _ the commonwealth _ -rrb- there be several occasion for it you must by no means take any place of scripture that prove or favor that kind of ecclesiastical government for then the plot will be discover and the people will say to themselves we know where to find you you intend to preach about episcopacy but you must take _ act _ chapter xvi verse 30 _ sir what must i do to be save _ a absolute place for episcopacy that all former divine have idly overlook for _ sir _ be in the greek -lrb- greek : kurious -rrb- which be to say in true and strict translation _ lord _ what be more plain than that of old episcopacy be not only the acknowledged government but that bishop be formerly peer of the realm and so ought to sit in the house of lord or suppose that you have a mind to commend to you people kingly government : you must not take any place that be plainly to the purpose but ' that of the evangelist _ seek first the kingdom of god _ from which word the doctrine will plainly be that monarchy or kingly government be most accord to the mind of god for it be not say seek the _ parliament _ of god the _ army _ of god or the _ committee of safety _ of god but it be seek the _ kingdom _ of god and who could expect less immediately after this -lrb- _ ie this argument _ -rrb- the king come in and the bishop be restore -lrb- 1660 ad -rrb- again sir -lrb- because i would willingly be understand -rrb- suppose you design to preach about election and reprobation as for the eighth chapter to the _ roman _ that be too well know but there be a little private place in the _ psalm _ that will do the business as well psalm xc 19 _ in the multitude of my thought within I thy comfort delight my soul _ the doctrine which naturally flow from the word will be that amongst _ the multitude of thought _ there be a great thought of election and reprobation and then away with the point accord as the preacher be inclined or suppose lastly that you be not fully satisfied that plurality be lawful or convenient may i be so bold sir i pray what text would you choose to preach up against non-resident certainly nothing ever be better pick than that of _ st matthew _ i 2 _ abraham begat isaac _ a clear place against non-resident for have abraham not reside but have discontinue from sarah he wife he could never have beget isaac but it be high time sir to make a end of they preach lest you be as much tire with the repetition of it as the people be little benefit when they hear it i shall only mind you sir of one thing more and that be -lrb- 4 -rrb- the ridiculous senseless and unintended use which many of they make of _ concordance _ i shall give you but one instance of it although i could furnish you with a hundred print one the text sir be this _ galatian _ vi 15 _ for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avail anything but a new creature _ now all the world know the meaning of this to be that let a man be of what nation he will jew or gentile if he amend he life and walk accord to the gospel he shall be accept with god but this be not the way that please they they must bring into the sermon to no purpose at all a vast heap of place of scripture which the _ concordance _ will furnish they with where the word _ new _ be mention and the observation must be that god be for _ new _ thing god be for _ a _ new _ creature st john _ xix 41 _ now in the place when he be crucify there be a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein be never man yet lay there they lay jesus _ and again _ st mark _ xvi 17 christ tell he disciple that they that be true believer shall cast out devil and speak _ with _ new _ tongue _ and likewise the prophet teach we _ isaiah _ xlii 10 _ sing unto the lord a new song and he praise to the end of the earth _ whence it be plain that christ be not for _ old _ thing he be not for a _ old sepulchre _ he be not for _ old tongue _ he be not for a _ old song _ he be not for a _ old creature _ christ be for a _ new creature circumcision and uncircumcision availeth nothing but a new creature _ and what do we read concern samson _ judge _ xv 15 be it not that he slew a thousand of the philistine with one _ new _ jawbone a _ old _ one might have kill its ten its twenty its hundred but it must be a _ new _ jawbone that be able to kill a thousand god be for the _ new creature _ but may not some say ` be god altogether for new thing ' how come it about then that the prophet say _ isaiah _ i 13 14 _ bring no more vain oblation & c you new moon and you appoint feast my soul hateth _ and again what mean that _ deuteronomy _ xxxii 17 19 _ they sacrifice unto devil and to new god whom they know not to new god that come newly up and when the lord see it he abhor they _ to which i answer that god indeed be not for _ new moon _ nor for _ new god _ but except _ moon _ and _ god _ he be for the _ new creature _ it be possible sir that somebody besides yourself may be so vain as to read this _ letter _ : and they may perhaps tell you that there be no such silly and useless people as i have describe and if there be there be not above two or three in a country -lrb- _ county _ -rrb- or should there be it be no such complain matter : see that the same happen in other profession in law and physic : in both -lrb- of -rrb- which there be many a contemptible creature such therefore as these may be please to know that if there have be need i could have tell they either the book -lrb- and very page almost -rrb- of all that have be speak about preach or else the when and where and the person that preach it as to the second viz : that the clergy be all mightily furnish with learning and prudence except ten twenty or so i shall not say anything myself because a very great scholar of we nation shall speak for I : who tell we that such preach as be usual be a hindrance of salvation rather than the means to it and what he intend by usual i shall not here go about to explain and as to the last i shall also in short answer that if the advancement of true religion and the eternal salvation of a man be no more considerable than the health of he body and the security of he estate we need not be more solicitous about the learning and prudence of the clergy than of the lawyer and physician but we believe it to be otherwise surely we ought to be more concerned for the reputation and success of the one than of the other i come now sir to the second part that be design viz : _ the poverty of some of the clergy _ by whose mean condition they sacred profession be much disparaged and they doctrine undervalue what large provision of old god be please to make for the priesthood and upon what reason be easily see to any one that but look into the _ bible _ the levite it be true be leave out in the division of the inheritance not to they loss but to they great temporal advantage for whereas have they be common sharer with the rest a twelfth part only would have be they just allowance god be please to settle upon they a tenth and that without any trouble or charge of tillage : which make they portion much more considerable than the rest and as this provision be very bountiful so the reason no question be very divine and substantial : which seem chiefly to be these two first that the priesthood might be altogether at leisure for the service of god : and that they of that holy order might not be distract with the care of the world and interrupt by every neighbor 's horse or cow that break they hedge or shackle -lrb- _ or hobble feed among _ -rrb- they corn but that live a kind of spiritual life and be remove a little from all worldly affair they might always be fit to receive holy inspiration and always ready to search out the mind of god and to advise and direct the people therein not as if this divine exemption of they from the common trouble and care of this life be intend as a opportunity of luxury and laziness : for certainly there be a labor besides digging and there be a true carefulness without follow the plough and look after they cattle and such be the employment of those holy man of old they care and business be to please god and to charge themselves with the welfare of all he people : which thing he that do it with a good and satisfied conscience i will assure he have a task upon he much beyond they that have for they care they hundred of ox and five hundred of sheep another reason that this large allowance be make to the priest be that they might be enable to relieve the poor to entertain stranger and thereby to encourage people in the way of godliness for they be in a peculiar manner the servant of god god be please to entrust in they hand a portion more than ordinary of the good thing of the land as the safest storehouse and treasury for such as be in need that in all age therefore there should be a continued tolerable maintenance for the clergy : the same reason as well as many other make we think to be very necessary unless they will count money and victuals to be only type and shadow and so to cease with the ceremonial law for where the minister be pinch as to the tolerable convenience of this life the chief of he care and time must be spend not in a impertinent -lrb- _ trifling _ -rrb- consider what text of scripture will be most useful for he parish what instruction most seasonable and what author best to be consult : but the chief of he thought and he main business must be how to live that week where he shall have bread for he family whose sow have lately pig whence will come the next rejoice goose or the next cheerful basket of apple how far to lamma or -lrb- easter -rrb- offering when shall we have another christen and cake and who be likely to marry or die these be very seasonable consideration and worthy of a man 's thought for a family can not be maintain by text and context and a child that lie cry in the cradle will not be satisfy without a little milk and perhaps sugar though there be a small german _ system _ -lrb- _ of divinity _ -rrb- in the house but suppose he do get into a little hole over the oven with a lock to it call he study towards the latter end of the week : for you must know sir there be very few text of scripture that can be divide at soonest before Friday night and some there be that will never be divide but upon Sunday morning and that not very early but either a little before they go or in the go to church i say suppose the gentleman get thus into he study one may very nearly guess what be he first thought when he come there -- viz that the last kilderkin of drink be nearly depart that he have but one poor single groat in the house and there be judgement and execution ready to come out against it for milk and egg now sir can any man think that one thus rack and tortured can be seriously intent half a hour to contrive anything that might be of real advantage to he people besides perhaps that week he have meet with some dismal cross and most undoing misfortune there be a scurvy-conditioned mole that break into he pasture and plough up the best part of he glebe and a little after that come a couple of spiteful ill-favoured crow and trample down the little remain grass another day have but four chicken sweep come the kite and carry away the fattest and hopefullest of the brood then after all this come the jackdaw and starling -lrb- idle bird that they be -rrb- and they scatter and carry away from he thin thatched house forty or fifty of the best straw and to make he completely unhappy after all these affliction another day that he have a pair of breeches on come over a perverse stile he suffer very much in carelessly lift over he leg now what parish can be so inconsiderate and unreasonable as to look for anything from one whose fancy be thus check and whose understanding be thus ruffle and disorder they may as soon expect comfort and consolation from he that lie rack with the gout and the stone as from a divine thus break and shatter in he fortune but we will grant that he meet not with any of these such frightful disaster but that he go into he study with a mind as calm as the evening for all that upon Sunday we must be content with what god shall please to send we for as for book he be for want of money so moderately furnish that except it be a small geneva _ bible _ -lrb- so small as it will not be desire to lie open of itself -rrb- together with a certain _ concordance _ thereunto belong as also a latin book for all kind of latin sentence call _ polyanthaea _ with some _ exposition _ upon the _ catechism _ a portion of which be to be get by heart and to be put off for he own and perhaps mr -lrb- joseph -rrb- caryl _ upon _ -lrb- john -rrb- pineda -lrb- _ these two author write vast commentary on the book of job _ -rrb- mr -lrb- john -rrb- dod upon the _ commandment _ mr -lrb- samuel -rrb- clarke 's life of famous man both in church and state -lrb- such as mr carter of norwich that use to eat such abundance of pudding -rrb- : besides i say these there be scarcely anything to be find but a budget of old stitch sermon hang up behind the door with a few broken girth two or three yard of whipcord and perhaps a saw and a hammer to prevent dilapidation now what may not a divine do though but of ordinary part and unhappy education with such learn help and assistance as these no vice surely dare stand before he no heresy affront he and furthermore sir it be to be consider that he that be but thus meanly provide for : it be not he only infelicity that he have neither time mind nor book to improve himself for the inward benefit and satisfaction of he people but also that he be not capable of do that outward good amongst the needy which be a great ornament to that holy profession and a considerable advantage towards the have the doctrine believe and practice in a degenerate world and that which augment the misery whether he be able or not it be expect from he if there come a _ brief _ to town for the minister to cast in he mite will not satisfy unless he can create sixpence or a shilling to put into the box for a stale -lrb- _ lure _ -rrb- to decoy in the rest of the parish nay he that have but # 20 or # 30 -lrb- = # 60 to # 90 _ now _ -rrb- _ per annum _ if he bid not up as high as the best in the parish in all act of charity he be count carnal and earthly-minded only because he dare not coin and can not work miracle and let there come ever so many beggar half of these i will secure you shall presently inquire for the minister 's house for god say they certainly dwell there and have lay up for we sufficient relief i know many of the laity be usually so extremely tender of the spiritual welfare of the clergy that they be apt to wish they but very small temporal goods lest they inward state should be in danger a thing they need not much fear since that effectual humiliation by henry viii for say they the great tithe large glebe good victuals and warm clothes do but puff up the priest make he fat foggy and useless and fill he with pride vainglory and all kind of inward wickedness and pernicious corruption we see this plain say they in the whore of babylon -lrb- _ roman catholic church _ -rrb- to what a degree of luxury and intemperance besides a great deal of false doctrine have riches and honor raise up that strumpet how do she strut it and swagger it over all the world terrifying prince and despise king and emperor the clergy if ever we would expect any edification from they ought to be diet and keep low to be meek and humble quiet and stand in need of a pot of milk from they next neighbor and always be very loth to ask for they very right for fear of make any disturbance in the parish or seem to understand or have any respect for this vile and outward world under the law indeed in those old time of darkaess and eat the priest have they first and second dish they milk and honey they manna and quail also they outward and inward vestment : but now under the gospel and in time of light and fast a much more spare diet be fitter and a single coat -lrb- though it be never so ancient and thin -rrb- be fully sufficient we must look say they if we would be the better for they for a hardy and labor clergy that be mortify to -lrb- the possession of -rrb- a horse and all such pampering vanity and that can foot it five or six mile in the dirt and preach till starlight for as many -lrb- 5 _ or _ 6 -rrb- shilling as also a sober and temperate clergy that will not eat so much as the laity but that the least pig the least sheaf and the least of everything may satisfy they spiritualship and besides a money-renouncing clergy that can abstain from see a penny a month together unless it be when the collector and visitationer come these be all gospel dispensation and great instance of patience contentedness and resignation of affection -lrb- in respect -rrb- to all the emptiness and foolery of this life but can not a clergyman choose rather to lie upon feather than a hurdle but he must be idle soft and effeminate may he not desire wholesome food and fresh drink unless he be a cheat a hypocrite and a impostor and must he need be void of all grace though he have a shilling in he purse after the rate be cross -lrb- off -rrb- and full of pride and vanity though he house stand not upon crutch and though he chimney be to be see a foot above the thatch o how prettily and temperately may half a score of child be maintain with _ almost _ # 20 -lrb- = # 60 _ now _ -rrb- _ per annum _ what a handsome shift a poor ingenious and frugal divine will make to take it by turn and wear a cassock -lrb- _ a long cloak _ -rrb- one year and a pair of breeches another what a become thing be it for he that serve at the altar to fill the dung cart in dry weather and to heat the oven and pull -lrb- _ strip _ -rrb- hemp in wet and what a pleasant thing be it to see the man of god fetch up he single melancholy cow from a small rib -lrb- _ strip _ -rrb- of land that be scarcely to be find without a guide or to be seat upon a soft and well grind pouch -lrb- _ bag _ -rrb- of meal or to be plant upon a pannier with a pair of goose or turkey bob out they head from under he canonical coat as you can not but remember the man sir that be thus accomplish or to find he rave about the yard or keep he chamber close because the duck lately miscarry of a egg or that the never-failing hen have unhappily forsake she wonted nest and now shall we think that such employment as these can any way consist with due reverence or tolerable respect from a parish and he speak altogether at a venture that say that this be false or at least it need not be so notwithstanding the mean condition of some of the clergy for let any one make it out to I which way be it possible that a man shall be able to maintain perhaps eight or ten in he family with # 20 or # 30 _ per annum _ without a intolerable dependence upon he parish and without commit himself to such vileness as will in all likelihood render he contemptible to he people now where the income be so pitifully small -lrb- which i will assure you be the portion of hundred of the clergy of this nation -rrb- which way shall he manage it for the subsistence of himself and he family if he keep the glebe in he own hand -lrb- which he may easily do almost in the hollow of it -rrb- what increase can he expect from a couple of apple tree a brood of duckling a hemp land and as much pasture as be just able to summer a cow as for he tithe he either rent they out to a layman who will be very unwilling to be he tenant unless he may be sure to save by the bargain at least a third part : or else he compound for they and then as for he money he shall have it when all the rest of the world be pay but if he think fit to take he due in kind he then either demand he true and utmost right and if so it be a great hazard if he be not count a caterpillar a muck worm a very earthly mind man and too much sight into this lower world which be make as many of the laity think altogether for themselves : or else he must tamely commit himself to that little dose of the creature that shall be please to be proportion out unto he choose rather to starve in peace and quietness than to gain he right by noise and disturbance the best of all these way that a clergyman shall think fit for he preferment to be manage -lrb- where it be so small -rrb- be such as will undoubtedly make he either to be hate and revile or else pitifully poor and disesteemed but have it not go very hard in all age with the man of god be not we lord and master we great and high priest and be not he fare low and he life full of trouble and be not the condition of most of he disciple very mean be not they notably pinch and severely treat after he and be it not the duty of every christian to imitate such holy pattern but especially of the clergy who be to be shine light and visible example and therefore to be satisfy with a very little morsel and to renounce ten time as much of the world as other people and be not patience better than the great tithe and contentedness to be prefer before large fee and custom be there any comparison between the expectation of a cringe bow or a low hat and mortification to all such vanity and foppery especially with those who in a peculiar manner hope to receive they inheritance and make they harvest in the next life this be well think of indeed but for all that if you please sir we will consider a little some of those remarkable inconvenience that do most undoubtedly attend upon the minister be so meanly provide for first of all the holy man of god or the ministry in general hereby be disesteemed and render of small account for though they be call man of god : yet when it be observe that god seem to take but little care of they in make they tolerable provision for this life or that man be suffer to take away that which god be please to provide for they the people be presently apt to think that they belong to god no more than ordinary folk if so much and although it be not to be question but that the lay on of hand be a most divine institution : yet it be not all the bishop ' hand in the world lay upon a man if he be either notoriously ignorant or dismally poor that can procure he any hearty and lasting respect for though we find that some of the disciple of christ that carry on and establish the great design of the gospel be person of ordinary employment and education : yet we see little reason to think that miracle should be continue to do that which natural endeavor assist by the spirit of god be able to perform and if christ be still upon earth to make bread for such as be he peculiar servant and declarer of he mind and doctrine the laity if they please should eat up all the corn themselves as well the tenth sheaf as the other : but see it be otherwise and that that miraculous power be not leave to the succeed clergy for they to beg they bread or depend for they subsistence upon the good pleasure and humor of they parish be a thing that render that holy office very much slight and disregard that constitution therefore of we church be a most prudent design that say that all who be ordain shall be ordain to somewhat not ordain at random to preach in general to the whole world as they travel up and down the road but to this or that particular parish and no question the reason be to prevent spiritual peddling and gad up and down the country with a bag of trifling and insignificant sermon inquire who will buy any doctrine so that no more might be receive into holy order than the church have provision for but so very little be this regard that if a young divinity intender have but get a sermon of he own or of he father 's although he know not where to get a meal 's meat or one penny of money by he preaching : yet he get a qualification from some beneficed man or other who perhaps be no more able to keep a curate than i be to keep ten footboy and so he be make a preacher and upon this account i have know a ordinary divine whose living would but just keep himself and he family from melancholy and despair shroud under he protection as many curate as the best nobleman in the land have chaplain -lrb- _ ie eight _ -rrb- now many such as these go into order against the sky fall foresee no more likelihood of any preferment come to they than you or i do of be secretary of state now so often as any such as these for want of maintenance be put to any unworthy and disgraceful shift this reflect disparagement upon all that order of holy man and we must have a great care of compare we small preferred clergy with those but of the like fortune in the church of rome : they have many art and device of gain respect and reverence to they office which we count neither just nor warrantable we design no more than to be in a likely capacity of do good and not discrediting we religion nor suffer the gospel to be disesteem : but they aim be clearly not only by cheat contrived tale and feigned miracle to get money in abundance but to be worship and almost deify be as little as they will content themselves withal for how can it be but that the people belong to a church wherein the supreme governor be believe never to err -lrb- either purely by virtue of he own single wisdom or by help of he inspiring chair or by the assistance of he little infallible cardinal for it matter not where the root of not be mistaken lie -rrb- : i say how can it be but that all that be believer of such extraordinary knowledge must need stand in most direful awe not only of the aforesaid supreme but of all that adhere to he or be in any ghostly authority under he and although it so happen that this same extraordinary know person be pleased to trouble himself with a good large proportion of this vile and contemptible world so that should he now and then upon some odd and cloudy day count himself _ mortal _ and be a little mistaken yet he have chance to make such a comfortable provision for himself and he follower that he must need be sufficiently value and honor amongst all but have he but just enough to keep himself from catch cold and starve so long as he be invest with such spiritual sovereignty and such a peculiar privilege of be infallible most certainly without quarrel he take the ride -lrb- -rrb- of all mankind and as for the most inferior priest of all although they pretend not to such perfection of knowledge : yet there be many extraordinary thing which they be believe to be able to do which beget in people a most venerable respect towards they : such be the power of make god in the sacrament a thing that must infallibly procure a infinite admiration of he that can do it though he scarce know the _ ten commandment _ and have not a farthing to buy himself bread and then when christ be make they give but half of he to the laity be a thing also if it be mind that will very much help on the business and make the people stand at a greater distance from the clergy i might instance likewise in they auricular confession enjoining of penance forgiving sin make of saint free people from purgatory and many such useful trick they have and wonder they can do to draw in the forward believe laity into a most right worshipful opinion and honorable esteem of they and therefore see we holy church of england count it not just nor warrantable thus to cheat the world by belie the _ scripture _ and by make use of such falsehood and stratagem to gain respect and reverence : it behove we certainly to wish for and endeavor all such means as be useful and lawful for the obtain of the same i might here i think conveniently add that though many preferment amongst the clergy of rome may possibly be as small as some of ours in england yet be we to be put in mind of one more excellent contrivance of theirs : and that be the denial of marriage to priest whereby they be free from the expense of a family and a train of young child that upon my word will soon suck up the milk of a cow or two and grind in piece a few sheaf of corn the church of england therefore think it not fit to oblige they clergy to a single life -lrb- and i suppose be not likely to alter they opinion unless they receive better reason for it from rome than have be as yet send over -rrb- : he make a comparison very wide from the purpose that go about to try the living here in england by those of the church of rome there be nothing more frequent in we church than for a clergyman to have three or four child to get bread for by that time one in theirs shall be allow to go into holy order there be still one thing remain which ought not to be forget -lrb- a thing that be sometimes urge i know by the papist for the single life of the priest -rrb- that do also much lessen the esteem of we ministry and that be the poor and contemptible employment that many child of the clergy be force upon by reason of the meanness of they father 's revenue it have happen i know sometimes that whereas it have please god to bestow upon the clergyman a very sufficient income : yet such have be he carelessness as that he have make but pitiful provision for he child : and on the other side notwithstanding all the good care and thoughtfulness of the father it have happen at other time that the child beyond the power of all advice have seem to be resolve for debauchery but to see clergyman 's child condemn to the walking -lrb- _ holding _ -rrb- of horse to wait upon a tapster or the like and that only because they father be not able to allow they a more genteel education : these be such employment that can not but bring great disgrace and dishonor upon the clergy but this be not all the inconvenience that attend the small income that be the portion of some clergyman : for besides that the clergy in general be disesteem they be likely also to do but little good in they parish for it be a hard matter for the people to believe that he talk anything to the purpose that want ordinary food for he family and that he advice and exposition can come from above that be scarcely defend against the weather i have hear a travel poor man beg with very good reason and a great stream of seasonable rhetoric and yet it have be very little mind because he clothes be tear or at least out of fashion and on the other side i have hear but a ordinary say proceeding from a fine suit and a good lusty title of honor highly admire which would not possibly have be hearken to have it be utter by a meaner person : yet by all means because it be a fancy of he worship 's it must be count high and notably express if indeed this world be make of sincere and pure beaten virtue like the gold of the first age then such idle and fond prejudice would be a very vain supposal and the doctrine that proceed from the most battered and contemptible habit -lrb- _ clothes _ -rrb- and the most spare diet would be as acceptable as that which flow from a silken cassock -lrb- _ cloak _ -rrb- and the best cheer but see the world be not absolutely perfect it be to be question whether he that run upon trust for every ounce of provision he spend in he family can scarce look from he pulpit into any seat in the church but that he spy somebody or other that he be beholden to and depend upon and for want of money have scarce confidence to speak handsomely to he sexton : it be to be question i say whether one thus destitute of all tolerable subsistence and thus shatter and distract with most necessary care can either invent with discretion or utter with courage anything that may be beneficial to he people whereby they may become he diligent attender and hearty respecter and as the people do almost resolve against be amend or better by the minister 's preach whose circumstance as to this life be so bad and he condition so low : so likewise be they devotion very cool and indifferent in hear from such a one the _ prayer _ of the church the _ divine service _ all the world know be the same if read in the most magnificent cathedral or in the most private parlor or if perform by the archbishop himself or by the meanest of he priest : but as the solemnity of the place besides the consecration of it to god almighty do much influence the devotion of the people so also the quality and condition of the person that read it and though there be not that acknowledge difference between a priest comfortably provide for and he that be in the thorn and briar as there be between one place in great dignity and authority and one that be in less : yet such a difference the people will make that they will scarce hearken to what be read by the one and yet be most religiously attentive to the other not surely that any one can think that he whose countenance be cheerly and he barn full can petition heaven more effectually or prevail with god for the forgiveness of a greater sin than he who be pitifully pale and be not owner of a ear of corn yet most certainly they do not delight to confess they sin and sing praise to god with he who sigh more for want of money and victuals than for he trespass and offence thus it be and will be do you or i sir what we can to the contrary do we church indeed believe with the papist every person rightfully ordain to be a kind of god almighty work miracle and do wonder then would people most readily prostrate themselves to everything in holy order though it could but just creep but as we church count those of the clergy to be but mortal man though peculiarly dedicate to god and he service they behavior they condition and circumstance of life will necessarily come into we value and esteem of they and therefore it be no purpose for man to say that this need not be it be but mere prejudice humor and fancy : and that if the man be but truly in holy order that be the great matter and from thence come blessing absolution and intercession through christ with god and that it be not philosophy language ecclesiastical history prudence discretion and reputation by which the minister can help we on towards heaven notwithstanding this i say again that see man be man and see that we be of the church of england and not of that of rome these thing ought to be weigh and consider and for want of be so we church of england have suffer much and i be almost confident that since the reformation nothing have more hinder people from a just estimation of a _ form of prayer _ and we holy _ liturgy _ than employ a company of boy or old illiterate mumbler to read the _ service _ and i do verily believe that at this very day especially in city and corporation which make up the third part of we nation there be nothing that do more keep back some dissatisfied people from church till _ service _ be over than that it be read by some # 10 or # 12 man with whose part and education they be so well acquaint as to have reason to know that he have but skill enough to read the _ lesson _ with twice conning over and though the office of the reader be only to read word for word and neither to invent or expound : yet people love he should be a person of such worth and knowledge as it may be suppose he understand what he read and although for some it be too burdensome a task to read the _ service _ twice a day and preach as often yet certainly it be much better if the people have but one sermon in a fortnight or month so the _ service _ be perform by a know and valuable person than to run a unlearned rout of contemptible people into holy order on purpose only to say the _ prayer _ of the church who perhaps shall understand very little more than a hollow pipe make of tin or wainscoat neither do i here at all reflect upon cathedral where the _ prayer _ be usually read by some grave and worthy person and as for the unlearned singer whether boy or man there be no complaint to be make as to this case than that they have not a all understand organ or a prudent and discreet cornet neither need people be afraid that the minister for want of preach should grow stiff and rusty suppose he come not into the pulpit every week for he can spend he time very honestly either by take better care of what he preach and by consider what be most useful and seasonable for the people : and not what subject he can preach upon with most ease or upon what text he can make a brave speech for which nobody shall be the better or where he can best steal without be discover as be the practice of many divine in private parish or else he may spend it in visit the sick instruct the ignorant and recover such as be go astray for though there be church build for public assembly for public instruction and exhortation and though there be not many absolutely plain place of scripture that oblige the minister to walk from house to house : yet certainly people might receive much more advantage from such charitable visit and friendly conference than from general discourse level at the whole world where perhaps the greatest part of the time shall be spend in useless preface dividing and flourishing which thing be very practicable except some vast parish : in which also it be much better to do good to some than to none at all there be but one calamity more that i shall mention which though it need not absolutely yet it do too frequently accompany the low condition of many of the clergy : and that be it be a great hazard if they be not _ idle intemperate _ and _ scandalous _ i say i can not prove it strictly and undeniably that a man smally benefice must of necessity be dissolute and debauched but when we consider how much he lie subject to the humor of all reprobate and how easily he be tempt from he own house of poverty and melancholy : it be to be fear that he will be willing too often to forsake he own study of a few scurvy book and he own habitation of darkness where there be seldom eat or drink for a good lightsome one where there be a bountiful provision of both and when he come there though he swear not at all yet he must be sure to say nothing to those that do it by all that they can think of and though he judge it not fit to lead the forlorn in vice and profaneness : yet if he go about to damp a frolic there be great danger not only of lose he Sunday dinner but also all opportunity of such future refreshment for he niceness and squeamishness and such as be but at all disposed to this lewd kind of meeting besides the devil he shall have solicitor enough who count all such revel occasion very unsavoury and unhallowed unless they have the presence of some clergyman to sanctify the ordinance : who if he stick at he glass bless he and call he but doctor and it slide presently -lrb- _ ie the clergyman drink _ -rrb- i take no delight i must confess to insist upon this : but only i could very much wish that such of we governor as go amongst we small preferred clergy to take a view of the condition of the church and chancel that they would but make inquiry whether the minister himself be not much out of repair i have now do sir with the grounds of that disesteem that many of the clergy lie under both by the _ ignorance _ of some and the _ extreme poverty _ of other and i should have trouble you no further but that i think it convenient not to omit the particular occasion that do concur to the making of many of we clergy so pitifully poor and contemptible the first thing that contribute much to the poverty of the clergy be _ the great scarcity of living _ church and chapel we have enough it be to be confess if compare with the bigness of we nation : but in respect of that infinite number that be in holy order it be a very plain case that there be a very great want and i be confident that in a very little time i could procure hundred that should ride both sun and moon down and be everlastingly yours if you could help they but to a living of # 25 or # 30 a year and this i suppose to be chiefly occasion upon these two account : either from _ the eagerness and ambition _ that some people have of go into order or from the _ refuge of other _ into the church who be otherwise disappointed of a livelihood hope to make sure of one by that mean first i say that which increase the unprovided-for number of the clergy be people post into order before they know they message or business only out of a certain pride and ambition thus some be hugely in love with the mere title of priest or deacon : never consider how they shall live or what good they be likely to do in they office but only they have a fancy that a cassock if it be make long be a very handsome garment though it be never pay for that the desk be clearly the best and the pulpit the highest seat in all the parish that they shall take place -lrb- _ precedence _ -rrb- of most esquire and right worshipful that they shall have the honor of be spiritual guide and counsellor and they shall be suppose to understand more of the mind of god than ordinary though perhaps they scarcely know the old law from the new nor the _ canon _ from the _ apocrypha _ many i say such as these there be who know not where to get two groat nor what they have to say to the people : but only because they have hear that the office of a minister be the most noble and honorable employment in the world therefore they -lrb- not know in the least what the meaning of that be -rrb- order by all means must have though it be to the disparagement of that holy function other also there be who be not so highly possess with the mere dignity of the office and honourableness of the employment but think have they but licence and authority to preach o how they could pay it away and that they can tell the people such strange thing as they never hear before in all they life that they have get such a commanding voice such heart-breaking expression such a peculiar method of text-dividing and such notable help for the interpret all difficulty in scripture that they can shew the people a much shorter way to heaven than have be as yet make know by any such a forwardness as this of go in holy order either merely out of a ambitious humor of be call a priest or of think they could do such feat and wonder if they might be but free of the pulpit have fill the nation with many more divine than there be any competent maintenance for in the church another great crowd that be make in the church be by those that take in there only as a place of shelter and refuge thus we have many turn priest and deacon either for want of employment in they profession of law physic or the like or have be unfortunate in they trade or have break a leg or a arm and so disabled from follow they former call or have have the pleasure of spend they estate or be -lrb- perhaps deservedly -rrb- disappointed of they inheritance the church be a very large and good sanctuary and one spiritual shilling be as good as three temporality shilling let the hardest come to the hardest if they can get by heart _ quid est fide quid est ecclesium quot sunt concilium generalium _ and gain order they may prove reader or preacher accord as they gift and opportunity shall lie now many such as these the church be not able to provide for -lrb- as there be no great reason that she should be solicitous about it -rrb- must need prove a very great disparagement to she they come hither just as the old heathen use to go to prayer when nothing would stop the anger of the god then for a touch of devotion and if there be no way to get victuals rather than starve let we read or preach in short sir we be perfectly overstock with professor of divinity : there be scarce employment for half of those who undertake that office and unless we have some of the romish trick to ramble up and down and cry pardon and indulgence or for want of a living have a good store of client in the business of purgatory or the like and so make such unrighteous gain of religion : it be certainly much better if many of they be otherwise determine or unless we have some vent -lrb- _ export _ -rrb- for we learn one beyond the sea and could transport so many ton of divine yearly as we do other commodity with which the nation be overstock we do certainly very unadvisedly to breed up so many to that holy call or to suffer so many to steal into order : see there be not sufficient work and employment for they the next thing that do as much to heighten the misery of we church as to the _ poverty _ of it be the gentry 's design not only the weak the lame and usually the most ill-favoured of they child for the office of the ministry but also such as they intend to settle nothing upon for they subsistence : leave they wholly to the bare hope of church preferment for as they think let the thing look how it will it be good enough for the church and that if it have but limb enough to climb the pulpit and eye enough to find the day of the month it will serve well enough to preach and read _ service _ so likewise they think they have oblige the clergy very much if they please to bestow two or three year ' education upon a younger son at the university : and then commend he to the grace of god and the favor of the church without one penny of money or inch of land you must not think that he will spoil he eldest son 's estate or hazard the lessen of the credit of the family to do that which may any way tend to the reputation and honor of the clergy and thus it come to pass that you may commonly ride ten mile and scarce meet with a divine that be worth above two spoon and a pepper box besides he living or spiritual preferment for as for the land that go sweeping away with the eldest son for the immortality of the family and as for the money that be usually employ for to bind out -lrb- _ apprentice _ -rrb- and set up other child and thus you shall have they make no doubt of give # 500 or a # 1000 -lrb- = # 1500 _ or _ # 3000 _ now _ -rrb- for a stock -lrb- _ capital _ -rrb- to they : but for the poor divinity son if he get but enough to buy a broad hat at second-hand and a small _ system of faith _ or two that be count stock sufficient for he to set up withal and possibly he might make some kind of shift in this world if anybody will engage that he shall have neither wife nor child : but if it so fall out that he leave the world and behind he either the one or the other : in what a dismal condition be these likely to be and how will they sad calamity reflect upon the clergy so dismal a thing be this commonly judge that those that at they departure out of this life be piously and virtuously dispose do usually reckon the take care for the relief of the poor minister ' widow to be a opportunity of as necessary charity as the mend the highway and the erecting of hospital but neither be spiritual preferment only scarce by reason of that great number that lie hover over they and that they that be thus on the wing be usually destitute of any other estate and livelihood : but also when they come into possession of they they find for the most part nothing but a little sauce and second course -lrb- pig goose and apple -rrb- must need be put upon great perplexity for the standing necessaries of a family so that if it be inquire by any one how come it to pass that we have so many in holy order that understand so little and be able to do so little service in the church if we may answer plainly and truly we may say because they be fit for nothing else for shall we think that any man that be not curse to uselessness poverty and misery will be content with # 20 or # 30 a year for though in the bulk it look at first like a bountiful estate yet if we think of it a little better we shall find that a ordinary bricklayer or carpenter -lrb- i mean not you great undertaker -lrb- _ contractor _ -rrb- and master workman -rrb- that earn constantly but he two shilling a day have clearly a better revenue and have certainly the command of more money for that the one have no dilapidation and the like to consume a great part of he weekly wages of which you know how much the other be subject unto so that as long as we have so many small and contemptible living belong to we church let the world do what it can we must expect that they should be supply by very lamentable and unserviceable thing for that nobody else will meddle with they unless one in a age abound with money charity and goodness will preach for nothing for if man of knowledge prudence and wealth have a fancy against a living of # 20 or # 30 a year there be no way to get they into such a undertaking but by send out a spiritual press -lrb- _ press gang _ -rrb- : for that very few volunteer that be worth unless better encourage will go into that holy warfare but it will be leave to those who can not devise how otherwise to live neither must people say that besides bishopric prebendary and the like we have several brave benefice suffice to invite those of the best part education and discretion for imagine one live in forty be worth # 100 -lrb- = # 300 _ now _ -rrb- a year and supply by a man of skill and wholesome counsel : what be the other thirty-nine the better for that what be the people about carlisle better by he instruction and advice who live at dover it be certainly we savior 's mind not only that the gospel should be preach to all nation at first but that the meaning and power of it should be preserve and constantly declare to all people by such as have judgement to do it neither again must they say that city corporation and the great trading town of this nation which be the strength and glory of it and that contain the useful people of the world be usually instruct by very learn and judicious person for i suppose that we savior 's design be not that mayor alderman and merchant should be only save : but also that all plain country people should partake of the same means who -lrb- though they read not so many _ gazette _ as citizen nor concern themselves where the turk or king of france -lrb- _ loui xiv _ -rrb- set on next -rrb- yet the true knowledge of god be now so plainly deliver in scripture that there want nothing but sober and prudent offerer of the same to make it save to those of the meanest understanding and therefore in all parish if possible there ought to be such a fix and settle provision as might reasonably invite some careful and prudent person for the people 's guide and instruction in holy matter and furthermore it might be add that the revenue belong to most of the corporation living be no such mighty business : for be it not for the uncertain and humorsome contribution of the well-pleased parishioner the parson and he family might be easily starve for all the land and income that belong to the church besides the great mischief that such kind of hire preacher have do in the world -- which i shall not stay here to insist upon and as we have not church enough in respect of the great multitude that be qualify for a living : so consider the smallness of the revenue and the number of people that be to be the hearer it be very plain that we have too many and we shall many time find two church in the same yard when as one would hold double the people of both the parish if they be unite for the encouragement of some deserving person he might easily make shift to spend very honestly and temperately the revenue of both and what though church stand at a little further distance people may please to walk a mile without distemperate themselves when as they shall go three or four to a market to sell two pennyworth of egg but suppose they resolve to pretend that they shall catch cold -lrb- the cloud be more than ordinarily thick upon the Sunday as they usually be if there be religion in the case -rrb- and that they be absolutely bent upon have instruction bring to they own town why might not one sermon a day or -lrb- rather than fail -rrb- one in a fortnight from a prudent and well-esteemed-of preacher do as well as two a day from he that talk all the year long nothing to the purpose and thereupon be laugh at and despise i know what people will presently say to this viz that if upon Sunday the church door be shut the alehouse will be open and therefore there must be somebody -lrb- though never so weak and lamentable -rrb- to pass away the time in the church that the people may be keep sober and peaceable truly if religion and the worship of god consist only in _ negative _ and that the observation of the sabbath be only _ not _ to be drunk then they speak much to the purpose but if it be otherwise very little it be not much unlike as it be the fashion in many place to the send of little child of two or three year old to a school dame without any design of learn one letter but only to keep they out of the fire and water last of all people must not say that there need no great store of learn in a minister and therefore a small living may answer he desert : for that there be _ homily _ make on purpose by the church for young beginner and slow inventor whereupon it be that such difference be make between give order and license to preach : the latter be grant only to such as the bishop shall judge able to make sermon but this do not seem to do the business for though it be not necessary for every guide of a parish to understand all the oriental language or to make exactly elegant or profound discourse for the pulpit yet most certainly it be very requisite that he should be so far learn and judicious as prudently to advise direct inform and satisfy the people in holy matter when they demand it or beg it from he which to perform readily and judiciously require much more discretion and skill than upon long deliberation to make a continued talk of a hour without any great discernible failing so that be a minister tie up never to speak one sentence of he own invention out of the pulpit in he whole lifetime yet doubtless many other occasion there be for which neither wisdom nor reputation should be want in he that have the care and government of a parish i shall not here go about to please myself with the imagination of all the great tithe be restore to the church have little reason to hope to see such day of virtue nor shall i here question the almightiness of former king and parliament nor dispute whether all the king henry in the world with ever such a powerful parliament be able to determine to any other use what be once solemnly dedicate to god and he service by yet when we look over the preface to those _ act of parliament _ whereby some church revenue be grant to henry viii one can not but be much take with the ingenuity of that parliament that when the king want a supply of money and a augmentation to he revenue how handsomely out of the church they make provision for he without do themselves any injury at all _ for _ say they _ see he majesty be we joy and life see that he be so courageous and wise see that he be so very tender of and well affect to all he subject and that he have be at such large expense for five and twenty whole year to defend and protect this he realm : therefore in all duty and gratitude and as a manifest token of we unfeigned thankfulness we do grant unto the king and he heir for ever & c _ it follow as closely as can be that because the king have be a good and deserving king and have be at much trouble and expense for the safety and honor of the nation that therefore all he want shall be supply _ out of the church _ as if all the charge that he have be at be upon the account only of he ecclesiastical subject and not in relation to the rest it be not sir for you or i to guess which way the whole clergy in general might be better provide for but sure it be and must not be deny that so long as many living continue as they now be thus impoverished and that there be so few encouragement for man of sobriety wisdom and learning : we have no reason to expect much better instructor and governor of parish than at present we commonly find there be a way i know that some people love marvellously to talk of and that be a just and equal levelling of ecclesiastical preferment what a delicate refreshment say they would it be if # 20000 or # 30000 a year be take from the bishop and discreetly sprinkle amongst the poorer and meaner sort of the clergy how would it rejoice they heart and encourage they in they office what need those great and sumptuous palace they city and they country house they park and spacious water they costly dish and fashionable sauce may not he that live in a small thatched house that can scarcely walk four stride in he own ground that have only _ read _ well concern venison fish and fowl : may not he i say preach as loud and to as much purpose as one of those high and mighty spiritualist go to then see it have pleased god to make such a bountiful provision for he church in general what need we be solicitous about the emend the low condition of many of the clergy when as there be such a plain remedy at hand have we but grace to apply it this invention please some mainly well but for all the great care they pretend to have of the distressed part of the clergy i be confident one might easily guess what would please they much better if -lrb- instead of augment small benefice -rrb- the bishop would be please to return to they those land purchase in they absence -lrb- _ ie during the commonwealth which be restore to the bishopric at the restoration _ -rrb- : and then as for the relieve of the clergy they would try if they could find out another way but art thou in good earnest my excellent contriver dost thou think that if the greatest of we church preferment be wisely parcel out amongst those that be in want it would do such feat and courtesy and dost thou not likewise think that if ten or twenty of the lustiest nobleman 's estate of england be cleverly slice among the indigent would it not strangely refresh some of the poor laity that cry small coal or grind scissors i do suppose if god should afterwards incline thy mind -lrb- for i fancy it will not be as yet a good while -rrb- to be a benefactor to the church thy wisdom may possibly direct thee to disperse thy goodness in smaller parcel rather than to flow in upon two or three with full happiness but if it be my inclination to settle upon one ecclesiastical person and he successor for ever a # 1000 a year -lrb- = # 3000 _ now _ -rrb- upon condition only to read the _ service _ of the church once in a week and you take it ill and find fault with my prudence and the method of my munificence and say that the stipend be much too large for such a small task : yet i be confident that should i make thy laityship heir of such a estate and oblige thee only to the trouble and expense of spend a single chicken or half a dozen lark once a year in commemoration of I that thou wouldst count I the wisest man that ever be since the creation and pray to god never to dispose thy mind to part with one farthing of it for any other use than for the service of thyself and thy family and yet so it be that because the bishop upon they first be restore -lrb- in 1660 -rrb- have the confidence to levy fine accord as they be justly due and desire to live in they own house if not pull down and to receive they own rent : presently they cry out the churchman have get all the treasure and money of the nation into they hand if they have let they thank god for it and make a good use of it weep not beloved for there be very little hope that they will cast it all into the sea on purpose to stop the mouth of they that say they have too much what other contrivance there may be for the settle upon minister in general a sufficient revenue for they subsistence and encouragement in they office i shall leave to be consider of by the governor of learning and religion only thus much be certain that so long as the maintenance of many minister be so very small it be not to be avoid but that a great part of they will want learn prudence courage and esteem to do any good where they live and what if we have -lrb- as by all must be acknowledge -rrb- as wise and learn bishop as be in the world and many other of very great understanding and wisdom yet -lrb- as be before hint -rrb- unless there be provide for most town and parish some tolerable and sufficient guide the strength of religion and the credit of the clergy will daily languish more and more not that it be to be believe that every small country parish should be altogether hopeless as to the next life unless they have a hooker a chillingworth a hammond or a sanderson dwelling amongst they : but it be requisite and might be bring about that somebody there should be to whom the people have reason to attend and to be direct and guide by he i have sir no more to say be it not that you find the word _ religion _ in the title : of which in particular i have speak very little neither need i consider how nearly it depend as to its glory and strength upon the reputation and mouth of the priest and i shall add no more but this viz that among those many thing that tend to the decay of religion and of a due reverence of the _ holy scripture _ nothing have more occasion it than the ridiculous and idle discourse that be utter out of pulpit for when the gallant of the world do observe how the minister themselves do jingle quibble and play the fool with the text : no wonder if they who be so inclinable to atheism do not only deride and despise the priest but droll upon the _ bible _ and make a mock of all that be sober and sacred i be sir you most humble servant tb _ August _ 8 1670 finis isaac bickerstaff -lrb- _ ie _ richard steele -rrb- _ the misery of the domestic chaplain in

redress whether or not you shall think it a proper case to come before you court of honor i can not tell : but thus it be i be chaplain to a honorable family very regular at the hour of devotion and i hope of a unblameable life : but for not offer to rise at the second course i find my patron and he lady very sullen and out of humor though at first i do not know the reason of it at length when i happen to help myself to a jelly the lady of the house otherwise a devout woman tell I it do not become a man of my cloth to delight in such frivolous food but as i still continue to sit out the last course i be yesterday inform by the butler that he lordship have no further occasion for my service all which be humbly submit to you consideration by sir you most humble servant & c _ the case of this gentleman deserve pity especially if he love sweetmeat to which if i may guess by he letter he be no enemy in the meantime i have often wonder at the indecency of discard the holiest man from the table as soon as the most delicious part of the entertainment be serve up : and could never conceive a reason for so absurd a custom be it because a licorous palate or a sweet tooth -lrb- as they call it -rrb- be not consistent with the sanctity of he character this be but a trifling pretence no man of the most rigid virtue give offence by any excess in plum pudding or plum porridge and that because they be the first part of the dinner be there anything that tend to _ incitation _ in sweetmeat more than in ordinary dish certainly not sugar-plum be a very innocent diet and conserve of a much colder nature than you common pickle i have sometimes think that the ceremony of the _ chaplain fly away from the dessert _ be typical and figurative to mark out to the company how they ought to retire from all the luscious bait of temptation and deny they appetite the gratification that be most please to they or at least to signify that we ought to stint ourselves in the most lawful satisfaction and not make we pleasure but we support the end of eating but most certainly if such a lesson of temperance have be necessary at a table : we clergy would have recommend it to all the lay master of family and not have disturb other man 's table with such unreasonable example of abstinence the original therefore of this _ barbarous custom _ i take to have be merely accidental the chaplain retire out of pure complaisance to make room for the removal of the dish or possibly for the range of the dessert this by degree grow into a duty till at length as the fashion improve the good man find himself cut off from the third part of the entertainment : and if the arrogance of the patron go on it be not impossible but in the next generation he may see himself reduce to the tithe or tenth dish of the table a sufficient caution not to part with any privilege we be once possess of it be usual for the priest in old time to feast upon the sacrifice nay the honey cake while the hungry laity look upon he with great devotion : or as the late lord rochester describe it in a very lively manner _ and while the priest do eat the people stare _ at present the custom be invert the laity feast while the priest stand by as a humble spectator this necessarily put the good man upon make great ravages on all the dish that stand near he and upon distinguish himself by voraciousness of appetite as know that he time be short i would fain ask these stiff-necked patron whether they would not take it ill of a chaplain that in he grace after meat should return thanks for the whole entertainment with a exception to the dessert and yet i can not but think that in such a proceeding he would but deal with they as they deserve what would a roman catholic priest think -lrb- who be always help first and place next the lady -rrb- should he see a clergyman give he company the slip at the first appearance of the tart or sweetmeat would he not believe that he have the same antipathy to a candid orange or a piece of puff paste as some have to a cheshire cheese or a breast of mutton yet to so ridiculous a height be this foolish custom grow that even the christmas pie which in its very nature be a kind of consecrate cake and a badge of distinction be often forbid to the druid of the family strange that a sirloin of beef whether boil or roasted when entire be expose to he utmost depredation and incision but if mince into small piece and toss up with plum and sugar it change its property and forsooth it be meat for he master in this case i know not which to censure -lrb- _ blame _ -rrb- the patron or the chaplain the insolence of power or the abjectness of dependence for my own part i have often blush to see a gentleman whom i know to have more wit and learning than myself and who be breed up with I at the university upon the same foot of a liberal education treat in such a ignominious manner and sink beneath those of he own rank by reason of that character which ought to bring he honor this deter man of generous mind from place themselves in such a station of life and by that mean frequently exclude person of quality from the improving and agreeable conversation of a learn and obsequious friend mr oldham let we know that he be affright from the thought of such a employment by the scandalous sort of treatment which often accompany it _ some think

my purpose the first i look into come to I from one who be chaplain to a great family he treat himself in the beginning of it after such a manner as i be persuade no man of sense would treat he even the lawyer and the physician to a man of quality expect to be use like gentleman and much more may any one of so superior a profession i be by no means encourage that dispute whether the chaplain or the master of the house be the better man and the more to be respect the two learn author dr hick and mr collier -lrb- to whom i might add several other -rrb- be to be excuse if they have carry the point a little too high in favor of the chaplain : since in so corrupt a age as that we live in the popular opinion run so far into the other extreme the only controversy between the patron and the chaplain ought to be which should promote the good design and interest of each other most and for my own part i think it be the happiest circumstance in a great estate or title that it qualify a man for choose out of such a learn and valuable body of man as that of the english clergy a friend a spiritual guide and a companion the letter which i have receive from one of this order be as follow : _ mr guardian i hope you will not only indulge I in the liberty of two or three question but also in the solution of they i haw have the honor many year of be chaplain in a noble family and of be account the _ highest servant _ in the house : either out of respect to my cloth or because i lie in the uppermost garret whilst my old lord live he table be always adorn with useful learning and innocent mirth as well as cover with plenty i be not look upon as a piece of furniture fit only to sanctify and garnish a feast but treat as a gentleman and generally desire to fill up the conversation a hour after i have do my duty _ -lrb- ie say grace after dinner -rrb- _ but now my young lord be come to the estate i find i be look upon as a _ censor morum _ a obstacle to mirth and talk : and suffer to retire constantly with _ prosperity to the church _ in my mouth _ -lrb- ie after drink this toast -rrb- _ i declare solemnly sir that i have hear nothing from all the fine gentleman who visit we more remarkable for half a year than that one young lord be seven time drunk at genoa i have lately take the liberty to stay three or four round _ -lrb- ie of the bottle -rrb- _ beyond -lrb- the toast of -rrb- _ the church _ to see what topic of discourse they go upon : but to my great surprise have hardly hear a word all the time besides the toast then they all stare full in my face and shew all the action of uneasiness till i be go immediately upon my departure to use the word of a old comedy i find by the noise they make that they have a mind to be private i be at a loss to imagine what conversation they have among one another which i may not be present at : since i love innocent mirth as much as any of they and be shock with no freedom whatsoever which be inconsistent with christianity i have with much ado maintain my post hitherto at the dessert and every day eat a tart in the face of my patron : but how long i shall be invest with this privilege i do not know for the servant who do not see I support as i be in my old lord 's time begin to brush very familiarly by I : and they thrust aside my chair when they set the sweetmeat on the table i have be bear and educate a gentleman and desire you will make the public sensible that the christian priesthood be never think in any age or country to debase the man who be a member of it among the great service which you useful papers daily do to religion this perhaps will not be the least : and it will lay a very great obligation on you unknown servant gw _ benjamin franklin _ poor richard improve be a almanac & c for the year of we lord _ 1758 richard saunder philom philadelphium courteous reader i have hear that nothing give a author so great pleasure as to find he work respectfully quote by other learn author this pleasure i have seldom enjoy for though i have be if i may say it without vanity a _ eminent _ author of _ almanac _ annually now a full quarter of a century my brother author in the same way for what reason i know not have ever be very spare in they applause and no other author have take the least notice of I : so that do not my writings produce I some solid pudding the great deficiency of praise would have quite discourage I i conclude at length that the people be the best judge of my merit for they buy my work : and besides in my ramble where i be not personally know i have frequently hear one or other of my adage repeat with as _ poor richard _ say at the end of it this give I some satisfaction as it shew not only that my instruction be regard but discover likewise some respect for my authority and i own that to encourage the practice of remember and repeat those wise sentence : i have sometimes _ quote myself _ with great gravity judge then how much i must have be gratify by a incident i be go to relate to you i stop my horse lately where a great number of people be collect at a vendue -lrb- _ sale _ -rrb- of merchant 's goods the hour of sale not be come they be converse on the badness of the time : and one of the company call to a clean old man with white lock pray father abraham what do you think of the time will not these heavy tax quite ruin the country how shall we be ever able to pay they what would you advise we to father abraham stand up and reply if you would have my advice i will give it you in short for _ a word to the wise be enough _ and _ many word will not fill a bushel _ as _ poor richard _ say they all join desire he to speak he mind and gathering round he he proceed as follow : friend say he and neighbor the tax be indeed very heavy and if those lay on by the government be the only one we have to pay we might the more easily discharge they : but we have many other and much more grievous to some of we we be tax twice as much by we idleness three time as much by we pride and four time as much by we folly : and from these tax the commissioner can not ease or deliver we by allow a abatement however let we hearken to good advice and something may be do for we _ god help they that help themselves _ as _ poor richard _ say in he _ almanac _ of 1733 it would be think a hard government that should tax its people one-tenth part of they time to be employ in its service but idleness tax many of we much more if we reckon all that be spend in absolute sloth or do of nothing with that which be spend in idle employment or amusement that amount to nothing sloth by bring on disease absolutely shorten life _ sloth like rust consume faster than labor wear while the use key be always bright as poor richard say _ but _ dost thou love life then do not squander time for that be the stuff life be make of _ as _ poor richard say _ how much more than be necessary do we spend in sleep forget that _ the sleep fox catch no poultry _ and that _ there will be sleep enough in the grave _ as _ poor richard _ say if time be of all thing the most precious _ wasting of time must be _ -lrb- as _ poor richard _ say -rrb- _ the greatest prodigality _ since as he elsewhere tell we _ lose time be never find again _ and what we call _ time enough always prow little enough _ let we then up and be do and do to the purpose : so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity _ sloth make all thing difficult but industry all thing easy _ as _ poor richard _ say : and _ he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake he business at night _ while _ laziness travel so slowly that poverty soon overtake he _ as we read in _ poor richard _ who add _ drive thy business let not that drive thee _ and _ early to bed and early to rise make a man healthy wealthy and wise _ so what signify _ wish _ and _ hope _ for better time we may make these time better if we bestir ourselves _ industry need not wish _ as _ poor richard _ say and _ he that live on hope will die fast there be no gain without pain _ then _ help hand for i have no land _ or if i have they be smartly tax and as _ poor richard _ likewise observe _ he that have a trade have a estate _ and he that _ have a call have a office of profit and honor _ : but then the trade must be work at and the call well follow or neither the estate nor the office will enable we to pay we tax if we be industrious we shall never starve for as _ poor richard _ say _ at the work man 's house hunger look in but dare not enter _ nor will the bailiff or the constable enter : for _ industry pay debt while despair increaseth they _ say _ poor richard _ what though you have find no treasure nor have any rich relation leave you a legacy _ diligence be the mother of good-luck _ as _ poor richard _ say and _ god give ail thing to industry _ then _ plough deep while sluggard sleep and you shall have corn to sell and to keep _ say _ poor dick _ work while it be call to-day for you know not how much you may be hinder to-morrow : which make _ poor richard _ say _ one to-day be worth two to-morrow _ and farther _ have you somewhat to do to-morrow do it to-day _ if you be a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle be you then you own master _ be ashamed to catch yourself idle _ as _ poor dick _ say

just now remember methink i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what _ poor richard _ say _ employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away a hour _ leisure be time for do something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as _ poor richard _ say _ a life of leisure and a life of laziness be two thing _ do you imagine that sloth will afford you more comfort than labor no for as _ poor richard _ say _ trouble spring from idleness and grievous toil from needless ease many without labor would live by they wit only but they 'll break for want of stock _ -lrb- _ ie _ capital -rrb- whereas industry give comfort and plenty and respect _ fly pleasure and they 'll follow you the diligent spinner have a large shift _ and _ now i have a sheep and a cow everybody bid I good morrow _ all which be well say by _ poor richard _ but with we industry we must likewise be steady settle and careful : and oversee we own affair _ with we own eye _ and not trust too much to other for as _ poor richard _ say _ i never see a oft remove tree nor yet a oft remove family that throve so well as those that settle be _ and again _ three remove be as bad as a fire _ and again _ keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee _ and again _ if you would have you business do go if not send _ and again _ he that by the plough would thrive himself must either hold or drive _ and again _ the eye of the master will do more work than both he hand _ and again _ want of care do we more damage than want of knowledge _ and again _ not to oversee workman be to leave they you purse open _ trust too much to other ' care be the ruin of many for as the almanac say _ in the affair of this world man be save not by faith but by the want of it _ but a man 's own care be profitable for saith _ poor dick learning be to the studious _ and _ riches to the careful _ as well as _ power to the bold _ and _ heaven to the virtuous _ and further _ if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself _ and again he adviseth to circumspection and care even in the smallest matter because sometimes _ a little neglect may breed great mischief _ add _ for want of a nail the shoe be lose for want of a shoe the horse be lose and for want of a horse the rider be lose _ be overtake and slay by the enemy all for want of care about a horse-shoe nail so much for industry my friend and attention to one 's own business but to these we must add frugality if we would make we industry more certainly successful _ a man may _ if he know not how to save as he get _ keep he nose all he life to the grindstone and die not worth a groat at last a fat kitchen make a lean will _ as _ poor richard _ say and _ many estate be spend in the get since woman for tea forsook spin and knit and man for punch forsake hewing and splitting _ _ if you would be healthy _ say he in another _ almanac think of save as well as of get the indy have not make spain rich because she outgo be greater than she income _ away then with you expensive folly and you will not have so much cause to complain of hard time heavy tax and chargeable family for as _ poor dick _ say _ woman and wine game and deceit make the wealth small and the want great _ and farther _ what maintain one vice would bring up two child _ you may think perhaps that a _ little _ tea or a _ little _ punch now and then diet a _ little _ more costly clothes a _ little _ finer and a _ little _ entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember what _ poor richard _ say _ many a little make a mickle _ and farther _ beware of little expense a small leak will sink a great ship _ and again _ who dainty love shall beggar prove _ and moreover _ fool make feast and wise man eat they _ here be you all get together at this vendue of finery and knicknack you call they goods : but if you do not take care they will prove evil to some of you you expect they will be sell cheap and perhaps they may for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for they they must be _ dear _ to you remember what _ poor richard _ say _ buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries _ and again _ at a great pennyworth pause a while _ he mean that perhaps the cheapness be apparent only and not real or the bargain by straiten thee in thy business may do thee more harm than good for in another place he say _ many have be ruin by buy good pennyworth _ again _ poor richard _ say _ ` tis foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance _ : and yet this folly be practice every day at vendue for want of mind the _ almanac _ _ wise man _ as _ poor dick _ say _ learn by other ' harm fool scarcely by they own _ : but _ felix quem faciunt aliena periculum cautum _ many a one for the sake of finery on the back have go with a hungry belly and half starve they family _ silk and satin scarlet and velvet _ as _ poor richard _ say _ put out the kitchen fire _ these be not the necessaries of life they can scarcely be call the convenience : and yet only because they look pretty how many _ want _ to have they the artificial want of mankind thus become more numerous than the natural and as _ poor dick _ say _ for one poor person there be a hundred _ indigent by these and other extravagance the genteel be reduce to poverty and force to borrow of those whom they formerly despise but who through industry and frugality have maintain they standing in which case it appear plainly that _ a ploughman on he leg be higher than a gentleman on he knee _ as _ poor richard _ say perhaps they have have a small estate leave they which they know not the get of they think _ ` tis day and will never be night _ that _ a little to be spend out of so much i be not worth mind _ -lrb- _ a child and a fool _ as _ poor richard _ say _ imagine twenty shilling and twenty year can never be spend _ -rrb- : but _ always take out of the meal tub and never put in soon come to the bottom _ then as _ poor dick say _ _ when the well 's dry they know the worth of water _ but this they might have know before if they have take he advice _ if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some _ for _ he that go a borrowing go a sorrowing _ and indeed so do he that lend to such people _ when he go to get it in again _ _ poor dick _ further advise and say _ fond pride of dress be sure a very curse ere fancy you consult consult you purse _ and again _ pride be as loud a beggar as want and a great deal more saucy _ when you have buy one fine thing you must buy ten more that you appearance may be all of a piece but _ poor dick _ say _ ` tis easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it _ and ` tis as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich as for the frog to swell in order to equal the ox _ great estate may venture more but little boat should keep near shore _ ` tis however a folly soon punish for pride that _ dine on vanity sup on contempt _ as _ poor richard _ say and in another place _ pride breakfast with plenty dine with poverty and sup with infamy _ and after all of what use be this pride of appearance for which so much be risk so much be suffer it can not promote health or ease pain it make no increase of merit in the person it create envy it hasten misfortune _ what be a butterfly at best he be but a caterpillar drest the gaudy fop 's he picture just _ as _ poor richard _ say but what madness must it be to _ run into debt _ for these superfluity we be offer by the term of this vendue six month ' credit and that perhaps have induce some of we to attend it because we can not spare the ready money and hope now to be fine without it but ah think what you do when you run in debt _ you give to another power over you liberty _ if you can not pay at the time you will be ashamed to see you creditor you will be in fear when you speak to he you will make poor pitiful sneak excuse and by degree come to lose you veracity and sink into base downright lie for as _ poor richard _ say _ the second vice be lie the first be run into debt _ : and again to the same purpose _ lie ride upon debt 's back _ whereas a free bear englishman ought not to be ashamed or afraid to see or speak to any man living but poverty often deprive a man of all spirit and virtue _ ` tis hard for a empty bag to stand upright _ as _ poor richard _ truly say what would you think of that prince or the government who should issue a edict forbid you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman on pain of imprisonment or servitude would you not say that you be free have a right to dress as you please and that such a edict would be a breach of you privilege and such a government tyrannical and yet you be about to put yourself under that tyranny when you run in debt for such dress you creditor have authority at he pleasure to deprive you of you liberty by confine you in gaol for life or to sell you for a servant if you should not be able to pay he when you have get you bargain you may perhaps think little of payment but _ creditor _ -lrb- _ poor richard _ tell we -rrb- _ have better memory than debtor _ and in another place say _ creditor be a superstitious sect great observer of set day and time _ the day come round before you be aware and the demand be make before you be prepare to satisfy it : or if you bear you debt in mind the term which at first seem so long will as it lessen appear extremely short time will seem to have add wing to he heel as well as shoulder _ those have a short lend _ saith _ poor richard who owe money to be pay at easter _ then since as he say _ the borrower be a slave to the lender and the debtor to the creditor _ disdain the chain preserve you freedom and maintain you independency be industrious and free be frugal and free at present perhaps you may think yourself in thrive circumstance and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury : but _ for age and want save while you may no morning sun last a whole day _ as _ poor richard _ say gain may be temporary and uncertain but ever while you live expense be constant and certain : and _ ` tis easier to build two chimney than to keep one in fuel _ as _ poor richard _ say so _ rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt _ _ get what you can and what you get hold ` tis the stone that will turn all you lead into gold _ as _ poor richard _ say and when you have get the philosopher 's stone sure you will no longer complain of bad time or the difficulty of pay tax this doctrine my friend be reason and wisdom but after all do not depend too much upon you own industry and frugality and prudence though excellent thing for they may all be blast without the blessing of heaven : and therefore ask that blessing humbly and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it but comfort and help they remember job suffer and be afterwards prosperous and now to conclude _ experience keep a dear school but fool will learn in no other and scarce in that _ for it be true _ we may give advice but we can not give conduct _ as _ poor richard _ say however remember this _ they that will not be counsel can not be help _ as _ poor richard _ say : and farther that _ if you will not hear reason she 'll surely rap you knuckle _ thus the old gentleman end he harangue the people hear it and approve the doctrine and immediately practice the contrary just as if it have be a common sermon for the vendue open and they begin to buy extravagantly notwithstanding all he caution and they own fear of tax i find the good man have thoroughly study my _ almanac _ and digest all i have drop on those topic during the course of five and twenty year the frequent mention he make of I must have tire any one else but my vanity be wonderfully delighted with it : though i be conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom be my own which he ascribe to I but rather the gleanings i have make of the sense of all age and nation however i resolve to be the better for the echo of it and though i have at first determine to buy stuff for a new coat i go away resolve to wear my old one a little longer reader if thou wilt do the same thy profit will be as great as mine i be as ever thine to serve thee July 7 1757 richard saunder end of
