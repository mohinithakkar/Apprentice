scrape together a little gold dust possibly we may have money enough to engage in some legitimate business and what we can not get by the discovery of a mine we may acquire in time in speculation you be shrewd and level-headed that would be a good scheme for you lad but not for I i be too far advance in life to earn money by slow labor now what i propose be that you go back take all the gold we have and enter into trade you be bright and energetic and may succeed and what will you do i shall continue my search for a mine and some day i may strike it brook be a college graduate a civil engineer and a mineralogist and believe he have great advantage in search for a mine but as have be indicate thus far they tramp and search have be a dead failure i 'll stick with you say desmond no lad you must go back i swear i will not i like this life and remember we have gather some wash dust and we may gather more i do not know the value of what we have gather from the bottom of that stream we strike but i do know that it would take a long time to accumulate as much money in trade remember we have be in the mountain only six week that be all right but we might stay here six year and not make a find at that instant there come a sound which cause brook and desmond to bend they ear and listen some of the indian be on the warpath a band of buck have be make a raid and have be pursue by the united state cavalry into the mountain indian as a rule do not take to the mountain but sometimes when pursue hotly they will separate into small band and scatter through the hill these fellow be dangerous they would have murder any white man they might meet for they arm alone without consider the spirit of wantonness or revenge that might animate they brook and desmond rise from they seat beside the fire and move slowly away at any moment a arrow or even a rifle shot might come and end the life of one or both desmond have become a very expert woodsman he and brook have be chase by indian several time and have exchange shot with one band they know a cover in a crevice in the wall of rock which run up abruptly each side of the gulch from this spot they could survey and also make a good fight in a emergency they have good weapon plenty of ammunition and what be more coolness skill and courage desmond especially be a very cool-headed chap in time of danger the use of firearm be not new to he nor be the woodsman life altogether a novelty for he have be raise in a very wild and desolate mountain region quickly they steal to cover although they believe it possible that they might have be see for they have absolute proof well know to woodsman that if there be foe in the vicinity they have be discover once in they covert they lay low and a few moment pass when they behold a solitary figure advance slowly and very cautiously up the gulch and as the figure come in the light of the fire desmond whose eyesight be very keen say : it be a white man he look like a hunter we will wait a moment or two but i guess it be all right the figure meantime with rifle poise advanced very slowly and finally stand fully reveal close to the fire and indeed he be a white man of strong and vigorous frame i 'll go and meet he say desmond you lay low here rifle in hand ready to shoot in case he prove a enemy all right lad go ahead desmond step from he hiding-place and advance toward the fire the stranger see he still hold he position ready for offense or defense and permit desmond to approach and soon he discern that the lad be a white man and he call : hail friend hail to you reply the lad the two man approach and shake hand the hunter be a splendid specimen of physical manhood and he face indicate honesty and good-nature be you alone here lad no where 's you comrade desmond make a sign and brook step forth from the crevice and approach the fire hail friend say the stranger hunter brook answer the salutation the two man shake hand and the stranger say what may be you business out here we 'll talk of that later on but stranger you take great chance i do yes how in approach the fire you be expose suppose the fire have be kindle by indian the woodsman laugh and say : i know it be not a indian 's fire you do yes how be that they do not create such a big blaze i know white man be around and man whom i need not fear but i be on my guard all the same we could have drop you off well yes but out here we have to take chance and it be necessary for I to do so it be yes how so i need food i have not strike any game lately the fact be i have be up in the peak where there be no game i hope you have a cold snack here my friend and some tobacco for i have not have a regular tobacco smoke or chew for over a month we be just about to prepare some coffee and make a meal good enough do you say coffee well i have strike elysium i have not taste a cup of coffee in a year you see i be snowbound away up in the mountain fortunately i have plenty of dry meat and i be compel to wait until i be thaw out brook commence make the coffee and while do so the woodsman ask : be you regular hunter no ever in the mountain before never you have be take great chance we have yes how so the mountain be full of bad indian fugitive and they be very ugly some be part of a raiding gang of buck and other be rascal who have make a kick out at the reservation i have meet twenty of they in the last ten day they be in squad of two and three and they be full of fight we have meet some of they and you manage to escape we have a fight with one party you do yes how do you come out ahead i reckon or we would not be here the conversation be between the woodsman and desmond what bring you into the mountain -- be you tourist no on business yes surveyor no i think not no use to survey out this way i suppose you be look for a lose mine well we might take in a lose mine or find a new one it do not matter ah i see well so far you have be lucky but you have be take desperate chance oh that be a way we have chapter ii a recognition -- the woodsman 's disclosure -- a chance after all -- the bivouac -- desmond 's discovery -- savage galore the coffee be soon prepared and brook produce some dry meat and a few cracker and the three man so strangely meet sit down to enjoy they meal the woodsman be offer the first cup of coffee and as he drink it down all hot and steam he smack he lip and exclaim : well that be good that cup of coffee make we friend i may do you a good turn good enough we be ready for a good turn we have have rather hard luck so far so you be after a mine eh yes you be regular prospector yes you have to strike a surface ledge to make any money do not think a claim would amount to much out here unless you find a nest of they so as to attract a crowd and a town and a mill and all that accord to my idea the mine out here all need capital to work 'em in case you should strike one regardless of possibility as the night be a little chilly brook have create quite a blaze and by the light of the fire he have a fair chance to study the woodsman 's face and finally he ask abruptly : stranger what be you name the woodsman laugh and say : i think you would ask that question you do yes why well it be natural that you should but that be not the reason i think so it be not no well why do you think so i be go to ask you name certainly my name be brooks i think so you do yes what make you think my name be brook can not you guess no why do you ask my name as you say it be a natural question that be not the reason you ask it it be not no well you may tell I the true reason you have be study my face i have you think you have see I before somewhere well you do see I before i do yes when and where just look sharp and see if you can not place I i can not it be a great many year ago it must have be but to tell the truth there be something very familiar in you face yes and you discover it at the start but you do not place I

be you have the advantage how i tell you my name i will tell you mine in good time but try to remember i give it up you do i do the woodsman laugh and say : we sleep together one night we do yes when and where and now you can not recall i can not you be a square man but there have come a change over you do we meet often no be we intimate well yes for the time be i give it up you do not place I no again the woodsman laugh and say : do you remember about fifteen year ago a young fellow tired wet and hungry try to find shelter in a freight car hello you be not henry creedon yes i be and this be the second time you have feed I you appear to be my good angel i may prove you good angel so you be henry creedon i be and turn to desmond creedon say : you friend there one night make a fight for I feed I and find shelter for I he be a tramp then i be foot it out west here henry say brook what have you be do all these year mine hunting mine hunting for fifteen year yes and have you find a mine yet the woodsman laugh and brook say : desmond we do indeed take desperate chance and we have be make a fool 's chase i reckon here be a man who have be mine hunting for fifteen year and have not find one yet where do we come in i 'll tell you say creedon it be luck when you find a mine more be find by chance than be discover by expert but i think i have find one i can not tell you see i be raise in a factory town i have have no education and i can not tell its value i know where the find be located however and some of these day i 'll strike a prospect party who will have a engineer with they and then i will know the value of my find if you take a party in with you they will demand a share certainly do you intend to share with they i can not do otherwise yes that be so suppose i find a engineer for you i suppose you will want a rake in certainly well brook i 'll tell you i do not want to start in on a divide with everyone but i have make up my mind to take you in with I i know you be a kind-hearted and honest man even though you be a tramp a whisky-loving tramp and that i remember you empty my canister that night yes but i be not drink now i have reform you have yes so much the better for you i have something to tell you go it i be just the man to establish the value of you mine you be yes i be how be that eh have you become a expert after be in the mountain six week and i be not in one way and i have be here for fifteen year i be a expert before i come to the mountain you be yes how be that i be a civil engineer by profession what be that i be a civil engineer by profession you do not tell I that be what i tell you and i tell you the truth then you be just the man i want i say i be i be more than a engineer i be a mineralogist and a geologist hold on do not overcome a fellow out here in the mountain if you be a civil engineer that be enough for I hang you mineralogy and geology what i want be a man who can estimate no doubt about the ledge i have strike the question be how much will it cost to mine it how much be there of it you see i have have some experience here in the mountain and sometimes we strike what be call a pocket we might find gold for a few foot one way and another and then strike dead rock and no gold i be not a mineralogist or geologist or a civil engineer and i be afraid my find will not amount to much but it be worth investigation and as you be able to estimate we will make a start to-morrow i will take you to my ledge and then we will know whether we be millionaire or tramp -- eh mountain tramp -- but i be grateful for this food and coffee and now if you 'll give I a little tobacco i 'll be the most contented man in the mountain whether my mine turn out a hit or a misthrow so tobacco be produce brook himself be a inveterate smoker and since be in the mountain desmond have take to the weed and there be promise that some day he might become a inveterate the three man have a jolly time but in a quiet way creedon be a good story teller he have have many weird experience in the mountain he have act as guide to a great many party he have engage in about fifty fight with indian during he residence in the great west and have meet a great many very notable character when the man conclude to lie down to sleep for the night they extinguish they fire and each man find a crevice into which he creep and only those who have sleep in the open air in a pure climate can tell of the exhilarating effect that follow a slumber under the condition describe desmond be the first to awake and he peep forth from he crevice and glance down toward the point where the fire have be when he behold a sight that cause he blood to run cold five fierce-looking savage be group around the spot where the campfire have be and he have a chance to study a scene he have never before witness he behold five savage in full war paint they be dress in a most grotesque manner part of they attire be fragment of united state uniform show that the red man have be in a skirmish and possibly have come out victorious and have have a opportunity to strip the body of the dead a great deal have be write about the shrewdness of redman they be shrewd when they quality be once fully arouse and they be on the scent but they be give to assumption the same as white man of course creedon be practically to be credit when he say that the indian assume there have be a camp there and that the camper have depart but have they make as close observation as when on a trail they would have make discovery that would have suggest the near presence of the late camper creedon have as far as possible destroy all sign when rake out the fire of a recent encampment but a experienced and alert eye can detect the truth despite these little trick desmond see the indian : they be a hard-looking lot the worst specimen he have ever behold and they be assassin at sight as he determine he be secure from observation but it be necessary to warn he comrade who be in different crevice and at that moment creedon actually snore he be in the crevice adjoining the one where desmond have take refuge the indian be too far away to overhear the snore but it be possible the man might awake and step forth then as desmond fear the fight would commence he do not desire a fight he might think the chance would be with he party as only two of the indian have rifle but then if even one of they own party be kick over it would be a sad disaster the lad meditate some little time and study the condition he crawl into he crevice and lo he see a lateral breakaway he might gain creedon 's berth as he call it without chance a outside steal fortune favor he creedon 's crevice be one of several rent in the rock and he manage to reach the sleeper 's foot and he cautiously touch it fear at the moment that creedon in he surprise might make a outcry or a inquiry in a loud tone but here he learn a lesson in woodcraft creedon do not make a outcry he awake and cautiously investigate and soon discover that desmond have touch he and be seek to communicate with he he demand in a whisper : what be it lad there be indian in the gulch aha where down where we be camp last night you keep low and i will take a peep desmond could afford to let creedon take a peep the woodsman do peep and take in the situation and he say : you be smaller than i be do the rent where you be run to the berth where brook be sleep it may i will find out and go slow we do not want a fight if we can help it but we have get the dead bulge on those redskin if we have to fight chapter iii creedon 's knowledge of woodcraft -- the redman 's departure -- a long trail -- on the tramp -- the strangest refuge in the world -- a bridge of risk desmond crawl forward beyond the rent where creedon have lodge and he find the space much wider as he progress and soon gain the opening where the rent terminate in which brook have lie all night desmond glance in and lo brook be inside awake and have already discover the presence of the indian and so far they be all right have you be able to notify creedon ask brook yes what do he say he bid I arouse you i discover the rascal as soon as i awake all right lay low and i will learn what creedon advise desmond crawl back and say : brook be awake and want to know what we shall do there be only one thing to do : we will lay low and if the rascal do not discover we all right if they do discover we it will be bad for they and all right with we again that be all and now you and brook just keep out of sight and let I run the show word be pass to brook and desmond with the tramp lay low as it prove there be not much of a show to run as the indian move away after a little but creedon do not permit he friend to go forth he say : you can never tell about these redskin they might suspect we be around and they go away may be a little trick they be up to these trick hour pass and creedon still keep he friend in hiding and it be near evening when he steal forth say he would take a observation after a little he return and say : it be all right come out creedon say he have discover evidence that the redskin have really go away why could not you have find that out sooner the woodsman laugh and say : they might have find I out then as it be accord to the tale you and brook tell i take a desperate chance shall we get to work and have a meal not much young man you will have to control you appetite for awhile remember i be captain of this squadron i 'll lead you to a place however where we can build a fire and camp and eat without fear i be post around here i know the safe place the party start on the march and desmond feel quite irritated he have go nearly twenty-four hour without eat and he say : i be ready to even fight for a meal creedon laugh and say in reply : you may have a stomach full of fight yet before we find the mine i think you have locate it yes but it be a week 's tramp from where we be at present and we may have some lively time before we arrive at the place it be nine o'clock at night when the party arrive at one of the most peculiar natural retreat desmond have ever see it be a cave as we will call it in the side wall of a cliff rise from a gulch even more wild and rugged than the one where the party have camp the previous night some mighty convulsion of the mountain have separate the whole front of the cliff from the main rock so that a space of at least twenty foot intervene and between yawn a dark abyss that lead down to where no man have yet penetrate creedon lead the way up along a ledge of ascent which line the outer edge of the great mass of detach cliff once at the top he descend on the inner side it be night but he have take advantage of a mask lantern which he carry with he and which he say be the most useful article in he possession he add : these lantern may belong to the profession of detective and burglar but i have find they the most useful article a cliff-climber can own they be different from other lamp and torch you can control the one ray of light and indicate you path without any trouble whatever this be true as the guide demonstrate and he party walk along the narrow ledge without any fear of be precipitate over all it require be a good eye and a steady nerve and they possess these necessary qualification the guide at length come to a halt and say : you stand here and i 'll get my bridge he proceed along alone but soon return with two sapling which he have string together and of which he have make a rope ladder desmond be greatly interested and watch the guide as he throw he ladder across the intervene abyss and then he say : it will take a little nerve to crawl over but once over we be all safe and i have get a storehouse over there i prepare this place with a great deal of patience and labor we can spend two or three day here i know you will enjoy it and we can take a good long rest i will go over first and then hold the light so you two can follow desmond glance at brook and ask : will you risk it yes i will lad i be not the fellow i be about six month ago i can climb a steeple now the guide go over creep across the sapling bent under he weight and make a downward curve so that when he attempt so ascend on the opposite side it be a climb up but with the rope make of weave prairie grass and stick and bough he easily ascend he have carry he lantern with he and he flash its light across he bridge and ask who will come next you go say desmond to brook the tramp do not hesitate but start to crawl over the oddly construct bridge and he do so as well as the guide have do then desmond cross and the instant all hand be over the guide take up he bridge stow it away and say : when we cross back it will be in the daytime and much harder much harder in the daytime yes i should think it would be easier the guide laugh and say : it might appear so but in the daytime you will realize just what you be do you will see the dark abyss beneath you and when the bridge sway downward you heart will be in you throat i tell you at night however you do not know just what you be do desmond see the truth of what the guide say and observe that the man be quite a philosopher now let I go in advance say creedon he lead the way and soon turn into what he call creedon street it be a broad opening with a solid flooring and wall of rock on either side -- the most singular and remarkable rock conformation that either brook or desmond have ever see the guide walk right ahead boldly he evidently know that there be no rent down which they might plunge here be creedon hall say the guide as he turn into a broad opening and flash he light around the party be in a cave and yet we can hardly call it a cave it appear to be merely a huge underline in the side of the cliff as it be open as the guide say face creedon street i will soon have creedon hall illuminate for you say the guide he secure some wood and as desmond follow he he see that he have abundance of it and the guide say : this wood some of it have be stow here for over ten year and we can have a jolly fire in a few minute and no fear of attract indian or any one else we be as safe here as though we be make a grate fire in a big hotel in new york creedon make good he word and soon creedon hall be brilliantly illuminate and desmond be delighted he exclaim in he enthusiasm this be just immense well it be brook also be delighted he set to work to make the coffee and prepare the meal and creedon lay down on he blanket and light he pipe while desmond wander around the cave as he persist in call it he discover several outlet from creedon hall and he make up he mind that as soon as he friend be asleep he would steal the mask lantern and go on a explore expedition it be a jolly party that sit down to coffee cold dry meat and cracker brook have be very spare of he cracker and have at least five pound of they at the time he and desmond meet the guide when do you discover this place ask desmond i do not discover the place it be reveal to I by a old hunter a mexican and how he discover it he would never tell the old man have a great many secret and i have sometimes think that there be gold hide here somewhere i have spend day search for it but never could find anything of the value of a red cent where be the old mexican now that be hard to tell lad he die about five year ago and he body be carry to the ruin of a old spanish church and there bury as he have request long before he die he be a strange old man he possess many secret but they die with he it be possible he mean to reveal they some day but death catch he and he go out with he mouth close as far as he secret be concern he be a sort of miser in secret i do think that some day the old man would reveal something of value to I he pretend to think a great deal of I i save he life at a critical moment he be actually bind to the stake and i shoot the rascal who be about to light the fire they intend to burn he alive and the arrival of myself and party be just in time do the indian still burn they prisoner at the stake these be not indian -- they be he own countryman they have try to force a confession from he and because he refuse to reveal the whereabouts of the gold they think he have store away somewhere they be set to murder he in anger and revenge and you save he i do and he never reveal he secret to you only the secret of this cave he often make strange remark and hint that some day i would receive my reward we room here together all of one winter but he die and never open he mouth to reveal where he gold be if it be true that he have any i believe he do but it will never do I any good and i do want to make a fortune somehow but i suppose i never will yes lad there be thousand of skeleton of gold-seeker hide away in cavern in these mountain victim of the same ambition which be lead we to take such desperate chance desmond be very greatly interested in the story of the old mexican and he ask a number of question you never get the least inkling as to where he gold be hide i do not know that he have any gold it be only a suspicion on my part he live in this cave yes do you ever search here well you bet i do and do you explore you bet i do and you never find anything i never do nor secure any indication never possibly you do not look in the right place that be dead certain come the natural answer chapter iv on a explore expedition -- a find in a cave -- the sepulchral voice -- the explanation -- desmond get square on a trick -- strange longing -- the finding of a nugget it be about midnight when the older man lay down on they blanket to sleep creedon have a big silver bull 's - eye watch and he say he always keep it go desmond pretend to lie down and go to sleep also but he head be fill with vision of the mexican 's hidden gold he have a idea that creedon 's investigation might have be very superficial he determine to make a thorough and systematic search and he actually believe he would find the hidden gold brook and creedon be good sleeper both be very weary and they be soon in a sound slumber and then desmond arise steal on tiptoe over beside creedon and secure the mask lantern a strange weird scene be certainly present there have be a big fire the ember be all aglow and illuminate the cave there lay brook and creedon look picturesque in they hunting garb and there be desmond steal on tiptoe under the glare of the firelight to secure the mask lantern have secure the lantern the lad move away and make for a crevice which promise the best result he know enough of rock conformation to go forward very carefully always flash he light ahead and study the path in advance and so slowly carefully and surely he move along until he have traverse as he calculate a distance of two hundred and fifty foot when suddenly he flashlight reveal a solid wall in front of he here we be he mutter and no mistake desmond see that he exploration in that direction have end he retrace he step and select a second crevice along which he make he way and at length he land in a pretty good size inner cave well i reckon we have get it here the lad proceed to search around with the care of a detective look for clue he do find evidence of some one have be in the cave he find the handle of a dirk a small bit of a deerskin hunting jacket and finally a little bit of pure gold he examine the latter under he lamp satisfied himself that it be a nugget of real gold in its natural state and he heart beat fast i have get it at last he mutter yes i think i know how to carry on this search creedon must have do it too hurriedly desmond feel quite proud of he success he have strike it sure as he believe and he continue he search and be intently engage when suddenly he hear a sepulchral groan at the instant he have plunge into a sort of pocket and be feel around but when he hear that groan he start back into the cave and stand as white as a sheet gaze around in every direction and there be a wild terror in he eye he stand for fully two minute gaze and listen and finally he say : great scott what be that i hear -- a groan desmond although brave and vigorous after all be but a lad of less than eighteen he could have face a grizzly bear but when it come to the supernatural he be not equal to it the fact be he be dead scared and then again he believe he have really strike the hidden recess where the old mexican 's gold be secrete the young be more susceptible to superstitious fear as a rule than older people they be not skeptical desmond listen a long time and as he do not hear the noise again and feel a intense desire to find the hidden treasure he again go to the rock pocket and plunge in but immediately there come again the groan clear distinct and unmistakable and also a voice command : go away go away do not disturb my gold the lad leap out into the main cave again and he tremble from head to foot he have never receive such a shock in all he life he have never really believe in ghost -- never think much about they indeed -- but here he have at least evidence that the dead do watch they treasure still the desire to secure the wealth be strong upon he naturally he be as we reader know very nervy and he determine to argue with the ghost he reason that the hidden wealth could be of no benefit to the spirit where he be and he think he might talk he into keep quiet it be in a tremble voice that desmond ask : be the spirit here the answer come : i be here a more experienced person than desmond would have get on to the fact that it be very strange that the spirit should answer he in such good english it be suppose to be the spirit of a mexican but spirit probably can talk any language at any rate desmond do not stop to consider do you own the gold yes why can not i have it i have find it you get away as quick as you can or i 'll seize you well well this be a great state of affair desmond do not ask any more question he seize he lamp and start to limp from the cave and he be white and tremble he make he way to creedon hall and beheld brook and creedon standing over the fire on the face of brook there be a amuse look and on creedon 's a expression of real jollity great sake desmond demand brook where have you be i awake and find you miss and creedon and i have be scare almost to death desmond try to assume a indifferent air and say : i be not sleepy so i think i would go and explore a little you have better be careful how you explore around here why well that be all i will not say any more but be careful or you may be suddenly miss what do you find boy i 'll tell you all about it in the morning the man retire to they blanket and desmond also lay down after have promise that he would not attempt to explore any more that night he do not sleep however the phantom voice the treasure and he discovery keep he awake and he lay think about ghost and goblin and he mutter hang it i never believe in ghost then as he lay there there come to he mind a recollection of the jolly look that have rest on the face of the guide and there come to he mind a suspicion and then a certainty that he have be fool he be a wonderfully sharp lad and he begin to think the whole matter over and he recall the fact that the ghost have speak good english hang I he mutter if i do not believe i have be make a victim of a huge joke and brook and creedon be both guilty in aid to give I a scare all right to-morrow we will see all about it i 'll get square desmond do fall asleep at length and when he awake brook and creedon be eat they breakfast and creedon say as desmond join they : so you be explore last night yes what do you find gold you do yes oh come off i do you think you do i do i 'll swear i do where do you find it in a cave which one of those passage lead to you find gold yes you will have to be careful careful yes why you 'll strike the ghost the ghost yes what ghost the ghost of the old mexican i do think i hear a groan tell I about the old mexican i have tell you all i know about he and i 'll tell you that in my opinion it will be dangerous to meddle with he gold even if you find it could that old mexican speak english a little only a little repeated desmond yes then it be just as i suspect i tell you i be scare at first but when the old ghost answer I -- when the ghost answer you demand creedon yes do you see the ghost i hear he -- that be i think i do -- and i speak to he but he give I back such good english i make up my mind that you do not know how to play a joke next time stick to the broken english you might have scare the life out of I then brook and creedon laugh and the latter say : well you be smart you be but lad let I tell you something : do not spend time look for the mexican 's gold why not i have explore every nook and cranny in this mountain and there be no treasure hide here but i find some gold you do yes creedon and brook stare be you in earnest i be where do you find it well i be go to consider awhile before i tell brook look desmond straight in the face and ask : boy honest do you really find gold yes i do the matter begin to assume a very serious aspect for desmond speak seriously if you find any gold lad you have beat I i do find gold on you honor yes well here we be on share tell we all about it desmond laugh in turn they have have they laugh and he have he laugh as he say : here be what i find the lad produce the little nugget he have pick up and then creedon laugh and say : by george that be the bit of gold i lose and i have a good hunt for it we hero have be impress by creedon 's statement that he have examine every nook and corner in the mountain and yet he do feel a sort of hankering notion that he could find the gold and he say : i want to explore again all right it can do no harm but i will relinquish all claim now to any gold that you may find in this cave i 'll take you at you word say desmond of course the youth have no real hope of ever find any gold but it be a known fact that such find have be make and sometimes the skeleton of the owner have be find bleaching beside they gold chapter v boy 's determination -- go through a crevice -- the movable rock -- aid to discover -- up through a hole -- the golden heap -- desmond 's great triumph -- the old mexican 's secret expose desmond be somewhat impress by the word of creedon but still insist that he would like to conduct a exploration you will only go over the ground that i have already go over i know that but i propose to look around all the same desmond have be do considerable thinking he question creedon again and again and make out that the old mexican have live in the cave along with creedon for month at a time and as he learn the old man have throw out a great many hint these hint mean something and then again if he have hide he wealth in the cave he have do it so securely and well that he have no idea of its ever be discover until such time as he see fit to disclose the fact desmond know how there be some strange conformation in the rock the very place they be in be a testimony to the strange freak that nature in its upheaval can and do create brook have nothing to say about the matter and creedon do remark finally : of course as i have say it can do no harm but be careful you do not strike -- desmond here interrupted and say : i be not afraid of ghost i have meet one and i have get use to they i do not mean a ghost i mean a crevice go very slow and carefully or you may become a ghost yourself right here we wish to exchange a few word with we reader in regard to these rock conformation right in the state of new york in ulster county and in what be call the shawangunk mountain there be some of the most wonderful cave and crevice and in some of these cave during the winter the snow drift down and in the spring become a solid mass of ice and the writer remember upon one occasion after a long and weary scramble over rock under the face of a cliff which tower up and overlook county be show a rock cave where there be a solid mass of ice which in its contour resemble a ship the ice must have be at least sixty foot in length twenty foot broad and fully forty foot high and adjoining it be all manner of cave these cave be within a few mile of several settlement and possibly at the time of the visit of the writer have not be enter by over a dozen person in these mountain be some very remarkable rock conformation and we merely mention this fact to the lad in the east who may think that these story of rock cavern be exaggerate there be probably hundred of cave in the catskill and shawangunk mountain that have never be enter or explore since the day when the early settler may have find they while bear hunting desmond have be raise as we have state near the mountain and probably have explore many rock cavern and it be because of this fact probably that he be not surprise when lead to the cave where he first behold the girl amy brook that cave still exist and be well know to many of the people live in its vicinity and in we description we adhere to almost absolute accuracy creedon be a rough and ready sort of man but not the fellow as desmond argue who would apply himself to a critical study it be a great thing to have learn the fact concern the old mexican and the lad really believe that there be gold secrete somewhere in one of the little cavity in that perforated mountain creedon start in to relate to brook the fact about the mine he believe he have discover and desmond take the mask lantern start off to explore you will burn out all my oil lad that be the only harm you will do and certainly little good i can not replenish the oil when it be burn out and i have be very careful hold it for only such occasion as when we come here across the chasm creedon explain that he have only carry with he one can of oil which have last he to date desmond start off and go direct to the crevice he have first enter and creedon smile as he see he go in there remark to brook : the lad will run up against a stone wall sure but he be enthusiastic it will be a lesson to he can not tell about that lad say brook there be method in he enthusiasm that be all right but i be camp in here one whole winter and as i tell you there be not a nook or cranny that i have not explore but there be other say brook with a odd smile on he face meantime desmond follow the crevice until he come to the stone wall he know about the same wall but he be work on a certain theory he be like the captain kidd treasure-seeker -- the discouragement of other do not in any way discourage he and we will here say that a similar persistence in any walk of life as a rule lead to great result desmond as state arrive opposite the stone wall and he commence a calm steady determine examination first appearance would have discourage any man be face as he be by a solid smooth face of rock he stand contemplate the mass before he and then with the ray of light from he lantern he run all over the rock by ginger he mutter at last i reckon it be true there do not appear a hole big enough in that rock for a spider to crawl through but hang I i have get a impression there appear to be a break in the rock just where it join with the roof of the cave desmond roll a bowlder over against the rock and mount and run he finger over the crack it be not a large crack and offer no encouragement but the lad be determine not to be satisfy until he have establish fact beyond all dispute he run he finger as state along the crack and he knuckle press against the roof and to he surprise there appear to be a loosen he examine it and he see that there be a uniform crack run along the roof inclose a space about two foot square the lad instinctively press on the center between the crack and lo there appear to be a piece of the roof that yield he press harder and satisfied himself that the piece of rock between the crack in the roof be movable the discovery cause he heart to stand still and he mutter : great scott but i have find it he flash the light on the crack and think he could discern where there have be some chisel he make every effort to shift the rock out of its place but it be too much for he owe to the fact that he could just about reach it he do not have purchase enough to exert he full strength he step down on the floor again and commence to consider and then he determine to return to the main cave and solicit brook and creedon to go to he aid when he re-enter the main cavern creedon with a laugh say : well lad do you run up against a stone wall i do i tell you it be of no use to search these crevice i have explore every inch you have yes i think not brook know desmond so well he discern that the lad have really make a discovery but he say nothing you think not eh i do that would hint that you have find something i have what have you find i do not know yet but i be certain i have find a cranny or nook that you never explore you have i have what have you find oh it may be that it be ` telling ' as the boy say creedon look at the lad in a curious way it can not be possible he say that you have find anything yes i have what have you find guess it be no time to guess what have you find i 'll show you what i have find i want you help the lad find a piece of saple about seven foot in length and say : you gentleman come with I i 'll show you something animated by great interest and curiosity brook and creedon follow desmond he lead they to the little rock cave where the crevice abut on the solid wall of rock and he say : now what do you see we see the rock be that all yes look sharp there be something you have not discover before what be it look i have look i reckon when you do look upon the occasion of you former visit you do as you be do now -- only _ look _ but you do not search have you search yes i have and you have find something yes i have what oh look i be do look then let I show you desmond take the strong piece of sapling he have bring with he and jam one end with great force against the square piece of roofing and the piece of rock move creedon gaze aghast and exclaim : by all that be strange and wonderful but i believe you have unfold the mexican 's secret i think so and now lend I you strength both of you and let 's see if we can move that loose piece of rock i 'll bet there be a opening there you be right -- yes lad you have indeed rake into the old mexican 's treasure den i can recall now some word he once speak do not spend any more time recall let 's shove that rock aside if we can the two man lend they aid to desmond and sure enough they do raise the piece of rock and by hoist it they manage to move it aside a trifle enough to reveal the fact that there be a chamber above and that the opening be through the piece of rock it be a reward of desmond 's persistence but after all it be accident that have reveal to he the opening by hard work the man finally succeed in move the rock aside and there be disclose the opening and desmond say : now let I stand on we shoulder with the light and i will tell you what it be we have find there be something there to reveal i be dead sure the two man assist desmond to they shoulder he take the lantern and shove he head through the opening and then flash the light around and with a joyful shout exclaim : we have get it this beat I dead say creedon both man be greatly excite for it do appear that they have make a great find of hidden treasure meantime desmond manage to force himself up and disappear in the cave he glance around and behold a sight that fill he with vary emotion the chamber be not more than four foot square but on the floor in one corner be a shine heap it shine under the ray of he lantern as he flash the light upon it he take a handful of the shine stuff and pass it down to creedon hand he the lantern at the same time and he say : you be a good judge tell I what that be it be gold dust cry creedon how much be there of it oh barrel full i should say great ginger lad you have strike it well it will not run away i reckon but give I you hat and i 'll fill it be that to be my share no we be only give you the first whack at it that be all desmond fill creedon 's hat with the dust and then descend and the whole party make they way to the outer cavern chapter vi discuss the find -- a new resolution -- go to creedon mine -- a disappointment -- better indication -- a new move once in the outer cavern desmond say : it be now a matter of business well how shall we divide you be the finder reply creedon you be to decide you leave it to I yes i 'll make it a even divide all round boy it be a great discovery what do you think of its value it depend upon the weight but from you description i should say we have a ten-thousand-dollar find desmond 's eye open wide and after a moment he ask : do it really belong to we it do certainly i be really the appoint heir of the old mexican but anyway treasure-trove go to the finder who can establish a right to it we can say brook you bet we can and it be ours but it be strange how the old mexican 's secret have be open up here i have have five year to search for this gold and fail to find it and this lad get on to it in one day it be a mere chance well yes to a certain extent but if you have not be so persistent you would not have develop the chance and make the find possible how do the old man accumulate this gold it be plain enough he have know some stream and have wash it and possibly it take he ten year to gather the heap you find there but how well he do it he do sure how shall we make a divide easy enough if you will let I make a suggestion certainly we will carry it all out here we run no risk no one will ever penetrate to this retreat then when we have it all cart out here we will divide it a coffee cup full at time good enough that suit I but wait i have a better proposition if you will accept it go ahead let 's leave it where it be go on to my mine and if it amount to anything we will have the capital to work it ourselves desmond glance at brook and the man say : that be a good proposition brook be less suspicious than desmond but the lad determine to accede to the proposition and it be decide that on the follow morning they would start for creedon 's mine and the guide say : we will start before daylight why we have better cross the chasm in the dark i be afraid you would hardly recross it if you be to behold once what would be underneath you it be so decide the party make all they preparation and on the follow morning before daylight with the aid of creedon 's ladder the party cross the chasm and proceed on they way toward the place where creedon 's mine be located they manage to secure enough game which they cook and have for food and commence they long march and it be a long march they have be five day on the tramp and stop one night to camp when creedon say : in the morning we will be on the ground the place where they be camp be a mountain glen and we young friend desmond be in splendid health be exceedingly happy the life thus far have be one of constant excitement and therefore at he age one of continuous enjoyment and besides to crown all he be comparatively rich as intimated creedon have value the dust at ten thousand dollar and when it should be turn into money desmond could indeed clear he mother 's farm and go to school and then to college and it be he highest ambition to obtain a fine education he be a ambitious lad creedon be restless and excited all the evening for he a great decision be to be render he have come to know that brook be indeed a expert and should the latter decide that he claim be of value it mean that for which he have be struggle a long time as he have say for fifteen year creedon do not sleep much danger would not have keep he awake but the possibility of the dawn day do cause exceed restlessness desmond notice that the woodsman do not sleep and go over and sit near he what be the matter lad why do not you sleep why do not you sleep to tell the truth i can not neither can i i do not see what keep you awake the possibility of the coming day creedon be in a thoughtful mood and desmond ask : why be you so anxious to get rich lad i 'll tell you : i be thirty-three year old i start from home when i be less than eighteen my father be a poor man living in we town be a rich man who have a lovely daughter she be just fifteen i have know she from the time we be wee little tot and we fall in love with each other although she be fifteen and i but a little past seventeen but she father be rich he

wonder you be restless and i be now as much interested in we success on you account as i be on my own i have high hope lad -- yes high hope on the morning follow the dialogue related all hand be up bright and early and they start for the mine and in two hour be on the ground creedon be pale as a picture ghost while point out to brook the indication and brook also be excite as he make he study we will not bear we reader with a account of the investigation make by brook but will state that at the end of the second day he be compel to announce that the mine be valueless desmond think he have never see a more disconsolate look on any man 's face than the one that settle over the face of creedon when the announcement be make you mine do not amount to anything in itself say brook but it carry a suggestion it be a compass that point to where a valuable mine may be find we be not in it yet to-morrow i will make a survey and i may get indication that will carry we to the ledge where the gold ore extend in pay quantity -- yes i think i can read the indication as plainly as though the road be map out brook spend two day and then say : it be all right there be a mine somewhere but i must have the proper instrument and testing utensil i will leave you and desmond here in the mountain and proceed to the nearest settlement and secure what i need creedon i can almost promise you that we will find a rich digging and it will be more accessible than this one i have a better plan say creedon what be you plan we will go and get the dust that the lad find we will carry that to the town

never board a train and lo he encounter several very thrilling adventure ere he arrive at the valley farm where kind heart beat to greet he desmond have be on the train but a few minute really when he observe a tall country-looking young fellow who fix he eye on he as have be demonstrate all through we narrative desmond be a very quick discerning chap in the language of the day he be up to snuff

he ask : do you take I for a telephone the stranger arch he eyebrow and demand : a telephone yes what make you ask that question because you yell ` hello ' in my ear i have hear about telephone but i never see one you never do no what be they like the question be ask seemingly in the most innocent manner but the keen-witted desmond 's suspicion be at once arouse and on the instant he make a curious discovery the fellow be a make-up under a disguise and consequently under immediate suspicion also so you never see a telephone never you _ tell _ I that yes we hero know he have a long journey before he he be naturally very fond of a joke and excitement and besides he have instinctive hatred for design man we hero be aware that the train as a rule be infested with sharp and the effort of the railroad company to squelch these nuisance be not altogether successful we adventurer determine to have a little amusement and if he suspicion be fully verify he be resolve to teach at least one sharp a good lesson we will repeat desmond do not look like a athlete or a youth who have see the rough side of life he could easily be mistake for a ordinarily bright youth who have much to learn so you really never see a telephone never repeat the man desmond have determine upon he course of action assume a most serious air and with the greatest earnestness graphically describe a telephone and the stranger appear to be all interest and attention and express he surprise by innocent ejaculation as we hero related the wonderful possibility of the telephone it be a amusing scene or would have be to one who be under the rose and understand that a game be be play when desmond 's description apparently as state tell in the most earnest manner the sharp as we shall call he say : well that beat I it beat anything i ever hear see here stranger you be make a fool of I with a big fish story because i be a green western man bear and raise on the prairie no i have tell you the

wonderful place you bet it be i be go there some day -- yes i have say i would see new york some day and i will it must make a man blind for a few day to go around there well yes it be rather dazzling say desmond so the conversation continue for quite a time and finally the stranger rise and go away say he would return immediately quite a respectable-looking man take the vacate seat beside desmond and the last neighbor ask : do you know that green-looking chap who be just talk to you no sir i never see he before then you do not know who he be no sir that be a son of senator f -- the richest mine owner out in this section he look like a countryman you see he be raise in the west but he be one of the most honest and good-hearted fellow in the world liberal to a fault fond of fun but a good
