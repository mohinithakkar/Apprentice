bank-note who ever hear of a editor pay for two seat at the theater since the world begin what have we ever do to offend you mr bezzle that you should behave thus sir say mr bezzle i once be young but now be old i see the error of my editorial way and have resolve to mend 'em my column be _ not _ to be buy sir my dramatic critic be not to be suborn i be determine to tear down the flaunt lie with which thespi have so long conceal she blushless face and to show the deluded public the cothurnus bespatter and the sock and buskin draggle in the mire perish my theatrical advertising column when i cease to tell the truth there be the sum twice tell : i pay my money and i take my choice never mind the change and with these word mr bezzle stalk off he face crimson with a rush of aesthetics to the head from the theater mr bezzle go to the house of a celebrated publisher who receive he with open arm and conduct he to a counter where all the newest and most expensive book be display we be just settle in we new quarter explain the publisher and any little thing you might say about we in you valuable paper would be -- i do not _ ask _ it you know -- but it would be -- upon my word it would see here mr bezzle i want you to pick out from this counter just what you want and -- sir exclaim mr bezzle leap at the publisher with eye that fairly blaze with the radiance of rectitude who do you take I for if mr bezzle have be less violent he would probably have say _ whom _ do you take I for and so have spare himself the ignominy of sink to the ungrammatical level of the common herd but the fact be he proud spirit be chafe and fret at the spectacle of sordid self-seeking that everywhere meet he gaze and excess of sentiment make he forgetful of syntax mark I my friend i be not to be buy he continue in unconscious blank verse i _ shall _ take my pick sir and _ you _ will take this check and he hand the amaze publisher a check for five hundred dollar i sicken sir he continue of this qualmish air of half-truth that i have breathe so long i be go to read these book and say what i think of 'em and five hundred dollar be dirt cheap for the privilege i have sooner that every ` new publication ' ad should die out of my newspaper than that my literary column should be contaminate with a lie never mind the change sir if anything be leave over send it to the proprietor of the new penny paper that be struggle to keep its head above water do not say that it come from I say that it come from a convert roper-in and mr bezzle stalk out of the office in such a tempest of morality that the publisher feel as though a tidal wave of virtue have sweep over he after this mr bezzle 's dream become a trifle confuse but he think that this noble course of conduct be greatly approve by the public that its eminent practicability commend it to all class of people and that theater publisher and other quadruple they advertisement ah sigh mr bezzle rub he hand but still asleep what a sweet thing virtue be honesty _ be _ the best policy after all at this moment he elbow be nudge and open he eye he behold one of the office boy whom he have send up to the theater half a hour ago to ask for six reserved seat near the stage mr puppet say he be very sorry sir say the boy but the seat be all take for to-night and so he can not send any can not send any can not he exclaim bezzle wide

turkey -- a fantasy -lrb- illustration : bishop of turkey -rrb- we hear a great deal from scientific man about the influence of climate atmosphere and even the proximity of certain mineral substance upon the life and welfare of man but there be yet another vein to be work in this region of human knowledge take a chance train of idea -- a excursion-train we may say -- which come in we way on last thanksgiving we be bring to some interesting conclusion in regard to the influence exercise by the turkey upon human affair the annual happiness of how many thousand at the return of thanksgive day -- the unfed woe of how many thousand more -- do this estimable fowl revolve within he urbane crop every kernel of grain which he pick from the barn-floor may represent a instant of masticatory joy hold in store for some as yet unconscious maxillary we may weigh the bird by the amount of happiness he will afford when we go to market to barter for we thanksgive turkey we inquire substantially of the spruce vender glisten in he white apron : how much gustatory delight do yonder cock contain and he gross slave of matter doth respond give the estimate in dollar and part of dollar but how inadequate be any material representative of he value to we indeed it be next to impossible to conceive of the nicety involve in this question of how much we owe the turkey for he the country air have be sweeten the rain have fall that he might thrive the wheat and barley sprout that he might be feed a shade more of leanness in the leg one jot less of rotundity in the breast -- what misery might not these seemingly trivial incident have create a failure in the supply of turkey -- it would have be a national calamity what be life indeed without the turkey as for thanksgive the turkey he be it _ pari c'est la france _ remove the turkey and you undermine thanksgive how could a conscientious man go to church on thanksgive morning know within himself that he shall return to beef or mutton or veal for he dinner as on work-day i tell you religion would disappear with the turkey toward the close of thanksgive how manifest become the influence of this feathered sovereign observe yonder jaundiced youth pacing the street moodily he lip set in a cynic sneer he turkey be lean i know it he can not hide that turkey the gaunt fowl obtrude himself from every part on the other hand none but the primest of prime turkey could have set in motion this brisk old gentleman with the ruddy check and hale clear eye whom we next pass a most stanch and royal turkey lurk behind that portly front -- a sound and fresh animal with plenty of cranberry to boot -- what be these soldier carpet-knight who have unite they thanks over a grand regimental banquet what frisky gobbler they have share in to be sure they prance and amble over the pavement as if they have absorb the very soul of chanticleer and fancy themselves once more prince of the barnyard the most singular and freakish of the turkey 's manifestation this by far indeed on a review of these suggestive fact we can not but feel a marvellous reverence for the potent cock establish as patron of this feast this sentiment be wide-spread among we people and perhaps it be not too fanciful to predict that it will some day expand itself to a _ cultus _ like that of the egyptian api or more properly the stork of japan the advanced civilization of the chinese indeed have already make the chicken a object of religious veneration in the slow march of age we shall perhaps develop we as yet crude and imperfect religion into a exalted worship of the turkey then shall the symbolic bird truss as for thanksgive be enshrine in all we temple and the multitude make pilgrimage from afar to such sanctuary shall be greet by a

earnest man who insist upon improve everything after they own fashion and who be unhappy because they do not have the opportunity of make the solar year consist of a even number of day and because they be not present at the building of the ark in order to urge upon noah the propriety of attach a screw propeller to that primitive great eastern these horribly energetic nuisance never find anything that precisely suit they and be always insist that everything stand in need of the improvement which they gratuitously suggest latterly they have venture to attack _ rip van winkle _ -- not the actor but the play -- and to insist that the closing scene should be so modify as to make the play a temperance lecture of the most unmistakable character if you recollect -- as of course you do -- the last scene in that exquisite drama you can still hear rip 's tremulous voice as he say i will take my pipe and my glass and will tell my strange story to all my friend and i will drink _ you _ good health and you family 's and may you live long and prosper and now come the progressive nuisance and ask mr jefferson to change this end so that it will read as follow : -- gretchen -- here be you glass rip rip -- but i swear off gretchen -- bless you my husband promise I never more to touch the intoxicating beer-mug rip -- i promise hereafter i will take my tupper 's proverbial philosophy and my glass of water and i will daily address all my friend on the subject of total abstinence from everything that cheer whether it inebriate or not and i will now close this evening 's lecture by a appeal to the audience now present to take warning by I and never drink a drop of lager-beer think my friend what would be the feeling of you respective wife should you return home after a drunken sleep of twenty or thirty year and find they all marry to richer husband think how they would revile the weakness of the beer which could not keep you asleep forever think how you would complicate the real estate business when you come to turn out the mistaken people who have occupy improve and sell you property during you brief absence think of the difficulty that would arise from the increase in the size of you family which would probably have take place while you be sleep out in the open air and for which you would have to provide although you have not be consult in the matter think too of the extent to which you would be interview by the reporter of the _ sun _ and the atrocious libel concern yourselve and you family which that unclean sheet would publish think of all these thing my friend and then step into the box-office on you way out and sign the total abstinence pledge the usher will now make a collection for the support of the temperance cause mr mollenhauer will please lead the audience in singing that beautiful temperance anthem -- ` cold water be the only thing worth loving here below the man who will not its praise sing will straight to hade go ' now for one i do not like this improve version of rip of course the temperance reformer will construe this expression of opinion into a admission that every man woman or advocate of female suffrage who have ever write a line for punchinello be a confirm drunkard in spite of this probability i still have the courage to maintain that so long as mr jefferson be a artist and not a temperance lecturer he need not mix up the drama with the temperance reform or any other hobby if he be to be compel to deliver a temperance address every time he play _ rip van winkle _ let we compel mr greeley to play rip every time he give a temperance lecture if the latter catastrophe be to happen the punishment of the reform nuisance would be complete there be however play which could be change so as to terminate much more naturally and effectively than they now do for example there be _ enoch arden _ at present enoch when he look through the window and see he wife enjoy herself with philip in the dining-room immediately lie down on the grass-plat in the back-yard and groan in a most harrowing style -- after which he pick himself up and go back to he hotel die without so much as recognize he old friend and congratulating they upon they prosperity now the way in which the play should have end have the dramatist wish to convince we that enoch be a reasonable be would have be somewhat as follow : -- enoch -lrb- look through the window -rrb- -- well here be a go my wife have actually marry philip they look pretty comfortable too philip be evidently rich here 's luck for I at last i have get he where i can strike he pretty heavily _ -lrb- he enter the house -rrb- _ philip and he wife -- enoch can it be possible why we think you be entirely dead and so we marry well well this be a healthy state of thing enoch -lrb- sternly -rrb- -- mr philip ray you have have the impertinence to marry my wife sir i consider that you have take a unjustifiable liberty have you anything to say for yourself before i proceed to shoot you i might mention that i once have a third cousin whose aunt by marriage be slightly insane so you see that i can kill you with a calm certainty that the jury will acquit I on the ground of my hereditary insanity philip -- take a drink old boy we 'll be reasonable about this matter do not attempt murder -- it be no longer respectable since mcfarland go into the business why can not we compromise this affair enoch -- it will cost you something there be my lacerated feeling which can not be repair without a good deal of expense still i will do the fair thing by you give I fifty thousand dollar and i 'll leave the country and say nothing more about it you can keep my wife if you want she i be sure _ i _ do not philip -- but i have be to a good deal of expense about she she clothes have cost I no end of money and there be all we new child besides child let I tell you be a great deal more expensive now than they be in you day now i 'll give you twenty thousand dollar and you wife and we 'll call it square enoch -- no sir i do not want the wife and i insist on more than twenty thousand dollar i have get you entirely in my power and you know it i 'll come down to forty thousand dollar but not a cent less draw a check on the bank or i 'll draw a revolver on you be quick about it too for my hereditary insanity may develop itself at any moment philip -- well if i must i must here be you money how do you leave thing at -- well at the place you come from everybody well i hope enoch -- there be no people and consequently nothing to drink there do not speak of the wretched place thanks for the check hope you 'll find you wife satisfactory let this be a warn to you not to marry a widow another time unless you have a sure thing do not believe she when she say she husband be dead unless you have he dig up and personally inspect he bone thank you i _ will _ take another drink since you insist upon it here be luck you 'll agree with I that this be the best day 's work i have ever do good-by i be off to chicago now would not that be the way in which enoch would have act have he be a practical business man you see the play thus alter be eminently probable not to say realistic i have several more improved catastrophe which if substitute for the present ending of some of we more recent popular play would render they quite perfect _ hamlet _ especially need change in this respect some of these day i will show the reader of punchinello how shakspeare should have end that drama i rather think they will agree with I that shakspeare clever as he doubtless be
