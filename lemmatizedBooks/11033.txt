arrangement be not to master charley 's mind a fig do he care for german but the kitty he must have whether or no -- and kitty he would find in that particular book -- so he turn its leaf over in great haste half of the time on the second day of trial have go when amy return and mr jame with a sigh leave she nursery before one o'clock she be twice call into the kitchen to superintend some

receive she caller she have to smile when she feel little like it -- to be sociable when she thought be busy with she task she friend make a long call -- they have nothing else to do with they time and when they go other come in very unsatisfactory chit-chat she morning slip away on the next day mr jame invite company to tea and she morning be devote to prepare for it she do not enter she study on the day follow a sick-head-ache confine she to she bed and on Saturday the care of the baby devolve upon she as amy have extra work to do thus pass the first week true to she promise mr jame patiently persevere for a month in she effort to secure for herself this little fragment of she broken time but with what success the first week 's history can tell with its close close the month of December on the last day of the old year she be so much occupy in she preparation for the morrow 's festival that the last hour of the day be approach before she make she good night 's call in the nursery she first go to the crib and look at the baby there he lay in he innocence and beauty fast asleep she softly stroke he golden hair -- she kiss gently he rosy cheek -- she press the little dimpled hand in hers and then carefully draw the coverlet over it tuck it in and steal yet another kiss -- she leave he to he peaceful dream and sit down on she daughter 's bed she also sleep sweetly with she dolly hug to she bosom at this she mother smile but soon grave thought enter she mind and these deepen into sad one she think of she disappointment and the failure of she plan to she not only the past month but the whole past year seem to have be one of fruitless effort -- all broken and disjointed -- even she hour of religious duty have be encroach upon and disturbed she have accomplish nothing that she could see but to keep she house and family in order and even this to she saddened mind seem to have be but indifferently do she be conscious of yearning for a more earnest life than this unsatisfied longing for something which she have not attain often cloud what otherwise would have be a bright day to she and yet the cause of these feeling seem to lie in a dim and misty region which she eye could not penetrate what then do she need to see some _ result _ from she life 's work to know that a golden cord bind she life-thread together into _ unity _ of purpose -- notwithstanding they seem so often single and broken she be quite sure that she feel no desire to shrink from duty however humble but she sigh for some comforting assurance of what _ be duty _ she employment conflict as they do with she taste seem to she frivolous and useless it seem to she that there be some better way of living which she from deficiency in energy of character or of principle have fail to discover as she lean over she child she tear fall fast upon its young brow most earnestly do she wish that she could shield that child from the disappointment and mistake and self-reproach from which the mother be then suffer that the little one might take up life where she could give it to she -- all mend by she own experience it would have be a comfort to have feel that in fight the battle she have fight for both yet she know that so it could not be -- that for ourselves must we all learn what be those thing which make for we peace the tear be in she eye as she give the good-night to she sleeping daughter -- then with soft step she enter a adjoining room and there fairly kiss out the old year on another chubby cheek which nestle among the pillow at length she seek she own rest soon she find herself in a singular place she be traverse a vast plain no tree be visible save those which skirt the distant horizon and on they broad top rest wreath of golden cloud before she be a female who be journey towards that region of light little child be about she now in she arm now run by she side and as they travel she occupy herself in care for they she teach they how to place they little foot -- she give they timely warning of the pit-fall -- she gently lift they over the stumbling-block when they be weary she soothe they by singing of that brighter land which she keep ever in view and towards which she seem hasten with she little flock but what be most remarkable be that all unknown to she she be constantly watch by two angel who repose on two golden cloud which float above she before each be a golden book and a pen of gold one angel with mild and loving eye peer constantly over she right shoulder -- another keep as strict watch over she left not a deed not a word not a look escape they notice when a good deed word look go from she the angel over the right shoulder with a glad smile write it down in he book when a evil however trivial the angel over the left shoulder record it in he book -- then with sorrowful eye follow the pilgrim until he observe penitence for the wrong upon which he drop a tear on the record and blot it out and both angel rejoice to the looker-on it seem that the traveller do nothing which be worthy of such careful record sometimes she do but bathe the weary foot of she little child but the angel over the _ right shoulder _ -- write it down sometimes she do but patiently wait to lure back a little truant who have turn he face away from the distant light but the angel over the _ right shoulder _ -- write it down sometimes she do but soothe a angry feeling or raise a droop eye-lid or kiss away a little grief but the angel over the right shoulder -- _ write it down _ sometimes she eye be fix so intently on that golden horizon and she become so eager to make progress thither that the little one miss she care do languish or stray then it be that the angel over the _ leave shoulder _ lift he golden pen and make the entry and follow she with sorrowful eye until he could blot it out sometimes she seem to advance rapidly but in she haste the little one have fall back and it be the sorrowing angel who record she progress sometimes so intent be she to gird up she loin and have she lamp trim and burn that the little child wander away quite into forbid path and it be the angel over the _ leave shoulder _ who record she diligence now the observer as she look feel that this be a faithful and true record and be to be keep to that journey 's end the strong clasp of gold on those golden book also impress she with the conviction that when they be close it would only be for a future open she sympathy be warmly enlist for the gentle traveller and with a beating heart she quicken she step that she might overtake she she wish to tell she of the angel keep watch above she -- to entreat she to be faithful and patient to the end -- for she life 's work be all write down -- every item of it -- and the _ result _ would be know when those golden book should be unclasped she wish to beg of she to think no duty trivial which must be do for over she right shoulder and over she left be record angel who would surely take note of all eager to warn the traveller of what she have see she touch she the traveller turn and she recognize or seem to recognize _ herself _ startle and alarm she awake

she return the merry greet most heartily it seem to she as if she have enter upon a new existence she have find she way through the thicket in which she have be entangled and a light be now about she path the _ angel over the right shoulder _ whom she have see in she dream would bind up in he golden book she life 's work if it be but well do he require of she no great deed but faithfulness and patience to the end of the race which be set before she now she could see plainly enough that though it be right and important for she to cultivate she own mind and heart it be equally right and equally important to meet and perform faithfully all those little household care and duty on which the comfort and virtue of she family depend for into these thing the angel carefully look -- and these duty and care acquire a dignity from the stroke of that golden pen -- they could not be neglect without danger sad thought and sadder misgiving -- undefined yearning and ungratified longing seem to have take they flight with the old year and it be with fresh resolution and cheerful hope and a happy heart she welcome the _ glad _ new year the _ angel over the right shoulder _ would go with she
