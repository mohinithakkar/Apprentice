six o'clock give way to those of nine they of nine to the generation of twelve and they of twelve disappear and make room for the fashionable world who have make two o'clock the noon of the day now since of these people they who rise at six pique themselves on they early rising in reference to those who rise at nine and they in they turn on theirs in reference to those who rise at twelve since like homer 's generation they successive rise and early rising be therefore as i say a phrase only intelligible by comparison we must -lrb- as theologian and politician ought oftener to do -rrb- set out by a definition of term what be early rising be it to rise what time the shepherd blowing of he nail can neither call it perfect day nor night patience i think i hear some of my fair reader exclaim be this the early rising this new correspondent of the mirror mean to enforce drag we from we bed at peep of day the visionary barbarian why ferocious as we innovator be he would just as soon drag a tigress from she 's we will not obey this self-appointed dictator stay gentle lady in the first place i be not go to enforce this or any other hour in the second place i be not go to enforce early rising at all -- convinced you feel with I the importance of time and you responsibility for its right improvement i leave it to you conscience whether any part of it should be uselessly squander in you bed the moral culpability of late rising be when it interfere with the necessary duty of the day and though my fair reader you may in a great measure claim exemption from these i would still simply in reference to you health and complexion advise you not to exceed seven o'clock but to effect this a sine quâ non be retire early say at eleven -- -lrb- though really i be too liberal -rrb- -- when people be compel to retire at the sound of the curfew when the curfew toll have the parting knell of day early rise be a necessary consequence as they be earlier tire of they bed and this may account for the singular difference between ancient and modern time in this respect so that late rise though a modern refinement be by no means exclusively attributable to modern luxury and indolence but partly to a change of political enactment -lrb- you see lady i be give you every chance -rrb- in the man of business late rising be perfectly detestable but to he instead of the argument of health and moral responsibility for time -lrb- or rather in addition to these argument -rrb- i would urge the argumentum ad crumenam which be so pithily however homelily express in these two proverb which he can not be remind of once too often : early to bed and early to rise will make a man healthy wealthy and wise there be no gain without pain then plough deep while sluggard sleep and a third proverb be a compendium of my advice to both class of reader : he who will thrive must rise at five he who have thriven may sleep till seven so then we have define what early rise be seven to those who have nothing to do -- as soon as ever business call to those who have be ever bed of sloth more eloquently reprobate than in the follow line from the _ season _ falsely luxurious will not

late riser sleep often till noon and when once reproach for he sluggishness observe that he feel so comfortable he really see no motive for rise as if accord to the popular version of the story i be convince in theory of the advantage of early rising who know it not but what can cato do ay he be a good divine you say who follow he own teaching do not talk to we of early rising after this why not unless like thomson you be keep up till a very late hour by business the fact be he do not -- in that gloomy state remain longer than nature crave after all he have a strong apology for not rise early in the late hour of he lie down the deep silence of the night be the time he commonly choose for study and he would often be hear walk in he library at richmond till near morning hum over what he be to write out and correct the next day and so good reader this be no argument against my position but observe retire late be no excuse for late rise unless business have detain you : ball and supper be no apology for habitual late rising and now my dearest reader do you spend the night precisely as thomson do and i 'll grant you my letter patent license and protection to sleep till noon every day of

and wickedness the singular perseverance of the conspirator be show by the fact that so early as in lend of the year 1603 robert catesby who appear to have be the prime mover of the plot in a conversation with thoma wintor and john wright first break with they about a design for deliver england from she bondage and to replant the catholic religion wintor express himself doubtful whether so grand a scheme could be accomplish when catesby inform he that he have project a plan for that purpose which be no less than to blow up the parliament house with gunpowder wintor consent to join in the scheme and at the suggestion of catesby go over to flander to arrange some preliminary affair there and to communicate the design to mr fawke who be personally know to catesby at ostend wintor be introduce to mr fawke by sir wm stanley guy fawke be a man of desperate character in he person he be tall and athletic he countenance be manly and the determine expression of he feature be not a little heighten by a profusion of brown hair and a auburn-coloured beard he be descend from a respectable family in yorkshire and have soon squander the property he inherit at the decease of he father he restless spirit associate itself with the discontented and factious of he age wintor and fawke come over to england together and shortly after meet catesby thoma percy and john wright in a house behind st clement 's where in a chamber with no other person present each administer a oath of secresy to the other and then go into another room to hear mass and to receive the sacrament percy be then send to hire a house fit for they purpose and find one belong to mr whinniard yeoman to the king 's wardrobe of the bed then in the occupation of one henry ferrer of which after some negociation

be to obtain a easy communication with the upper parliament house and by digging through the wall that separate they to form a extensive mine under the foundation a house be also hire in lambeth to serve as a depository for the powder and mr key who be then admit as one of the number be place in charge the whole party then disperse and agree to meet again at michaelma at michaelma it be resolve that the time be arrive when they should commence work at they mine but various cause hinder they from begin till within a fortnight of christmas the party at that time consist of five then enter upon they work and have first provide themselves with baked meat that they might not have occasion to leave the house they work incessantly till christmas eve underpropp the wall as they proceed with wood a little before christmas christopher wright be add to the number and find they work to be extremely laborious the wall be upward of three yard in thickness they afterwards admit robert wintor to assist they take advantage of the long and dreary night between christmas and candlema they then bring they powder over from lambeth in a boat and lodge it in percy 's house and afterwards continue to labor at the mine in the easter follow -lrb- 1605 -rrb- as they be at they work the whole party be dreadfully alarm on hear a rush noise near they but on inquiry they find no danger menace they but that it proceed from the removal of some coal in a adjoining vault under the parliament house nothing could be more propitious for the conspirator and ascertain that it belong to the same party of whom they hold the house but in the possession of a man of the name of skinner they lose no time in purchase the good-will of skinner and eventually hire the vault of whinniard at the rate of four pound per annum abandon they original intention of form a mine under the wall they place the powder in this vault and afterwards gradually convey into it three thousand billet of wood and five hundred fagot guy fawke arrange they in order make the place clean and neat in order that if any stranger by accident or otherwise enter the house no suspicion might be excite fawke then go into flander to inform sir w stanley and mr owen of they progress and return in the follow August catesby meeting percy at bath propose that himself should have authority to call in whom he please as at that time they be but few in number and be very short of money this be accede to he impart the design to sir everard digby franci tresam ambrose rookewood and john grant digby promise to subscribe one thousand five hundred pound and tresam two thousand pound percy engage to procure all he could of the duke of northumberland 's rent which would amount to about four thousand pound and to furnish ten good horse thus far every thing have prosper with the conspirator success have follow every effort they have make on Thursday evening the 24th of October eleven day before the intended meeting of parliament a anonymous letter be put into the hand of the servant of lord monteagle warn he lordship not to attend the parliament that season for that god and man have concur to punish the wickedness of the time it be a most extraordinary fact that the conspirator know of the delivery of this letter to the lord monteagle and that it be in the possession of the earl of salisbury secretary of state for eight day before the disclosure take place as develop in thoma wintor 's confession take before the lord 's commissioner on the 23rd of November 1605 yet so strong be they infatuation and so desperately have they set they fortune on the event that they unanimously resolve to abyde the uttermost tryall the generally receive opinion have be that it be to the sagacity and penetration of king jame that the detection of the conspiracy must be ascribe and that it be he majesty who first suggest the agency of gunpowder : but the earl of salisbury in a letter to sir charle cornwalli ambassador at madrid assert that in a conversation between the earl of suffolk -lrb- lord chamberlain -rrb- and himself on perusal of the anonymous letter the employment of gunpowder first occur to they and that the king subsequently concur in _ they _ opinion the letter after have be communicate to several of the privy council be shewn to the king three or four day before the opening of parliament who with great prudence give order that no notice whatever should be take of it but that every thing should go on as usual until the very day appoint on Saturday the lord chamberlain accord to the customary form of he office previous to the meeting of every parliament view every room and cellar belong to the parliament house and amongst other the identical vault in which the wood and powder be deposit and observe a man who subsequently prove to be guy fawke stand there to answer any question that might have be ask the lord chamberlain then go to the privy council and report what he have see after much discussion it be resolve that a more minute search should be make under pretence of seek for steal goods in order that no suspicion might arise if nothing should be discover accordingly on Monday at midnight sir t knyvett accompany by a small band of man go to percy 's house where at the door they find guy fawke with he clothes and boot on sir thoma immediately apprehend he and then proceed to search the house and vault and upon remove some of the wood they soon discover the powder ready prepared for the explosion then directly afterwards search guy fawke they find on he three match and other instrument for set fire to the train he confess himself guilty and boldly declare that if he have happen to have be within the house when sir t knyvett apprehend he he would instantly have blow he up house and all on the arrest of guy fawke such of the conspirator as at the time be in london flee into the country to meet catesby at dunchurch accord to previous arrangement and after take some horse out of a stable at warwick they reach robert wintor 's house at huddington on the Wednesday night on Thursday morning the whole party amount to about twenty person confess themselves to hammond a priest receive absolution from he and partook of the sacrament together and then with they follower and servant proceed to lord windsor 's house at hewell from whence they take a great quantity of armor and weapon they then pass into staffordshire and by night reach the house of stephen littleton call holbeach house about two mile from stourbridge by this time the whole country be raise in pursuit of the rebel and a large party under the direction of sir richard walshe high sheriff of worcestershire early on Friday morning arrive at holbeach house the party in the house -- consist of catesby percy sir e digby robert john and thoma wintor grant rookewood the two wright stephen littleton and they servant -- find they condition now to be desperate determine to fight resolutely to the last treat the summons to surrender with contempt and defy they pursuer a singular accident however put a end to all conference between the party some gunpowder which the conspirator have provide for they defense prove damp they have place nearly two pound in a pan near the fire to dry and a person incautiously rake together the fading ember a spark fly into the pan ignite the powder which blow up with a great explosion shatter the house and severely maim catesby rookewood and grant but the most remarkable circumstance be that about sixteen pound of powder in a linen bag which be actually under the pan wherein the powder explode be blow through the roof of the house and fall into the court-yard amongst the assailant without ignite or even burst sir r walshe then give order for a general assault to be make upon the house and in the attack that follow thoma wintor go into the court-yard be the first who be wound have receive a shot in the shoulder which disable he the next be mr wright and after he the younger wright who be both kill rookewood be then wound catesby now see all be lose and they condition totally hopeless exclaim to thoma wintor tom we will die together wintor could only answer by point to he disabled arm that hang useless by he side and as they be speak catesby and percy be strike dead at the same instant and the rest then surrender themselves into the hand of the sheriff at the end of January 1606 the whole of the conspirator at that time in custody be eight in number be bring to they trial in westminster hall and be all try upon one indictment except sir

that purpose of he participation in the plot there be no doubt and he admit himself criminal in not reveal it although as he assert it be impart to he only in confession : but it be more than probable that the valuable papers lately rescue from oblivion and preserve in he majesty 's state paper office will be able to prove he extensive connexion with the plot he knowledge of it both _ in _ and _ out _ of confession and he influential character with all the conspirator garnet be hang on the 3rd of may 1606 on a scaffold erect for that purpose at the west end of st paul 's church hold up to

believe its maligner calai be no better than a sort of alsatium to england a kind of extension of the rule of the king 's bench the same person would persuade you that america be something between a

refuge to some of those who have the wit to prefer free limb and fresh air to a prison it would be all that be agreeable and genteel it seem to be think that a certain ci-devant leader of fashion have

interesting by mere dignity of mind and rectitude of principle assist by unpretend good sense and temper without any of the beauty grace talent accomplishment and wit to which a heroine of romance be suppose to have a prescriptive right if the portrait be receive with interest by the public i be conscious how much it be owe to the truth and force of the original sketch which i regret that i be unable to present to the public as it be write with much feeling and spirit _ bride of lammermoor _ -- the terrible catastrophe of the bride of lammermoor actually occur in a scottish family of rank the female relative by whom the melancholy tale be communicate to I many year since be a near connexion of the family in which the event happen and always tell it with a appearance of melancholy mystery which enhance the interest she have know in she youth the brother who ride before the unhappy victim to the fatal altar who though then a mere boy and occupy almost entirely with the gallantry of he own appearance in the bridal procession could not but remark that the hand of he sister be moist and cold as that of a statue it be unnecessary further to withdraw the veil from this scene of family distress nor although it occur more than a hundred year since might it be altogether agreeable to the representative of the family concern in the narrative it may be proper to say that the event be imitate but i have neither the means nor intention of copy the manners or trace the character of the person concern in the real story _ the antiquary _ -- the character of jonathan oldbuck in the antiquary be partly found on that of a old friend of my youth to whom i be indebted for introduce I to shakspeare and other invaluable favor but i think i have so completely disguise the likeness that it could not be recognize by any one now alive i be mistaken however and indeed have endanger what i desire should be consider as a secret for i afterwards learn that a highly respectable gentleman one of the few survive friend of my father and a acute critic have say upon the appearance of the work that he be now convince who be the author of it as he recognize in the antiquary trace of the character of a very intimate friend of my father 's family _ waverley _ -- the sort of exchange of gallantry between the baron of bradwardine and col talbot be a literal fact -lrb- for the real

supply by highland torch-bearer be lay and win by one of the mac donald of keppoch \* \* \* \* \* i may however before dismiss the subject allude to the various locality which have be affix to some of the scenery introduce into these novel by which for example wolf 's - hope be identify with fast castle in berwickshire tillietudlem with draphane in clydesdale and the valley in the monastery call glendearg with the dale of the allan above lord somerville 's villa near melrose i can only say that in these and other instance i have no purpose of describe any particular local spot and the resemblance must therefore be of that general kind which necessarily exist betwixt scene of the same character the iron-bound coast of scotland afford upon its headland and promontory fifty such castle as wolf 's - hope every country have a valley more or less resemble glendearg and if castle like tillietudlem or mansion like the baron of bradwardine 's be now less frequently to be meet with it be owe to the rage of indiscriminate destruction which have remove or ruin so many monument of antiquity when they be not protect by they inaccessible situation -- the scrap of poetry which have be in most case tack to the beginning of chapter in these novel be sometimes quote either from read or from memory but in the general case be pure invention i find it too troublesome to turn to the collection of the british poet to discover apposite motto and in the situation of the theatrical mechanist who when the white paper which represent he shower of snow be exhaust continue the storm by snow brown i draw on my memory as long as i could and when that fail eke it out with invention i believe that in some case where actual name be affix to the suppose quotation it would be to little purpose to seek they in the work of the author refer to -- and now the reader may expect I while in the confessional to explain the motive why i have so long persist in disclaim the work of which i be now write to this it would be difficult to give any other reply save that of corporal nym -- it be the humor or caprice of the time it be not until i have attain the age of thirty year that i make any serious attempt at distinguish myself as a author and at that period man 's hope desire and wish have usually acquire something of a decisive character and be not eagerly and easily divert into a new channel when i make the discovery -- for to I it be one -- that by amusing myself with composition which i feel a delightful occupation i could also give pleasure to other and become aware that literary pursuit be likely to engage in future a considerable portion of my time i feel some alarm that i might acquire those habit of jealousy and fretfulness which have lessen and even degrade the character of the child of imagination and render they by petty squabble and mutual irritability the laughing-stock of the people of the world i resolve therefore in this respect to guard my breast -lrb- perhaps a unfriendly critic may add my brow -rrb- with triple brass and as much as possible to avoid rest my thought and wish upon literary success lest i should endanger my own peace of mind and tranquillity by literary failure it would argue either stupid apathy or ridiculous affectation to say that i have be insensible to the public applause when i have be honor with its testimony and still more highly do i prize the invaluable friendship which some temporary popularity have enable I to form among those most distinguish by talent and genius and which i venture to hope now rest upon a basis more firm than the circumstance which give rise to they yet feel all these advantage as a man ought to do and must do i may say with truth and confidence that i have taste of the intoxicating cup with moderation and that i have never either in conversation or correspondence encourage discussion respect my own literary pursuit on the contrary i have usually find such topic even when introduce from motive most flattering to myself rather embarrassing and disagreeable i have now frankly tell my motive for concealment so far as i be conscious of have any and the public will forgive the egotism of the detail as what be necessarily connect with it i have only to repeat that i avow myself in print as formerly in word the sole and unassisted author of all the novel publish as the composition of the author of waverley i ought to mention before conclude that twenty person at least be either from intimacy or from the confidence which circumstance render necessary participant of this secret and as there be no instance to my knowledge of any one of the number break the confidence require from they i be the more oblige to they because the slight and trivial character of the
