produce by robert j hall sea-power and other study by admiral sir cyprian bridge gcb preface the essay collect in this volume be republish in the hope that they may be of some use to those who be interested in naval history the aim have be to direct attention to certain historical occurrence and condition which the author venture to think have be often misunderstand a endeavor have be make to show the continuity of the operation of sea-power throughout history and the importance of recognize this at the present day in some case specially relate to we navy at different period a revision of the more commonly accept conclusion -- form it be believe on imperfect knowledge -- be ask for it be also hope that the intimate connection between naval history in the strict sense and military history in the strict sense have be make apparent and likewise the fact that both be in reality branch of the general history of a nation and not something altogether distinct from and outside it in a collection of essay on kindred subject some repetition be inevitable but it be believe that they will be find present only to a moderate extent in the follow page my nephew mr j s c bridge have very

to indicate two distinct though cognate thing the affinity of these two and the indiscriminate manner in which the term have be apply to each have tend to obscure its real significance the obscurity have be deepen by the frequency with which the term have be confound with the old phrase ` sovereignty of the sea ' and the still current expression ` command of the sea ' a discussion -- etymological or even archæological in character -- of the term must be undertake as a introduction to the explanation of its now generally accept mean it be one of those compound word in which a teutonic and a latin -lrb- or romance -rrb- element be combine and which be easily form and become widely current when the sea be concern of such be ` sea-coast ' ` sea-force ' -lrb- the ` land - and sea-force ' use to be a common designation of what we now call the ` army and navy ' -rrb- ` sea-service ' ` sea-serpent ' and ` sea-officer ' -lrb- now supersede by ` naval officer ' -rrb- the term in one form be as old as the fifteenth century edward iii in commemoration of the naval victory of sluy coin gold ` noble ' which bear on one side he effigy ` crown standing in a large ship holding in one hand a sword and in the other a shield ' a anonymous poet who write in the reign of henry vi say of this coin : for four thing we noble showeth to I king ship and sword and _ power_of_the_sea _ even in its present form the term be not of very recent date grote -lrb- 2 -rrb- speak of ` the conversion of athen from a land-power into a sea-power ' in a lecture publish in 1883 but probably deliver earlier the late sir j r seeley say that ` commerce be sweep out of the mediterranean by the besom of the turkish sea-power ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- the term also occur in vol xviii of the ` encyclopædia britannica ' publish in 1885 at p 574 of that volume -lrb- art persium -rrb- we be tell that themistocle be ` the founder of the attic sea-power ' the sense in which the term be use differ in these extract in the first it mean what we generally call a ` naval power ' -- that be to say a state have a considerable navy in contradistinction to a ` military power ' a state with a considerable army but only a relatively small navy in the last two extract it mean all the element of the naval strength of the state refer to and this be the meaning that be now generally and be likely to be exclusively attach to the term owe to the brilliant way in which it have be elucidate by captain a t mahan of the united state navy in a series of remarkable work -lrb- 4 -rrb- the double use of the term be common in german though in that language both part of the compound now in use be teutonic one instance out of many may be cite from the historian adolf holm -lrb- 5 -rrb- he say -lrb- 6 -rrb- that athen be in possession of a good naval port could become ' _ eine_bedeutende _ _ seemacht _ ' ie a important naval power he also say -lrb- 7 -rrb- that gelon of syracuse besides a large army -lrb- _ heer _ -rrb- have ' _ eine _ _ bedeutende_seemacht _ ' mean a considerable navy the term in the first of the two sens be old in german as appear from the follow extract from zedler 's ` gross universal lexicon ' vol xxxvi : -lrb- 8 -rrb- ` seemachten seepotenzen latin _ summae _ _ potestates_mari_potentes _ ' ` seepotenzen ' be probably quite obsolete now it be interesting as show that german no more abhor teuto-latin or teuto-romance compound than english we may note as a proof of the indeterminate meaning of the expression until he own epoch-making work have appear that mahan himself in he earliest book use it in both sens he say -lrb- 9 -rrb- ` the spanish netherland cease to be a sea-power ' he allude -lrb- 10 -rrb- to the development of a nation as a ` sea-power ' and -lrb- 11 -rrb- to the inferiority of the confederate state ` as a sea-power ' also -lrb- 12 -rrb- he remark of the war of the spanish succession that ` before it england be one of the sea-power after it she be _ the _ sea-power without any second ' in all these passage as appear from the use of the indefinite article what be mean be a naval power or a state in possession of a strong navy the other meaning of the term form the general subject of he writings above enumerate in he earlier work mahan write ` sea power ' as two word but in a publish letter of the 19th February 1897 he join they with a hyphen and defend this formation of the term and the sense in which he use it we may regard he as the virtual inventor of the term in its more diffused meaning for -- even if it have be employ by earlier writer in that sense -- it be he beyond all question who have give it general currency he have make it impossible for anyone to treat of sea-power without frequent reference to he writings and conclusion -lrb-

mere literary interest in the fact that the term in another language be use more than two thousand year ago before mahan no historian -- not even one of those who specially devoted themselves to the narration of naval occurrence -- have evince a more correct appreciation of the general principle of naval warfare than thucydide he allude several time to the importance of get command of the sea this country would have be save some disaster and be less often in peril have british writer -- take as guide by the public -- possess the same grasp of the true principle of defense as thucydide exhibit one passage in he history be worth quote brief as it be it show that on the subject of sea-power he be a predecessor of mahan in a speech in favor of prosecute the war which he put into the mouth of pericle these word occur : -- _ oi_meu _ _ gar_ouch_exousiu_allaeu_autilabeiu_amachei_aemiu_de_esti _ _ gae_pollae_kai_eu_uaesois_kai_kat_aepeirou_mega_gar _ _ to_tes_thalassaes_kratos _ the last part of this extract though often translate ` command of the sea ' or ` dominion of the sea ' really have the wider meaning of sea-power the ` power of the sea ' of the old english poet above quote this wider meaning should be attach to certain passage in herodotus -lrb- 13 -rrb- which have be generally interpret ` command the sea ' or by the mere titular and honorific ` have the dominion of the sea ' one editor of herodotus ch f baehr do however see exactly what be mean for with reference to the allusion to polycrate he say _ classe_maximum_valuit _ this be perhaps as exact a definition of sea-power as could be give in a sentence -lrb- footnote 13 : _ herodotus _ iii 122 in two place v83 -rrb- it be however impossible to give a definition which would be at the same time succinct and satisfactory to say that ` sea-power ' mean the sum-total of the various element that go to make up the naval strength of a state would be in reality to beg the question mahan lay down the ` principal condition affect the sea-power of nation ' but he do not attempt to give a concise definition of it yet no one who have study he work will find it difficult to understand what it indicate we present task be to put reader in possession of the means of do this the best indeed -- as mahan have make we see -- the only effective way of attain this object be to treat the matter historically whatever date we may agree to assign to the formation of the term itself the idea -- as we have see -- be as old as history it be not intend to give a condensed history of sea-power but rather a analysis of the idea and what it contain illustrate this analysis with example from history ancient and modern it be important to know that it be not something which originate in the middle of the seventeenth century and have seriously affected history in the eighteenth cease to have weight till captain mahan appear to comment on it in the last decade of the nineteenth with a few masterly touch mahan in he brief allusion to the second punic war have illustrate its importance in the struggle between rome and carthage what have to be show be that the principle which he have lay down in that case and in case much more modern be true and have be true always and everywhere until this be perceive there be much history which can not be understand and yet it be essential to we welfare as a maritime people that we should understand it thoroughly we failure to understand it have more than once bring we if not to the verge of destruction at any rate within a short distance of serious disaster sea-power in ancient time the high antiquity of decisive naval campaign be amongst the most interesting feature of international conflict notwithstanding the much greater frequency of land war the course of history have be profoundly change more often by contest on the water that this have not receive the notice it deserve be true and mahan tell we why ` historian generally ' he say ` have be unfamiliar with the condition of the sea have as to it neither special interest nor special knowledge and the profound determine influence of maritime strength on great issue have consequently be overlook ' moralise on that which might have be be admittedly a sterile process but it be sometimes necessary to point if only by way of illustration to a possible alternative as in modern time the fate of indium and the fate of north america be determine by sea-power so also at a very remote epoch sea-power decide whether or not hellenic colonisation be to take root in and hellenic culture to dominate central and northern italy as it dominate southern italy where trace of it be extant to this day a moment 's consideration will enable we to see how different the history of the world would have be have a hellenised city grow and prosper on the seven hill before the tarquin be drive out of rome a phocoean fleet be encounter -lrb- 537 bc -rrb- off corsica by a combined force of etruscan and phoenician and be so handle that the phocoean abandon the island and settle on the coast of lucanium -lrb- 14 -rrb- the enterprise of they navigator have build up for the phoenician city and they great off-shoot carthage a sea-power which enable they to gain the practical sovereignty of the sea to the west of sardinium and sicily the control of these water be the object of prolonged and memorable struggle for on it -- as the result show -- depend the empire of the world from very remote time the consolidation and expansion from within outwards of great continental state have have serious consequence for mankind when they be accompany by the acquisition of a coast-line and the absorption of a maritime population we shall find that the process lose none of its importance in recent year ` the ancient empire ' say the historian of greece ernst curtius ` as long as no foreign element have intrude into they have a invincible horror of the water ' when the condition which curtius notice in parenthesis arise the ` horror ' disappear there be something highly significant in the uniformity of the effort of assyrium egypt babylon and persium to get possession of the maritime resource of phoenicium we own immediate posterity will perhaps have to reckon with the result of similar effort in we own day it be this which give a living interest to even the very ancient history of sea-power and make the study of it of great practical importance to we now we shall see as we go on how the phenomenon connect with it reappear with striking regularity in successive period look at in this light the great conflict of former age be full of useful indeed necessary instruction -lrb- footnote 14 : mommsen _ hist_rome _ english trans i p 153 -rrb- in the first and greatest of the contest wage by the nation of the east against europe -- the persian war -- sea-power be the govern factor until persium have expand to the shore of the levant the european greek have little to fear from the ambition of the great king the conquest of egypt by cambys have show how formidable that ambition could be when support by a efficient navy with the aid of the naval force of the phoenician city the persian invasion of greece be render comparatively easy it be the naval contingent from phoenicium which crush the ionian revolt the expedition of mardonius and still more that of dati and artapherne have indicate the danger threatening greece when the master of a great army be likewise the master of a great navy they defeat at marathon be not likely to and as a matter of fact do not discourage the persian from further attempt at aggression as the advance of cambys into egypt have be flank by a fleet so also be that of xerx into greece by the good fortune sometimes vouch-safed to a people which owe to its obstinate opposition to or neglect of a wise policy scarcely deserve it there appear at athen a influential citizen who understand all that be mean by the term sea-power themistocle see more clearly than any of he contemporary that to enable athen to play a lead part in the hellenic world she need above all thing a strong navy ` he have already in he eye the battle-field of the future ' he feel sure that the persian would come back and come with such force that resistance in the open field would be out of the question one scene of action remain -- the sea persuade by he the athenian increase they navy so that of the 271 vessel comprise the greek fleet at artemisium 147 have be provide by athen which also send a large reinforcement after the first action though no one have ever surpass themistocle in the faculty of correctly estimate the importance of sea-power it be understand by xerx as clearly as by he that the issue of the war depend upon naval operation the arrangement make under the persian monarch 's direction and he very personal movement show that this be he view he feel and probably express the feeling exactly as -- in the war of arnerican independence -- washington do in the word ` whatever effort be make by the land army the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest ' the decisive event be the naval action of salami to have make certain of success the persian should have first obtain a command of the ægean as complete for all practical purpose as the french and english have of the sea generally in the war against russium of 1854-56 the persian sea-power be not equal to the task the fleet of the great king be numerically stronger than that of the greek ally but it have be prove many time that naval efficiency do not depend on numerical superiority alone the choice section of the persian fleet be the contingent of the ionian and phoenician the former be half-hearted or disaffected whilst the latter be at best not superior in skill experience and valor to the greek sailor at salami greece be save not only from the ambition and vengeance of xerx but also and for many century from oppression by a oriental conqueror persium do not succeed against the greek not because she have no sea-power but because she sea-power artificially build up be inferior to that which be a natural element of the vitality of she foe ionia be lose and greece in the end enslave because the quarrel of greek with greek lead to the ruin of they naval state the peloponnesian be largely a naval war the confidence of the athenian in they sea-power have a great deal to do with its outbreak the immediate occasion of the hostility which in time involve so many state be the opportunity offer by the conflict between corinth and corcyra of increase the sea-power of athen hitherto the athenian naval predominance have be virtually confine to the ægean sea the corcyræan envoy who plead for help at athen dwell upon the advantage to be derive by the athenian from alliance with a naval state occupy a important situation ` with respect to the western region towards which the view of the athenian have for some time be direct ' -lrb- 15 -rrb- it be the ` weapon of she sea-power ' to adopt mahan 's phrase that enable athen to maintain the great conflict in which she be engage repeat invasion of she territory the ravages of disease amongst she people and the rise disaffection of she ally have be more than make up for by she predominance on the water the scale of the subsequent syracusan expedition show how vigorous athen still be down to the interruption of the war by the peace of nicia the great expedition just mention over-taxed she strength its failure bring about the ruin of the state it be hold by contemporary and have be hold in we own day that the athenian defeat at syracuse be due to the omission of the government at home to keep the force in sicily properly supply and reinforce this explanation of failure be give in all age and should always be suspect the friend of unsuccessful general and admiral always offer it be sure of the support of the political opponent of the administration after the despatch of the support expedition under demosthene and eurymedon no further great reinforcement as nicia admit be possible the weakness of athen be in the character of the man who sway the popular assembly and hold high command a people which remember the administration of a pericle and yet allow a cleon or a alcibiade to direct its naval and military policy court defeat nicia notwithstanding the possession of high quality lack the supreme virtue of a commander -- firm resolution he dare not face the obloquy consequent on withdrawal from a enterprise on which the popular hope have be fix and therefore he allow a reverse to be convert into a overwhelming disaster ` the complete ruin of athen have appear both to she enemy and to herself impend and irreparable but so astonishing so rapid and so energetic have be she rally that -lrb- a year after syracuse -rrb- she be find again carry on a terrible struggle ' -lrb- 16 -rrb- nevertheless she sea-power have indeed be ruin at syracuse now she could wage war only ` with impaired resource and on a purely defensive system ' even before arginusæ it be see that ` superiority of nautical skill have pass to the peloponnesian and they ally ' -lrb- 17 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : thirwall _ hist_greece _ iii p 96 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : grote _ hist_greece _ v p 354 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : _

western mediterranean so completely have that control be exercise by carthage that she have anticipate the spanish commercial policy in america the roman be preclude by treaty from trading with the carthaginian territory in hispanium africa and sardinium rome as mommsen tell we ` be from the first a maritime city and in the period of its vigor never be so foolish or so untrue to its ancient tradition as wholly to neglect its war marine and to desire to be a mere continental power ' it may be that it be lust of wealth rather than lust of dominion that first prompt a trial of strength with carthage the vision of universal empire could hardly as yet have form itself in the imagination of a single roman the area of phoenician maritime commerce be vast enough both to excite jealousy and to offer vulnerable point to the cupidity of rival it be probable that the modern estimate of the sea-power of carthage be much exaggerate it be great by comparison and of course overwhelmingly great when there be none but insignificant competitor to challenge it mommsen hold that in the fourth and fifth century after the foundation of rome ` the two main competitor for the dominion of the western water ' be carthage and syracuse ` carthage ' he say ` have the preponderance and syracuse sink more and more into a second-rate naval power the maritime importance of the etruscan be wholly go rome itself be not exempt from the same fate its own water be likewise command by foreign fleet ' the roman be for a long time too much occupy at home to take much interest in mediterranean matter the position of the carthaginian in the western basin of the mediterranean be very like that of the portuguese long afterwards in indium the latter keep within reach of the sea ` nor do they rule ever extend a day 's march from they ship ' -lrb- 18 -rrb- ` the carthaginian in spain ' say mommsen ` make no effort to acquire the interior from the warlike native nation they be content with the possession of the mine and of station for traffic and for shell and other fishery ' allowance be make for the number of the class engage in administration commerce and supervision it be nearly certain that carthage could not furnish the crew require by both a great war-navy and a great mercantile marine no one be surprise on finding that the land-force of carthage be compose largely of alien mercenary we have several example from which we can infer a parallel if not a identical condition of she maritime resource how then be the great carthaginian carrying-trade provide for the experience of more than one country will enable we to answer this question the ocean trade of those off-shoot or dependency of the unite kingdom viz the united state australasium and indium be largely or chiefly conduct by shipping of the old country so that of carthage be largely conduct by old phoenician these may have obtain a ` carthaginian register ' or the contemporary equivalent but they could not all have be purely carthaginian or liby-phoenician this must have be the case even more with the war-navy british indium for a considerable time possess a real and indeed highly efficient navy but it be officer entirely and man almost entirely by man from the ` old country ' moreover it be small the wealth of indium would have suffice to furnish a larger material element but as the country could not supply the _ personnel _ it would have be absurd to speak of the sea-power of indium apart from that of england as soon as the roman choose to make the most of they natural resource the maritime predominance of carthage be doom the artificial basis of the latter 's sea-power would not enable it to hold out against serious and persistent assault unless this be perceive it be impossible to understand the story of the punic war judge by every visible sign of strength carthage the richer the more enterprising ethnically the more predominant amongst she neighbor and apparently the more nautical seem sure to win in the great struggle with rome which by the condition of the case be to be wage largely on the water yet those who have watch the struggle of the punic city with the sicilian greek and especially that with agathocle must have see reason to cherish doubt concern she naval strength it be a anticipation of the case of spain in the age of philip ii as the great elizabethan seaman discern the defect of the spanish naval establishment so man at rome discern those of the carthaginian date in connection with this are of great significance a comprehensive measure with the object of ` rescue they marine from its condition of impotence ' be take by the roman in the year 267 bc four _ quoestore _ _ classicus _ -- in modern naval english we may perhaps call they port-admiral -- be nominate and one be station at each of four port the object of the roman senate so mommsen tell we be very obvious they be ` to recover they independence by sea to cut off the maritime communication of tarentum to close the adriatic against fleet come from epirus and to emancipate themselves from carthaginian supremacy ' four year afterwards the first punic war begin it be and have to be largely a naval contest the roman wage it with vary fortune but in the end triumph by means of they sea-power ` the sea be the place where all great destiny be decide ' -lrb- 19 -rrb- the victory of catulus over the carthaginian fleet off the ægatian island decide the war and leave to the roman the possession of sicily and the power of possess themselves of sardinium and corsica it would be a interesting and perhaps not a barren investigation to inquire to what extent the decline of the mother state of phoenicium consequent on the campaign of alexander the great have help to enfeeble the naval efficiency of the carthaginian defence one thing be certain carthage have now meet with a rival endowed with natural maritime resource greater than she own that rival also contain citizen who understand the true importance of sea-power ` with a statesmanlike sagacity from which succeed generation might have draw a lesson the lead man of the roman commonwealth perceive that all they coast-fortification and coast-garrison would prove inadequate unless the war-marine of the state be again place on a footing that should command respect ' -lrb- 20 -rrb- it be a gloomy reflection that the lead man of we own great maritime country could not see this in 1860 a thorough comprehension of the event of the first punic war enable we to solve what until mahan write have be one of the standing enigma of history viz hannibal 's invasion of italy by land instead of by sea in the second punic war mahan 's masterly examination of this question have set at rest all doubt as to the reason of hannibal 's action -lrb- 21 -rrb- the naval predominance in the western basin of the mediterranean acquire by rome have never be lose though modern historian even those belong to a maritime country may have fail to perceive it the carthaginian know well enough that the roman be too strong for they on the sea though other force co-operate to bring about the defeat of carthage in the second punic war the roman navy as mahan demonstrate be the most important as a navy he tell we in word like those already quote ` act on a element strange to most writer as its member have be from

notwithstanding the greater attention pay within the last dozen year or so to naval affair it be doubtful if the country generally even yet recognize the extent to which its security depend upon a good fleet as fully as we ancestor do nearly seven century ago the narrative of we pre-elizabethan campaign be interesting merely as a story and when tell -- as for instance d hannay have tell it in

the reinforcement try to cross the channel under the escort of a fleet command by eustace hubert de burgh who have stoutly hold dover for king john and be faithful to the young henry iii hear of the

the position of they country challenge as it do what be believe to be the greatest of maritime state would have be altogether precarious the principal expedition now undertake be distinguish by a characteristic peculiar to the people and not to be find in connection with the explore or colonise activity of most other great nation even down to we own time they be really unofficial speculation in which if the government take part at all it be for the sake of the profit expect and almost if not exactly like any private adventurer the participation of the government nevertheless have a aspect which it be worth while to note it convey a hint -- and quite consciously -- to all whom it might concern that the speculation be ` under-written ' by the whole sea-power of england the force of more than one state have be use to protect its maritime trade from the assault of enemy in the mediterranean or in the narrow sea they have be use to ward off invasion and to keep open communication across not very extensive area of water in the sixteenth century they be first rely upon to support distant commerce whether carry on in a peaceful fashion or under aggressive form this naturally enough lead to collision the contention wax hot and be virtually decide when the armada shape course to the northward after the fight off graveline the expedition against the spanish indy and still more those against philip ii 's peninsular territory have help to define the limitation of sea-power it become evident and it be make still more evident in the next century that for a great country to be strong it must not rely upon a navy alone it must also have a adequate and properly organise mobile army notwithstanding the number of time that this lesson have be repeat we have be slow to learn it it be doubtful if we have learn it even yet english seaman in all age seem to have master it fully for they have always demand -- at any rate for upward of three century -- that expedition against foreign territory over-sea should be accompany by a proper number of land-troops on the other hand the necessity of organise the army of a maritime insular state and of training it with the object of render effective aid in operation of the kind in question have rarely be perceive and act upon by other the result have be a long series of inglorious or disastrous affair like the west indy voyage of 1595-96 the cadiz expedition of 1625 and that to the ile de ré of 1627 addition might be make to the list the failure of joint expedition have often be explain by allege difference or quarrel between the naval and the military commander this way of explain they however be nothing but the inveterate critical method of the street by which cause be take for effect and effect for cause the difference and quarrel arise no doubt but they generally spring out of the recrimination consequent on not produce the want of success another manifestation of the way in which sea-power work be first observe in the seventeenth century it suggest the adoption of and furnish the instrument for carry out a distinct maritime policy what be practically a standing navy have come into existence as regard england this phenomenon be now of respectable age long voyage and cruise of several ship in company have be frequent during the latter half of the sixteenth century and the early part of the seventeenth even the grandfather of the man who sail with blake and penn in 1652 could not have know a time when ship have never cross the ocean and squadron keep together for month have never cruise however imperfect it may have be a system of provision ship and supply they with store and of preserve discipline amongst they crew have be develop and have prove fairly satisfactory the parliament and the protector in turn find it necessary to keep a considerable number of ship in commission and make they cruise and operate in company it be not till well on in the reign of queen victorium that the man-of-war 's man be finally differentiate from the merchant seaman but two century before some of the distinctive mark of the former have already begin to be noticeable there be seaman in the time of the commonwealth who rarely perhaps some who never serve afloat except in a man-of-war some of the interesting naval family which be settle at portsmouth and the eastern port and which -- from father to son -- help to recruit the rank of we bluejacket till a date later than that of the launch of the first ironclad could carry back they professional genealogy to at least the day of charle ii when in all probability it do not first start though landsman continue even after the civil war to be give naval appointment and though a permanent corps through the rank of which everyone must pass have not be formally establish a body of real naval officer -- man who could handle they ship supervise the working of the armament and exercise military command -- have be form a navy accordingly be now a weapon of undoubted keenness capable of very effective use by anyone who know how to wield it have taste the sweet of intercourse with the indy whether in the occupation of portugal or of spain both english and dutch be desirous of get a larger share of they english maritime commerce have increase and need naval protection if england be to maintain the international position to which as no one deny she be entitle that commerce must be permit to expand the mind of man in western europe moreover be set upon obtain for they country territory in the new world the amenity of which be now know from the reign of jame i the dutch have show great jealousy of english maritime enterprise where it be possible as in the east indian archipelago they have destroy it they naval resource be great enough to let they hold english shipping at they mercy unless a vigorous effort be make to protect it the dutch conduct the carry trade of a great part of the world and the monopoly of this they be resolve to keep while the english be resolve to share in it the exclusion of the english from every trade-route except such as run by they own coast or cross the narrow sea seem a by no means impossible contingency there seem also to be but one way of prevent it viz by war the suppose unfriendliness of the dutch or at least of a important party amongst they to the regicide government in england help to force the conflict the navigation act of 1651 be pass and regard as a covert declaration of hostility so the first dutch war begin it establish we claim to compete for the position of a great maritime commercial power the rise of the sea-power of the dutch and the magnitude which it attain in a short time and in the most adverse circumstance have no parallel in history the case of athen be different because the athenian power have not so much be unconsciously develop out of a great maritime trade as base on a military marine deliberately and persistently foster during many year

dutch war be therefore contest between the two foremost naval state of the world for what be primarily a maritime object the identity of the cause of the first and of the second war will be discern by anyone who compare what have be say about the circumstance lead to the former with monk 's remark as to the latter he say that the english want a larger share of the trade enjoy by the dutch it be quite in accordance with the spirit of the age that the dutch should try to prevent by force this want from be satisfied anything like free and open competition be repugnant to the general feeling the high road to both individual wealth and national prosperity be believe to lie in secure a monopoly merchant or manufacturer who call for the abolition of monopoly grant to particular courtier and favorite have not the smallest intention on gain they object of throw open to the enterprise of all what have be monopolise it be to be keep for the exclusive benefit of some privileged or chartered company it be the same in greater affair as mahan say ` to secure to one 's own people a disproportionate share of the benefit of sea commerce every effort be make to exclude other either by the peaceful legislative method of monopoly or prohibitory regulation or when these fail by direct violence ' the apparent wealth of spain be believe to be due to the rigorous manner in which foreigner be exclude from trading with the spanish over-sea territory the skill and enterprise of the dutch have enable they to force themselves into this trade they be determine to keep it to themselves the dutch east indium company be a powerful body and largely dictate the maritime policy of the country we have thus come to a interesting point in the historical consideration of sea-power the elizabethan conflict with spain have practically settle the question whether or not the expand nation be to be allow to extend they activity to territory in the new world the first two dutch war be to settle the question whether or not the ocean trade of the world be to be open to any people qualify to engage in it we can see how largely these be maritime question how much depend on the solution find for they

sea-power open in 1660 midway between the first and second dutch war ` the sailing-ship era with its distinctive feature ' he tell we ` have fairly begin ' the art of war by sea in its more important detail have be settle by the first war from the beginning of the second the general feature of ship design the classification of ship the armament of ship and the handling of fleet be to remain without essential alteration until the date of navarino even the tactical method except where improve on occasion by individual genius alter little the great thing be to bring the whole broadside force to bear on a enemy whether this be to be impartially distribute throughout the hostile line or concentrate on one part of it depend on the character of particular admiral it would have be strange if a period so long and so rich in incident have afford no material for form a judgment on the real significance of sea-power the text so to speak choose by mahan be that notwithstanding the change work in naval _ matériel _ during the last half-century we can find in the history of the past instructive illustration of the general principle of maritime war these illustration will prove of value not only ` in those wider operation which embrace a whole theater of war ' but also if rightly apply ` in the tactical use of the ship and weapon ' of we own day by a remarkable coincidence the same doctrine be be preach at the same time and quite independently by the late vice-admiral philip colomb in he work on ` naval warfare ' as a prelude to the second dutch war we find a repetition of a process which have be adopt somewhat earlier that be the permanent conquest of trans-oceanic territory until the seventeenth century have well begin naval or combined naval and military operation against the distant possession of a enemy have be practically restricted to raiding or plunder attack on commercial centre the portuguese territory in south america have come under spanish dominion in consequence of the annexation of portugal to spain the dutch -- as the power of the latter country decline -- attempt to reduce part of that territory into permanent possession this improvement on the practice of drake and other be soon see to be a game at which more than one could play a expedition send by cromwell to the west indy seize the spanish island of jamaica which have remain in the hand of its conqueror to this day in 1664 a english force occupy the dutch north american settlement on the hudson though the dispossessed ruler be not quite in a position to throw stone at sinner this be rather a raid than a operation of recognize warfare because it precede the formal outbreak of hostility the conquer territory remain in english hand for more than a century and thus testify to the efficacy of a sea-power which europe have scarcely begin to recognize neither the second nor the third dutch war can be count amongst the occurrence to which englishman may look back with unalloyed satisfaction but they unquestionably disclose some interesting manifestation of sea-power much indignation have be express concern the corruption and inefficiency of the english government of the day and its failure to take proper measure for keep up the navy as it should have be keep up some perhaps a good deal of this indignation be deserve but it would have be nearly as well deserve by every other government of the day even in those home of political virtue where the administrative machinery be work by or in the interest of speculate capitalist and privileged company the accumulate evidence of late year have prove that everything be not consider to be and as a matter of fact be not exactly as it ought to have be charle ii and he brother the duke of york have be hold up to obloquy because they think that the coast of england could be defend against a naval enemy better by fortification than by a good fleet and as pepy note be ` not ashamed of it ' the truth be that neither the king nor the duke believe in the power of a navy to ward off attack from a island this may have be due to want of intellectual capacity but it would be go a long way to put it down to personal wickedness they have have many imitator some in we own day the huge fort which stud the coast of the unite kingdom and have be erect within the memory of the present generation be monument likely to last for many year of the inability of people whom no one could accuse of be vicious to rate sea-power at its proper value it be much more likely that it be owe to a reluctance to study question of naval defense as industriously as they deserve and to that moral timidity which so often tempt even man of proved physical courage to undertake the impossible task of make themselves absolutely safe against hostile effort at every point charle ii have also be charge with indifference to the interest of he country or worse because during a great naval war he adopt the plan of try to weaken the enemy by destroy he commerce the king ` take a fatal resolution of lay up he great ship and keep only a few frigate on the cruise ' it be expressly related that this be not charle 's own idea but that it be urge upon he by adviser whose opinion probably seem at the time as well worth listen to as that of other anyhow if the king err as he undoubtedly do he err in good company fourteen hundred year earlier the statesman who conduct the great war against carthage and whose astuteness have be the theme of innumerable panegyric since take the same ` fatal resolution ' in the midst of the great struggle they ` do away with the fleet at the most they encourage privateering and with that view place the war-vessel of the state at the disposal of captain who be ready to undertake a corsair warfare on they own account ' -lrb- 41 -rrb- in much later time this method have have many and respectable defender mahan 's work be in a sense a formal warning to he fellow-citizen not to

result than during this period we suffer ` infinitely more than in any former war ' many of we merchant be ruin and it be affirm that the english shipping be reduce to the necessity of sailing under

trade this be only another way of say that we commerce have increase so largely that the navy be not strong enough to look after it as well as oppose the enemy 's main force notwithstanding we loss we be on the win side in the conflict much misery and ruin have be cause but not enough to affect the issue of the war torrington 's proceedings in July 1690 be at the time the subject of much angry debate the debate still merit the epithet angry have be renew within the last few year the matter have to be notice here because it involve the consideration of a question of naval strategy which must be understand by those who wish to know the real meaning of the term sea-power and who ought to learn that it be not a thing to be idly risk or throw away at the bidding of the ignorant and the irresponsible arthur herbert earl of torrington -- the later peerage be a viscounty hold by the byng family -- be in command of the ally english and dutch fleet in the channel ` the disparity of force

wisdom it have still further weaken we fleet by divide it -lrb- vice-admiral killigrew have be send to the mediterranean with a squadron -rrb- and have neglect and indeed refuse when urge to take the

dispute that in england at the time tourville 's movement be believe to be preliminary to invasion whether tourville deliberately mean he movement to cover a invasion or not invasion would almost certainly have follow complete success on he part otherwise he victory would have be without any valuable result torrington see that as long as he could keep he own fleet intact he could though much weaker than he opponent prevent he from do serious harm though personally not a believer in the imminence of invasion the english admiral know that ` most man be in fear that the french would invade ' he own view be ` that whilst we have a fleet in be they would not dare to make a attempt ' of late year controversy have rage round this phrase ' a fleet in be ' and the strategic principle which it express most seaman be at the time have be since and still be in agreement with torrington this might be suppose enough to settle the question it have not be allow however to remain one of purely naval strategy it be make at the time a matter of party politics this be why it be so necessary that in a notice of sea-power it should be discuss both as a strategist and as a tactician torrington be immeasurably ahead of he contemporary the only english admiral who can be place above he be hawke and nelson he pay the penalty of he pre-eminence : he could not make ignorant man and dull man see the meaning or the advantage of he proceedings mahan who be specially qualify to do he full justice do not devote much space in he work to a consideration of torrington 's case evidently because he have no sufficient material before he on which to form a judgment the admiral 's character have be take away already by macaulay who do have ample evidence before he william iii with all he fine quality do not possess a military genius quite equal to that of napoleon and napoleon in naval strategy be often wrong william iii understand that subject even less than the french emperor do and he favorite be still less capable of understand it consequently torrington 's action have be put down to jealousy of the dutch there have be people who accuse nelson of be jealous of the naval reputation of caracciolo the explanation of torrington 's conduct be this : -- he have a fleet so much weaker than tourville 's that he could not fight a general action with the latter without a practical certainty of get a crush defeat such a result would have lay the kingdom open : a defeat of the ally fleet say mahan ` if sufficiently severe might involve the fall of william 's throne in england ' give certain movement of the french fleet torrington might have manoeuvre to slip past it to the westward and join he force with that under killigrew which would make he strong enough to hazard a battle this prove impracticable there be then one course leave to retire before the french but not to keep far from they he know that though not strong enough to engage they whole otherwise unemployed fleet with any hope of success he would be quite strong enough to fight and most likely beat it when a part of it be try either to deal with we ship to the westward or to cover the disembarkation of a invade army he therefore propose to keep he fleet ` in be ' in order to fall on the enemy when the latter would have two affair at the same time on he hand the late vice-admiral colomb rise to a greater height than be usual even with he in he criticism of this campaign what torrington do be merely to reproduce on the sea what have be notice dozen of time on shore viz the menace by the flanking enemy in land warfare this be hold to give exceptional opportunity for the display of good generalship but to quote mahan over again a navy ` act on a element strange to most writer its member have be from time immemorial a strange race apart without prophet of they own neither themselves nor they call understand ' whilst torrington have have the support of seaman he opponent have be landsmen for the crime of be a good strategist he be bring before a court-martial but acquit he sovereign who have be give the crown of three kingdom to defend we law show he respect for they by flout a legally constitute tribunal and disregard its solemn find the admiral who have save he country be force into retirement still the principle of the ` fleet in be ' lie at the bottom of all sound strategy admiral colomb have point out a great change of plan in the later naval campaign of the seventeenth century improvement in naval architecture in the method of preserve food and in the arrangement for keep the crew healthy permit fleet to be employ at a distance from they home port for long continuous period the dutch when ally of the spaniard keep a fleet in the mediterranean for many month the great de ruyter be mortally wound in one of the battle there fight in the war of the spanish succession the anglo-dutch fleet find its principal scene of action eastward of gibraltar this as it be set the fashion for future war it become a kind of tacitly accept rule that the operation of british sea-power be to be feel in the enemy 's rather than in we own water the hostile coast be regard strategically as the british frontier and the sea be look upon as territory which the enemy must be prevent from invade acceptance of this principle lead in time to the so-called ` blockade ' of brest and toulon the name be mislead as nelson take care to explain there be no desire to keep the enemy 's fleet in what be desire be to be near enough to attack it if it come out the wisdom of the plan be undoubted the hostile navy could be more easily watch and more easily follow if it put to sea to carry out this plan a navy stronger in number of ship or in general efficiency than that of the enemy be necessary to we with the exception of that of american independence which will therefore require special notice we subsequent great war be conduct in accordance with the rule sea-power in the eighteenth century and early part of the nineteenth century in the early part of the eighteenth century there be a remarkable manifestation of sea-power in the baltic peter the great have create a efficient army drive the swede from the coast province south of the gulf of finland like the earlier monarchy of which we have speak russium in the baltic at least now become a naval state a large fleet be build and indeed a considerable navy establish it be a purely artificial creation and show the merit and defect of its character at first and when under the eye of its creator it be strong when peter be no more it dwindle away and when need again have to be create afresh it enable peter the great to conquer the neighbouring portion of finland to secure he coast territory and to dominate the baltic in this he be assist by the exhaustion of sweden consequent on she endeavor to retain what be no longer possible the position of a _ quasus _ great power which she have hold since the day of gustavus adolphus sweden have be further weaken especially as a naval state by almost incessant war with denmark which prevent all hope of scandinavian predominance in the baltic the control of which sea have in we own day pass into the hand of another state possess a quickly create navy -- the modern german empire the war of the spanish succession leave great britain a mediterranean power a position which in spite of twice lose minorca she still hold in the war of the austrian succession ` france be force to give up she conquest for want of a navy and england save she position by she sea-power though she have fail to use it to the best advantage ' -lrb- 42 -rrb- this show as we shall find that a later war show more plainly that even the government of a thoroughly maritime country be not always sure of conduct its naval affair wisely the seven year ' war include some brilliant display of the efficacy of sea-power it be this which put the british in possession of canada decide which european race be to rule in indium and lead to a british occupation of havannah in one hemisphere and of manila in the other in the same war we learn how by a feeble use of sea-power a valuable possession like minorca may be lose at the same time we maritime trade and the general prosperity of the kingdom increase enormously the result of the conflict make plain to all the paramount importance of have in the principal post in the government man capable of understand what war be and how it ought to be conduct -lrb- footnote 42 : mahan _ inf_on_hist _ p 280 -rrb- this lesson as the sequel demonstrate have not be learn when great britain become involve in a war with the insurgent colony in north america mahan 's comment be striking : ` the magnificence of sea-power and its value have perhaps be more clearly show by the uncontrolled sway and consequent exaltation of one belligerent but the lesson thus give if more striking be less vividly interesting than the spectacle of that sea-power meeting a foe worthy of its steel and excite to exertion by a strife which endanger not only its most valuable colony but even its own shore ' -lrb- 43 -rrb- we be in fact draw too largely on the _ prestige _ acquire during the seven year ' war and we be govern by man who do not understand the first principle of naval warfare and would not listen to those who do they quite ignore the teaching of the then comparatively recent war which have be allude to already -- that we should look upon the enemy 's coast as we frontier a century and a half earlier the dutchman grotius have write -- quæ meta britanni litora sunt alii -lrb- footnote 43 : _ influence_on_hist _ p 338 -rrb- though ordinary prudence would have suggest ample preparation british minister allow they country to remain unprepared instead of concentrate they effort on the main objective they fritter away force in attempt to relieve two beleaguered garrison under the pretext of yield to popular pressure which be the official term for act on the advice of irresponsible and uninstructed busybody ` depuis le début de la crise ' say captain chevalier ` les ministres de la grande bretagne s ' étaient montrés inférieurs à leur tâche ' a impressive result of this be the repeat appearance of powerful and indeed numerically superior hostile fleet in the english channel the war -- notwithstanding that perhaps because land operation constitute a important part of it and in the end settle the issue -- be essentially oceanic captain mahan say it be ` purely maritime ' it may be true that whatever the belligerent result the political result as regard the _ status _ of the insurgent colony would have be the same it be in the highest degree probable indeed it closely approach to certainty that a proper use of the british sea-power would have prevent independence from be conquer as it be at the point of the bayonet there can be no surprise in store for the student acquaint with the vagary of strategist who be influence in war by political in preference to military requirement still it be difficult to repress a emotion of astonishment on finding that a british government intentionally permit de grasse 's fleet and the french army in its convoy to cross the atlantic unmolested for fear of postpone for a time the revictualling of the garrison beleaguer at gibraltar washington 's opinion as to the importance of the naval factor have be quote already and mahan do not put the case too strongly when he declare that the success of the american be due to ` sea-power be in the hand of the french and its improper distribution by the english authority ' we navy misdirect as it be make a good fight of it never allow itself to be decisively beat in a considerable battle and win at least one great victory at the point of contact with the enemy however it be not in general so conspicuously successful as it be in the seven year ' war or as it be to be in the great conflict with the french republic and empire the truth be that its opponent the french navy be never so thoroughly a sea-going force as it be in the war of american independence and never so closely approach we own in real sea-experience as it do during that period we meet antagonist who be very nearly but fortunately for we not quite as familiar with the sea as we be ourselves and we never find it so hard to beat they or even to avoid be beat by they a englishman would naturally enough start at the conclusion confront he if he be to speculate as to the result of more than one battle have the great suffren 's captain and crew be quite up to the level of those command by stout old sir edward hughes suffren it should be say before go to the east indy have ` thirty-eight year of almost uninterrupted sea-service ' -lrb- 44 -rrb- a glance at a chart of the world with the scene of the general action of the war dot on it will show how notably oceanic the campaign be the hostile fleet meet over and over again on the far side of the atlantic and in distant indian sea the french navy have penetrate into the ocean as readily and as far as we could do ourselves besides this it should be remember that it be not until the 12th April 1782 when rodney in one hemisphere and suffren in the other show they the way that we officer be able to escape from the fetter impose on they by the _ fight _ _ instruction _ -- a fact worth remember in day in which it be sometimes propose by establish school of naval tactic on shore to revive the pedantry which make a decisive success in battle nearly impossible -lrb- footnote 44 : laughton _ studies_in_naval_hist _ p 103 -rrb- the mighty conflict which rage between great britain on one side and france and she ally on the other with little intermission for more than twenty year present a different aspect from that of the war last mention the victory which the british fleet be to gain be generally to be overwhelming if not they be look upon as almost defeat whether the fleet oppose to ours be or be not the more numerous the result be generally the same -- we enemy be beat that there be a reason for this which can be discover be certain a great deal have be make of the disorganisation in the french navy consequent on the confusion of the revolution that there be disorganisation be undoubted that it do impair discipline and consequently general efficiency will not be dispute but that it be considerable enough to account by itself for the french naval defeat be altogether inadmissible revolutionary disorder have invade the land-force to a greater degree than it have invade the sea-force the supersession flight or guillotining of army officer have be beyond measure more frequent than be the case with the naval officer in spite of all this the french army be on the whole -- even in the early day of the revolution -- extraordinarily successful in 1792 ` the most formidable invasion that ever threaten france ' as alison call it be repel though the invader be the highly discipline and veteran army of prussium and austria it be nearly two year later that the french and english fleet come into serious conflict the first great battle which we call ` the glorious first of June ' though a tactical victory for we be a strategical defeat villaret-joyeuse manoeuvre so as to cover the arrival in france of a fleet of merchant vessel carry sorely need supplies of food and in this he be completely successful he plan involve the probability almost the necessity of fight a general action which he be not at all sure of win he be beat it be true but the french make so good a fight of it that they defeat be not nearly so disastrous as the later defeat of the nile or trafalgar and -- at the most -- not more disastrous than that of dominica yet no one even allege that there be disorder or disorganisation in the french fleet at the date of anyone of those affair indeed if the french navy be really disorganised in 1794 it would have be better for france -- judge from the event of 1798 and 1805 -- if the disorganisation have be allow to continue in point of organization the british navy be inferior and in point of discipline not much superior to the french at the earliest date at the later date and especially at the latest owe to the all-pervading energy of napoleon the british be far behind its rival in organization in ` science ' and in every branch of training that can be impart without go to sea we have the immense advantage of count amongst we officer some very able man nelson of course stand so high that he hold a place entirely by himself the other british chief good as they be be not conspicuously superior to the hawke and rodney of a earlier day howe be a great commander but he do little more than just appear on the scene in the war almost the same may be say of hood of whom nelson write ` he be the greatest sea-officer i ever know ' -lrb- 45 -rrb- there must have be something therefore beyond the meritorious quality of we principal officer which help we so consistently to victory the many triumph win could not have be due in every case to the individual superiority of the british admiral or captain to he opponent there must have be bad as well as good amongst the hundred on we list and we can not suppose that providence have so arrange it that in every action in which a british officer of inferior ability command a still inferior french commander be oppose to he the explanation of we nearly unbroken success be that the british be a thoroughly sea-going navy and become more and more so every month whilst the french since the close of the american war have lose to a great extent its sea-going character and because we shut it up in its port become less and less sea-going as hostility continue the war have be for we in the word of mr theodore roosevelt ' a continuous course of victory win mainly by seamanship ' we navy as regard sea-experience especially of the officer be immensely superior to the french this enable the british government to carry into execution sound strategic plan in accordance with which the coast of france and its dependent or ally country be regard as the english frontier to be watch or patrol by we fleet -lrb- footnote 45 : laughton _ nelson 's _ lett_and_desp _ p 71 -rrb- before the long

of the british in the end assert its influence and we antagonist suffer much more severely even absolutely than ourselves at the same time we might have learn for the american do they best to teach we that over-confidence in numerical strength and narrow professional self-satisfaction be nearly sure to lead to reverse in war and not unlikely to end in grave disaster we have now to meet the _ élite _ of one of the finest community of seaman ever know even in 1776 the american have a great maritime commerce which as mahan inform we ` have come to be the wonder of the statesman of the mother country ' in the six-and-thirty year which have elapse since then this commerce have further increase there be no finer nursery of seaman than the then state of the american union roosevelt say that ` there be no better seaman in the world ' than the american who ` have be breed to he work from infancy ' a large proportion of the population ` be engage in sea-going pursuit of a nature strongly tend

in french ship the state navy which they be call on to man be small and therefore its _ personnel _ though without any regular or avowed selection be virtually and in the highest sense a pick body the lesson of the war of 1812 should be learn by englishman of the present day when a long naval peace have generate a confidence in numerical superiority in the mere possession of heavier _ matériel _ and in the merit of a rigidly uniform system of training which confidence as experience have show be too often the forerunner of misfortune it be neither patriotic nor intelligent to minimize the american success certainly they have be exaggerate by american and even by ourselves to take the frigate action alone as be those which properly attract most attention we see that the capture in action amount to three on each side the proportionate loss to we opponent consider the smallness of they fleet be immensely greater than ours we also see that no british frigate be take after the first seven month of a war which last two and a half year and that no british frigate succumb except to admittedly superior force attempt have be make to spread a belief that we reverse be due to nothing but the greater size and heavier gun of we enemy 's ship it be now establish that the superiority in these detail which the american certainly enjoy be not great and not of itself enough to account for they victory of course if superiority in mere _ matériel _ beyond a certain well-understood amount be possess by one of two combatant he antagonist can hardly escape defeat but it be never allege that size of ship or calibre of gun -- greater within reasonable limit than we have -- necessarily lead to the defeat of british ship by the french or spaniard in the word of admiral jurien de la gravière ` the ship of the united state constantly fight with the chance in they favor ' all this be indisputable nevertheless we ought to see to it that in any future war we sea-power great as it

essential the efficacy of sea-power be prove again in the american secession war if ever there be hostility in which to the unobservant or short-sighted naval operation might at first glance seem destine to count for little they be these the sequel however make it clear that they constitute one of the leading factor of the success of the victorious side the belligerent the northern or federal state and the southern or confederate state have a common land frontier of great length the capital of each section be within easy distance of this frontier and the two be not far apart in wealth population and resource the federal be enormously superior they alone possess a navy though at first it be a small one the one advantage on the confederate side be the large proportion of military officer which belong to it and they fine training as soldier in _ physique _ as well as in _ morale _ the army of one side differ little from that of the other perhaps the federal army be slightly superior in the first and the confederate as be recruit from a dominant white race in the second outnumber less well equipped and more scantily supply the confederate nevertheless keep up the war with many brilliant success on land for four year have they be able to maintain they trade with neutral state they could have carry on the war longer and -- not improbably -- have succeed in the end the federal navy which be largely increase take away all chance of this it establish effective blockade of the confederate port and sever they communication with the outside world indispensable article of equipment could not be obtain and the army consequently become less and less able to cope with they abundantly furnished antagonist by dominate the river the federal cut the confederacy asunder and by the power they possess of move troops by sea at will perplex and harass the defense and facilitate the occupation of important point meanwhile the confederate could make no reply on the water except by capture merchant vessel by which the contest be embittered but the course of the war remain absolutely unaffected the great number of man under arm on shore the terrific slaughter in many battle of a war in which tactical ability even in a moderate degree be notably uncommon on both side and the vary fortune of the belligerent make the land campaign far more interesting to the ordinary observer than the naval it be not surprising therefore that peace have be re-establish for several year before the american people could be make to see the great part take by the navy in the restoration of the union and what the american have not see be hide from the sight of other nation in several great war in europe wage since france and england make peace with russium sea-power manifest itself but little in the russo-turkish war the great naval superiority of the turk in the black sea where the russian at the time have no fleet govern the plan if not the course of the campaign the water be deny

flank consequently the only route be a land one across the danube and the balkan the advantage though not fully utilise which the enforcement of this line of advance put into the hand of the turk and the difficulty and loss which it cause the russian exhibit in a striking manner what sea-power can effect even when its operation be scarcely observable this be more conspicuous in a later series of hostility the civil war in chili between congressist and balmacedist be specially interesting because it throw into sharp relief the predominant influence when a non-maritime enemy be to be attack of a navy follow up by a adequate land-force at the beginning of the dispute the balmacedist or president 's party have practically all the army and the congressist or opposition party nearly all the chilian navy unable to remain in the principal province of the republic and expel from the water of valparaiso by the balmacedist garrison of the fort -- the only and doubtful service which those work render to they own side -- the congressist go off with the ship to the northern province where they count many adherent there they form a army and have money at command and open sea communication they be able to import equipment from abroad and eventually to transport they land-force secure from molestation on the voyage by the sea-power at they disposal to the neighborhood of valparaiso where it be land and triumphantly end the campaign it will have be notice that in its main outline this story repeat that of many earlier campaign it be itself repeat as regard its general feature by the story of the war between china and japan in 1894-95 ` every aspect of the war ' say colomb ` be interesting to this country as japan be to china in a position similar to that which the british island occupy to the european continent ' -lrb- 48 -rrb- it be additionally interesting because the sea-power of japan be a novelty though a novelty it be well know by english naval man to be superior in all essential to that of china a novelty itself as be the rule when two belligerent be contend for something beyond a purely maritime object the final decision be to be on land korea be the principal theater of the land war and as far as access to it by sea be concern the chief basis of the two side be about the same distance from it it be possible for the chinese to march there by land the japanese come from a island state be oblige to cross the water it will be see at once that not only the success of the japanese in the struggle but also the possibility of its be carry on by they at all depend on sea-power the japanese proved themselves decisively superior at sea they navy effectually clear the way for one army which be land in korea and for another which be land in the chinese province of shantung the chinese land-force be defeat the navy of japan be superior on the sea be able to keep its sister service supply or reinforce as require it be however not the navy but the army which finally frustrate the chinese effort at defense and really terminate the war what the navy do be what in accordance with the limitation of sea-power may be expect of a navy it make the transport of the army across the sea possible and enable it to do what of itself the army could not have do viz overcome the last resistance of the enemy -lrb- footnote 48 : _ naval_warfare _ 3rd ed p 436 -rrb- the issue of the spanish-american war at least as regard the mere defeat of spain be perhaps a foregone conclusion that spain even without a serious insurrection on she hand be unequal to the task of meeting so powerful a antagonist as the united state must have be evident even to spaniard be that as it may a early collapse of the spanish defense be not anticipate and however one-sided the war may have be see to be it furnished example illustrate rule as old as naval warfare mahan say of it that ` while possess as every war do characteristic of its own differentiate it from other nevertheless

superiority of the american sea-power ' a million of the best soldier ' say mahan ` would have be powerless in face of hostile control of the sea ' that control be obtain and keep by the united state navy thus permit the unobstructed despatch of troops -- and they subsequent reinforcement and supply -- to spanish territory which be finally conquer not by the navy but by the army on shore that it be the navy which make this final conquest possible happen in this case to be make specially evident by the action of the united state government which stop a military expedition on the point of start for cuba until the sea be clear of all spanish naval force worth attention -lrb- footnote 49 : _ lessons_of_the_war_with_spain _ p 16 -rrb- the event of the long period which we have be consider will have show how sea-power operate and what it effect what be in it will have appear from this narrative more clearly than would have be possible from any mere definition like many other thing sea-power be compose of several element to reach the highest degree of efficacy it should be base upon a population naturally maritime and on a ocean commerce naturally develop rather than artificially entice to extend itself its outward and visible sign be a navy strong in the discipline skill and courage of a numerous _ personnel _ habituate to the sea in the number and quality of its ship in the excellence of its _ matériel _ and in the efficiency scale security and geographical position of its arsenal and basis history have demonstrate that sea-power thus condition can gain any purely maritime object can protect the trade and the communication of a widely extended empire and whilst so do can ward off from its shore a formidable invader there be however limitation to be note leave to itself its operation be confine to the water or at any rate to the inner edge of a narrow zone of coast it prepare the way for the advance of a army the work of which it be not intend and be unable to perform behind it in the territory of which it guard the shore there must be a land-force adjust in organization equipment and number to the circumstance of the country the possession of a navy do not permit a sea-surrounded state to dispense with all fix defence or fortification but it do render it unnecessary and indeed absurd that they should be abundant or gigantic the danger which always impend over the sea-power of any country be that after be long unused it may lose touch of the sea the revolution in the constructive art during the last half-century which have also be a period of but little-interrupted naval peace and the universal adoption of mechanical appliance both for ship-propulsion and for many minor service -- mere _ matériel _ be thereby raise in the general estimation far above really more important matter -- make the danger mention more menacing in the present age than it have ever be before ii the command of the sea -lrb- 50 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 50 :

with the rhetorical expression 'em pire of the sea ' mahan instead of it use the term ` control of the sea ' which have the merit of precision and be not likely to be misunderstand or mix up with a form of word mean something different the expression ` command of the sea ' however in its proper and strategic sense be so firmly fix in the language that it would be a hopeless task to try to expel it and as no doubt writer will continue to use it it must be explain and illustrate not only do it differ in mean from ` dominion or sovereignty of the sea ' it be not even truly derive therefrom as can be briefly show ` it have become a uncontested principle of modern international law that the sea as a general rule can not be subject to appropriation ' -lrb- 51 -rrb- this however be quite modern we ourselves do not admit the principle till 1805 the russian do not admit it till 1824 and the american and then only tacitly not till 1894 most european nation at some time or other have

sea surround the british isle like other institution the english sovereignty of the sea be and be admit to be beneficent for a long period then come the time when it ought to have be abandon as obsolete but it be not and so it lead to war the general conviction of the maritime nation be that the lord of the sea would provide for the police of the water over which he exercise dominion in rude

apparent as soon as we come to the consideration of the first struggle or rather series of struggle for the command of the sea gain this be the result of we war with the dutch in the seventeenth century at the time of the first dutch war 1652-54 and probably of the later war also a great many people and especially seamen believe that the conflict be due to a determination on we part to retain and on that of the dutch to put a end to the english sovereignty or dominion the obstinacy of the dutch in object to pay the old-established mark of respect to the english flag be quite reason enough in the eye of most englishman and probably of most dutchman also to justify hostility which other reason may have render inevitable the remarkable thing about the dutch war be that in reality what we gain be the possibility of secure a absolute command of the sea we come out of the struggle a great and in a fair way of become the greatest naval power it be this which prompt vice-admiral p h colomb to hold that there be various kind of command such as ` absolute or assure ' ` temporary ' ` with definite ulterior purpose ' & c a explanation that would make all these term intelligible would be voluminous and be unnecessary here it will be enough to say that the absolute command -- of attempt to gain which as colomb tell we the anglo-dutch war be the most complete example -- be nothing but a attribute of the nation whose power on the sea be paramount it exist and may be visible in time of peace the command which as say above express a definite strategical condition be existent only in time of war it can easily be see that the former be essential to a empire like the british the part of which be bind together by maritime communication inability to keep these communication open can have only one result viz the loss of the part with which communication can not be maintain experience of war as well as reason will have make it evident that inability to keep open sea-communication can not be limit to any single line because the inability must be due either to incapacity in the direction of hostility or insufficiency of force if we have not force enough to keep open all the communication of we widely extended empire or if -- have force enough -- we be too foolish to employ it properly we do not hold the command of the sea and the empire must fall if seriously attack the strategic command of the sea in a particular war or campaign have equal concern for all maritime belligerent before see what it be it will be well to learn on high authority what it be not mahan say that command or to use he own term ` control of the sea however real do not imply that a enemy 's single ship or small squadron can not steal out of port can not cross more or less frequented tract of ocean make harass descent upon unprotected point of a long coast-line enter blockade harbor on the contrary history have show that such evasion be always possible to some extent to the weaker party however great the inequality of naval strength ' -lrb- 55 -rrb- the anglo-french command of the sea in 1854-56 complete as it be do not enable the ally to intercept the russian ship in the north-western pacific nor do that hold by the federal in the american civil war put a early stop to the cruise of the confederate vessel what the term really do imply be the power possess from the first or gain during hostility by one belligerent of carry out considerable over-sea expedition at will in the russian war just mention the ally have such overwhelmingly superior sea-power that the russian abandon to they without a struggle the command of the sea and the more recent landing in south africa more than six thousand mile away of a large british army without even a threat of interruption on the voyage be another instance of unchallenged command in war between great power and also between secondary power if nearly equally match this absence of challenge be rare the rule be that the command of the sea have to be win after hostility begin to win it the enemy 's naval force must be neutralise it must be drive into he port and there blockade or ` mask ' and thus render virtually innocuous or it must be defeat and destroy the latter be the preferable because the more effective plan as be perceptible in the spanish-american war of 1898 as long as one belligerent 's fleet be intact or at large the other be reluctant to carry out any considerable expedition over-sea in fact the command of the sea have not be secure whilst the enemy continue to have a ` fleet in be

eventually force to surrender the french have not perceive that except for a short time and for minor operation you can not separate the command of the mediterranean or of any particular area of water from that of the sea in general local command of the sea may enable a belligerent to make a hasty raid seize a relatively insignificant port or cut out a vessel but it will not ensure he be able to effect anything require considerable time for its execution or in other word anything likely to have a important influence on the course of the war if great britain have not naval force enough to retain command of the mediterranean she will certainly not have force enough to retain command of the english channel it can be easily show why it should be so in war danger come less from condition of locality than from the enemy 's power to hurt take up a weak position when confront a enemy may help he in the exercise of he power but it do not constitute it -lrb- 57 -rrb- a maritime enemy 's power to hurt reside in he fleet if that can be neutralise he power disappear it be in the highest degree improbable that this end can be attain by splitting up we own fleet into fragment so as to have a part of it in nearly every quarter in which the enemy may try to do we mischief the most promising plan -- as experience have often prove -- be to meet the enemy when he show himself with a force sufficiently strong to defeat he the proper station of the british fleet in war should accordingly be the nearest possible point to the enemy 's force this be the fundamental principle of nelson 's strategy and it be as valid now as ever it be if we succeed in get into close proximity to the hostile fleet with a adequate force of we own we foe can not obtain command of the sea or of any part of it whether that part be the mediterranean or the english channel at any rate until he have defeat we if he be strong enough to defeat we fleet he obtain the command of the sea in general and it be for he to decide whether he shall show the effectiveness of that command in the mediterranean or in the channel -lrb- footnote 57 : in he _ history_of_scotland _ -lrb- 1873 -rrb- j h m burton speaking

sea hold by the fleet that find shelter in the fiord and firth ' -rrb- in the smaller operation of war temporary command of a particular area of water may suffice for the success of a expedition or at least will permit the execution of the preliminary movement when the main fleet of a country be at a distance -- which it ought not to be except with the object of near the oppose fleet -- a small hostile expedition may slip across say the channel throw shell into a coast town or burn a fishing village and get home again unmolest its action would have no sort of influence on the course of the campaign and would therefore be useless it would also most likely lead to reprisal and if this process be repeat the war would probably degenerate into the antiquated system of ` cross-raid ' discard century ago not at all for reason of humanity but because it become certain that war could be more effectually wage in other way the nation in command of the sea may resort to raiding to expedite the formal submission of a already defeat enemy as russium do when at war with sweden in 1719 but in such a case the other side can not retaliate temporary command of local water will also permit of operation rather more considerable than mere raiding attack but the duration of these operation must be adjust to the time available if the duration of the temporary command be insufficient the operation must fail it must fail even if the earlier step have be take successfully temporary command of the baltic in war might enable a german force to occupy a aland isle but unless the temporary could be convert into permanent command germany could make no use of the acquisition which in the end would revert as a matter of course to its former possessor the command of the english channel which napoleon wish to obtain when mature he invasion project be only temporary it be possible that a reminiscence of what have happen in egypt cause he to falter at the last and that quite independently of the proceedings of villeneuve he hesitate to risk a second battle of the nile and the loss of a second army it may have be this which justify he later statement that he do not really mean to invade england in any case the english practice of fix the station of they fleet wherever that of the enemy 's be would have seriously shorten the duration of he command of the channel even if it have allow it to be win at all moreover attempt to carry out a great operation of war against time as well as against the effort of the enemy to prevent it be in the highest degree perilous in war the british navy have three prominent duty to discharge it have to protect we maritime trade to keep open the communication between the different part of the empire and to prevent invasion if we command the sea these duty will be discharge effectually as long as we command the sea the career of hostile cruiser send to prey on we commerce will be precarious because command of the sea carry with it the necessity of possess a ample cruiser force as long as the condition mention be satisfied we ocean communication will be keep open because a inferior enemy who can not obtain the command require will be too much occupy in see to he own safety to be able to interfere seriously with that of any part of we empire this be so it be evident that the greater operation of invasion can not be attempt much less carry to a successful termination by the side which can not make head against the oppose fleet command of the sea be the indispensable preliminary condition of a successful military expedition send across the water it enable the nation which possess it to attack its foe where it please and where they seem to be most vulnerable at the same time it give to its possessor security against serious counter-attack and afford to he maritime commerce the most efficient protection that can be devise it be in fact the main object of naval warfare iii war and its chief lesson -lrb- 58 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 58 : write in 1900 -lrb- _ naval_annual _ 1901 -rrb- -rrb- have the expression ` real war ' be introduce into the title of this chapter its introduction would have be justifiable the source -- if not of we knowledge of combat at least of the view which be sure to prevail when we come to actual fighting -- be to be find in two well-defined dissimilar and widely separated area within one be include the record of war within the other remembrance of the exercise and maneuver of a time of peace the future belligerent will almost of a certainty have take a practical part in the latter whilst it be probable that he will have have no personal experience of the former the longer the time elapse since hostility be in progress the more probable and more general do this absence of experience become the fight man -- that be to say the man set apart pay and train so as to be ready to fight when call upon -- be of the same nature as the rest of he species this be a truism but it be necessary to insist upon it because professional and especially professorial strategist and tactician almost invariably ignore it that which we have see and know have not only more but very much more influence upon the mind of nearly all of we than that of which we have only hear and most likely hear but imperfectly the result be that when peace be interrupted and the fight man -- on both sea and land -- be confront with the problem of practical belligerency he bring to he attempt at they solution a intellectual equipment draw not from knowledge of real war but from the less trustworthy arsenal of the recollection of he peace training when peace especially a long peace end the method which it have introduce be the first enemy which the organise defender of a country have to overcome there be plenty of evidence to prove that -- except of course in unequal conflict between highly organise civilised state and savage or semi-barbarian tribe -- success in war be directly proportionate to the extent of the preliminary victory over the predominance of impression derive from the habit and exercise of a armed force during peace that the cogency of this evidence be not invariably recognize be to be attribute to insufficient attention to history and to disinclination to apply its lesson properly a primary object of the _ naval_annual _ -- indeed the chief reason for its publication -- be to assist in advance the efficiency of the british navy its page be eminently the place for a review of the historical example of the often-recurring inability of system establish in peace to stand the test of war hostility on land be more frequent and much more frequently write about than those by sea the history of the former as well as of the latter must be examine the two class of warfare have much in common the principle of they strategy be identical and as regard some of they main feature so be those of the tactic follow in each consequently the history of land warfare have its lesson for those who desire to achieve success in warfare on the sea that this have often be lose sight of be largely due to a misapprehension of the meaning of term the two word ` military ' and ` army ' have be give in english a narrower signification than they ought and than they use to have both term have be gradually restricted in they use and make to apply only to the land service this have be unfortunate because record of occurrence and discussion capable of impart much valuable instruction to naval officer have be pass over by they as inapplicable to they own call it may have be notice that captain mahan use the word ` military ' in its right sense as indicate the member and the most important class of operation of both land - and sea-force the french through whom the word have come to we from the latin use it in the same sense as mahan _ un_militaire _ be a member of either a land army or a navy the ` naval _ and _ military intelligence ' of the english press be give under the head ` nouvelle militaire ' in the french we word ` army ' also come to we direct from the french who still apply it equally to both service -- _ armée_de _ _ terre_armée_de_mer _ it be a participle and mean ` arm ' the word ` force ' be understand the kindred word _ armada _ in spanish and portuguese and _ arma _ in italian -- equally derive from the latin -- be use to indicate a fleet or navy another name be give to a land army the word ` army ' be generally apply to a fleet in former day by the english as will be see on reference to the navy record society 's volume on the defeat of the spanish armada this short etymological discussion be not inappropriate here for it show why we should not neglect authority on the history and conduct of war merely because they do not state specially that they be deal with the naval branch of it a very slight knowledge of history be quite enough to make we acquaint with the frequent recurrence of defeat and disaster inflict on armed force by antagonist whose power to do so have not be previously suspect it have be the same on the sea as on the land though -- owe to more copious record -- we may have a larger list of event on the latter it will not be deny that it be of immense importance to we to inquire how this happen and ascertain how -- for the future -- it may be render highly improbable in we own case a brief enumeration of the more striking instance will make it plain that the event in question have be confine to no particular age and to no particular country it may be say that the more elaborately organise and train in peace time a armed force happen to be the more unexpected always and generally the more disastrous be its downfall example of this be to be find in the earliest campaign of which we have anything like detailed account and they continue to reappear down to very recent time in the elaborate nature of its organization and training there probably never have be a army surpassing that lead by xerx into greece twenty-four century ago something like eight year have be devote to its preparation the minute account of its review by xerx on the shore of the hellespont prove that however inefficient the semi-civilised contingent accompany it may have be the regular persian army appear in discipline equipment and drill to have come up to the highest standard of the most intense ` pipeclay ' epoch in number alone its superiority be considerable to the last and down to the very eve of platæa its commander openly display he contempt for he enemy yet no defeat could be more complete than that suffer by the persian at the hand of they despise antagonist as if to establish beyond dispute the identity of govern condition in both land and maritime war the next very conspicuous disappointment of a elaborately organise force be that of the athenian fleet at syracuse at the time athen without question stand at the head of the naval world : she empire be in the truest sense the product of sea-power she navy whilst unequalled in size might claim without excessive exaggeration to be invincible the great armament which the athenian despatch to sicily seem in number alone capable of triumph over all resistance if the athenian navy have already meet with some explicable mishap it look back with complacent confidence on the glorious achievement of more than half a century previously it have enjoy many year of what be so nearly a maritime peace that its principal exploit have be the subjection of state weak to insignificance on the sea as compare with imperial athen profuse expenditure on its maintenance the ` continued practice ' of which pericle boast the peace maneuver of a remote past skilfully design equipment and the memory of past glory -- all these do not avail to save it from defeat at the hand of a enemy who only begin to organise a fleet when the athenian have invade he coast water ideal perfection as a regular army have never be so nearly reach as by that of sparta the spartan spend he life in the barrack and the mess-room he amusement be the exercise of the parade ground for many generation a spartan force have never be defeat in a pitched battle we have have in modern time some instance of a hectoring soldiery arrogantly prance amongst population whose official defender it have defeat in battle but nonesuch could vie with the spartan in the sublimity of they military self-esteem overweening confidence in the prowess of she army lead sparta to trample with ruthless disdain on the rights of other the iniquitous attack on thebe a state think incapable of effectual resentment be avenge by the defeat of leuctra which announce the end of the political supremacy and the military predominance of sparta in the series of struggle with carthage which result in put rome in a position enable she eventually to win the dominion of the ancient world the issue be to be decide on the water carthage be essentially a maritime state the foundation of the city be effect by a maritime expedition its dominion lay on the neighbouring coast or in region to which the carthaginian could penetrate only by traverse the sea to carthage she fleet be ` all in all ' : she navy support by large revenue and continuously maintain be more of a ` regular ' force than any modern navy before the second half of the seventeenth century the roman be almost without a fleet and when they form one the undertaking be ridicule by the carthaginian with a unconcealed assumption of superiority the defeat of the latter off mylæ the first of several come as a great surprise to they and as we can see now indicate the eventual ruin of they city we be so familiar with story of the luxury and corruption of the roman during the decline of the empire that we be likely to forget that the decline go on for century and that they armed force however recruit present over and over again abundant sign of physical courage and vigor the victory of stilicho over alaric at pollentium have be aptly parallel with that of marius over the cimbrus this be by no mean the only achievement of the roman army of the decadence a century and a quarter later -- when the empire of the west have fall and the general decline have make further progress -- belisarius conduct successful campaign in persium in north africa in sicily and in italy the mere list of country show that the mobility and endurance of the roman force during a period in which little creditable be generally look for be not inferior to they discipline and courage yet they meet with disastrous defeat after all and at the hand of race which they have more than once prove themselves capable of withstand it could not have be because the later roman equipment be inferior the organization less elaborate or the training less careful than those of they barbarian enemy though it be hold by some in these day that the naval power of spain in the latter part of the sixteenth century be not really formidable that do not appear to have be the opinion of contemporary whether spaniard or otherwise some english seaman of the time do indeed declare they conviction that philip the second 's navy be not so much to be fear as many of they fellow-countrymen thought but in the public opinion of the age spain be the greatest or indeed the one great naval state she possess a more systematically organise navy than any other country have the ocean for a field of action have then or till long afterwards even genoa and venice whose operation moreover be restricted to mediterranean water could not have be serve by more finish specimen of the naval officer and the man-of-war 's man of the time than a large proportion of the military _ personnel _ of the regular spanish fleet as basque castilian catalan or aragonese or all combine the crew of spanish fight ship could look back upon a glorious past it be no wonder that by common consent of those who man it the title of ` invincible ' be informally confer upon the armada which in 1588 sail for the english channel how it fare be a matter of common knowledge no one could have be more surprised at the result than the gallant officer who lead its squadron spain furnish another instance of the unexpected overthrow of a military body to which long cohesion and precise organization be believe to have secure invincibility the spanish be consider the ` most redoubtable infantry in europe ' till its unexpected defeat at rocrous the effect of this defeat be far-reaching notwithstanding the bravery of she son which have never be open to question and in fact have always be conspicuous the military superiority of spain be break beyond repair in the history of other country be to be find example equally instructive the defeat of almansa brihuega and villaviciosa be nearly contemporary with the victory of blenheim and ramilly and the thousand of british troops compel to lay down they arm at the first name belong to the same service as they fellow-countryman who so often march to victory under marlborough a striking example of the disappointment which lie in wait for military self-satisfaction be furnish by the defeat of soubise at rossbach by frederick the great before the action the french have ostentatiously show they contempt for they opponent the service which glory in the exploit of anson and of hawke discern the approach of the seven year ' war without misgive and the ferocity show in the treatment of byng enable we now to measure the surprise cause by the result of the action off minorca there be further surprise in store for the english navy at the end of the seven year ' war its reputation for invincibility be generally established few perhaps none venture to doubt that if there be anything like equality between the opposing force a meeting between the french and the british fleet could have but one result -- viz the decisive victory of the latter experience in the english channel on the other side of the atlantic and in the bay of bengal -- during the war of american independence -- roughly upset this flattering anticipation yet in the end the british navy come out the unquestioned victor in the struggle : which prove the excellence of its quality after every allowance be make for the incapacity of the government we must suspect that there be something else which so often frustrated the effort of such a formidable force as the british navy of the day must essentially have be on land the surprise be even more mortifying and it be no exaggeration to say that a year before it occur such a event as the surrender of burgoyne 's army to a imperfectly organise and train body of provincial would have seem impossible the army which frederick the great bequeath to prussium be universally regard as the model of efficiency its method be copy in other country and foreign officer desire to excel in they profession make pilgrimage to berlin and potsdam to drink of the stream of military knowledge at its source when it come in contact with the tumultuous array of revolutionary france the performance of the force that preserve the tradition of the great frederick be disappointingly want in brilliancy a few year later it suffer a overwhelming disaster the prussian defeat at jena be serious as a military event its political effect be of the utmost importance yet many who be involve in that disaster take later on a effective part in the expulsion of the conqueror from they country and in settle the history of europe for nearly half a century at waterloo the brilliancy of the exploit of wellington and the british army in portugal and spain have throw into comparative obscurity that part of the peninsular war which be wage for year by the french against the spaniard spain distract by palace intrigue and political faction with the flower of she troops in a distant comer of europe and several of she most important fortress in the hand of she assailant seem destine to fall a easy and a speedy prey to the foremost military power in the world the attitude of the invader make it evident that they believe themselves to be march to certain victory even the british soldier -- of whom there be never many more than 50000 in the peninsula and for some year not half that number -- be disdain until they have be encounter the french arm meet with disappointment after disappointment on one occasion a whole french army over 18000 strong surrender to a spanish force and become prisoner of war before the struggle close there be six marshal of france with nearly 400000 troops in the peninsula the great effort which these figure indicate be unsuccessful and the intruder be drive from the country yet they be the comrade of the victor of austerlitz of jena and of wagram and part of that mighty organization which have plant its victorious standard in berlin and vienna hold down prussium like a conquer province and shatter into fragment the holy roman empire in 1812 the british navy be at the zenith of its glory it have not only defeat all its opponent it have also sweep the sea of the fleet of the historic maritime power -- of spain of france which have absorb the italian maritime state of the netherland of denmark warfare nearly continuous for eighteen and uninterrupted for nine year have transform the british navy into a organization more nearly resemble a permanently maintain force than it have be throughout its previous history its long employment in serious hostility have save it from some of the failing which the narrow spirit inherent in a close profession be only too sure to foster it have however a confidence -- not unjustified by its previous exploit -- in its own invincibility this confidence do not diminish and be not less ostentatiously exhibit as its great achievement recede more and more into the past the new enemy who now appear on the farther side of the atlantic be not consider formidable in the british navy there be 145000 man in the united state navy the number of officer seaman and marine available for ocean service be less than 4500 -- a insignificant numerical addition to the enemy with whom we be already contend the subsequent and rapid increase in the american _ personnel _ to 18000 show the small extent to which it could be consider a ` regular ' force its permanent nucleus be overwhelmingly outnumber by the hastily enrol addition we defeat in the war of 1812 have be greatly exaggerate but all the same they do constitute rebuff to we naval self-esteem which be highly significant in themselves and deserve deep attention rebuff of the kind be not confine to the sea service and at new orlean we army which number in its rank soldier of busaco fuente de onoro and salamanca meet with a serious defeat when the austro-prussian war break out in 1866 the austrian commander-in-chief general benedek publish a order probably still in the remembrance of many which officially declare the contempt for the enemy feel in the imperial army even those who perceive that the prussian force be not fit subject of contempt count with confidence on the victory of the austrian yet the latter never gain a considerable success in they combat with the prussian and within a few week from the beginning of hostility the general who have assume such a lofty tone of superiority in speaking of he foe have to implore he sovereign to make peace to avoid further disaster at the beginning of the franco-german war of 1870 the widespread anticipation of french victory be clearly show by the unanimity with which the journalist of various nationality illustrate they papers with map give the country between the french frontier and berlin and omit the part of france extend to paris in less than five week from the opening of hostility event have make it certain that a map of the country to the eastward of lorraine would be practically useless to a student of the campaign unless it be to follow the route of the hundred of thousand of french soldier who be convey to germany as prisoner of war it be to be specially note that in the above enumeration only contest in which the result be unexpected -- unexpected not only by the beaten side but also by impartial observer -- have be specify in all war one side or the other be defeat and it have not be attempt to give a general _ résumé _ of the history of war the object have be to show the frequency -- in all age and in all circumstance of systematic as distinguish from savage warfare -- of the defeat of the force which by general consent be regard as certain to win now it be obvious that a result so frequently reappear must have a distinct cause which be well worth try to find out discovery of the cause may enable we to remove it in the future and thus prevent result which be likely to be all the more disastrous because they have not be foresee professional military writer -- a expression which as before explain include naval -- do not help we much in the prosecution of the search which be so eminently desirable as a rule they have contrived rather to hide than to bring to light the object seek for it would be do they injustice to assume that this have be do with deliberate intention it be much more likely due to professional bias which exercise over the mind of member of definitely limited profession incessant and potent domination when allude to occurrence include in the enumeration give above they exhibit sign of a resolve to defend they profession against possible imputation of inefficiency much more than a desire to get to the root of the matter this explain the unremitting eagerness of military writer to extol the special quality develop by long-continued service habit and method they be always apprehensive of the possibility of credit be give to fight body more loosely organise and less precisely train in peace time than the body to which they themselves belong this sensitiveness as to the merit of they particular profession and impatience of even indirect criticism be unnecessary there be nothing in the history of war to show that a untrained force be better than a trained force on the contrary all historical evidence be on the other side in quite as many instance as be present by the opposite the force which put a unexpected end to the military supremacy long possess by they antagonist be themselves in the strictest sense of the word ` regular ' the theban whom epaminonda lead to victory over the spartan at leuctra no more resemble a hasty levy of armed peasant or man imperfectly train as soldier than do napoleon 's army which overthrow the prussian at jena or the german who defeat the french at gravelotte and sedan nothing could have be less like a ` irregular ' force than the fleet with which la galissonnière beat byng off minorca or the french fleet which in the war of american independence so often disappointed the hope of the british the record of war on land and by sea -- especially the extract from they include in the enumeration already give -- lend no support to the silly suggestion that efficient defense can be provide for a country by ` a untrained man with a rifle behind a hedge ' the truth be that it be not the absence of organization or training on one side which enable it to defeat the other if the beaten side have be elaborately organise and carefully train there must have be something bad in its organization or its method now this ` something bad ' this defect -- wherever it have disclose itself -- have be enough to neutralise the most splendid courage and the most unselfish devotion it have be see that army and navy the valor of which have never be question have be defeat by antagonist sometimes as highly organise as they be and sometimes much less so this ought to put we on the track of the cause which have produce a effect so little anticipate a ` regular ' permanently embody or maintain service of fight man be always likely to develop a spirit of intense professional self-satisfaction the more highly organise it be and the more sharply its official frontier be define the more intense be this spirit likely to become a ` close ' service of the kind grow restive at outside criticism and yield more and more to the conviction that no advance in efficiency be possible unless it be the result of suggestion emanate from its own rank its view of thing become narrower and narrower whereas efficiency in war demand the very widest view ignorant critic call the spirit thus engender ` professional conservatism ' the fact be that change be not object to -- be even welcome however frequent it may be provide only that it be suggest from inside a immediate result be ` unreality and formalism of peace training ' -- to quote a recent thoughtful military critic as the formalism become more pronounced so the unreality increase the proposer or introducer of a system of organization of training or of exercise be often perhaps usually capable of distinguish between the true and the false the real and the unreal he successor the man who continue the execution of he plan can hardly bring to they work the open mind possess by the originator they can not escape from the influence of the method which have be provide for they ready make and which they be incessantly engage in practise this be not a peculiarity of the military profession in either branch -- it extend to nearly every call but in the profession specify which be a service rather than a freely exercise profession it be more prominent human thought always have a tendency to run in groove and in military institution the groove be purposely make deep and departure from they rigorously forbid all exercise even those design to have the widest scope tend to become mere drill each performance produce and bequeath for use on the next occasion a set of customary method of execution which be readily adopt by the subsequent performer there grow up in time a kind of body of customary law govern the execution of peace operation -- the principle be peace-operation principle wholly and solely -- which law few dare to disobey and which eventually obtain the sanction of official write regulation as scharnhorst quote by baron von der goltz say ` we have begin to place the art of war higher than military virtue ' the eminent authority who thus express himself write the word before the great catastrophe of jena and with prophetic insight sharpen by he fear of the menacing tendency of peace-training formalism and unreality add he conviction that ` this have be the ruin of nation from time immemorial ' independently of the evidence of history already adduce it would be reasonable to conclude that the tendency be strengthen and make more menacing when the service in which it prevail become more highly specialise if custom and regulation leave little freedom of action to the individual member of a armed force the difficulty -- sure to be experience by they -- of shake themselves clear of they fetter when the need for do so arise be increase to realize -- when peace be break -- the practical condition of war demand a effort of which the unfettered intelligence alone seem capable the great majority of successful leader in war on both element have not be considerably or at all superior in intellectual acuteness to number of they fellow but they have have strength of character and they mind be not squeeze in a mould into a commonplace and uniform pattern the ` canker of a long peace ' during recent year at any rate be not manifest in disuse of arm but in mistaken method for a quarter of a century the civilised world have tend more and more to become a drill-ground but the spirit dominate it have be that of the pedant there have be more exercise and less reality the training especially of officer become increasingly scholastic this and the deterioration consequent on it be not merely modern phenomenon they appear in all age ` the sword of the saracen ' say gibbon ` become less formidable when they youth be draw from the camp to the college ' the essence of pedantry be want of originality it be nourish on imitation for the pedant to imitate be enough of itself to he the suitability of the model be immaterial thus military body have be ruin by mimicry of foreign arrangement quite inapplicable to the condition of the mimic ' country more than twenty year ago sir henry maine speaking of the war of american independence say ` next to they stubborn valor the chief secret of the colonist ' success be the incapacity of the english general train in the stiff prussian system soon to perish at jena to adapt themselves to new condition of warfare ' he point out that the effect of this uncritical imitation of what be foreign be again experience by man ` full of admiration of a newer german system ' we may not be able to explain what it be but all the same there do exist something which we call national characteristic the aim of all training should be to utilise these to the full not to ignore they the naval method of a continental state with relatively small oceanic interest or with but a brief experience of secure these can not be very applicable to a great maritime state whose chief interest have be on the sea for many year how be all this applicable to the ultimate efficiency of the british navy it may be allow that there be a good deal of truth in what have be write above but it may be say that consideration sententiously present can not claim to have much practical value so long as they be absolute and unapplied the statement can not be dispute it be unquestionably necessary to make the application the change in naval _ matériel _ so often speak of introduce within the last fifty year have be rival by the change in the composition of the british navy the human element remain in original individual character exactly the same as it always be but there have be a great change in the opportunity and facility offer for the development of the faculty most desire in man-of-war 's man all reform -- use the word in its true sense of alteration and not in its strained sense of improvement -- have be in the direction of secure perfect uniformity if we take the particular directly suggest by the word just use we may remember almost with astonishment that there be no british naval uniform for anyone below the rank of officer till after 1860 now at every inspection much time be take up in ascertain if the narrow tape embroidery on a frock collar be of the regulation width and if the row of tape be the proper distance apart the diameter of a cloth cap be officially define and any departure from the regulation number of inch -lrb- and fraction of a inch -rrb- be as sure of involve punishment as insubordination it be the same in greater thing till 1853 -- in which year the change come into force -- there be no permanent british naval service except the commission and warrant officer not till several year later do the new ` continuous service ' man equal half of the bluejacket aggregate now every bluejacket proper serve continuously and have be in the navy since boyhood the training of the boy be make uniform no member of the ship 's company -- except a domestic -- be now allow to set foot on board a sea-going ship till he have be put through a training course which be exactly like that through which every other member of he class pass even during the comparatively brief period in which young officer enter the navy by join the college at portsmouth it be only the minority who receive the special academic training till the establishment of the _ illustrious _ training school in 1855 the great majority of officer join they first ship as individual from a variety of different and quite independent quarter now every one of they have as a preliminary condition to spend a certain time -- the same for all -- in a school till a much later period every engineer enter separately now pass through a training establishment be obligatory for engineer also within the service there have be repeat formation of distinct branch or ` school ' such as the further specialised specialist gunnery and torpedo section it be not till 1860 that uniform watch bill quarter bill and station bill be introduce and not till later that they general adoption be make compulsory up to that time the internal organization and discipline of a ship depend on she own officer it be suppose that capacity to command a ship imply at least capacity to distribute and train she crew the result be a larger scope than be now think permissible for individual capability however short-lived some particular drill or exercise may be however soon it be supersede by another as long as it last the strictest conformity to it be rigorously enforce even the number of time that a exercise have to be perform difference in class of ship or in the nature of the service on which she be employ notwithstanding be authoritatively lay down still more noteworthy though much less often speak of than the change in _ matériel _ have be the progress of the navy towards centralisation naval duty be now formulate at a desk on shore and the mode of carry they out notify to the service in print all this would have be quite as astonishing to the contemporary of nelson or of exmouth and codrington as the aspect of a battleship or of a 12-inch breech-loading gun let it be clearly understand that none of these thing have be mention with the intention of criticise they either favourably or unfavourably they have be cite in order that it may be see that the change in naval affair be by no means one in _ matériel _ only and that the transformation in other matter have be stupendous and revolutionary beyond all previous experience it follow inevitably from this that we shall wage war in future under condition dissimilar from any hitherto know in this very fact there lie the making of a great surprise it will have appear from the historical statement give above how serious a surprise sometimes turn out to be its consequence always significant be not unfrequently far-reaching the question of practical moment be : how be we to guard ourselves against such a surprise to this a satisfactory answer can be give it might be summarise in the admonition : abolish over-centralisation give proper scope to individual capacity and initiative avoid professional self-sufficiency when closely look at it be one of the strangest manifestation of the spirit of modern navy that though the issue of land warfare be rarely think instructive the peace method of land force be extensively and eagerly copy by the sea-service the exercise of the parade ground and the barrack square be take over readily and so be the parade ground and the barrack square themselves this may be right the point be that it be novel and that a navy into the training of which the innovation have enter must differ considerably from one that be without it and find no need of it during a long course of serious war at any rate no one will deny that parade-ground evolution and barrack-square drill expressly aim at the elimination of individuality or just the quality to the possession of which we owe the phenomenon call in vulgar speech the ` handy man ' habit and sentiment base on a great tradition and the faculty develop by they be not kill all at once but innovation in the end annihilate they and they not have yet entirely disappear give no ground for doubt they eventual and even near extinction the aptitude still universally most prize in the seaman be produce and nourish by practice and under condition no longer allow to prevail should we lose those aptitude be we likely to reach the position in war gain by we predecessor for the british empire the matter be vital : success in maritime war decisive and overwhelming be indispensable to we existence we have to consider the desirability of ` take stock ' of we moral as well as of we material naval equipment : to ascertain where the accumulate effect of repeat innovation have carry we the mere fact of complete the investigation will help we to rate at they true value the change which have be introduce will show we what to retain what to reject and what to substitute there be no essential vagueness in these allusion if they seem vague it be because the moment for particularising have not yet come the public opinion of the navy must first be turn in the right direction it must be lead to question the soundness of the basis on which many present method rest have once begin to do this we shall find no difficulty in settle in detail and with precision what the true element of naval efficiency be iv -lrb- 59 -rrb- the historical relation between the navy and the merchant service -lrb- footnote 59 : write in 1898 -lrb- _ the_times _ -rrb- -rrb- the regret often express that the crew of british merchant ship now include a large proportion of foreigner be found chiefly on the apprehension that a well-tested and hitherto secure recruiting ground for the navy be likely to be close it have be state repeatedly and the statement have be generally accept without question that in former day when a great expansion of we fleet be force on we by the near approach of danger we rely upon the ample resource of we merchant service to complete the manning of we ship of war even in a short time and that the demand of the navy upon the former be always satisfy it be assume that compliance with those demand be as a rule not voluntary but be enforce by the press-gang the resource it be say exist and be within reach and the method employ in draw upon they be a detail of comparatively minor importance we merchant ship be man by native-born british seaman of whom ten of thousand be always at hand so that if volunteer be not forthcoming the number want could be ` press ' into the royal service it be lament that at the present day the condition of affair be different that the presence in it of a large number of foreigner forbid we to regard with any confidence the merchant service as a adequate naval recruiting ground in the event of war even though we be ready to substitute for the system of ` impressment ' -- which be now consider both undesirable and impossible -- reward likely to attract volunteer the importance of the subject need not be dwell upon the necessity to a maritime state of a powerful navy include abundant resource for man it be now no more disputed than the law of gravitation if the proportion of foreigner in we merchant service be too high it be certainly deplorable and if be already too high that proportion be rise a early remedy be urgently need i do not propose to speak here of that matter which be grave enough to require separate treatment my object be to present the result of a inquiry into the history of the relation between the navy and the merchant service from which will appear to what extent the latter help in bring the former up to a war footing how far its assistance be affect by the presence in it of any foreign element and in what way impressment ensure or expedite the rendering of the assistance the inquiry have necessarily be largely statistical consequently the result will often be give in a statistical form this have the great advantage of remove the conclusion arrive at from the domain of mere opinion into that of admit fact the statistics use be those which have not be and be not likely to be question it be desirable that this should be understand because official figure have not always command universal assent lord brougham speaking in the house of lord in 1849 of table issue by the board of trade say that a lively impression prevail ` that they could prove anything and everything ' and in connection with they he adopt some unnamed person 's remark ` give I half a hour and the run of the multiplication table and i 'll engage to payoff the national debt ' in this inquiry there have be no occasion to use figure relate to the time of lord brougham 's observation we will take the last three great maritime war in which we country have be engage these be : the war of american independence the war with revolutionary france to the peace of amien and the war with napoleon the period cover by these three contest roughly correspond to the last quarter of the eighteenth and the first fifteen year of the nineteenth century in each of the three war there be a sudden and large addition to the number of seaman in the navy and in each there be considerable annual increase as the struggle continue it must be understand that we shall deal with the case of seaman only the figure which also be large relate to the marine not be include in we survey because it have never be contend that they corps look to the merchant service for any appreciable proportion of its recruit in take note of the increase of seaman vote for any year it will be necessary to make allowance also for the ` waste ' of the previous year the waste even in the latter part of the last century be large commander robinson in he valuable work ` the british fleet ' give detail show that the waste during the seven year ' war be so great as to be truly shocking in 1895 lord brassey -lrb- _ naval_annual _ -rrb- allow for the _ personnel _ of the navy even in these day of peace and advance sanitary science a yearly waste of 5 per cent a percentage which be i expect rather lower than that officially accept we may take it as certain that during the three serious war above name the annual waste be never less than 6 per cent this be perhaps to put it too low but it be better to understate the case than to appear to exaggerate it the recruit demand therefore for a year of increase armament will be the sum of the increase in man _ plus _ the waste on the previous year 's number the capacity of the british merchant service to supply what be demand would of course be all the greater the smaller the number of foreigner it contain in its rank this be not only generally admit at the present day it be also frequently point out when it be assert that the condition now be less favourable than they be owe to a recent influx of foreign seaman the fact however be that there be foreigner on board british merchant ship and it would seem in considerable number long before even the war of american independence by 13 george ii c 3 foreigner not exceed three-fourth of the crew be permit in british vessel ` and in two year to be naturalised ' by 13 george ii c 17 exemption from impressment be grant to ` every person be a foreigner who shall serve in any merchant ship or other trading vessel or privateer belong to a subject of the crown of great britain ' the act quote be pass about the time of the ` jenkin ' ear war ' and the war of the austrian succession but the fact that foreigner be allow to form the majority of a british vessel 's crew be worthy of notice the effect and probably the object of this legislation be not so much to permit foreign seaman to enter we merchant service as to permit the number of those already there to be increase it be in 1759 that lord then commander duncan report that the crew of the hire merchant ship _ royal _ _ exchange _ consist ` to a large extent of boy and foreigner many of whom could not speak english ' in 1770 by 11 george iii c 3 merchant ship be allow to have three-fourth of they crew foreigner till the 1st February 1772 act permit the same proportion of foreign seaman and extend the time be pass in 1776 1778 1779 1780 1781 and 1782 a similar act be pass in 1792 it be in contemplation to reduce the foreign proportion after the war to one-fourth in 1794 it be enact -lrb- 34 george iii c 68 -rrb- ` for the encouragement of british seaman ' that after the expiration of six month from the conclusion of the war vessel in the foreign as distinguish from the coast trade be to have they commander and three-fourth of they crew british subject from the wording of the act it seem to have be take for grant that the proportion of three-fourths _ bona_fide _ british-born seaman be not likely to be generally exceed it will have be observe that in all the legislation mention from the time of george ii downward it be assume as a matter of course that there be foreign seaman on board we merchant vessel the united state citizen in the british navy about whom there be so much discussion on the eve of the war of 1812 come principally from we own merchant service and not direct from the american it be remarkable that until a recent date the presence of foreigner in british vessel even in time of peace be not loudly or generally complain of mr w s lindsay writing in 1876 state that the throw open the coast trade in 1855 have ` neither increase on the average the number of foreigner we have hitherto be allow to employ in we ship nor deteriorated the number and quality of british seaman ' i have bring forward enough evidence to show that as far as the merchant service be the proper recruiting ground for the british navy it be not one which be devoid of a considerable foreign element we may nevertheless feel certain that that element never amount to and indeed never nearly approach three-fourth of the whole number of man employ in we ` foreign-going ' vessel for this between 50000 and 60000 man would have be require at least in the last of the three war above mention if all the foreign mercantile marine at the present day when nearly all have be so largely increase be to combine they could not furnish the number require after they own want have be satisfy during the period under review some of the lead commercial nation be at war with we so that few if any seaman could have come to we from they we custom-house statistics indicate a increase in the shipping trade of the neutral nation sufficient to have render it impossible for they to spare we any much larger number of seaman therefore it be extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that during the war the composition of we merchant service remain nearly what it be during peace it contain a far from insignificant proportion of foreigner and that proportion be augmented though by no means enormously whilst war be go on this lead we to the further conclusion that if we merchant service supply the navy with many man it could recover only a small part of the number from foreign country in fact any that it could give it have to replace from we own population almost exclusively the question now to be consider be what be the capacity of the merchant service for supply the demand of the navy in the year 1770 the number of seaman vote for the navy be 11713 owe to a fear of a difficulty with spain about the falkland island the number for the following year be suddenly raise to 31927 consequently the increase be 20214 which add to the ` waste ' on the previous year make the whole naval demand about 21000 we have not get statistics of the seaman of the whole british empire for this period but we have figure which will enable we to compute the number with sufficient accuracy for the purpose in hand in england and wale there be some 59000 seaman and those of the rest of the empire amount to about 21000 large as the ` waste ' be in the royal navy it be and still be much larger in the merchant service we may safely put it at 8 per cent at least therefore simply to keep up its number -- 80000 -- the merchant service would have have to engage fully 6400 fresh hand in view of these figure it be difficult to believe that it could have furnish the navy with 21000 man or indeed with any number approximate thereto it could not possibly have do so without restrict its operation if only for a time so far be its operation from shrink that they be positively extend the english tonnage ` clear outwards ' from we port be for the year mention as follow : 1770 703495 1771 773390 1772 818108 owe to the generally slow rate of sailing when on voyage and to the great length of time take in unload and reload abroad -- both be often effect ` in the stream ' and with the ship 's own boat -- the figure for clearance outward much more nearly represent the amount of we ` foreign-going ' tonnage a century ago than similar figure would now in these day of rapid movement after 1771 the navy be reduce and keep at a relatively low standard till 1775 in that year the state of affair in america render a increase of we naval force necessary in 1778 we be at war with france in 1779 with spain as well and in December 1780 we have the dutch for enemy in addition in September 1783 we be again at peace the way in which we have to increase the navy will be see in the follow table : --

these great and repeated demand besides make up its own ` waste ' unless its size be much reduce after 1777 indeed there be a considerable fall in the figure of english tonnage ` outwards ' i give

have indeed be a shrinkage we find however on further examination that in reality there have be none ` during the -lrb- american -rrb- war the ship-yard in every port of britain be full of employment and consequently new ship-yard be set up in place where ship have never be build before ' even the diminution in the statistics of outward clearance indicate no diminution in the number of merchant ship or they crew the missing tonnage be merely employ elsewhere ` at this time there be about 1000 vessel of private property employ by the government as transport and in other branch of the public service ' of course there have be some diminution due to the transfer of what have be british-american shipping to a new independent flag this would not have set free any man to join the navy when we come to the revolutionary war we find ourselves confront with similar condition the case of this war have often be quote as prove that in former day the navy have to rely practically exclusively on the merchant service when expansion be necessary in give evidence before a parliamentary committee about fifty year ago admiral sir t byam martin refer to the great increase of the fleet in 1793 say ` it be the merchant service that enable we to man some sixty ship of the line and double that number of frigate and smaller vessel ' he add that we have be able to bring promptly together ` about 35000 or 40000 man of the mercantile marine ' the requirement of the navy amount as state by the admiral to about 40000 man to be exact 39045 the number of seaman in the british empire in 1793 be 118952 in the next year the number show no diminution in fact it increase though but slightly to 119629 how we merchant service could have satisfy the above-mentioned immense demand on it in addition to make good its waste and then have even increase be a thing that baffle comprehension no such example of elasticity be present by any other institution admiral byam martin speak so positively and indeed with such justly admit authority that we should have to give up the problem as insoluble be it not for other passage in the admiral 's own evidence it may be mention that all the witness do not hold he view sir jame stirl a officer of nearly if not quite equal authority differ from he in continuation of he evidence sir t byam martin state that afterwards the merchant service could give only a small and occasional supply as ship arrive from foreign port or as apprentice grow out of they time now during the remain year of this war and throughout the napoleonic war great as be the demand of the navy they only in one year that of the rupture of the peace of amien equal the demand at the beginning of the revolutionary war from the beginning of hostility till the final close of the conflict in 1815 the number of merchant seaman fall only once -- viz in 1795 the fall be 3200 in 1795 however the demand for man for the navy be less than half that of 1794 the utmost therefore that sir t byam martin desire to establish be that on a single occasion in a unusually protracted continuance of war the strength of we merchant service enable it to reinforce the navy up to the latter 's requirement but its do so prevent it from give much help afterwards all the same man in large number have to be find for the navy yearly for a long time this will appear from the table which follow : --

spirit but simply because it be impossible even as regard the single exception the evidence be not uncontested and by itself though undoubtedly strong it be not convince in view of the well-grounded presumption the other way the question then that naturally arise be -- if the navy do not fill up its complement from the merchant service how do it fill they up the answer be easy we naval complement be fill up largely with boy largely with landsman largely with fisherman whose number permit this without inconvenience to they trade in general and to a small extent with merchant seaman it may be suggest that the man want by the navy could have be pass on to it from we merchant vessel which could then complete they own crew with boy landsman and fisherman it be the age in which dr price be a great authority on public finance the age of mr pitt 's sink fund when borrow money be repay with further borrowing so that a corresponding roundabout method for man the navy may have have attraction for some people a conclusive reason why it be not adopt be that its adoption would have be possible only at the cost of disorganise such a great industrial undertaking as we maritime trade that this disorganisation do not arise be prove by the fact that we merchant service flourish and expand it be widely suppose that wherever the man want for the navy may have come from they be force into it by the system of ` impressment ' the popular idea of a man-of-war 's ` lower deck ' of a century ago be that it be inhabit by a ship 's company which have be capture by the press-gang and be restrain

would indeed make a deep impression on the public and what be really the exception would be take for the rule there be no evidence to show that even from the middle of the seventeenth century any considerable number of man be raise by forcible impressment i be not acquaint with a single story of the press-gang which even when much embellished profess to narrate the seizure of more than a

of opinion by some of the older seaman of sunderland and shield when the russian war break out in 1854 the married sailor they say naturally wait for the impressment for ` we know that have always be and always will be precede by the proclamation of bounty ' the most fruitful source of error as to the procedure of the press-gang have be a deficient knowledge of etymology the word have properly no

year at least there never have be a time when the british merchant service do not contain a appreciable percentage of foreigner during the last three -lrb- and greatest -rrb- maritime war in which this country have be involve only a small proportion of the immense number of man require by the navy come or could have come from the merchant service the number of man raise for the navy by forcible impressment in war time have be enormously exaggerated owe to a confusion of term as a matter of fact the number so raise for quite two century be only a insignificant fraction of the whole v fact and fancy about the press-gang -lrb- 60 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 60 : write in 1900 -lrb- _ national_review _ -rrb- -rrb- of late year great attention have be pay to we naval history and many even of its obscure byway have be explore a general result of the investigation be that we be enable to form a high estimate of the merit of we naval administration in former century we find that for a long time the navy have possess a efficient organization that its right position as a element of the national defence be understand age ago and that english naval officer of a period which be now very remote show by they action that they exactly appreciate and -- when necessary -- be able to apply the true principle of maritime warfare if anyone still believe that the country have be save more than once merely by lucky chance of weather and that the england of elizabeth have be convert into the great oceanic and colonial british empire of victorium in ' a fit of absence of mind ' it will not be for want of material with which to form a correct judgment on these point it have be accept generally that the principal method of man we fleet in the past -- especially when war threaten to arise -- be to seize and put man on board the ship by force this have be take for grant by many and it seem to have be assume that in any case there be no way of either prove it or disprove it the truth however be that it be possible and -- at least as regard the period of we last great naval war -- not difficult to make sure if it be true or not record cover a long succession of year still exist and in these can be find the name of nearly every seaman in the navy and a statement of the condition on which he join it the exception would not amount to more than a few hundred out of many ten of thousand of name and would be due to the disappearance -- in itself very infrequent -- of some of the document and to occasional but also very rare inaccuracy in the entry the historical evidence on which the belief in the prevalence of impressment as a method of recruit the navy for more than a hundred year be base be limit to contemporary statement in the english newspaper and especially in the issue of the periodical call _ the_naval_chronicle _ publish in 1803 the first year of the war follow the rupture of the peace of amien reader of captain mahan 's work on sea-power will remember the picture he draw of the activity of the press-gang in that year he authority be _ the_naval_chronicle _ this evidence will be submit directly to close examination and we shall see what importance ought to be attach to it in the great majority of case however the belief above mention have no historical foundation but be to be trace to the frequency with which the suppose operation of the press-gang be use by the author of naval story and drama and by artist who take scene of naval life for they subject violent seizure and abduction lend themselves to effective treatment in literature and in art and writer and painter do not neglect what be so plainly suggest a fruitful source of the widespread belief that we navy in the old day be chiefly man by recourse to compulsion be a confusion between two word of independent origin and different meaning which in age when exact spelling be not think indispensable come to be write and pronounced alike during we later great maritime war the official term apply to anyone recruit by impressment be ` prest-man ' in the sixteenth and seventeenth century and part of the eighteenth century this term mean the exact opposite it mean a man who have voluntarily engage to serve and who have receive a sum in advance call ` prest-money ' ' a prest-man ' we be tell by that high authority professor sir j k laughton ` be really a man who receive the prest of 12d as a soldier when enlist ' in the ` encyclopædia metropolitana ' -lrb- 1845 -rrb- we find : -- ` impress or more correctly imprest ie pay earnest-money to seamen by the king 's commission to the

posthumous work of stephen skinner ` etymologia linguæ anglicanæ ' -lrb- 1671 -rrb- the author join together ` press or imprest ' as though they be the same and give two definition viz : -lrb- 1 -rrb- recruiting by force -lrb- _ milites_cogere _ -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- pay soldier a sum of money and keep they ready to serve dr murray 's ` new english dictionary ' now in course of publication give instance of the confusion between imprest and impress a consequence of this confusion have be that many thousand of seaman who have receive a advance of money have be regard as carry off to the navy by force if to this misunderstanding we add the effect on the popular mind of cleverly write story in which the press-gang figure prominently we can easily see how the belief in a almost universal adoption of compulsory recruiting for the navy become general it should therefore be no matter of surprise when we find that the sensational report publish in the english newspaper in 1803 be accept without question impressment of seaman for the navy have be call ` lawless ' and sometimes it have be assert that it be directly contrary to law there be however no doubt that it be perfectly legal though its legality be not base upon any direct statutory authority indirect confirmation of it by statute be numerous these appear in the form of exemption the law of the land relate to this subject be that all ` sea-faring ' man be liable to impressment unless specially protect by custom or statute a consideration of the long list of exemption tend to make one believe that in reality very few people be liable to be impress some be ` protect ' by local custom some by statute and some by administrative order the number of the last must have be very great the ` protection book ' preserve in the public record office form no inconsiderable section of the admiralty record for the period specially under notice viz that begin with the year 1803 there be no less than five volume of ` protection ' exemption by custom probably originate at a very remote date : ferryman for example be everywhere privileged from impressment the crew of collier seem to have enjoy the privilege by custom before it be confirm by act of parliament the naval historian burchett writing of 1691 cite a ` proclamation forbid press man from collier ' every ship in the coal trade have the follow person protect viz two ab 's for every ship of 100 ton and one for every 50 ton in larger ship when we come to consider the sensational statement in _ the_naval_chronicle _ of 1803 it will be well to remember what the penalty for infringe the collier ' privilege be by the act 6 & 7 william iii c 18 sect 19 ` any officer who presume to impress any of the above shall forfeit to the master or owner of such vessel # 10 for every man so impressed and such officer shall be incapable of hold any place office or employment in any of he majesty 's ship of war ' it be not likely that the least scrupulous naval officer would make himself liable to professional ruin as well as to a heavy fine no parish apprentice could be impress for the sea service of the crown until he arrive at the age of eighteen -lrb- 2 & 3 anne c 6 sect 4 -rrb- person voluntarily bind themselves apprentice to sea service could not be impress for three year from the date of they indenture besides sect 15 of the act of anne just quote exemption be grant before 1803 by 4 anne c 19 and 13 george ii c 17 by the act last mention all person fifty-five year of age and under eighteen be exempt and every foreigner serve in a ship belong to a british subject and also all person ` of what age soever who shall use the sea ' for two year to be compute from the time of they first use it a customary exemption be extend to the proportion of the crew of any ship necessary for she safe navigation in practice this must have reduce the number liable to impressment to small dimension even when the admiralty decide to suspend all administrative exemption -- or as the phrase be ` to press from all protection ' -- many person be still exempt the customary and statutory exemption of course be unaffected on the 5th November 1803 they lordship inform officer in charge of rendezvous that it be ` necessary for the speedy manning of hm ship to impress all person of the denomination exprest in the press-warrant which you have receive from we without regard to any protection except however all such person as be protected pursuant to act of parliament and all other who by the print instruction which accompany the say warrant be forbid to be imprest ' in addition to these a long list of further exemption be send the last in the list include the crew of ` ship and vessel bind to foreign part which be laden and clear outwards by the proper officer of hm custom ' it would seem that there be next to no one leave liable to impressment and it be not astonishing that the admiralty as show by its action very shortly afterwards feel that press seaman be a poor way of man the fleet though the war which break out in 1803 be not formally declare until may active preparation be begin earlier the navy have be greatly reduce since the peace of amien and as late as the 2nd December 1802 the house of common have vote that ' 50000 seaman be employ for the service of the year 1803 include 12000 marine ' on the 14th march a additional number be vote it amount to 10000 man of whom 2400 be to be marine much larger addition be vote a few week later the total increase be 50000 man viz 39600 seaman and 10400 marine it never occur to anyone that forcible recruiting would be necessary in the case of the marine though the establishment of the corps be to be nearly double as it have to be bring up to 22400 from 12000 attention may be specially direct to this point the marine form a integral part of a man-of-war 's crew just as the seaman do he receive no better treatment than the latter and as regard pecuniary remuneration prospects of advancement and hope of attain to the position of warrant officer be on the whole in a less favourable position it seem to have be universally accept that voluntary enlistment would prove -- as in fact it do prove -- sufficient in the case of the marine what we have get to see be how far it fail in the case of the seaman and how far its deficiency be make up by compulsion on the 12th march the admiralty notify the board of ordnance that twenty-two ship of the line -- the name of which be state -- be ` come forward ' for sea many of these ship be mention in _ the_naval_chronicle _ as require man and that journal give the name of several other of various class in the same state the number altogether be thirty-one the aggregate complement include marine and boy of these ship amount to 17234 the number of ` seaman ' be 11861 though this include some of the officer who be bear on the same muster-list the total number of seaman actually require exceed 11500 the _ naval _ _ chronicle _ contain a vivid not to say sensational account of the step take to raise they the report from plymouth date 10th march be as follow : ` several body of royal marine in party of twelve and fourteen each with they officer and naval officer arm proceed towards the quay so secret be the order keep that they do not know the nature of the business on which they be go until they board the tier of collier at the new quay and other gang the ship in the catwater and the pool and the gin-shop a great number of prime seaman be take out and send on board the admiral 's ship they also press landsman of all description and the town look as if in a state of siege at stonehouse mutton cove morri town and in all the receive and gin-shop at dock -lrb- the present devonport -rrb- several hundred of seaman and landsman be pick up and send directly aboard the flag-ship by the return last night it appear that upward of 400 useful hand be press last night in the three town one press-gang enter the dock -lrb- devonport -rrb- theater and clear the whole gallery except the woman ' the reporter remark : ` it be say that near 600 man have be impress in this neighborhood ' the number -- if obtain -- would not have be sufficient to complete the seaman in the complement of a couple of line-of-battle ship naval officer who remember the method of man ship which last well into the middle of the nineteenth century and of course long after recourse to impressment have be give up will probably notice the remarkable fact that the reporter make no mention of any of the party whose proceedings he describe be engage in pick up man who have voluntarily join ship fitting out but have not return on board on the expiration of the leave grant they the description in _ the_naval_chronicle _ might be apply to event which -- when impressment have cease for half a century -- occur over and over again at portsmouth devonport and other port when two or three ship happen to be put in commission about the same time we shall find that the 600 report as impressed have to be considerably reduce before long the reporter afterwards wisely keep himself from give figure except in a single instance when he state that ` about forty ' be take out of the flotilla of plymouth trawler report on 11th march he say that ` last Thursday and yesterday ' -- the day of the sensational report above give -- ` several useful hand be pick up mostly seaman who be conceal in the different lodgings and be discover by they girl ' he add ` several prime seaman be yesterday take disguise as labourer in the different marble quarry round the town ' on 14th October the report be that ` the different press-gang with they officer literally scour the country on the eastern road and pick up several fine young fellow ' here again no distinction be draw between man really impressed and man who be arrest for be absent beyond the duration of they leave we be tell next that ` upon a survey of all impressed man before three captain and three surgeon of the royal navy such as be deem unfit for he majesty 's service as well as all apprentice be immediately discharge ' which no doubt greatly diminish the above-mentioned 600 the reporter at portsmouth begin he account of the ` press ' at that place by say ` they indiscriminately take every man on board the collier ' in view of what we know of the heavy penalty to which officer who press more than a certain proportion of a collier 's crew be liable we may take it that this statement be make in error on 14th march it be report that ` the constable and gang from the ship continue very alert in obtain seaman many of whom have be send on board different ship in the harbor this day ' we do not hear again from portsmouth till may on the 7th of which month it be report that ` about 700 man be obtain ' on the 8th the report be that ` on Saturday afternoon the gate of the town be shut and soldier place at every avenue tradesman be take from they shop and send on board the ship in the harbor or place in the guard-house for the night till they could be examine if fit for he majesty 's service they be keep if in trade set at liberty ' the ` tradesman ' then if really take be take simply to be set free again as far as the report first quote convey any trustworthy information it appear that at portsmouth and plymouth during march April and the first week of may 1340 man be ` pick up ' and that of these many be immediately discharge how many of the 1340 be not really impressed but be what in the navy be call ` straggler ' ie man over-stay they leave of absence be not indicate _ the_times _ of the 11th march 1803 and 9th may 1803 also contain report of the impressment operation it say : ` the return to the admiralty of the seaman impressed -lrb- apparently at the thame port -rrb- on Tuesday night amount to 1080 of whom no less than two-third be consider prime hand at portsmouth portsea gosport and cowe a general press take place the same night upward of 600 seaman be collect in consequence of the promptitude of the measure adopt ' it be add that the government ` rely upon increase we naval force with 10000 seaman either volunteer or impressed man in less than a fortnight ' the figure show we how small a proportion of the 10000 be even allege to be make up of impressed man a later _ time _ report be that : ` the impress on Saturday both above and below the bridge be the hottest that have be for some time the boat belong to the ship at deptford be particularly active and it be suppose they obtain upward of 200 man ' _ the _ _ time _ report thus account for 1280 man over and above the 1340 state to have be impress at plymouth and portsmouth thus make a grand total of 2620 it will be prove by official figure directly that the last number be a over-estimate before go farther attention may be call to one or two point in connection with the above report the increase in the number of seaman vote by parliament in march be 7600 the report of the impressment operation only come down to may it be not till the 11th June that parliament vote a further addition to the navy of 32000 seaman yet whilst the latter great increase be be obtain -- for obtain it be -- the reporter be virtually silent as to the action of the press-gang we must ask ourselves if we could get 32000 additional seaman with so little recourse to impressment that the operation call for no special notice how be it that compulsion be necessary when only 7600 man be want the question be all the more pertinent when we recall the state of affair in the early part of 1803 the navy have be greatly reduce in the year before the man vote have diminish from 100000 to 56000 what become of the 44000 man not require of whom about 35000 must have be of the seaman class and have be discharge from the service there be a further reduction of 6000 to take effect in the beginning of 1803 sir sydney smith at that time a member of parliament in the debate of the 2nd December 1802 ` express considerable regret at the great reduction which be suddenly make both in the king 's dockyard and in the navy in general a prodigious number of man ' he say ` have be thus reduce to the utmost poverty and distress ' he state that he ` know from he own experience that what be call a ordinary seaman could hardly find employment at present either in the king 's or in the merchant ' service ' the increase of the fleet in march must have seem a godsend to thousand of man-of-war 's man if there be any hold back on they part it be due no doubt to a expectation -- which the sequel show to be well found -- that a bounty would be give to man join the navy the muster-book of a man-of-war be the official list of she crew it contain the name of every officer and man in the complement primarily it be a account-book as it contain entry of the payment make to each person whose name appear in it at the beginning of the nineteenth century it be usual to make out a fresh muster-book every two month though that period be not always exactly adhere to each new book be a copy of the precede one with the addition of the name of person who have join the ship since the closing of the latter until the ship be pay off and thus put out of commission -- or in the case of a very long commission until ` new book ' be order to be open so as to escape the inconvenience due to the repetition of large number of entry -- the name of every man that have belong to she remain on the list he disposal -- if no longer in the ship -- be note in the proper column one column be head ` whence and whether prest or not ' in this be note he former ship or the fact of he be enter direct from the shore which answer to the question ` whence ' there be reason to believe that the muster-book be as above say primarily a account-book the word ` whether prest or not ' be originally place at the head of the column so that it might be note against each man enter whether he have be pay ` prest-money ' or not however this may be the column at the beginning of the nineteenth century be use for a record of the circumstance of the man 's enter the ship whether he have be transfer from another have join as a volunteer from the shore or have be impressed i have examine the muster-book of every ship mention in the admiralty letter to the board of ordnance above refer to and also of the ship mention in _ the_naval_chronicle _ as fitting out in the early part of 1803 there be altogether thirty-three ship but two of they the _ utrecht _ and the _ gelykheid _ be use as temporary receive ship for newly raise man -lrb- 61 -rrb- the name on they list be therefore merely those of man who be pass on to other ship in whose muster-book they appear again there remain thirty-one ship which as far as could be ascertain account for the additional force which the government have decide to put in commission more than two-third of they be ship of the line as already state they total complement amount to 17234 and the number of the ` blue-jacket ' of full age to at least 11500 the muster-book appear to have be keep with great care the only exception seem to be that of the _ victory _ in which there be some reason to think the number of man note as ` prest ' have be over-state owe to a error in copy the earlier book ship in 1803 do not get they full crew at once any more than they do half a century later i have therefore think it necessary to take the muster-book for the month in which the crew have be bring up to completion -lrb- footnote 61 : the word ` recruit ' and ` enlist ' except as regard marine be unknown in the navy in which they be replace by ` raise ' and ` enter ' -rrb- a examination of the book would be likely to dispel many misconception about the old navy not only be it note against each man 's name whether he be ` press ' or a volunteer it be also note if he be put on board ship as a alternative to imprisonment on shore this be indicate by the word ` civil power ' a expression still use in the navy but with a different mean the percentage of man thus ` raise ' be small sometimes there be a note state that the man have be allow to enter from the ' -- shire militia ' a rare note be ` bring on board by soldier ' which most likely indicate that the man have be recapture when attempt to desert it be sometimes assert that many man who volunteer do so only to escape impressment this may be so but it should be say that there be frequent notation against the name of ` prest ' man that they afterwards volunteer this show the care that be take to ascertain the real condition on which a man enter the service for the purpose of this inquiry all these man have be consider as impressed and they have not be count amongst the volunteer it be perhaps permissible to set off against such man the number of those who allow themselves to be impressed to escape inconvenience likely to be encounter if they remain at home of two john westlakes ordinary seaman of the _ boadicea _ one -- john -lrb- i -rrb- -- be ` prest ' but be afterwards ` take out of the ship for a debt of twenty pound ' which show that he have prefer to trust himself to the press-gang rather than to he creditor without be unduly imaginative we may suppose that in 1803 there be hero who prefer be ` carry off ' to defend they country afloat to meet the liability of putative paternity in they native village the muster-book examine cover several month during which many ` prest ' man be discharge and some manage to desert so that the total be never present at anyone time that total amount to 1782 it be certain that even this be larger than the reality because it have be find impossible -- without a excessive expenditure of time and labor -- to trace the case of man be send from one ship to another and thus appear twice over or oftener as ` prest ' man as a example of this the _ minotaur _ may be cite out of twenty name on one page of she muster-book thirteen be those of ` prest ' man discharge to other ship the discharge from the _ victory _ be numerous and the _ ardent _ which be employ in keep up communication with the ship off brest pass man on to the latter when require i have however make no deduction from the ` prest ' total to meet these case we can see that not more than 1782 man and probably considerably fewer be impressed to meet the increase of the navy during the greater part of 1803 admit that there be case of impressment from merchant vessel abroad to complete the crew of we man-of-war in distant water the total number impressed -- include these latter -- could not have exceed greatly the figure first give we know that owe to the reduction of 1802 as state by sir sydney smith the seaman be look for ship rather than the ship for seaman it seem justifiable to infer that the whole number of impressed man on any particular day do not exceed almost certainly do not amount to 2000 if they have be spread over the whole navy they would not have make 2 per cent of the unite complement of the ship and as it be do not equal one-nineteenth of the 39600 seaman -lrb- ` blue-jacket ' -rrb- raise to complete the navy to the establishment sanction by parliament a system under which more than 37000 volunteer come forward to serve and less than 2000 man be obtain by compulsion can not be properly call compulsory the plymouth reporter of _ the_naval_chronicle _ do not give many detail of the volunteer for the navy in 1803 though he allude to it in fluent term more than once on the 11th October however he report that ` so many volunteer seaman have arrive here this last week that upward of # 4000 bounty be to be pay they afloat by the pay commissioner rear-admiral dacre ' at the time the bounty be # 2 10 for a ab # 1 10s for a ordinary seaman and # 1 for a landsman take only # 4000 as the full amount pay and assume that the three class be equally represent three man be obtain for every # 5 or 2400 in all a number raise in about a week that may be compare with that give as result from impressment in reality the number of volunteer must have be larger because the ab 's be fewer than the other class some people may be astonish because the practice of impressment which have prove to be so utterly inefficient be not at once and formally give up no astonishment will be feel by those who be conversant with the habit of government department in every country public official evince great and indeed almost invincible reluctance to give up anything whether it be a material object or a administrative process which they have once possess or conduct one have only to stroll through the arsenal of the world or glance at the mooring-grounds of the maritime state to see to what a extent the passion for retain the obsolete and useless hold dominion over the official mind a thing may be know to be valueless -- its retention may be prove to be mischievous -- yet proposal to abandon it will be oppose and defeat it be doubtful if any male human be over forty be ever convert to a new faith of any kind the public have to wait until the generation of administrative conservative have either pass away or be outnumber by those acquaint only with newer method then the change be make the certainty nevertheless be that the new man in they turn will resist improvement as obstinately and in exactly the same way as they predecessor to be just to the board of admiralty of 1803 it must be admit that some of its member seem to have lose faith in the efficacy of impressment as a system of man the navy the lord commissioner of that date could hardly -- all of they at any rate -- have be so thoroughly destitute of humor as not to suspect that seize a few score of man here and a few there when ten of thousand be need be a very insufficient compensation for the large correspondence necessitate by adherence to the system -lrb- and still in existence -rrb- they lordship actively bombard the home office with letter point out for example that a number of british seaman at guernsey ` appear to have repair to that island with a view to avoid be press ' that they be ` of opinion that it would be highly proper that the sea-faring man -lrb- in jersey as well as guernsey -rrb- not native nor settled inhabitant should be impressed ' that when the captain of hm _ aigle _ have land at portland ` for the purpose of raise man ' some resistance have ` be make by the sailor ' and deal with other subject connect with the system a complaint send to the war department be that ` amongst a number of man lately impressed -lrb- at leith -rrb- there be eight or ten shipwright who be sea-faring man and have be claim as belong to a volunteer artillery corps ' we may suspect that there be some discussion at whitehall as to the wisdom of retain a plan which cause so much inconvenience and have such poor result the conclusion seem to have be to submit it to a search test the coast of the unite kingdom be stud with station -- thirty-seven generally but the number vary -- for the entry of seaman the ordinary official description of these -- as show by entry in the muster-book -- be ` rendezvous ' but other term be use it have often be think that they be simply impressment office the fact be that many more man be raise at these place by volunteer than by impressment the rendezvous as a rule be in charge of captain or commander some few be entrust to lieutenant the man attach to each be style its ` gang ' a word which convey no discredit in nautical language on 5th November 1803 the admiralty send to the officer in charge of rendezvous the communication already mention -- to press man ` without regard to any protection ' -- the exception indeed be so many that the officer must have wonder who could legitimately be take the order at first sight appear sweeping enough it contain the follow word : ` whereas we think fit that a general press from all protection as above mention shall commence at london and in the neighborhood thereof on the night of Monday next the 7th instant you be therefore -lrb- after take the proper preparatory measure with all possible secrecy -rrb- hereby require to impress and to give order to the lieutenant under you command to impress all person of the above-mentioned denomination -lrb- except as before except -rrb- and continue to do so until you receive order from we to the contrary ' as it be address to officer in all part of the unite kingdom the ` general press ' be not confine to london and its neighborhood though it be to begin in the capital though return of the number impress have not be discover we have strong evidence that this ` general press ' notwithstanding the secrecy with which it have be arrange be a failure on the 6th December 1803 just a month after it have be try the admiralty formulate the follow conclusion : ` on a consideration of the expense attend the service of raise man on shore for he majesty 's fleet comparatively with the number procure as well as from other circumstance there be reason to believe that either proper exertion have not be make by some of the officer employ on that service or that there have be great abuse and mismanagement in the expenditure of the public money ' this mean that it be now see that impressment though of little use in obtain man for the navy be a very costly arrangement the lord of the admiralty accordingly order that ` the several place of rendezvous should be visit and the conduct of the officer employ in carry out the above-mentioned service should be inquire into on the spot ' rear-admiral arthur phillip the celebrated first governor of new south wale be order to make the inquiry this be the last duty in which that distinguish officer be employ and he have be select for it appear to have be unknown to all he biographer it be not surprising that after this the proceedings of the press-gang occupy scarcely any space in we naval history such reference to they as there be will be find in the writings of the novelist and the dramatist probably individual case of impressment occur till nearly the end of the great war but they could not have be many compulsory service most unnecessarily cause -- not much but still some -- unjustifiable personal hardship it tend to stir up a feeling hostile to the navy it require to work it machinery costly out of all proportion to the result obtain indeed it fail completely to effect what have be expect of it in the great day of old we fleet after all be man not by impressed man but by volunteer it be largely due to that that we become master of the sea vi

advisability of subordinate rhetoric to veracity have the contemporary document be available for a immediate appeal to they by the read public we should long ago have rid ourselves of some dangerous superstition we should have abandon we belief in the fiction that the armada of 1588 be defeat by the weather and that the great herbert of torrington be a lubber a traitor and a coward it be not easy to calculate the benefit that we should have secure have the presentation of some important event in the history of we national defense be as accurate as it be effective enormous sum of money have be waste in try to make we defensive arrangement square with a conception of history base upon misunderstanding or misinterpretation of fact pecuniary extravagance be bad enough but there be a greater

should be say that only the first volume of three which will complete it have be publish it be however in the nature of a work of the kind that its separate part should be virtually independent of

singularly free from all taint of chauvinism that he expressly resolve that he work ` should never sink into a drum and trumpet history ' a few figure will be interesting and it may be add conclusive

therefore in addition to account of many project but never really attempt descent on the british isle give a very complete history of hoche 's expedition to ireland of the less important but curious descent in cardigan bay know as the fishguard or fishgard expedition and of the formation of the first ` army of england ' a designation destine to attain greater celebrity in the subsequent war when france be rule by the great soldier whom we know as the emperor napoleon the various document be connect by captain desbrière with a explanatory commentary and here and there be illustrated with note he have not rest content with the publication of mss select from the french archive in prepare he book he visit england and examine we record and besides he have insert in they proper place passage from captain mahan 's work and also from those of english author the reader 's interest in the book be likely to be almost exclusively concentrate on the detailed and where captain desbrière 's

the proceedings of hoche several of the many plan submit by private person who here describe they in they own word be worth examination and some it may be mention be amusing in the _ naïveté _ of they anglophobia and in they obvious indifference to the elementary principle of naval strategy in this indifference they have some distinguished companion we be inform by captain desbrière that the idea of a hostile descent on england be during a long time much favor in france the national archive and those of the ministry of war and of marine be fill with proposal for carry it out some date back to 1710 whether emanate from private person or formulate in obedience to official direction there be certain feature in all the proposal so marked that we be able to classify the various scheme by group together those of a similar character in one class may be place all those which aim at mere annoyance to be effect by landing small body of man not always soldier to do as much damage as possible the appearance of these at many different point it be believe would so harass the english that they would end the war or at least so divide they force that they subjection might be look for with confidence in another class might be place proposal to seize outlying out not distant british territory -- the channel island or the isle of wight for example a third class might comprise attempt on a greater scale necessitate the employment of a considerable body of troops and merit the designation ` invasion ' some of these attempt be to be make in great britain some in ireland in every proposal for a attempt of this class whether it be to be make in great britain or in ireland it be assume that the invader would receive assistance from the people of the country invade indeed generally the bulk of the force to be employ be ultimately to be compose of native sympathiser who be also to provide -- at least at the beginning -- all the supplies and transport both vehicle and animal require every plan no matter to which class it might belong be base upon the assumption that the british naval force could be avoid until we come to the time when general bonaparte as he then be dissociate himself from the first ` army of england ' there be no trace in any of the document now print of a belief in the necessity of obtain command of the sea before send across it a considerable military expedition that there be such a thing as the command of the sea be rarely allude to and when it be it be merely to accentuate the possibility of neutralise it by evade the force hold it there be something which almost deserve to be style comical in the absolutely unvarying confidence alike of amateur and highly place military officer with which it be hold that a superior naval force be a thing that might be disregard general who would have laugh to scorn anyone maintain that though there be a powerful prussian army on the road to one city and a austrian army on the road to the other a french army might force its way to either berlin or vienna without either fighting or even be prepare to fight such general never hesitate to approve expedition oblige to traverse a region in the occupation of a greatly superior force the region be pelagic and the force naval we have seize the little island of st marcoff a short distance from the coast of normandy and hold they for year it be expressly admit that they recapture be impossible ' à raison de la supériorité des force navale anglaise ' but it be not even suspect that a much more difficult operation require longer time and a longer voyage be likely to be impracticable we shall see by and by how far this remarkable attitude of mind be support by the experience of hoche 's expedition to ireland hoche himself be the inventor of a plan of harass the english enemy which long remain in favor he propose to organise what be call a _ chouannerie _ in england as that country have no _ chouan _ of she own the want be to be supply by send over a expedition compose of convict hoche 's idea be approve and adopt by the eminent carnot the plan to which the former devoted great attention be to land on the coast of wale from 1000 to 1200 _ forçats _ to be command by a certain mascheret of whom hoche write that he be ` le plus mauvais sujet dont on puisse purger la france ' in a plan accept and forward by hoche it be lay down that the band on reach the enemy 's country be if possible not to fight but to pillage each man be to understand that he be send to england to steal 100000f ` pour ensuite finir sa carrière tranquillement dan l'aisance ' and be to be inform that he would receive a formal pardon from the french government the plan extraordinary as it be be one of the few put into execution the famous fishguard invasion be carry out by some fourteen hundred convict command by a american adventurer name tate the direction to avoid fighting be exactly obey by colonel tate and the armed criminal under he order he land in cardigan bay from a small squadron of french man-of-war at sunset on the 22nd February 1797 and on the appearance of lord cawdor with the local yeomanry and militia ask to be allow to surrender on the 24th at a subsequent exchange of prisoner the french authority refuse to receive any of the worthy who have accompany tate at length 512 be allow to land but be imprison in the fort of cherbourg the french record contain many expression of the dread experience by the inhabitant of the coast lest the english should put on shore in france the malefactor whom they have capture at fishguard a more promising enterprise be that in which it be decide to obtain the assistance of the dutch at the time in possession of a considerable fleet the dutch fleet be to put to sea with the object of engage the english a army of 15000 be then to be embark in the port of holland and be to effect a diversion in favor of another and larger body which start from france be to land in ireland repeat the attempt of hoche in December 1796 which will be deal with later on the enterprise be frustrate by the action of admiral duncan who decisively defeat the dutch fleet off camperdown in October it might have be suppose that this would have drive home the lesson that no considerable military expedition across the water have any chance of success till the country send it have obtain command of the sea but it do not to bonaparte the event be full of mean but no other french soldier seem to have learn it -- if we may take captain desbrière 's view as representative -- even down to the present day on the 23rd February 1798 bonaparte write : ` opérer une descente en angleterre sans être maître de la mer est l'opération la plus hardie et la plus difficile qui ait été faite ' there have be much speculation as to the reason which induce bonaparte to quit the command of the ` army of england ' after hold it but a short time and after have devote great attention to its organization and propose method of transport across the channel the question be less difficult than it have appear to be to many one of the foremost man in france bonaparte be ready to take the lead in any undertaking which seem likely to have a satisfactory ending -- a end which would redound to the glory of the chief who conduct it the most important operation contemplate be the invasion of england and -- now that hoche be no more -- bonaparte might well claim to lead it he penetrate insight soon enable he to see its impracticability until the french have win the command of the channel of that there be not much likelihood and at the first favourable moment he dissociate himself from all connection with a enterprise which offer so little promise of a successful termination that it be all but certain not to be begin a essential condition as already point out of all the project invasion be the receipt of assistance from sympathiser in the enemy 's country hoche himself expect this even in tate 's case but experience prove the expectation to be baseless when the prisoner take with tate be be conduct to they place of confinement the difficulty be to protect they ` car la population furieuse contre les français voulait les lyncher ' captain desbrière dwell at some length on the mutiny in the british fleet in 1797 and ask regretfully ` qu'avait - on fait pour profiter de cette chance unique ' he remark on the undoubted and really lamentable fact that english historian have usually pay insufficient attention to these occurrence one and perhaps the principal reason of they silence be the difficulty at all event till quite lately of get material with which to compose a narrative the result be that the real character of the great mutiny have be altogether misunderstand lord camperdown 's recently publish life of he great ancestor lord duncan have do something to put they in they right light as regard defense against the enemy the mutiny affect the security of the country very little the seaman always express they determination to do they duty if the enemy put to sea even at the nore they conspicuously display they general loyalty and as a matter of fact discipline have regain its sway some time before the expedition prepare in holland be ready how effectively the crew of the ship not long before involve in the mutiny could fight be prove at camperdown though earlier in date than the event just discuss the celebrated first expedition to ireland have be intentionally leave out of consideration till now as to the general feature of the undertaking and even some of its more important detail the document now publish add little to we knowledge the literature of the expedition be large and captain chevalier have give we a admirable account of it in he ` histoire de la marine française sous la première république ' the late vice-admiral colomb submit it to a most instructive examination in the _ journal_of_the _ _ royal_united_service_institution _ for January 1892 we can however learn something from captain desbrière 's collection the perusal suggest or indeed compel the conclusion that the expedition be doom to failure from the start it have no money store or means of transport there be no hope of find these in a country like the south-western corner of ireland grouchy 's decision not to land the troops who have reach bantry bay be no doubt dictate in reality by a perception of this and by the discovery that even if he get on shore sympathiser with he would be practically non-existent on read the letter now make public one be convince of hoche 's unfitness for the leadership of such a enterprise the adoration of mediocrity be confine to no one cult and to no one age hoche 's canonisation for he be a prominent saint in the republican calendar be due not so much to what he do as to what he do not do he do not hold the supreme command in la vendée till the most try period of the war be past he do not continue the cruelty of the jacobin emissary in the disturbed district but then he pacificatory measure be take when the spirit of ferocity which cause the horror of the _ noyade _ and of the terror have even amongst the mob of pari burnt itself out he do not overthrow a constitutional government and enslave he country as bonaparte do and therefore he be favourably compare with the latter whose opportunity he do not have he letter show he to have be a adept in the art of traduce colleague behind they back in write he call admiral villaret-joyeuse ` perfide ' and speak of he ` mauvaise foi ' he have a low opinion of general humbert whom he bracket with mascheret grouchy he say be ` un inconséquent paperassier ' and general vaillant ` un misérable ivrogne ' he be place in supreme command of the naval as well as of the military force and be allow to select the commander of the former yet he and he nominee be amongst the small fraction of the expeditionary body which never reach a place where disembarkation be possible notwithstanding all this the greater part of the fleet and of the troops convey by it do anchor in bantry bay without encounter a english man-of-war and a large proportion continue in the bay unmolested by we navy for more than a fortnight be not this it may be ask a sufficient refutation of those who hold that command of the sea give security against invasion as a matter of fact command of the sea -- even in the case in question -- do prevent invasion from be undertake still more from be carry through on a scale likely to be very formidable the total number of troops embark be under 14000 of whom 633 be lose owe to step take to avoid the hostile navy before the expedition have get fully under way it be not necessary to rate hoche 's capacity very highly in order to understand that he who have see something of war on a grand scale would not have commit himself to the command of so small a body without cavalry without means of transport on land without supplies with but a insignificant artillery and that not furnish with horse and as be avow without hope of subsequent reinforcement or of open communication with its base -- that he would not have stake he reputation on the fate of a body so conditioned if he have be permit by the naval condition of the case to lead a larger more effectually organise and better supply army the commentary supply by captain desbrière to the volume under notice disclose he opinion that the failure of the expedition to ireland be due to the inefficiency of the french navy he endeavor to be scrupulously fair to he naval fellow-countryman but he conviction be apparent it hardly admit of doubt that this view have generally be and still be prevalent in the french army foreign soldier of talent and experience generalise from this as follow : let they but have the direction of the naval as well as of the military part of a expedition and the invasion of england must be successful the complete direction which they would like be exactly what hoche do have he choose the commander of the fleet and also choose or regulate the choice of the junior flag officer and several of the captain admiral morard de galle be not and do not consider himself equal to the task for which hoche 's favor have select he he letter point out he own disqualification have a striking resemblance to the one write by medina sidonia in deprecation of he appointment in place of santa cruz nevertheless the french naval officer do succeed in convey the greater part of the expeditionary army to a point at which disembarkation be practicable now we have some lesson to learn from this the advantage confer by command of the sea must be utilise intelligently and it be bad management which permit a important anchorage to remain for more than a fortnight in the hand of a invade force we need not impute to we neighbor a burning desire to invade we but it be a become exercise of ordinary strategic precaution to contemplate preparation for repel what as a mere military problem they consider still feasible no amount of naval superiority will ever ensure every part of we coast against incursion like that of tate and he gaol-bird naval superiority however will put in we hand the power of prevent the arrival of a army strong enough to carry out a real invasion the strength of such a army will largely depend upon the amount of mobile land force of which we can dispose consequently defense against invasion even of a island be the duty of a land army as well as of a fleet the more important part may in we case be that of the latter but the service of the former can not be dispense with the best method of utilise those service call for much thought in 1798 when the ` first army of england ' menace we from the southern coast of the channel it be report to we government that a examination of the plan formerly adopt for frustrate intended invasion show the advantage of trouble the enemy in he own home and not wait till he have come to injure we in ours vii over-sea raid and raid on land -lrb- 64 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 64 : write in 1906 -lrb- _ the_morning_post _ -rrb- -rrb- it have be contend that raid by ` armament with 1000 20000 and 50000 man on board respectively ' have succeed in evade ` we watch and chase fleet ' and that consequently invasion of the british isle on a great scale be not only possible but fairly practicable british naval predominance notwithstanding i dispute the accuracy of the history involve in the allusion to the above-stated figure the number of man comprise in a raiding or invade expedition be the number that be or can be put on shore the crew of the transport be not include in it in the case allude to humbert 's expedition be to have number 82 officer and 1017 other rank and 984 be put on shore in killalum bay though the round number 1000 represent this figure fairly enough there be a 10 per cent shrinkage from the original embarkation strength in hoche 's expedition the total number of troops embark be under 14000 of whom 633 be lose before the expedition have get clear of its port of start and of the remainder only a portion reach ireland general bonaparte land in egypt not 50000 man but about 36000 in the expedition of hoche and humbert it be not expect that the force to be land would suffice of itself the belief be that it would be join in each case by a large body of adherent in the raid country outside the rank of the ` extremist of the dinghy school ' -- whose number be unknown and be almost certainly quite insignificant -- no one assert or ever have assert that raid in moderate strength be not possible even in the face of a strong defend navy it be a fact that the whole of we defense policy for many generation have be base upon a admission of they possibility captain mahan 's statement of the case have never be question by anyone of importance it be as follow : ` the control of the sea however real do not imply that a enemy 's single ship or small squadron can not steal out of port can not cross more or less frequented tract of ocean make harass descent upon unprotected point of a long coast-line enter blockade harbor ' it be extraordinary that everyone do not perceive that if this be not true the ` dinghy school ' would be right student of clausewitz may be expect to remember that the art of war do not consist in make raid that be unsuccessful that war be wage to gain certain great object and that the course of hostility between two powerful antagonist be affect little one way or the other by raid even on a considerable scale the egyptian expedition of 1798 deserve fuller treatment than it have generally receive the preparation at toulon and some italian port be know to the british government it be impossible for even a moltke or -- comparative resource be take into account -- the greater strategist kodama to know everything in the mind of a opponent the sensible proceeding be to guard against he do what would be likely to do you most harm the british government have reason to believe that the toulon expedition be intend to reinforce at a atlantic port another expedition to be direct against the british isle or to effect a landing in spain with a view to march into portugal and deprive we navy of the use of lisbon either if effect would probably cause we serious mischief and arrangement be make to prevent they a landing in egypt be as the event show of little importance the threat convey by it against we indian possession prove to be a empty one upward of 30000 hostile troops be lock up in a country from which they could exercise no influence on the general course of the war and in which in the end they have to capitulate suppose that a expedition cross the north sea with the object of invade this country have to content itself with a landing in iceland have eventual capitulation before it should we not consider ourselves very fortunate though it may have temporarily occupy one of the shetland isle _ en_route _ the truth of the matter be that the egyptian expedition be one of the gravest of strategical mistake and but for the marvellous subsequent achievement of napoleon it would have be the typical example of bad strategy adduce by lecturer and writer on the art of war for the warning of student the supposition that over-sea raid even when successful in part in any way demonstrate the inefficiency of naval defense would never be admit if only land and sea warfare be regard as branch of one whole and not as quite distinct thing to be consistent those that admit the supposition should also admit that the practicability of raid demonstrate still more conclusively the insufficiency of defense by a army a eminent military writer have tell we that ' a raiding party of 1000 french land in ireland without opposition after sixteen day of navigation unobserved by the british navy defeat and drive back the british troops oppose they on four separate occasion entirely occupy the attention of all the available troops of a garrison of ireland 100000 strong penetrate almost to the center of the island and compel the lord-lieutenant to send a urgent requisition for as great a reinforcement as possible ' if a inference be to be draw from this in the same way as one have be draw from the circumstance on the sea it would follow that one hundred thousand troops be not sufficient to prevent a raid by one thousand and consequently that one million troops would not be sufficient to prevent one by ten thousand enemy on this there would arise the question if a army a million strong give no security against a raid by ten thousand man be a army worth have and this question be it note would come not from disciple of the blue water school ` extremist ' or other but from student of military narrative the truth be that raid be far more common on land than on the ocean for every one of the latter it would be possible to adduce several of the former indeed account of raid be amongst the common-place of military history there be few campaign since the time of that smart cavalry leader mago the younger brother of hannibal in which raid on land do not occur or in which they exercise any decisive influence on the issue of hostility it be only the failure to see the connection between warfare on land and naval warfare that prevent these land raid be give the same significance and importance that be usually give to those carry out across the sea in the year 1809 the year of wagram napoleon 's military influence in central germany be to say the least not at its lowest yet colonel schill of the prussian cavalry with 1200 man subsequently increase to 2000 infantry and 12 squadron proceed to wittenberg thence to magdeburg and next to stralsund which he occupy and where he meet he death in oppose a assault make by 6000 french troops he have defy for a month all the effort of a large army to suppress he in the same year the duke of brunswick-oel and colonel dornberg notwithstanding the smallness of the force under they by they action positively induce napoleon only a few week before wagram to detach the whole corps of kellerman 30000 strong which otherwise would have be call up to the support of the grande armée to the region in which these enterprising raider be operate the mileage cover by schill be nearly as great as that cover by the part of hoche 's expedition which under grouchy do reach a irish port though it be not land instance of cavalry raid be frequent in the war of secession in america the federal colonel b h grierson of the 6th illinoi cavalry with another illinoi and a iowa cavalry regiment in April 1863 make a raid which last sixteen day and in which he cover 600 mile of hostile country finally reach baton rouge where a friendly force be station the confederate officer john h morgan john s mosby and especially n b forrest be famous for the extent and daring of they raid of all the leader of important raid in the war of secession none surpass the great confederate cavalry general j e b stuart whose ride right round the impose federal army be well know yet not one of the raid above mention have any effect on the main course of the war in which they occur or on the result of the great conflict in the last war the case be the same in January 1905 general mischenko with 10000 sabre and three battery of artillery march right round the flank of marshal oyama 's great japanese army and occupy niu-chwang -- not the treaty port so-called but a place not very far from it for several day he be unmolested and in about a week he get back to he friend with a loss which be moderate in proportion to he number in the follow may mischenko make another raid this time round general nogus 's flank he have with he fifty squadron a horse artillery battery and a battery of machine gun start on the 17th he be discover on the 18th come in contact with he enemy on the 19th but meet with no considerable hostile force till the 20th when the japanese cavalry arrive just in time to collide with the russian rearguard of two squadron on this general mischenko ` retire at he ease for some thirty mile along the japanese flank and perhaps fifteen mile away from it ' these russian ' raid do not alter the course of the war nor bring ultimate victory to they standard it would be consider by every military authority as a flagrant absurdity to deduce from the history of these many raid on land that a strong army be not a sufficient defense for a continental country against invasion what other efficient defense against that can a continental country have apply the reasoning to the case of a insular country and reliance on naval defense will be abundantly justified to maintain that canada indium and egypt respectively could be invade by the united state russium and turkey back by germany notwithstanding any action that we navy could take would be equivalent to maintain that one part of we empire can not or need not reinforce another suppose that we have a military force numerically equal to or exceed the russian how could any of it be send to defend canada indium and egypt or to reinforce the defender of those country unless we sea communication be keep open can these be keep open except by the action of we navy it be plain that they can not viii queen elizabeth and she seaman -lrb- 65 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 65 : write in 1900 -lrb- _ nineteenth_century_and_after _ 1901 -rrb- -rrb- a eminent writer have recently repeat the accusation make within the last forty year and apparently only within that period against queen elizabeth of have starve the seaman of she fleet by give they food insufficient in quantity and bad in quality and of have rob they by keep they out of the pay due to they he also accuse the queen though somewhat less plainly of have deliberately acquiesce in a wholesale slaughter of she seaman by remain still though no adequate provision have be make for the care of the sick and wound there be further charge of obstinately object out of mere stinginess to take proper measure for the naval defense of the country and of withhold a sufficient supply of ammunition from she ship when about to meet the enemy lest it should be suppose that this be a exaggerated statement of the case against elizabeth as formulate by the writer in question he own word be give he say : ` instead of strengthen she armament to the utmost and throw herself upon she parliament for aid she cling to she moneybags actually reduce she fleet withhold ammunition and the more necessary store cut off the sailor 's food do in short everything in she power to expose the country defenceless to the enemy the pursuit of the armada be stop by the failure of the ammunition which apparently have the fighting continue longer would have be fatal to the english fleet ' the writer make on this the rather mild comment that ` treason itself could scarcely have do worse ' why ` scarcely ' surely the very blackest treason could not have do worse he go on to ask : ` how be the glorious seaman whose memory will be for ever honor by england and the world reward after they victory ' this be he answer : ` they wages be leave unpaid they be dock of they food and serve with poisonous drink while for the sick and wound no hospital be provide more of they be kill by the queen 's meanness than by the enemy ' it be safe to challenge the student of history throughout the world to produce any parallel to conduct so infamous as that which have thus be imputed to a english queen if the charge be true there be no limit to the horror and loathing with which we ought to regard elizabeth be they true that be the question i respectfully invite the attention of those who wish to know the truth and to retain they reverence for a great historical character to the follow examination of the accusation and of the foundation on which they rest it will not i hope be consider presumptuous if i say that -- in make this examination -- personal experience of life in the navy sufficiently extensive to embrace both the present day and the time before the introduction of the great modern change in system and naval _ matériel _ will be of great help many thing which have appear so extraordinary to landsmen that they could account for they occurrence only by assume that this must have be due to extreme culpability or extreme folly will be quite familiar to naval officer whose experience of the service go back forty year or more and can be satisfactorily explain by they there be little reason to doubt that the above-mentioned charge against the great queen be base exclusively on statement in froude 's history it be remarkable how closely froude have be follow by writer treat of elizabeth and she reign he be know to have go to original document for the source of he narrative and it seem to have be take for grant not only that he fidelity be above suspicion -- a assumption with which i do not deal now -- but also that he interpretation of the meaning of those who write the papers consult must be correct motley in he ` history of the unite netherland ' publish in 1860 have dwell upon the shortness of ammunition and provision in the channel fleet command by lord howard of effingham but he attribute this to bad management on the part of official and not to downright baseness on that of elizabeth froude have place beyond doubt he determination to make the queen responsible for all shortcoming ` the queen ' he say ` have take upon herself the detailed arrangement of everything she and she alone be responsible she have extend to the dockyard the same hard thrift with which she have pare down she expense everywhere she tie the ship to harbor by supply the store in driblet she allow ration but for a month and permit no reserve to be provide in the victual office the ship at plymouth furnish from a distance and with small quantity at a time be often for many day without food of any kind even at plymouth short food and poisonous drink have bring dysentery among they they have to meet the enemy as it be with one arm bandage by they own sovereign the greatest service ever do by a english fleet have be thus successfully accomplish by man whose wages have not be pay from the time of they engagement half-starved with they clothes in rag and so ill-found in the necessaries of war that they have eke out they ammunition by what they could take in action from the enemy himself the man expect that at least after such a service they would be pay they wages in full the queen be cavil over the account and would give no order for money till she have demand the meaning of every penny that she be charge they legitimate food have be steal from they by the queen 's own neglect ' we thus see that froude have make elizabeth personally responsible for the short ration the undue delay in pay wages earn and the fearful sickness which produce a heavy mortality amongst the crew of she channel fleet and also for insufficiently supply she ship with ammunition the quotation from the book previously refer to make it clear that it be possible to outdo froude in he denunciation even where it be on he statement that the accuser find they charge in he ` history of england ' -- which be widely read especially by the younger generation of englishman -- the rev j franck bright tell we with regard to the defensive campaign against the armada : ` the queen 's avarice go near to ruin the country the miserable supplies which elizabeth have alone allow to be send they -lrb- the ship in the channel -rrb- have produce all sort of disease and thousand of the crew come from they great victory only to die in the midst of privation and want in all the necessaries of life the sailor have fight with unflagging energy with they wages unpaid with ammunition supply to they with so stingy a hand that each shot send on board be register and account for with provision withhold so that the food of four man have habitually to be divide among six and that food so bad as to be really poisonous ' j r green in he ` history of the english people ' state that : ` while england be thrill with the triumph over the armada its queen be coolly grumble over the cost and make she profit out of the spoil provision she have order for the fleet that have save she ' the object of each subsequent historian be to surpass the originator of the calumny against elizabeth in he sketch of she life in the ` dictionary of national biography ' dr augustus jessopp assert that the queen 's ship ` be notoriously and scandalously ill-furnished with store and provision for the sailor and it be impossible to lay the blame on anyone but the queen ' he have previously remark that the merchant vessel which come to the assistance of the men-of-war from london and the smaller port ` be as a rule far better furnished than the queen 's ship ' which be ` without the barest necessaries ' after these extract one from dr s r gardiner 's ` student 's history of england ' will appear moderate here it be : ` elizabeth have with she usual economy keep the ship short of powder they be force to come back ' from the chase of the armada the above allegation constitute a heavy indictment of the queen no heavier could well be bring against any sovereign or government probably the first thing that occur to anyone who know what elizabeth 's position be read the tremendous charge make against she will be that -- if they be true -- she must have be without a rival in stupidity as well as in turpitude there be no person in the world who have as much cause to desire the defeat of the armada as she have if the duke of medina sidonia 's expedition have be successful she would have lose both she throne and she life she herself and she father have show that there could be a short way with queen -- consort or regnant -- whom you have in you power and whose existence might be inconvenient to you yet if we be to believe she accuser she do she best to ensure she own dethronement and decapitation ` the country save itself and its cause in spite of its queen ' how do this extraordinary view of elizabeth 's conduct arise what have froude to go upon when he come forward as she accuser these question can be answer with ease every government that come near go to war or that have go to war be sure to incur one of two charge make accord to circumstance if the government prepare for war and yet peace be preserve it be accuse of unpardonable extravagance in make preparation whether it make these on a sufficient scale or not it be accuse if war do break out -- at least in the earlier period of the contest -- of not have do enough political opponent and the ` man in the street ' agree in charge the administration with panic profusion in one case and with criminal niggardliness in the other elizabeth hope to preserve peace she have succeed in keep out of a ` official ' war for a long time and she have much justification for the belief that she could do so still longer ` she could not be thoroughly persuade ' say mr david hannay -lrb- 66 -rrb- ` that it be hopeless to expect to avert the spanish invasion by artful diplomacy ' whilst reasonable precaution be not neglect she be determine that no one should be able to say with truth that she have needlessly throw away money in a fright for the general naval policy of england at the time elizabeth as both the nominal and the real head of the government be properly hold responsible the event show the perfect efficiency of that policy -lrb- footnote 66 : _ a_short_history_of_the_royal_navy _ pp 96 97 -rrb- the war have really come it be inevitable that the government and elizabeth as its head should be blame sooner or later for not have make adequate provision for it no one be better entitle to speak on the naval policy of the armada epoch than mr julian corbett -lrb- 67 -rrb- who be not dispose to assume that the queen 's action be above criticism he say that ` elizabeth have usually be regard as guilty of complete and unpardonable inaction ' he explain that ` the event at least justified the queen 's policy there be no trace of she have be blame for it at the time at home nor be there any reason to doubt it be adopt sagaciously and deliberately on the advice of she most capable officer ' mr david hannay who as a historian rightly take into consideration the condition of the age point out that ` elizabeth be a very poor sovereign and the maintenance of a great fleet be a heavy drain upon she resource ' he add : ` there be no reason to suppose that elizabeth and she lord treasurer be careless of they duty but the government of the time have very little experience in the maintenance of great military force ' -lrb- footnote 67 : _ drake_and_the_tudor_navy _ 1898 vol ii p 117 -rrb- if we take the charge against she in detail we shall find that each be as ill-founded as that of criminal neglect of naval preparation generally the most serious accusation be that with regard to the victuals it will most likely be a surprise to many people to find that the seaman of elizabeth be victual on a more abundant and much more costly scale than the seaman of victorium nevertheless such be the fact in 1565 the contract allowance for victual be 4-1\/2 d a day for each man in harbor and 5d a day at sea there be also a allowance of 4d a man per month at sea and 8d in harbor for ` purser 's necessaries ' mr oppenheim in whose valuable work -lrb- 68 -rrb- on naval administration the detail as to the elizabethan victualling system be to be find tell we that in 1586 the rate be raise to 6d a day in harbor and 6-1\/2 d at sea and that in 1587 it be again raise this time to 6-1\/2 d in harbor and 7d at sea these sum be intend to cover both the cost of the food and storage custody conveyance & c the present-day ` establishment charge ' the repeat raising of the money allowance be convince proof that the victual arrangement have not be neglect and that there be no refusal to sanction increase expenditure to improve they it be a great thing to have mr oppenheim 's high authority for this because he be not generally favourable to the queen though even he admit that it ` be a moot point ' how far she be herself responsible -lrb- footnote 68 : _ the_administration_of_the_royal_navy _ _ 1509-1660 _ london 1896 -rrb- if necessary detailed argument could be adduce to show that to get the present value of the sum allow in 1588 we ought to multiply they by six -lrb- 69 -rrb- the sum allow for each man 's daily food and the ` establishment charge ' -- increase as they have be in 1586 -- do little more than cover the expenditure and though it do not appear that the contractor lose money he nevertheless die a poor man it will be hardly imputed to elizabeth for iniquity that she do not consider that the end of government be the enrichment of contractor the fact that she increase the money payment again in 1587 may be accept as proof that she do not object to a fair bargain as have be just say the elizabethan scale of victual be more abundant than the early victorian and not less abundant than that give in the earlier year of king edward vii -lrb- 70 -rrb- as show by mr hubert hall and thorold roger in the price-list which they publish the cost of a week 's allowance of food for a man-of-war 's man in 1588 in the money of the time amount to about 1 11-1\/2 d which multiply by six would be about 11s 9d of we present money the so-called ` savings price ' of the early twentieth century allowance be about 9-1\/2 d a day or 5 6-1\/2 d weekly the ` savings price ' be the amount of money which a man receive if he do not take up he victuals each article have a price attach to it for that purpose it may be interesting to know that the full allowance be rarely perhaps never take up and that some part of the savings be till the last and for many year have be almost invariably pay -lrb- footnote 69 : see mr hubert hall 's _ society_in_the_elizabethan _ _ age _ and thorold roger 's _ history_of_agriculture_and_prices _ vol v and vi froude himself put the ratio at six to one -rrb- -lrb- footnote 70 : it will be convenient

elizabeth 's day in that day but little sugar be use and tea and cocoa be unknown even in palace it be just a question if seven gallon of beer do not make up for the weekly allowance of these and for the seven-eighths of a pint of spirit tea be only allow in 1850 and be not a additional article it replace part of the spirit the biscuit allowance be now 8-3\/4 lb weekly the victorian dietary be more varied and wholesome than the elizabethan but as we have see it be less abundant and can be obtain for much less money even if we grant that the ` savings price ' -- purposely keep low to avoid all suggestion that the man be be bribe into stint themselves -- be less than the real cost the excess of this latter however be not likely to be more than 30 per cent so that elizabeth 's expenditure in this department be more liberal than the present such defect as be to be find in the elizabethan naval dietary be common to it with that of the english people generally if there be plenty there be but little variety in the food of we ancestor of all rank three century ago as far as be possible in the condition of the time elizabeth 's government do make provision for victual the fleet on a sufficient and even liberal scale and notwithstanding slender pecuniary resource repeatedly increase the money assign to it on cause be show in he eagerness to make queen elizabeth a monster of treacherous rapacity froude have completely overreach himself he say that ` she permit some miserable scoundrel to lay a plan before she for save expense by cut down the seaman 's diet ' the ` miserable scoundrel ' have submit a proposal for diminish the expense which the administration be certainly ill able to bear the candid reader will draw he own conclusion when he find that the queen do not approve the plan submit and yet that not one of she assailant have let this appear -lrb- 71 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 71 : it may be state here that the word ` ration ' be unknown in the navy the official term be ` victuals ' the term in common use be ` provision ' -rrb- it be of course possible to concede that adequate arrangement have be make for the general victualling of the fleet and still to maintain that after all the sailor afloat actually do run short of food in he striking ` introduction to the armada despatch ' publish by the navy record society professor sir john laughton declare that : ` to anyone examine the evidence there can be no question as to victual be conduct on a fairly liberal scale as far as the money be concern it be in provide the victuals that the difficulty lay when a fleet of unprecedented magnitude be collect when a sudden and unwonted demand be make on the victualling officer it would have be strange indeed if thing have go quite smoothly ' there be plenty of naval officer who have have experience and within the last ten year of the nineteenth century of the difficulty and sometimes of the impossibility of get sufficient supplies for a large number of ship in rather out-of-the-way place in 1588 the comparative thinness of population and insufficiency of communication and means of transport must have constitute obstacle far greater than any encounter in we own day to the collection of supplies locally and to they timely importation from a distance ` you would not believe ' say lord howard of effingham himself ` what a wonderful thing it be to victual such a army as this be in such a narrow corner of the earth where a man would think that neither victuals be to be have nor a cask to put it in ' no more effective defense of elizabeth and she minister could well be advance than that which mr oppenheim put forward as a corroboration of the accusation against they he say that the victualling official ` find no difficulty in arrange for 13000 man in 1596 and 9200 in 1597 after timely notice ' this be really a high compliment as it prove that the authority be quite ready to and in fact do learn from experience mr oppenheim however be not a undiscriminating assailant of the queen for he remark as have be already say that ` how far elizabeth be herself answerable be a moot point ' he tell we that there ` be no direct evidence against she ' and the charge level at she rest not on proof but on ` strong probability ' one would like to have another instance out of all history of probability however strong be deem sufficient to convict a person of unsurpassed treachery and stupidity combine when the direct evidence which be not scanty fail to support the charge and indeed point the other way the lord admiral himself and other officer have be quote to show how badly off the fleet be for food yet at the close of the active operation against the armada sir j hawkin write : ` here be victual sufficient and i know not why any should be provide after September but for those which my lord doth mean to leave in the narrow sea ' on the same day howard himself write from dover : ' i have cause all the remains of victuals to be lay here and at sandwich for the maintain of they that shall remain in the narrow sea ' any naval officer with experience of command who read howard 's representation on the subject of the victuals will at once perceive that what the admiral be anxious about be not the quantity on board the ship but the stock in reserve howard think that the latter ought to be a supply for six week the council think a month 's stock would be enough and -- as show by the extract from howard 's and hawkin 's letter just give -- the council be right in its estimate anyone who have have to write or to read official letter about stock of store and provision will find something especially modern in howard 's representation though the crew of the fleet do certainly come near the end of they victuals afloat there be no case of they have actually run out of they the complement of a ordinary man-of-war in the latter part of the sixteenth century judge by we modern standard be very large in proportion to she size it be impossible for she to carry provision enough to last she man for a long time any unexpected prolongation of a cruise threaten a reduction to short common a great deal have be make of the fact that howard have to oblige six man to put up with the allowance of four ` when a large force ' say mr d hannay ` be collect for service during any length of time it be the common rule to divide four man 's allowance among six ' there must be still many officer and man to whom the plan would seem quite familiar it be indicate by a recognize form of word ` six upon four ' i have myself be ` six upon four ' several time mostly in the pacific but also on at least one occasion in the east indy as far as i could see no one appear to regard it as a intolerable hardship the government it should be know make no profit out of the process because money be substitute for the food not issue howard 's recourse to it be not due to immediate insufficiency speaking of the merchant vessel which come to reinforce he he say : ` we be fain to help they with victuals to bring they thither there be not any of they that have one day 's victuals ' these merchant vessel be supply by private owner and it be worth note that in the tooth of this statement by howard dr jessopp in he eagerness to blacken elizabeth say that they ` be as a rule far better furnished than the queen 's ship ' the lord admiral on another occasion before the fight off graveline say of the ship he hope would join he from portsmouth : ` though they have not two day ' victuals let that not be the cause of they stay for they shall have victuals out of we fleet ' a conclusive proof that he ship be not very short as to the accusation of deliberately issue food of bad quality that be effectually dispose of by the explanation already give of the method employ in victual the navy a sum be pay for each man 's daily allowance to a contractor who be expressly bind to furnish ` good and seasonable victuals ' -lrb- 72 -rrb- professor laughton whose competence in the matter be universally allow inform we that complaint of bad provision be by no means confine to the armada epoch and be due not to intentional dishonesty and neglect but to insufficient knowledge of the way to preserve provision for use on rather long cruise mr hannay say that the fleet send to the coast of spain in the year after the defeat of the armada suffer much from want of food and sickness ` yet it be organise not by the queen but by a committee of adventurer who have every motive to fit it out well ' it be the fashion with english historian to paint the condition of the navy in the time of the commonwealth in glowing color yet mr oppenheim cite many occasion of well-founded complaint of the victuals he say : ` the quality of the food supply to the man and the honesty of the victualling agent both steadily deteriorate during the commonwealth ' lord howard 's principal difficulty be with the beer which would go sour the beer be the most frequent subject of protest in the commonwealth time also in 1759 lord -lrb- then sir edward -rrb- hawke report : ` we daily employment be condemn the beer from plymouth ' the difficulty of brewing beer that would stand a sea voyage seem to be insuperable the authority however do not soon abandon attempt to get the right article complaint continue to pour in but they go on with they brewing till 1835 and then give it up as hopeless -lrb- footnote 72 : see ` the mariner of england before the armada ' by mr h halliday sparling in the _ english_illustrated_magazine _ July 1 1891 -rrb- one must have have personal experience of the change to enable one to recognize the advance that have be make in the art of preserve article of food within the last half-century in the first drury lane pantomime that i can remember -- about a year before i go to sea -- a practical illustration of the quality of some of the food supply to the navy be offer during the harlequinade by the clown who satisfy he curiosity as to the contents of a large tin of ` preserved meat ' by pull out a dead cat on join the service i soon learn that owe to the badness of the ` preserved ' food that have be supply the idea of issue tinned meat have be abandon it be not resume till some year later it be often make a joke against naval officer of a certain age that before eat a biscuit they have a trick of rap the table with it we contract the habit as midshipman when it be necessary to get rid of the weevil in the biscuit before it could be eat and a fairly long experience teach we that rap the table with it be a effectual plan for expel they there be no more justification for accuse queen elizabeth of failure to provide well-preserved food to she sailor than there be for accuse she of not have send supplies to plymouth by railway steam transport and efficient food preservation be equally unknown in she reign and for long after it have be intimate above that even have she wish to she could not possibly have make any money out of bad provision the victualling system do not permit of she do so the austere republican virtue of the commonwealth authority enable they to do what be out of elizabeth 's power in 1653 ` beer and other provision decay and unfit for use be license for export free of custom ' mr oppenheim who report this fact make the remarkable comment that this be do ` perhaps in the hope that such store would go to holland ' with whose people we be at war as the heavy mortality in the navy have always be ascribe to the use of bad provision we can not refuse to give to the sturdy republican who govern england in the seventeenth century the credit of contemplate a more insidious and more effective method of damage they enemy than poisoning he well one would like to have it from some jurist if the sale of poisonously bad food to you enemy be disallow by international law that there be much sickness in the fleet and that many seaman die be unfortunately true if howard 's evidence be to be accept -- as it always be when it seem to tell against the queen -- it be impossible to attribute this to the bad quality of the food then supply the lord admiral 's official report be ` that the ship of themselves be so infectious and corrupt as it be think to be a very plague and we find that the fresh man that we draw into we ship be infected one day and die the next ' the least restrained assertor of the ` poisonous ' food theory do not contend that it kill man within twenty-four hour the armada reach the channel on the 20th of July -lrb- 30th new style -rrb- a month earlier howard have report that ` several man have fall sick and by thousand fain to be discharge ' and after the fighting be over he say of the _ elizabeth_jonas _ she ` have have a great infection in she from the beginning ' lord henry seymor who command the division of the fleet station in the strait of dover note that the sickness be a repetition of that of the year before and attribute it not to bad food but to the weather ` we man ' he write ` fall sick by reason of the cold night and cold morning we find and i fear I they will drop away faster than they do last year with sir henry palmer which be thick enough ' ` the sickness ' say professor laughton ` be primarily and chiefly due to infection from the shore and ignorance or neglect of what we now know as sanitary law similar infection continue occasionally to scourge we ship ' company and still more frequently french and spanish ship ' company till near the close of the eighteenth century ' it be not likely that any evidence would suffice to divert from they object writer eager to hurl calumny at a great sovereign but a little knowledge of naval and of military history also would have save they reader from a belief in they accusation in 1727 the fleet in the west indy command by admiral hosier commemorate in glover 's ballad lose ten flag officer and captain fifty lieutenant and 4000 seaman in the seven year ' war the total number belong to the fleet kill in action be 1512 whilst the number that die of disease and

landing 500 have still about 2000 man sick at the beginning of autumn the number of sick have become so great that many ship have not enough man to work they the _ ville_de_paris _ have 560 sick and lose 61 the _ auguste _ have 500 sick and lose 44 on board the _ intrépide _ 70 die out of 529 sick these be the worst case but other ship also suffer heavily it be perhaps not generally remembered

disorder show itself amongst hm troops and that on the 8th of September the number of sick amount to upward of 10948 man that of the army which embark for service in the scheldt sixty officer and 3900

one of two alternative we must either maintain that sanitary science make no advance between 1588 and 1855 or admit that the mortality in elizabeth 's fleet become what it be owe to ignorance of sanitary law and not to intentional bad management as regard care of the sick it be to be remember that the establishment of naval and military hospital for the reception of sick soldier and sailor be of recent date for instance the two great english military hospital netley and the herbert be only about sixty year old -lrb- footnote 73 : philadelphium 1864 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 74 : london 1899 -rrb- so far from we fleet in 1588 have be ill-supplied with ammunition it be in reality astonishingly well equip consider the age we learn from mr julian corbett -lrb- 75 -rrb- that ` during the few year immediately precede the outbreak of the war the queen 's navy have be entirely re-arm with brass gun and in the process of re-armament a great advance in simplicity have be secure ' froude

nineteenth century the regulate allowance for gun mount on the broadside be eighty-five round each consequently the elizabethan allowance be nearly if not quite as much as that which we authority after a experience of naval warfare during three century think sufficient ` the full explanation ' say professor laughton ` of the want -lrb- of ammunition -rrb- seem to lie in the rapidity of fire

for ' will be receive with ridicule by naval officer of course every shot and for the matter of that every other article expend have to be account for one of the most important duty of the gunner of a man-of-war be to keep a strict account of the expenditure of all gunnery store this be more exactly do under queen victorium than it be under queen elizabeth naval officer be more hostile to ` red tape ' than most man and they may lament the vast amount of bookkeeping that modern auditor and committee of public account insist upon but they be convince that a reasonable check on expenditure of store be indispensable to efficient organization so far from blame elizabeth for demand this they believe that both she and burleigh she lord treasurer be very much in advance of they age another charge against she be that she defraud she seaman of they wages the following be froude 's statement : -- ` want of the relief which if they have be pay they wages they might have provide for themselves have aggravate the tendency to disease and a frightful mortality now set in through the entire fleet ' the word ` now ' be interesting froude have have before he howard 's and seymor 's letter already quote show that the appearance of the sickness be by no means recent elizabeth 's illiberality towards she seaman may be judge from the fact that in she reign they pay be certainly increase once and perhaps twice -lrb- 78 -rrb- in 1585 the sailor 's pay be raise from 6s 8d to 10s a month a rise of pay of 50 per cent all at once be i venture to say entirely without parallel in the navy since and can not well be call illiberal the elizabethan 10 would be equal to # 3 in we present account and as the naval month at the earlier date be the lunar a sailor 's yearly wages would be equal to # 39 now the year 's pay of a ab ` non-continuous service ' as elizabeth 's sailor be be at the present time # 24 6 8d it be true that the sailor now can receive additional pay for good-conduct badge gunnery-train & c and also can look forward to that immense boon -- a pension -- nearly but thanks to sir j hawkin and drake 's establishment of the ` chatham chest ' not quite unknown in the sixteenth century compare with the rate of wages rule on shore elizabeth 's seaman be pay highly mr hubert hall state that for labourer ` the usual rate be 2d or 3d a day ' ploughman

give for 1588 the wages without board of carpenter and mason at 10d and 1s a day a plumber 's wages vary from 10-1\/2 d to 1 but there be one case of a plumber receive as much as 1 4d which be probably for a single day -lrb- footnote 78 : mr halliday sparling in the article already refer to -lrb- p 651 -rrb- say twice but mr oppenheim seem to think that the first increase be before elizabeth 's accession -rrb- delay in the payment of wages be not peculiar to the elizabethan system it last very much longer down to we own time in fact in 1588 the seaman of the fleet be keep without they pay for several month in the great majority of case and most likely in all the number of these month be less than six even within the nineteenth century man-of-war 's man have to wait for they pay for year commander c n robinson in he ` british fleet ' -lrb- 79 -rrb- a book that ought to be in every englishman 's library remark : ` all through the seventeenth and eighteenth century it be the rule not to pay anybody until the end of the commission and to a certain degree the practice obtain until some fifty year ago ' as to the nineteenth century lord dundonald speaking in parliament may be quote he say that of the ship on the east indy station the _ centurion 's _ man have be unpaid for eleven year the _ rattlesnake 's _ for fourteen the _ fox 's _ for fifteen the elizabethan practice compare with this will look almost precipitate instead of dilatory to draw again on my personal experience i may say that i have be keep without pay for a longer time than most of the people in lord howard 's fleet as for the first two year that i be at sea young officer be pay only once in six month and then never in cash but always in bill the reader may be leave to imagine what happen when a naval cadet try to get a bill for some # 7 or # 8 cash at a small spanish-american port -lrb- footnote 79 : london 1894 -rrb- a great deal have be make of the strict audit of the account of howard 's fleet the queen say froude ` would give no order for money till she have demand the meaning of every penny that she be charge ' why she alone should be hold up to obloquy for this be not clear until a very recent period well within the last reign no commanding officer on a ship be pay off could receive the residue of he pay or get any half-pay at all until he ` account have be pass ' -lrb- 80 -rrb- the same rule apply to officer in charge of money or store it have be make a further charge against elizabeth that she officer have to meet certain expenditure out of they own pocket that certainly be not a peculiarity of the sixteenth-century navy till less than fifty year ago the captain of a british man-of-war have to provide one of the three chronometer use in the navigation of he ship even later than that the article necessary for clean the ship and everything require for decorate she be pay for by the officer almost invariably by the first lieutenant or second in command there must be many officer still serve who have spend sum considerable in the aggregate of they own money on public object though pressure in this respect have be much relieved of late there be doubtless many who do so still it be in fact a traditional practice in the british navy and be not in the least distinctly elizabethan -lrb- footnote 80 : this happen to I in 1904 -rrb- some acquaintance with present condition and accurate knowledge of the naval method prevail in the great queen 's reign -- a knowledge which the publication of the original document put within the reach of anyone who really care to know the truth -- will convince the candid inquirer that elizabeth 's administration of the navy compare favourably with that of any of she successor and that for it she deserve the admiration and unalloyed gratitude of the nation ix -lrb- 81 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 81 : write in 1905 -lrb- _ cornhill_magazine _ -rrb- -rrb- nelson : the centenary of trafalgar -lrb- the follow article be read as a address in compliance with the request of its council at the annual meeting of the navy record society in July 1905 it be and indeed be still my opinion as state to the meeting in some prefatory remark that the address would have come better from a profess historian several member of the society be well know as entitle to that designation the council however consider that as nelson 's tactical principle and achievement should be deal with it would be better for the address to be deliver by a naval officer -- one moreover who have personal experience of the maneuver of fleet under sail space would not suffice for treat of nelson 's merit as a strategist though they be as great as those which he possess as a tactician -rrb- centenary commemoration be common enough but the commemoration of nelson have a characteristic which distinguish it from most if not from all other in these day we forget soon what place be still keep in we memory by even the most illustrious of those who have but recently leave we it be not only that we do not remember they wish and injunction they existence have almost fade from we recollection it be not difficult to persuade people to commemorate a depart worthy but in most case industry have to take the place of enthusiasm and moribund or extinct remembrance have to be galvanise by assiduity into a semblance of life in the case of nelson the condition be very different he may have be misunderstand even by he professional descendant he act and doctrine may have be misinterpret but he have never be forget the time have now come when we can specially do honor to nelson 's memory without wound the feeling of other nation there be no need to exult over or even to expatiate on the defeat of other in recall the past it be more dignified as regard ourselves and more considerate of the honor of we great admiral to think of the valor and self-devotion rather than the misfortune of those against whom he fight we can do full justice to nelson 's memory without reopen old wound the first thing to be note concern he be that he be the only man who have ever live who by universal consent be without a peer this be say in full view of the new constellation rise above the eastern horizon for that constellation brilliant as it be have not yet reach the meridian in every walk of life except that which nelson choose as he own you will find several competitor for the first place each one of whom will have many supporter alexander of macedon hannibal cæsar marlborough frederick the great and napoleon have be severally put forward for the palm of generalship to those who would acclaim richelieu as the first of statesman other would oppose chatham or william pitt or cavor or bismarck or marquis ito who be the first of sculptor who the first of painter who the first of poet in every case there be a great difference of opinion ask however who be the first of admiral and the unanimous reply will still be -- ` nelson ' try as he be by many year of high command in war it be not only amongst he fellow-countryman that he preeminence be acknowledged foreigner admit it as readily as we proclaim it ourselves we may consider what it be that give nelson this unique position among man the early condition of he naval career be certainly not favourable to he it be true that he be promote when young but so be many other officer nelson be make a commander only a few month after the outbreak of war between great britain and france and be make a post-captain within a few day of the declaration of war by spain a officer hold a rank qualify he for command at the outset of a great war might well have look forward confidently to exceptional opportunity of distinguish himself even in we own day when some trifling campaign be about to be carry on the officer who be employ where they can take no part in it vehemently lament they ill-fortune how much more disheartening must it have be to be exclude from active participation in a great and long-continued conflict this be nelson 's case as far as he hope of gain distinction be concerned fate seem to persecute he pertinaciously he be a captain of more than four year ' seniority when the treaty of versaille put a end to the war of american independence yet with the exception of the brief nicaragua expedition -- which by the side of the important occurrence of grand naval campaign must have seem insignificant -- he service during all those year of hostility be uneventful and even humdrum he seem to miss every important operation and when the war end -- we may almost say -- he have never see a ship fire a broadside in anger there then come what promise to be and in fact turn out to be a long period of peace with no distinguished war service to point to and with the prospect before he of only uneventful employment or no employment afloat at all nelson might well have be dishearten to the verge of despondency that he be not dishearten but instead thereof make a name for himself in such unfavourable circumstance must be accept as one of the most convincing proof of he rare force of character to have attract the notice and to have secure the confidence of so great a sea-officer as lord hood constitute a distinction which could have be win only by merit so considerable that it could not long remain unrecognised the war of american independence have still seven month to run when lord hood point to nelson as a officer to be consult on ` question relative to naval tactic ' professor laughton tell we that at that time nelson have never serve with a fleet lord hood be one of the last man in the world to go out of he way to pay to a youthful subordinate a empty compliment and we may confidently base we estimate of a officer 's merit on lord hood 's belief in they he no doubt give a wide signification to the term ` tactic ' and use it as embrace all that be include in the phrase ` conduct of war ' he must have find out from conversation with and from the remark of the young captain whom he treat as intimately as if he be he son that the latter be already what he continue to be till the end viz a student of naval warfare this point deserve particular attention the officer of the navy of the present day period of peace though it be can imitate nelson at least in this he have to wait a long time before he could translate into brilliant action the result of he tactical study fourteen year after lord hood speak of he as above relate by a ` spontaneous and sudden act for which he have no authority by signal or otherwise except he own judgment and quick perception ' nelson entirely defeat the movement of the enemy 's fleet contribute to the winning of a great victory and as captain mahan tell we 'em erge from merely personal distinction to national renown ' the justification of dwelling on this be to be find in the necessity even at this day of prevent the repetition of mistake concern nelson 's quality and disposition he recent biographer captain mahan and professor laughton feel constrain to tell we over and over again that nelson 's predominant characteristic be not mere ` headlong valor and instinct for fight ' that he be not the man ` to run needless and useless risk ' in battle ` the breadth and acuteness of nelson 's intellect ' say mahan ` have be too much overlook in the admiration excite by he unusually grand moral endowment of resolution dash and fearlessness of responsibility ' in form a true conception of what nelson be the publication of the navy record society will help we greatly there be something very remarkable in the way in which mr gutteridge 's volume -lrb- 82 -rrb- not only confirm captain mahan 's refutation of the aspersion on nelson 's honor and humanity but also establish professor laughton 's conclusion reach many year ago that it be the order give to he and not he amour which detain he at naple at a well-known epoch the last volume issue by the society that of mr julian corbett -lrb- 83 -rrb- be i venture to affirm the most useful to naval officer that have yet appear among the society 's publication it will provide they with a admirable historical introduction to the study of tactic and greatly help they in ascertain the importance of nelson 's achievement as a tactician for my own part i may say with gratitude that but for mr corbett 's valuable work i could not have complete this appreciation -lrb- footnote 82 : _ nelson_and_the_neapolitan_jacobins _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 83 : _ fighting_instructions _ 1530-1816 -rrb- the most renowned of nelson 's achievement be that perform in he final battle and victory strange as it may seem that celebrated performance have be the subject of much controversy and brilliant as it be the tactic adopt in it have be freely and indeed unfavourably criticise there be still much difference of opinion as to the preliminary movement and as to the exact method by which nelson 's attack be make it have be often assert that the method really follow be not that which nelson have expressly declare he intention of adopt the question raise concern this be a difficult one and until the appearance of mr julian corbett 's recent work and the interesting volume on trafalgar lately publish by mr h newbolt have not be fully discuss the late vice-admiral p h colomb contribute to the _ united_service_magazine _ of September 1899 a very striking article on the subject of nelson 's tactic in he last battle and those who propose to study the case should certainly peruse what he write the criticism of nelson 's procedure at trafalgar in its strongest form may be summarise as follow it be affirm that he draw up and communicate to the officer under he order a certain plan of attack that just before the battle he change he plan without warn that he hurry on he attack unnecessarily that he expose he fleet to excessive peril and because of all this that the british loss be much heavier and much less evenly distribute among the ship of the fleet than it need have be the most formidable arraignment of the mode of nelson 's last attack be undoubtedly to be find in the paper publish by sir charle ekin in he book on ` naval battle ' and vouch for by he as the work of a eye-witness -- almost certainly as mr julian corbett hold a officer on board the _ conqueror _ in the battle it be a remarkable document be critical rather than instructive it be not to be class with the essay of clerk of eldin but it be one of the most important contribution to the investigation of tactical question ever publish in the english tongue on it be base nearly or quite all the unfavourable view express concern the british tactic at trafalgar as it contain a respectfully state but still sharp criticism of nelson 's action it will not be think presumptuous if we criticise it in its turn notwithstanding the fact that the author of the paper actually take part in the battle and that he be gifted with no mean tactical insight it be permissible to say that he remark have a academic tinge in fact they be very much of the kind that a clever professor of tactic who have not feel the responsibility inseparable from the command of a fleet would put before a class of student between a professor of tactic however clever and a commanding genius like nelson the difference be great indeed the writer of the paper in question perhaps express the more general opinion of he day he have certainly suggest opinion to later generation of naval officer the captain who share in nelson 's last great victory do not agree among themselves as to the mode in which the attack be introduce it be believe by some of they and thanks largely to the _ conqueror _ officer 's paper it be generally believe now that whereas nelson have announce he intention of advance to the attack in lines-abreast or lines-of-bearing he really do so in lines-ahead follow up the path of investigation to which in he article above mention admiral colomb have already point we can i think arrive only at the conclusion that the announce intention be adhere to before the reason for this conclusion be give it will be convenient to deal with the suggestion or allegation that nelson expose he fleet at trafalgar to unduly heavy loss put it in the power of the enemy -- to use the word of the _ conqueror 's _ officer -- to ` have annihilate the ship one after another in detail ' and that ` the brunt of the action would have be more equally feel ' have a different mode of advance from that actually choose be adopt now trafalgar be a battle in which a inferior fleet of twenty-six ship gain a victory over a superior fleet of thirty-three the victory be so decisive that more than half of the enemy 's capital ship be capture or destroy on the spot and the remainder be so batter that some fall a easy prey to the victor 's side soon after the battle the rest have limp painfully to the shelter of a fortified port near at hand to gain such a victory over a superior force of seaman justly celebrate for they spirit and gallantry very hard fighting be necessary the only action of the napoleonic period that can be compare with it be those of camperdown the nile and copenhagen the proportionate loss at trafalgar be the least in all the four battle -lrb- 84 -rrb- the allegation that have nelson follow a different method at trafalgar the ` brunt of the action would have be more equally feel ' can be dispose of easily in nearly all sea-fight whether nelsonic in character or not half of the loss of the victor have fall on considerably less than half the fleet that this have be the rule whatever tactical method may have be adopt will appear from the follow statement in rodney 's victory -lrb- 12th April 1782 -rrb- half the loss fall upon nine ship out of thirty-six or one-fourth at ` the first of June ' it fall upon five ship out of twenty-five or one-fifth at st vincent it fall upon three ship out of fifteen also one-fifth at trafalgar half the loss fall on five ship out of twenty-seven or very little less than a exact fifth it have therefore be conclusively show that faulty or not faulty long-announced or hastily adopt the plan on which the battle of trafalgar be fight do not occasion excessive loss to the victor or confine the loss such as it be to a unduly small portion of they fleet as bear on this question of the relative severity of the british loss at trafalgar it may be remark that in that battle there be several british ship which have be in other great sea-fight they loss in these latter be in nearly every case heavier than they trafalgar loss -lrb- 85 -rrb- authoritative and undisputed figure show how baseless be the suggestion that nelson 's tactical procedure at trafalgar cause he fleet to suffer needlessly heavy loss -lrb- footnote 84 : camperdown 825 loss out of 8221 : 10 per cent the nile 896 7401 : 121 copenhagen 941 6892 : 1375 _

hastily and without warn change he plan for fight the battle this investigation be much more difficult than that into the loss of the british fleet because whilst the latter can be settle by arithmetic the former must proceed largely upon conjecture how desirable it be to make the investigation of the statement mention will be manifest when we reflect on the curious fact that the very completeness of nelson 's success at trafalgar check or indeed virtually destroy the study of tactic in the british navy for more than three-quarter of a century he action be so misunderstand or at any rate so variously represent that it generally pass for gospel in we service that nelson 's method consist merely in rush at he enemy as soon as he see he against this conception he biographer one after another have protest in vain at the outset of this investigation it will be well to call to mind two or three thing simple enough but not always remember one of these be that advance to the attack and the attack itself be not the same operation another be that in the order of sailing in two or more column if the ship be ` by the wind ' or close-hauled -- the column-leader be not abeam of each other but bear from one another in the direction of the wind also it may be mention that by simple alteration of course a line-abreast may be convert into a line-of-bearing and a line-of-bearing into a line-ahead and that the reverse can be effect by the same operation again adherence to a plan which presuppose the enemy 's fleet to be in a particular formation after he be find to be in another be not to be expect of a consummate tactician this remark be introduce here with full knowledge of the probability that it will be quote as a admission that nelson do change he plan without warn no admission of the kind be intend ` in all case of anticipated battle ' say mahan ` nelson be careful to put he subordinate in possession both of he general plan and as far as possible of the underlie idea ' the same biographer tell we what be well worth remember that ` no man be ever better serve than nelson by the inspiration of the moment no man ever count on it less ' the plan announce in the celebrated memorandum of 9th October 1805 indicate for the attack from to windward that the british fleet in what would be call on shore a echelon of two main division and a ` advance squadron ' would move against a enemy assume to be in single line-ahead the ` advance squadron ' it should be note be not to be ahead of the two main division but in such a position that it could be move to strengthen either the name seem to have be due to the mode in which the ship compose the squadron be employ in so to speak ` feeling for ' the enemy on 19th October six ship be order ` to go ahead during the night ' and besides the frigate two more ship be so station as to keep up the communication between the six and the commander-in-chief 's flag-ship thus eight ship in effect compose a ` advance squadron ' and do not join either of the main division at first when it be expect that the british fleet would comprise forty sail-of-the-line and the enemy 's fleet forty-six each british main division be to be make up of sixteen ship and eight two-decker add to either division would increase the strength of the latter to twenty-four ship it be interesting to note that omit the _ africa _ which ship come up late each british main division on the morning of 21st October 1805 have nine ship -- a number which by the addition of the eight already mention as distinct from the division could have be increase to seventeen thus except for a fraction exactly maintain the original proportion as regard the hostile fleet which be now find to be compose of thirty-three ship during the night of 20th-21st October the franco-spanish fleet which have be sail in three division and a ` squadron of observation ' form line and stand to the southward head a little to the eastward of south the ` squadron of observation ' be parallel to the main body and to windward -lrb- in this case to the westward -rrb- of it with the lead ship rather more advance the british main division steer wsw till 1 be after that they steer sw till 4 be there be great difficulty about the time as the notation of it -lrb- 86 -rrb- differ considerably in different ship but the above hour be take from the _ victory 's _ log at 4 be the british fleet or rather its main division wear and stand n by e as the wind be about nw by w the ship be close-hauled and the leader of the ` lee-line ' ie collingwood 's flag-ship be when in station two point abaft the _ victory 's _ beam as soon as the ` order of sailing ' in two column -- which be to be the order of battle -- have be form -lrb- footnote 86 :

observe bearing from collingwood 's flag-ship -lrb- 87 -rrb- view from the british ship place as they be relatively to it the enemy 's fleet must have appear as a long single line-ahead perhaps not very exactly form as soon as the hostile force be clearly make out the british division bear up and stand to the eastward steer by the _ victory 's _ compass ene the position and formation of the british main division be by this make exactly those in which they be show in the diagram usually attach to the celebrated memorandum of 9th October 1805 the enemy must have appear to the british who be ten or twelve mile to windward of he and on he beam as if he be form in line-ahead he therefore be also in the position and formation assign to he in that diagram -lrb- footnote 87 : it would necessitate the use of some technicality to explain it fully but it may be say that the bearing of the extreme of the enemy 's line observe from he flag-ship prove that collingwood be in the station that he ought to have occupy when the british fleet be in the order of sailing and close to the wind -rrb- at a time which because of the variety in the notation of it it be difficult to fix exactly but somewhere between 7 and 8 be the enemy 's ship wear together and endeavor to form a line to the northward which owe to the direction of the wind must have be about n by e and s by w or nne and ssw the operation -- not merely of wear but of both wear and reform the line such as it be -- take more than a hour to complete the wind be light there be a westerly swell the ship be under easy sail consequently there must have be a good deal of leeway and the hostile or ` combine ' fleet head in the direction of cadiz towards which we be expressly tell by a high french authority -- chevalier -- it advance nelson have to direct the course of he fleet so that its division when about to make the actual attack would be just opposite the point to which the respective hostile ship have advance in the meantime in a light wind vary in force a direct course to those point could not be settle once for all but that first choose be very nearly right and a alteration of a point viz to e by n be for a considerable time all that be necessary collingwood later make a signal to he division to alter course one point to port which bring they back to the earlier course which by the _ victory 's _ compass have be ene the eight ship of what have be refer to as the ` advance squadron ' be distribute between the two main british division six be assign to collingwood 's and two to nelson 's they do not all join they division at the same time some -- probably owe to the distance at which they have be employ from the rest of the fleet and the feebleness of the breeze -- not till several hour after the combined fleet have be sight collingwood preserve in he division a line-of-bearing apparently until the very moment when the individual ship push on to make the actual attack the enemy 's fleet be usually represent as form a curve it would probably be more correct to call it a very obtuse re-enter angle this must have be largely due to gravina 's ` squadron of observation ' keep away in succession to get into the wake of the rest of the line which be form towards the north about the center of the combined fleet there be a gap of a mile ahead and astern of this the ship be not all in each other 's wake many be to leeward of they station thus give the enemy 's formation the appearance of a double line or rather of a string of group of ship it be important to remember this because no possible mode of attack -- the enemy 's fleet be form as it be -- could have prevent some british ship from be ` double on ' when they cut into the enemy 's force on ` the first of June ' notwithstanding that the advance to the attack be intend to be in line-abreast several british ship be ` double on ' and even ` treble on ' as will be see in the experience on that day of the _ brunswick _ _ marlborough _ _ royal_sovereign _ and _ queen_charlotte _ herself owe to the shape of the hostile ` line ' at trafalgar and the formation in which he keep he division collingwood bring he ship up till the very moment when each proceed to deliver she attack in the formation lay down in the oft-quoted memorandum by the term of that document nelson have specifically assign to he own division the work of see that the movement of collingwood 's division should be interrupt as little as possible it would of course have be beyond he power to do this if the position of he own division in the echelon formation prescribe in the memorandum have be rigorously adhere to after collingwood be get near he objective point in execution therefore of the service allot to he division nelson make a feint at the enemy 's van this necessitate a alteration of course to port so that he ship come into a ` line-of-bearing ' so very oblique that it may well have be loosely call a ` line-ahead ' sir charle ekin say that the two british line ' _ afterwards _ fall into line-ahead the ship in the wake of each other ' and that this be in obedience to signal collingwood 's line certainly do not fall into line-ahead at the most it be a rather oblique line-of-bearing almost parallel to that part of the enemy 's fleet which he be about to attack in nelson 's line there be more than one alteration of course as the _ victory 's _ log expressly state that she keep stand for the enemy 's van which we learn from the french account be move about n by e or nne in the light wind prevail the alteration of course must have render it towards the end of the forenoon impossible to keep exact station even if the _ victory _ be to shorten sail which we know she do not as admiral colomb point out ` several later signal be record which be proper to make in lines-of-bearing but not in lines-ahead ' it be difficult to import into this fact any other meaning but that of intention to preserve however obliquely the line-of-bearing which undoubtedly have be form by the act of bearing-up as soon as the enemy 's fleet have be distinguish when collingwood have move near enough to the enemy to let he ship deliver they attack it become unnecessary for nelson 's division to provide against the other 's be interrupted accordingly he head for the point at which he mean to cut into the enemy 's fleet now come the moment as regard he division for do what collingwood 's have already begin to do viz engage in a ` pell-mell battle ' -lrb- 88 -rrb- which surely may be interpret as mean a battle in which rigorous station-keeping be no longer expect and in which ` no captain could do very wrong if he place he ship alongside that of the enemy ' -lrb- footnote 88 : nelson 's own expression -rrb- in several diagram of the battle as suppose to have be fight the two british division just before the moment of impact be represent as converge towards each other the spanish diagram lately reproduce by mr newbolt show this as well as the english diagram we may take it therefore that there be towards the end of the forenoon a convergence of the two column and that this be due to nelson 's return from he feint at the hostile van to the line from which he intend to let go he ship to deliver the actual attack collingwood 's small alteration of course of one point to port slightly but only slightly accentuate this convergence enough have be say here of nelson 's tactic at trafalgar to discuss they fully would lead I too far for this occasion i can only express the hope that in the navy the subject will receive fuller consideration hereafter nelson 's last victory be gain be it remember in one afternoon over a fleet more than 20 per cent he superior in number and be so decisive that more than half of the hostile ship be take this be the crowning effort of seven year spend in virtually independent command in time of war -- seven year too illustrate by more than one great victory the more closely we look into nelson 's tactical achievement the more effective and brilliant do they appear it be the same with he character and disposition the more exact research and investigation of recent time have remove from he name the obloquy which it please some to cast upon it we can see now that he ` childlike delighted vanity ' -- to use the phrase of he greatest biographer -- be but a thin incrustation on noble quality as in the material world valueless earthy substance surround a vein of precious metal so through nelson 's moral nature there run a opulent lode of character unimpaired in its priceless worth by adjacent frailty which in the majority of mankind be present without any precious stuff beneath they it be with mind prepare to see this that we should commemorate we great admiral veneration of nelson 's memory can not be confine to particular object or be limit by locality he tomb be wider than the space cover by dome or column and he real monument be more durable than any material construction it be the unwritten and spiritual memorial of he firmly fix in the heart of he fellow-countryman x the share of the fleet in the defense of the empire -lrb- 89 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 89 : write in 1907 -lrb- _ naval_annual _ 1908 -rrb- -rrb- at the close of the great war which end in the downfall of napoleon the maritime position of the british empire be not only predominant -- it also be and long remain beyond the reach of challenge after the stupendous event of the great contest such success as those at algier where we be help by the dutch at navarino where we have two ally and at acre be regard as matter of course and no very grave issue hang upon any one of they for more than half a century after nelson 's death all the most brilliant achievement of british arm be perform on shore in indium or in the crimea there be also many small war on land and it may well have seem to contemporary that the day of great naval contest be over and that force of circumstance be convert we into a military from a naval nation the belief in the efficacy of naval defense be not extinct but it have cease to operate actively even whilst the necessity of that form of defense be far more urgent inattention to or ignorance of its true principle have occasionally allow it to grow weak but the possibility of substitute something else for it have not be press or even suggest to this however we have now come and it be largely a consequence of the crimean war in that war the british army have nobly sustain its reputation as a fight machine for the first time after a long interval it have meet in battle european troops and have come out of the conflict more renowned for bravery than ever nothing seem able to damp its heroism -- not scantiness of food not lack of clothing amidst bitter cold not miserable quarter not superior force of a valiant enemy it cling to its squalid abode in the position which it be order to hold with a tenacious fortitude that have never be surpass in its glorious history and that defy all assault in combination with its brave ally it bring to a triumphant conclusion a war of a altogether peculiar character the campaign in the crimea be in reality the siege of a single fortress all the movement of the western invader be undertake to bring they within striking distance of the place to keep they within reach of it or to capture it every battle that occur be fight with one of those object when the place fall the war end the one general who in the opinion of all concerned gain high distinction in the war be the general who have prolong the defense of sebastopol by the skilful use of earthwork it be no wonder that the attack and defense of fortify place assume large importance in the eye of the british people the command of the sea hold by the ally power be so complete and all-pervading that no one stop to think what the course of hostility would have be without it any more than man stop to think what the course of any particular business would be if there be no atmosphere to breathe in not a single ally soldier have be delay on passage by the hostile fleet not a single merchant vessel belong to the ally have be capture by a hostile cruiser supplies and reinforcement for the besiege army be transport to they without escort and with as little risk of interruption as if the operation have be those of profound peace no sooner be the crimean war over than another struggle take place viz the war of the indian mutiny and that also be wage entirely on land here again the command of the sea be so complete that no interruption of it even temporary call attention to its existence troops and supplies be send to india from the unite kingdom and from hong-kong horse for military purpose from australium and south africa and in every case without a thought of naval escort the experience of hostility in indium seem to confirm the experience of the crimea what we have just do to a great european nation be assume to be what unfriendly european nation would wish to do and would be able to do to we it be also assume that the only way of frustrate they design would be to do what have recently be do in the hope of frustrating ours but to do it better we must -- it be say -- depend on fortification but more perfect than those which have fail to save sebastopol the protection to be afford by we fleet be deliberately declare to be insufficient it might so it be hold be absent altogether and then there would be nothing but fortification to stand between we and the progress of a active enemy in the result the policy of construct impose passive defence-works on we coast be adopt the fortification have to be multiply dependence on that class of defense inevitably lead to discovery after discovery that some spot open to the kind of attack fear have not be make secure we begin by fortify the great dockyard port -- on the sea side against a hostile fleet on the land side against hostile troops then it be perceive that to fortify the dockyard port in the mother country afford very little protection to the outlying portion of the empire so they principal port also be give defence-works -- sometimes of a elaborate character again it be find that commercial port have be leave out and that they too must be fortify when this be do spot be observe at which a enemy might effect a landing in force to prevent which further fort or battery must be erect the most striking thing in all this be the complete omission to take note of the condition involve in the command of the sea evidently it have not be understand that it be that very command which alone have enable the army of western europe to proceed not only without serious interruption but also without encounter a attempt at obstruction to the field in the crimea on which they victory have be win and that the same command would be necessary before any hostile expedition large enough to justify the construction of the fortification specially intend to repel it could cross the sea and get within striking distance of we shore it should be deeply interesting to the people of those part of the british empire which lie beyond sea to note that the defensive system comprise in the fortification of the coast of the unite kingdom promise no security to they in the event of war make all proper allowance for the superior urgency of defend the heart of the empire we must still admit that no system of defense be adequate which do not provide for the defense of other valuable part of the great body politic as well again the system of defense prove to be imperfect every part of the empire depend for prosperity -- some part depend for existence -- on practically unrestricted traffic on the ocean this which might be assail at many point and on line often thousand of mile in length could find little or no defense in immovable fortification it could not be hold that the existence of these release the fleet from all duty but that of protect we ocean commerce because if any enemy 's navy be able to carry out a operation of such magnitude and difficulty as a serious attack on we home territory it would assuredly be able to carry out the work of damage we maritime trade power to do the latter have always belong to the navy which be in a position to extend its activity persistently to the immediate neighborhood of its opponent 's coast-line it be not to be suppose that there be no one to point this out several person do so but be mostly sailor they be not listen to in actual practice the whole domain of imperial strategy be withdraw from the intervention of the naval officer as though it be something with which he could not have anything to do several great war have be wage in europe in the meantime and all of they be land war naval force if employ at all be employ only just enough to bring out how insignificant they participation in they be as be to have be expect the habit of attach importance to the naval element of imperial defense decline the empire nevertheless continue to grow its territory be extend its population notably its population of european stock increase and its wealth and the subsequent operation of exchange its production for those of other country be enormously expand at the same time the navy to the strength and efficiency of which it have to look for security decline absolutely and still more relatively other navy be advance : some have as it be come into existence at last the true condition be discern and the nation almost with one voice demand that the naval defence of the empire should be put upon a proper footing let no one dismiss the foregoing retrospect as merely ancient history on the contrary let all those who desire to see the british empire follow the path of its natural development in tranquillity study the recent past by do this we shall be able to estimate aright the position of the fleet in the defense of the empire we must examine the circumstance in which we be place for five-and-thirty year the nation of the world have practically live under the rule of force the incessant object of every great state have be to increase the strength of its armed force up to the point at which the cost become intolerable country separate from one another only by arbitrary geographical line add regiment to regiment and gun to gun and also devise continually fresh expedient for accelerate the work of prepare they army to take the field the most pacifically inclined nation must do in this respect as its neighbor do on pain of lose its independence and be mutilate in its territory if it do not this rivalry have spread to the sea and fleet be increase at a rate and at a cost in money unknown to former time even to those of war the possession of a powerful navy by some state which have no reason to apprehend over-sea invasion and which have no maritime interest however intrinsically important they may be commensurate with the strength of its fleet may not indicate a spirit of aggression but it at least indicate ability to become a aggressor consequently for the british fleet to fill its proper position in the defense of the empire it must be strong to be strong more than large number will be require it must have the right that be the best material the best organization the best discipline the best training the best distribution we shall ascertain the position that it should hold if we examine what it would have to do when call upon for work more active than that of peace time with the exception of indium and canada no part of the empire be liable to serious attack that do not come over-sea any support that can be give to indium or canada by other part of the empire must be convey across the sea also this at once indicate the importance of ocean line of communication war be the method adopt when less violent means of persuasion have fail to force you enemy to comply with you demand there be three principal way of effect this -- invasion of he country raid on he territory destruction or serious damage of he sea-borne commerce successful invasion must compel the invade to come to term or he national existence will be lose raid upon he territory may possibly so distress he that he would rather concede you term than continue the struggle -lrb- 90 -rrb- damage to he sea-borne commerce may be carry so far that he will be ruin if he do not give in so much for one side of the account we have to examine the other against invasion raid or attempt at commerce-destruction there must be some form of defense and as a matter of historical fact defense against each have be repeatedly successful if we need instance we have only to peruse the history of the british empire -lrb- footnote 90 : though raid rarely if ever decide a war they may cause inconvenience or local distress and a enemy desire to make they should be obstruct as much as possible -rrb- how be it that -- whilst we land invade army in many hostile country seize many portion of hostile territory and drive more than one enemy 's commerce from the sea -- we own country have be free from successful invasion for more than eight century few portion of we territory have be take from we even temporarily and we commerce have increase throughout protracted maritime war to this there can only be one answer viz that the arrangement for defense be effectual what then be these arrangement they be comprise in the provision of a powerful well-distributed well-handled navy and of a mobile army of suitable strength it be to be observe that each element possess the characteristic of mobility we have to deal here more especially with the naval element and we must study the manner in which it operate naval war be sea-power in action and sea-power take in the narrow sense have limitation it may not even when so take cease to act at the enemy 's coast-line but its direct influence extend only to the inner side of a narrow zone conform to that line in a maritime contest each side try to control the ocean communication and to prevent the other from control they if either gain the control something in addition to sea-power strictly define may begin to operate : the other side 's territory may be invade or harass by considerable raid and its commerce may be drive from the sea it will be notice that control of ocean communication be the needful preliminary to these it be merely a variant of the often employ expression of the necessity in war of obtain command of the sea in the case of the most important portion of the british empire viz the unite kingdom we loss of control of the ocean communication would have a result which scarcely any foreign country would experience other country be dependent on importation for some part of the food of they population and of the raw material of they industry but much of the importation be and perhaps all of it may be effect by land here we depend upon import from abroad for a very large part of the food of we people and of the raw material essential to the manufacture of the commodity by the exchange of which we obtain necessary supplies and the whole of these import come and must come to we by sea also if we have not freedom of exportation we wealth and the means of support a war would disappear probably all the greater colony and indium could feed they inhabitant for a moderately long time without sea-borne import but unless the sea be open to they they prosperity would decline this teach we the necessity to the british empire of control we maritime communication and equally teach those who may one day be we enemy the advisability of prevent we from do so the lesson in either case be drive farther home by other consideration connect with communication in war a belligerent have two task before he he have to defend himself and hurt he enemy the more he hurt he enemy the less be he likely to be hurt himself this define the great principle of offensive defense to act in accordance with this principle a belligerent should try as the say go to carry the war into the enemy 's country he should try to make he opponent fight where he want they to fight which will probably be as far as possible from he own territory and as near as possible to theirs unless he can do this invasion and even serious raid by he will be out of the question more than that he inability to do it will virtually indicate that on its part the other side can fix the scene of active hostility unpleasantly close to the point from which he desire to keep its force away a line of ocean communication may be vulnerable throughout its length but it do not follow that a assailant can operate against it with equal facility at every point nor do it follow that it be at every point equally worth assail line run past hostile naval port be especially open to assault in the part near the port and line form by the confluence of two or more other line -- like for example those which enter the english channel -- will generally include a greater abundance of valuable traffic than other consequently there be some part at which a enemy may be expect to be more active than elsewhere and it be from those very part that it be most desirable to exclude he they be as a rule relatively near to the territory of the state whose navy have to keep the line open that be to say prevent they be persistently beset by a enemy the necessary convergence of line towards that state 's port show that some portion of they would have to be traverse or they traverse be attempt by expedition mean to carry out either invasion or raid if therefore the enemy can be exclude as above mention invasion raid and the more serious molestation of sea-borne commerce by he will be prevent if we consider particular case we shall find proof upon proof of the validity of the rule three great line -- one from the neighborhood of the cape of good hope one from the red sea and a third from indium and ceylon -- converge near the south-western part of australium and run as one line towards the territory of the important state farther east if a assailant can be exclude from the latter or combined line he must either divide he force or operate on only one of the confluent leave the rest free the farther he can be push back from the point of confluence the more effectually will he be limit to a single line because the combine line trace backwards trend more and more apart and it be therefore more and more difficult for he to keep detachment of he force within support distance of each other if they continue to act against two or more line the particular case of the approach to the territory of the unite kingdom have the same feature and prove the rule with equal clearness this latter case be so often adduce without mention of other that there be some risk of its be believe to be a solitary one it stand however exactly on all fours with all the rest as regard the principle of the rule a necessary consequence of a enemy 's exclusion from the combined line as it approach the territory to be defend be -- as already suggest -- that invasion of that territory and serious raid upon it will be render impracticable indeed if the exclusion be absolutely complete and permanent raid of every kind and depredation on commerce in the neighborhood will be prevent altogether it should be explain that though line and communication be speak of it be the area cross by they which be strategically important a naval force either guard or intend to assail a line do not necessarily station itself permanently upon it all that it have to do be to remain for the proper length of time within the strategic area across which the defend or threaten line run the strategic area will be of vary extent its boundary be determine by circumstance the object of the defense will be to make the area from which the enemy 's ship be exclude as extensive as possible when the enemy have be push back into he own water and into he own port the exclusion be strategically complete the sea be deny to he invade and important raiding expedition and indeed to most of he individual cruiser at the same time it be free to the other belligerent to effect this a vigorous offensive will be necessary the immediate theater of operation the critical strategic area need not be and often ought not to be near the territory defend by we navy it be necessary to dwell upon this because no principle of naval warfare have be more frequently or more seriously misapprehended misapprehension of it have lead to mischievous and dangerous distribution of naval force and to the squander of immense sum of money on local defense vessel that be vessel only capable of operate in the very water from which every effort should be make to exclude the enemy failure to exclude he from they can only be regard as at the very least yield to he a important point in the great game of war if we succeed in keep he away the local defense craft of every class be useless and the money spend on they have be worse than waste because if it have not be so spend it might have be devote to strengthen the kind of force which must be use to keep the enemy where he ought to be keep viz at a distance from we own water the demand that ship be so station that they will generally and except when actually cruise be within sight of the inhabitant be common enough in the mother country and perhaps even more common in the over-sea part of the british empire nothing justify it but the honest ignorance of those who make it nothing explain compliance with it but the deplorable weakness of authority who yield to it it be not by hang about the coast of england when there be no enemy near it with he fleet that hawke or nelson save the country from invasion nor be it by remain where they could be see by the fellow-countryman of they crew that the french and english fleet shut up they enemy in the baltic and black sea and thus gain and keep undisputed command of the sea which enable they without interruption to invade they enemy 's territory the condition insist upon by the australasian government in the agreement formerly make with the home government that a certain number of ship in return for a annual contribution of money should always remain in australasian water be in reality greatly against the interest of that part of the empire the australasian taxpayer be in fact make to insist upon be injure in return for he money the proceeding would have be exactly parallel by a householder who might insist that a fire-engine maintain out of rate to which he contribute should always be keep within a few foot of he front door and not be allow to proceed to the end of the street to extinguish a fire threaten to extend eventually to the householder 's own dwelling when still further localized naval defense -- localized defense that be of what may be call the smaller description -- be consider the danger involve in adopt it will be quite as apparent and the waste of money will be more obvious localized defense be a near relation of passive defense it owe its origin to the same sentiment viz a belief in the efficacy of stay where you be instead of carry the war into the enemy 's country there may be case in which no other kind of naval defense be practicable the immense costliness of modern navy put it out of the power of smaller state to maintain considerable sea-going fleet the historic maritime country -- sweden denmark the netherland and portugal the performance of whose seaman be so justly celebrate -- could not now send to sea a force equal in number and fight efficiency to a quarter of the force possess by anyone of the chief naval power the country name when determine not to expose themselves unarmed to a assailant can provide themselves only with a kind of defense which whatever its detailed composition must be of a intrinsically localized character in they case there be nothing else to be do and in they case defense of the character specify would be likely to prove more efficacious than it could be expect to be elsewhere war be usually make in pursuit of a object valuable enough to justify the risk inseparable from the attempt to gain it aggression by any of the country that have be mention be too improbable to call for serious apprehension aggression against they be far more likely what they have to do be to make the danger of attack they so great that it will equal or outweigh any advantage that could be gain by conquer they they wealth and resource compare with those of great aggressive state be not large enough to make up for much loss in war on the part of the latter engage in attempt to seize they therefore what the small maritime country have to do be to make the form of naval defense to which they be restricted efficacious enough to hurt a aggressor so much that the victory which he may feel certain of gain will be quite barren he will get no glory even in these day of self-advertisement from the conquest of such relatively weak antagonist and the plunder will not suffice to repay he for the damage receive in effect it the case of a member of the great body know as the british empire be altogether different its conquest would probably be enormously valuable to a conqueror its ruin immensely damage to the body as a whole either would justify a enemy in run considerable risk and would afford he practically sufficient compensation for considerable loss incur we may expect that in war any chance of accomplish either purpose will not be neglect provision must therefore be make against the eventuality let we for the moment suppose that like one of the smaller country whose case have be adduce we be restricted to localized defense a enemy not so restricted would be able to get without be molest as near to we territory -- whether in the mother country or elsewhere -- as the outer edge of the comparatively narrow belt of water that we localized defence could have any hope of control effectively we should have abandon to he the whole of the ocean except a relatively minute strip of coast-water that would be equivalent to say good-bye to the maritime commerce on which we wealth wholly and we existence largely depend no thoughtful british subject would find this tolerable everyone would demand the institution of a different defense system a change therefore to the more active system would be inevitable it would begin with the introduction of a cruise force in addition to the localized force the unvarying lesson of naval history would be that the cruise division should gain continuously on the localized it be only in time of peace when man have forget or can not be make to understand what war be that the opposite take place if it be hope that a localized force will render coast-wise traffic safe from the enemy a little knowledge of what have happen in war and a sufficiently close investigation of condition will demonstrate how baseless the hope must be country not yet thickly populate would be in much the same condition as the country of western europe a century ago the similarity be due to the relative scarcity of good land communication a part -- probably not a very large part -- of the article require by the people dwelling on and near the coast in one section would be draw from another similar section these article could be most conveniently and cheaply transport by water if it be worth he while a enemy dispose of a active cruise force strong enough to make its way into the neighborhood of the coast water concern would interrupt the ` long-shore traffic ' and defy the effort of a localized force to prevent he the history of the great war at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth teem with instance of interruption by we navy of the enemy 's coast-wise trade when he ocean trade have be destroy the history of the american war of 1812 supplies other instance the localized defense could not attempt to drive off hostile cruiser remain far from the shore and mean to infest the great line of maritime communication run towards it if those cruiser be to be drive off at all it can be do only by cruise ship unless therefore we be to be content to leave we ocean route where most crowded and therefore most vulnerable to the mercy of a enemy we must have cruiser to meet the hostile cruiser if we still adhere to we localized defense we shall have two distinct kind of force -- one provide merely for local and consequently restricted action the other able to act near the shore or far out at sea as circumstance may demand if we go to the expense of provide both kind we shall have follow the example of the sage who cut a large hole in he study door for the cat and a small one for the kitten be local naval defense then of any use well to tell the truth not much and only in rare and exceptional circumstance even in the case of the smaller maritime country to which reference have be make above defense of the character in question would avail little if a powerful assailant be resolve to press home he attack that be to say if only absolute belligerent consideration be regard in war however qualify consideration can never be leave out of sight as the great napoleon observe you can no more make war without incur loss than you can make omelette without break egg the strategist -- and the tactician also within he province -- will always count the cost of a propose operation even where they be nearly certain of success the occupation of a country which would be of no great practical value to you when you get it would be a poor return for the loss to which you would have be put in the process that loss might and probably would leave you at a great disadvantage as regard enemy more nearly on a equality with yourself it would therefore not be the improbability of break down the local naval defense of a minor maritime state but the pressure of qualify and only indirectly belligerent consideration that would prevent its be attempt in a struggle between two antagonist of the first rank the circumstance would be different purely belligerent consideration would have fuller play mistake will be make of course for war be full of mistake but it may be accept that a attack on any position however defend be in itself proof that the assailant believe the result hope for to be quite worth the cost of obtain it consequently in a struggle as assume every mode of defense would have to stand on its intrinsic merit nearly or quite unaided by the influence of consideration more or less foreign to it every scrap of local defense would in proportion to its amount be a diminution of the offensive defense advocate of the former may be challenge to produce from naval history any instance of local naval defense succeed against the assault of a actively aggressive navy in the late war between japan and russium the russian local defense fail completely in the last case a class of vessel like that which have fail in local defense be use successfully because offensively by the japanese this and many another instance show that the right way to use the kind of craft so often allocate to local defense be to use they offensively it be only thus that they adoption by a great maritime power like the british empire can be justify the origin and center of we naval strength be to be look for in the unite kingdom the shore of the latter be near the shore of other great maritime power its port especially those at which its fleet be equip and would be likely to assemble on the imminence of war be within reach of more than one foreign place from which small swift craft to be use offensively might be expect to issue the method of frustrate the effort of these craft give most promise of success be to attack they as soon as possible after they issue from they own port to the acceptance of this principle we owe the origin of the destroyer devise to destroy hostile torpedo-boat before they could reach a position from which they would be able to discharge with effect they special weapon against we assemble ship it be true that the destroyer have be gradually convert into a larger torpedo-boat it be also true that when use as such in local defense as at port arthur she failure be complete and just as true that she have never accomplish anything except when use offensively when therefore a naval country 's coast be so near the port of another naval country that the latter would be able with swift small craft to attack the former 's ship the provision of craft of a similar kind be likely to prove advantageous war between great power be a two-sided game and what one side can do the other will at least be likely to attempt nothing support the view that it be well -- either above or beneath the surface of the water -- to stand on the defensive and await attack everything point to the superiority of the plan of beat up the enemy 's quarter and attack he before he can get far from they on he way towards he objective consequently the only justification of expend money on the localized vessel of which we have be speak be the probability that a enemy would have some of he basis within reach of those vessel ' effort where this condition do not exist the money expend be from the belligerent point of view throw away here come in the greatest foe of belligerent efficiency viz political expediency in time of peace it be think better to conciliate voter than to prepare to meet a enemy if local defense be think to be please to a inexpert electorate it be only too likely to be provide no matter how ineffectual and how costly in reality it will turn out to be not only be the british empire the first of naval power it be also the first of colonial power one attribute be closely connect with the other neither without the other would be applicable the magnitude of we colonial domain and especially the impose aspect of some of its greater component -- the dominion the commonwealth south africa new zealand -- be apt to blind we to a feature of great strategical importance and that be the abundance and excellence of the naval basis that stud we ocean line of communication in thinking of the great daughter state we be liable to forget these yet we possession of they help greatly to strengthen we naval position because it facilitate we assume a far-reaching offensive by themselves if not too numerous they can afford valuable support to the naval operation that be likely to prove most beneficial to we the fact that they be ours and not a opponent 's also constitute for we a advantage of importance of course they have to be defend or else they may fall into a opponent 's hand have we here a case in which highly localize or even passive defence be desirable no doubt we do act for a time as though we believe that the question could only be answer in the affirmative but that be when we be under the influence of the feeling engender by observation of the long series of land war previously discuss perhaps we have not yet quite shake off the effect of that influence but we have at least get so far as to tolerate the statement of the other side of the question it would be a great mistake to suppose that the place allude to be mean to be port of refuge for we ship though they be to serve that purpose occasionally in the case of isolate merchant vessel it would be but a accident and not the essence of they existence what they be mean for be to be utilise as position where we man-of-war can make reasonably sure of find supplies and the means of refit this assurance will largely depend upon they power of resistance if attack before we can decide how to impart that power to they we shall have to see the kind of attack against which they would have to be prepare if they be on a continent like for example gibraltar attack on they by a land force however improbable be physically possible against a attack of the kind a naval force could give little direct help most of we outlying naval basis be really or virtually insular and be open to attack only by a expedition come across the sea a essential characteristic of a naval base be that it should be able to furnish supplies as want to the men-of-war need to replenish they stock some and very often all of these supplies be not of native production and must be bring to the base by sea if the enemy can stop they conveyance to it the place be useless as a base and the enemy be really in control of its communication if he be in control of its communication he can send against it as great a expedition as he like and the place will be capture or completely neutralise similarly if we control the communication not only can supplies be convey to it but also no hostile expedition will be allow to reach it thus the primary defense of the outlying base be the active sea-going fleet moderate local defense chiefly of the human kind in the shape of a garrison will certainly be need though the enemy have not be able to obtain control of the communication of the place fitful raid on it will be possible and the place should be fortify enough and garrison enough to hold out against the inconsiderable assault comprise in these till we own ship can drive the enemy 's away outlying naval basis though but moderately fortify that contain depot of store dock and other convenience have the vice of all immobile establishment when war do come some of they almost certainly and all of they possibly may not be in the right place with regard to the critical area of operation they can not however be move it will be necessary to do what have be do over and over again in war in the latest as well as in earlier war and that be establish temporary basis in more convenient situation thus much perhaps all of the cost and trouble of establish and maintain the permanent basis will have be waste this inculcate the necessity of have not as many basis as can be find but as few as it be possible to get on with the control of ocean communication or the command of the sea be the end of naval warfare and its acquisition be practicable only by the assumption of a vigorous offensive it follow as a matter of course that we must have a strong and in all respects efficient mobile navy this be the fundamental condition on which the continue existence of the british empire depend it be thoroughly well know to every foreign government friendly or unfriendly the true objective in naval warfare be the enemy 's navy that must be destroy or decisively defeat or intimidate into remain in its port not one of these can be effect without a mobile that be a sea-going fleet the british empire may fall to piece from cause as yet unknown or unsuspected : it can not be keep together if it lose the power of gain command of the sea this be not a result of deliberate policy : it be inherent in the nature of the empire scatter as its part be throughout the world with only the highway of the sea between they such be the position of the fleet in the defense of the empire : such be its duty towards it duty in the case be mutual and some be owe to the fleet as well as by it it be incumbent on every section of the empire without neglect its land force to lend zealous help in keep the fleet efficient it be not to be suppose that this can be do only by make pecuniary contribution to its maintenance it be indeed very doubtful if any real good can be do by urge colony to make they it seem certain that the objection to this be greater than any benefit that it can confer badger we fellow-subject beyond sea for money payment towards the cost of the navy be undignified and impolitic the greatest sum ask for by the most exacting postulant would not equal a twentieth part of the imperial naval expenditure and would not save the taxpayer of the mother country a farthing in the pound of he income no one have yet be able to establish the equity of a demand that would take something from the inhabitant of one colony and nothing from those of another adequate voluntary contribution be a different matter there be other way in which every trans-marine possession of the crown can lend a hand towards perfect the efficiency of the fleet -- way too which would leave each in complete and unmenaced control of its own money sea-power do not consist entirely of men-of-war there must be dock refit establishment magazine and depot of store port which men-of-war must visit at least occasionally in war for repair or replenishment of supplies will have to be make secure against the assault which it have be say that a hastily raiding enemy notwithstanding we general control of the communication might find a chance of make moderate fix fortification be all the passive defense that would be need but good and active troops must be available if all these be not provide by the part of the empire in which the necessary naval basis lie they will have to be provide by the mother country if the former provide they the latter will be spare the expense of do so and spare expense with no loss of dignity and with far less risk of friction and inconvenience than if she taxpayer ' pocket have be nominally spare to the extent of a trifling and reluctantly pay money contribution it have be point out on a earlier page that a country can be and most probably will be more effectually defend in a maritime war if its fleet operate at a distance from rather than near its shore every subject of we king should long to see this condition exist if ever the empire be involve in hostility it may be -- for who can tell what war will bring -- that the people of some great trans-marine dependency will have to choose between allow a campaign to be conduct in they country or force the enemy to tolerate it in he if they choose the latter they must be prepare to furnish part at least of the mobile force that can give effect to they choice that be to say they must be prepare to back up we sea-power in its effort to keep off the tide of war from the neighborhood of they home history show how rarely during the struggle between european nation for predominance in north america the more settled part of we former american colony be the theater of war : but then the colonist of those day few comparatively as they be send strong contingent to the army that go campaigning in the territory of the various enemy this be in every way better -- the sequel prove how much better -- than a money contribution beg or extort would have be help in the manner first suggest need not result in dissociate we fellow-subject beyond the sea from participation in the work of the active sea-going fleet it be now and still would be open to they as much as to any native or denizen of the mother country the time have fully come when the people of the greater outlying part of the empire should insist upon perfect equality of treatment with they home fellow-subject in this matter they should resent as a now quite out-of-date and invidious distinction any difference in qualification for entry locality of service or remuneration for any rank or rating self-respect and a dignified confidence in they own quality the excellence of which have be thoroughly test will prompt the king 's colonial subject to ask for nothing but equal chance in a force on which be lay so large a part of the duty of defend the empire why should they cut themselves off from the promising career that service in the royal navy open to the capable the zealous and the honorable aspirant of every grade some of the highest post in the navy be now or lately have be hold by man who not only happen to be bear in british colony but who also belong to resident colonial family surely in this there be a strong moral cement for binding and keep the empire together it be unnecessary to expatiate on the contrast between the prospect of such a career and that which be all that a small local service could offer it would soon be see towards which the enterprising and the energetic would instinctively gravitate in the defense of the british empire the fleet hold a twofold position to its general belligerent efficiency its strength and activity we must look if the plan of a enemy be to be bring to nought it and it only can secure for we the control of the ocean communication on the freedom of which from serious interruption the prosperity -- indeed the existence -- of a scatter body must depend in time of peace it can be make a great consolidate force foster every sentiment of worthy local patriotism whilst obliterate all inclination to mischievous narrow particularism and tend to perfect the unity which give virtue to national grandeur and be the true secret of national independence and strength xi naval strategy and tactic at the time of trafalgar -lrb- 91 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 91 : write in 1905 -lrb- read at institute of naval architect -rrb- -rrb- the subject on which i have be invite to read a paper and which be take as the title of the latter would require for anything like full discussion a much longer time than you can be expect to allot to it to discuss it adequately a volume of no diminutive size would be necessary it may however be possible to indicate with the brevity appropriate to the occasion the main outline of the subject and to suggest for you consideration certain point which over and above they historical interest may furnish we with valuable guidance at the present day in take account of the condition of the trafalgar epoch we have to note two distinct but of course closely related matter these be the strategic plan of the enemy and the strategic plan adopt to meet it by the british the former of these be describe in the house of common by william pitt at the beginning of the war in word which may be use without change at the present time on 16th may 1803 the war which have be interrupt by the unstable peace of amien be definitely resume the struggle be now to be a war not so much between the unite kingdom and the french nation as between the unite kingdom and the great napoleon wield more than the resource of france alone speak a week after the declaration of war pitt say that any expectation of success which the enemy might have must be base on the supposition that he could break the spirit or weaken the determination of the country by harass we with the perpetual apprehension of descent on we coast or else that we resource could be impaired and we credit undermine by the effect of a expensive and protracted war more briefly state the hostile plan be to invade the unite kingdom ruin we maritime trade and expel we from we over-sea possession especially in the east from which it be suppose we wealth be chiefly derive the plan be comprehensive but not easily conceal what we have to do be to prevent the invasion of the unite kingdom and defend we trade and we outlying territory as not one of the hostile object could be attain except by make a maritime expedition of some kind that be to say by a expedition which have to cross more or less extensive area of water it necessarily follow that we most effective method of defense be the keep open of we sea communication it become necessary for we to make such arrangement that the maritime path by which a hostile expedition could approach we home-coast or hostile cruiser molest we sea-borne trade or hostile squadron move to the attack of we trans-marine dependency -- that all these path should be so defend by we navy that either the enemy would not venture to traverse they or if he do that he could be drive off short as it be the time at my disposal permit I to give a few detail it be fully recognize that defense of the unite kingdom against invasion could not be secure by naval means alone as in the time of queen elizabeth so in those of george iii no seaman of reputation contend that a sufficient land force could be dispense with we ablest seaman always hold that small hostile expedition could be prepare in secret and might be able to slip through the most complete line of naval defense that we could hope to maintain it be not discover or allege till the twentieth century that the crew of a dinghy could not land in this country in the face of the navy therefore a essential feature of we defensive strategy be the provision of land force in such number that a invader would have no chance of succeed except he come in strength so great that he preparation could not be conceal and he expedition could not cross the water unseen as we mercantile marine be to be find in nearly every sea though in greater accumulation in some area than in other its defense against the assault of a enemy could only be ensure by the virtual ubiquity of we cruise force this of course involve the necessity of employ a large number of cruiser and of arrange the distribution of they in accordance with the relative amount and value of the traffic to be protect from molestation in different part of the ocean it may be mention here that the term ` cruiser ' at the time with which we be deal be not limit to frigate and smaller class of vessel it include also ship of the line it be the old belief of the british navy justify by the experience of many campaign and consecrate by the approval of we greatest admiral that the value of a ship of war be directly proportionate to she capacity for cruise and keep the sea if the ocean path use by we merchant ship -- the trade route or sea communication of the unite kingdom with friendly or neutral market and area of production -- could be keep open by we navy that be make so secure that we trade could traverse they with so little risk of molestation that it could continue to be carry on it result as a matter of course that no sustained attack could be make on we outlying territory where this be possible it be where we have fail to keep open the route or line of communication in which case the particular trade follow it be at least temporarily destroy and the territory to which the route lead be either cut off or seize naturally when this be perceive effort be make to re-open and keep open the endanger or interrupt communication line napoleon notwithstanding he supereminent genius make some extraordinary mistake about warfare on the sea the explanation of this have be give by a highly distinguish french admiral the great emperor he say be want in exact appreciation of the difficulty of naval operation he never understand that the naval officer -- alone of all man in the world -- must be master of two distinct profession the naval officer must be as completely a seaman as a officer in any mercantile marine and in addition to this he must be as accomplish in the use of the material of war entrust to he charge as the member of any aim force in the world the emperor 's plan for the invasion of the unite kingdom be conceive on a grand scale a great army eventually 130000 strong be collect on the coast of north-eastern france with its headquarters at boulogne the numerical strength of this army be worth attention by far the larger part of it be to have make the first descent on we territory the remainder be to be a reserve to follow as quickly as possible it have be doubt if napoleon really mean to invade this country the suggestion be that he collection of a army on the shore of the strait of dover and the english channel be merely a ` blind ' to cover another intended movement the overwhelming weight of authoritative opinion be in favor of the view that the project of invasion be real it be highly significant that he consider so large a number of troops necessary it could not have be govern by any estimate of the naval obstruction to be encounter during the sea passage of the expedition but only by the amount of the land force likely to be meet if the disembarkation on we shore could be effect the numerical strength in troops which napoleon think necessary compel he to make preparation on so great a scale that concealment become quite impossible consequently a important part of he plan be disclose to we betime and the threaten locality indicate to we within comparatively narrow limit of precision notwithstanding he failure to appreciate all the difficulty of naval warfare the great emperor have grasp one of its lead principle before the peace of amien indeed before he campaign in egypt and even he impose triumph in italy he have see that the invasion of the unite kingdom be impracticable without first obtain the command of the sea he strategic plan therefore include arrangement to secure this the detail of the plan be change from time to time as condition alter but the main object be adhere to until the final abandonment of the whole scheme under pressure of circumstance as embody in nelson and he victorious brothers-in-arm the gunboat transport boat and other small craft which to the number of many hundred fill the port of north-eastern france and the netherland be not the only naval component of the expedition fleet of line-of-battle ship be essential part of it and on they effective action the success of the scheme be largely make to depend this feature remain unaltered in principle when less than twelve month before trafalgar spain take part in the war as napoleon 's ally and bring he a great reinforcement of ship and important assistance in money we should not fail to notice that before he consider himself strong enough to undertake the invasion of the unite kingdom napoleon find it necessary to have at he disposal the resource of other country besides france notwithstanding that by herself france have a population more than 60 per cent greater than that of england by the alliance with spain he have add largely to the resource on which he could draw moreover he strategic position be geographically much improve with the exception of that of portugal the coast of western continental europe from the texel to leghorn and somewhat later to taranto also be unite in hostility to we this complicate the strategic problem which the british navy have to solve as it increase the number of point to be watch and it facilitate the junction of napoleon 's mediterranean naval force with those assemble in he atlantic port by supply he with ally port of refuge and refit on spanish territory -- such as cartagena or cadiz -- between toulon and the bay of biscay napoleon therefore enforce upon we by the most convincing of all argument the necessity of maintain the british navy at the ` two-power standard ' at least the lesson have be teach we long before by philip ii who do not venture on a attempt at invade this country till he be master of the resource of the whole iberian peninsula as well as of those of the spanish dominion in italy in the burgundian heritage and in the distant region across the atlantic ocean at several point on the long stretch of coast of which he be now the master napoleon equip fleet that be to unite and win for he the command of the sea during a period long enough to permit the unobstructed passage of he invade army across the water which separate the start point of he expedition from the unite kingdom command of the sea to be win by a powerful naval combination be thus a essential element in napoleon 's strategy at the time of trafalgar it be not in decide what be essential that this soldier of stupendous ability err : it be in choose the method of gain the essential that he go wrong the british strategy adopt in opposition to that of napoleon be base on the acquisition and preservation of the command of the sea formulate and carry into effect by seaman it differ in some important feature from he we may leave out of sight for the moment the special arrangement make in the english channel to oppose the movement of napoleon 's flotilla of gunboat transport boat and other small craft the british strategy at the time of trafalgar as far as it be concern with opposition to napoleon 's sea-going fleet may be succinctly describe as station off each of the port in which the enemy 's force be lie a fleet or squadron of suitable strength though some of we admiral notably nelson himself object to the application of the term ` blockade ' to they plan the hostile ship be to this extent blockade that if they should come out they would find outside they port a british force sufficient to drive they in again or even to defeat they thoroughly and destroy they beat they and thus have do with they and not simply shut they up in harbor be what be desire by we admiral this necessitate a close watch on the hostile port and how consistently that be maintain let the history of cornwalli 's command off brest and of nelson 's off toulon suffice to tell we the junction of two or more of napoleon 's fleet would have ensure over almost any single british fleet a numerical superiority that would have render the defeat or retirement of the latter almost certain to meet this condition the british strategy contemplate the fall back if necessary of one of we detachment on another which might be carry further and junction with a third detachment be effect by this step we should preserve if not a numerical superiority over the enemy at least so near a equality of force as to render he defeat probable and he serious maltreatment even if undefeated a certainty the strategic problem before we navy be however not quite so easy as this might make it seem the enemy 's concentration might be attempt either towards brest or towards toulon in the latter case a superior force might fall upon we mediterranean fleet before we watch ship in the atlantic could discover the escape of the enemy 's ship from the atlantic port or could follow and come up with they against the probability of this be to be set the reluctance of napoleon to carry out a eccentric operation which a concentration off toulon would necessitate when the essence of he scheme be to concentrate in a position from which he could obtain naval control of the english channel after the addition of the spanish navy to he own napoleon to some extent modify he strategic arrangement the essential feature of the scheme remain unaltered it be to effect the junction of the different part of he naval force and thereupon to dominate the situation by evade the several british fleet or detachment which be watch he before spain join he in the war he intention be that he escape fleet should go out into the atlantic behind the back as it be of the british ship and then make for the english channel when he have the aid of spain the point of junction be to be in the west indy the remarkable thing about this be the evident belief that the command of the sea might be win without fight for it win too from the british navy which be ready and indeed wish to fight we now see that napoleon 's naval strategy at the time of trafalgar whilst it aim at gain command of the sea be base on what have be call evasion the fundamental principle of the british naval strategy of that time be quite different so far from think that the contest could be settle without one or more battle the british admiral though nominally blockade he port give the enemy every facility for come out in order that they might be able to bring he to action napoleon on the contrary declare that a battle would be useless and distinctly order he officer not to fight one could it be that when pit against admiral whose accurate conception of the condition of naval warfare have be over and over again test during the hostility end by the peace of amien napoleon still trust to the efficacy of method which have prove so successful when he be outmanoeuvre and intimidate the general who oppose he in north italy we can only explain he attitude in the campaign of trafalgar by attribute to he a expectation that the british seaman of he day try as they have be in the fire of many year of war would succumb to he method as readily as the military formalist of central europe napoleon have at he disposal between seventy and eighty french dutch and spanish ship of the line of which some sixty-seven be available at the beginning of the trafalgar campaign in January 1805 besides other ship of the class in distant water or specially employ we -- on we side -- have eighty ship of the line in commission a knowledge of this will enable we to form some idea of the chance of success that would have attend napoleon 's concentration if it have be effect to protect the passage of he invade expedition across the english channel he do not depend only on concentrate he more distant fleet in the texel there be besides smaller vessel nine sail of the line thus the emperor do what we may be sure any future intending invader will not fail to do viz he provide he expedition with a respectable naval escort the british naval officer of the day who know what war be make arrangement to deal with this escort lord keith who command in the downs have under he six sail of the line in addition to many frigate and sloop and there be five more line-of-battle ship ready at spithead if require there have be a demand in the country that the defense of we shore against a invade expedition should be entrust to gunboat and what may be call coastal small craft and boat this be resist by the naval officer nelson have already say ` we first defense be close to the enemy 's port ' thus agree with a long line of eminent british seaman in they view of we strategy lord st vincent say that ` we great reliance be on the vigilance and activity of we cruiser at sea any reduction in the number of which by apply they to guard we port inlet and beach would in my judgment tend to we destruction ' these be memorable word which we should do well to ponder in these day the government of the day insist on have the coastal boat but st vincent succeed in postpone the preparation of they till the cruise ship have be man he plan of defense have be describe by he biographer as ' a triple line of barricade 50-gun ship frigate sloop of war and gun-vessel upon the coast of the enemy in the downs opposite france another squadron but of powerful ship of the line continually disposable to support the former or attack any force of the enemy which it might be imagine possible might slip through the squadron hang over the coast and a force on the beach on all the shore of the english port to render assurance doubly sure ' this last item be the one that st vincent have be compel to adopt and he be careful that it should be in addition to those measure of defense in the efficacy of which he and he brother seaman believe concern it he biographer make the follow remark : ` it be to be note that lord st vincent do not contemplate repel a invasion of gunboat by gunboat ' & c he object to the force of sea-fencible or long-shore organization because he consider it more useful to have the sea-going ship man speaking of this coastal defense scheme he say : ` it would be a good bone for the officer to pick but a very dear one for the country ' the defense of we ocean trade enter largely into the strategy of the time a important part be play by we fleet and group of line-of-battle ship which give usually indirect but sometimes direct protection to we own merchant vessel and also to neutral vessel carry commodity to or from british port the strategy of the time the correctness of which be confirm by long belligerent experience reject the employment of a restricted number of powerful cruiser and rely upon the practical ubiquity of the defend ship which ubiquity be render possible by the employment of very numerous craft of moderate size this can be see in the list of successive year in January 1803 the number of cruise frigate in commission be 107 and of sloop and smaller vessel 139 the total be 246 in 1804 the number be : frigate 108 sloop & c 181 with a total of 289 in 1805 the figure have grow to 129 frigate 416 sloop & c the total be 545 most of these be employ in defend commerce we all know how completely napoleon 's project of invade the unite kingdom be frustrated it be less well know that the measure for defend we sea-borne trade indicate by the figure just give be triumphantly successful we mercantile marine increase during the war a sure proof that it have be effectually defend consequently we may accept it as establish beyond the possibility of refutation that that branch of we naval strategy at the time of trafalgar which be concern with the defense of we trade be rightly conceive and properly carry into effect as have be state already the defense of we sea-borne trade be in practice the keep open of we ocean line of communication carry with it the protection in part at any rate of we transmarine territory napoleon hold pertinaciously to the belief that british prosperity be chiefly due to we position in indium we owe it to captain mahan that we now know that the eminent american fulton -- a name of interest to the member of this institution -- tell pitt of the belief hold abroad that ` the fountain of british wealth be in indium and china ' in the great scheme of naval concentration which the emperor devise seizure of british colony in the west indy have a definite place we keep in that quarter and vary as necessary a force capable of deal with a naval raid as well as guard the neighbouring line of communication in 1803 we have four ship of the line in the west indian area in 1804 we have six of the same class and in 1805 while the line-of-battle ship be reduce to four the number of frigate be increase from nine to twenty-five whether we government divine napoleon 's design on indium or not it take measure to protect we interest there in January 1804 we have on the cape of good hope and the east indy station both together six sail of the line three smaller two-decker six frigate and six sloop or twenty-one ship of war in all this would have be sufficient to repel a raiding attack make in some strength by the beginning of 1805 we east indy force have be increase and in the year 1805 itself we raise it to a strength of forty-one ship in all of which nine be of the line and seventeen be frigate have therefore any of the hostile ship manage to get to the east indy from the atlantic or the mediterranean port in which they be be watch by we navy they chance of succeed in they object would have be small indeed when we enter the domain of tactic strictly so-called that be to say when we discuss the proceedings of naval force -- whether single ship squadron or fleet -- in hostile contact with one another we find the time of trafalgar full of instructive episode even with the most recent experience of naval warfare vividly present to we mind we can still regard nelson as the greatest of tactician naval tactic may be roughly divide into two great class or section viz the tactic of group of ship that be to say fleet action and the tactic of what the historian jame call ` single ship action ' that be to say fight between two individual ship in the former the achievement of nelson stand out with incomparable brilliancy it would be impossible to describe he method fully in such a paper as this we may however say that nelson be a innovator and that he tactical principle and method have be generally misunderstand down to this very day if ever there be a admiral who be oppose to a unthinking headlong rush at a enemy it be he yet this be the character that he still bear in the conception of many he be in truth a industrious and patient student of tactic have study they in what in these day we should call a scientific spirit at a early period when there be but little reason to expect that he would ever be in a position to put to a practical test the knowledge that he have acquire and the idea that he have form he see that the old battle formation in single line-ahead be insufficient if you want -- as he himself always do -- to gain a overwhelming victory he also see that though a improvement on the old formation lord howe 's method of the single line-abreast be still a good deal short of tactical perfection therefore he devise what he call with pardonable elation the ` nelson touch ' the attack in successive line so direct as to overwhelm one part of the enemy 's fleet whilst the other part be prevent from come to the assistance of the first and be in its turn overwhelm or break up he object be to bring a larger number of he own ship against a smaller number of the enemy 's he would by this method destroy the part attack suffer in the process so little damage himself that with he whole force he would be able to deal effectively with the hostile remnant if it venture to try conclusion with he it be of the utmost importance that we should thoroughly understand nelson 's fundamental tactical principle viz the bringing of a larger number of ship to fight against a smaller number of the enemy 's there be not i believe in the whole of the record of nelson 's opinion and action a single expression tend to show that tactical efficiency be consider by he to be due to superiority in size of individual ship of the same class or -- as far as _ matériel _ be concern -- to anything but superior number of course at the critical point he do not require and do not have more ship in he own fleet than the whole of those in the fleet of the enemy what he want be to bring to the point of impact when the fight begin a larger number of ship than be to be find in that part of the enemy 's line i believe that i be right in say that from the date of salami downward history record no decisive naval victory in which the victorious fleet have not succeed in concentrate against a relatively weak point in its enemy 's formation a greater number of its own ship i know of nothing to show that this have not be the rule throughout the age of which detailed history furnish we with any memorial -- no matter what the class of ship what the type of weapon what the mode of propulsion the rule certainly prevail in the battle of the 10th August 1904 off port arthur though it be not so overwhelmingly decisive as some other we may not even yet know enough of the sea fight in the strait of tsushima to be able to describe it in detail but we do know that at least some of the russian ship be defeat or destroy by a combination of japanese ship against they look back at the tactic of the trafalgar epoch we may see that the history of they confirm the experience of earlier war viz that victory do not necessarily fall to the side which have the biggest ship it be a well-known fact of naval history that generally the french ship be larger and the spanish much larger than the british ship of corresponding class this superiority in size certainly do not carry with it victory in action on the other hand british ship be generally bigger than the dutch ship with which they fight and it be of great significance that at camperdown the victory be due not to superiority in the size of individual ship but as show by the different list of kill and wound to the act of bring a larger number against a smaller all that we have be able to learn of the occurrence in the battle of the japan sea support instead of be oppose to this conclusion and it may be say that there be nothing tend to upset it in the previous history of the present war in the far east i do not know how far i be justified in expatiate on this point but as it may help to bring the strategy and tactic of the trafalgar epoch into practical relation with the stately science of which in we day this institution be as it be the mother-shrine and metropolitical temple i may be allow to dwell upon it a little longer the object aim at by those who favor great size of individual ship be not of course magnitude alone it be to turn out a ship which shall be more powerful than a individual antagonist all recent development of man-of-war construction have take the form of produce or at any rate try to produce a more powerful ship than those of earlier date or belong to a rival navy i know the issue that such statement be likely to raise and i ask you as naval architect to bear with I patiently when i say what i be go to say it be this : if you devise for the ship so produce the tactical system for which she be specially adapt you must in order to be logical base you system on she power of defeat she particular antagonist consequently you must abandon the principle of concentration of superior number against you enemy and what be more must be prepare to maintain that such concentration on he part against yourself would be ineffectual this will compel a reversion to tactical method which make a fleet action a series of duel between pair of combatant and -- a thing to be ponder on seriously -- never enable anyone to win a decisive victory on the sea the position will not be make more logical if you demand both superior size and also superior number because if you adopt the tactical system appropriate to one of the thing demand you will rule out the other you can not employ at the same time two different and opposed tactical system it be not necessary to the line of argument above indicate to ignore the merit of the battleship class like they predecessor the ship of the line it be really battleship which in a naval war dominate the situation we see that it be so at the time of trafalgar and we see that it have be so in the war between russium and japan at all event throughout the 1904 campaign the experience of naval war down to the close of that in which trafalgar be the most impressive event lead to the virtual abandonment of ship of the line -lrb- 92 -rrb- above and below a certain class the 64-gun ship and smaller two-decker have greatly diminish in number and repetition of they grow more and more rare it be the same with the three-decker which as the late admiral colomb point out continue to be build though in reduce number not so much for they tactical efficiency as for the convenient manner in which they meet the demand for the accommodation require in flag-ship the tactical condition which the naval architect of the trafalgar period have to meet be the employment of a increase number of two-decker of the medium class -lrb- footnote 92 : experience of war as regard increase in the number of medium-sized man-of-war of the different class tend to the same result in both the french revolutionary war -lrb- 1793 to 1801 -rrb- and the napoleonic war which begin in 1803 take both contest down to the end of the trafalgar year the follow table will show how great be the development of the line-of-battle-ship class below the three-decker and above the 64-gun ship it will also show that there be no development of but a relative decline in the three-decker and the 64 's the small addition where there be any be generally due to capture from the enemy the two-decker not ` fit to lie in a line ' be at the end of the trafalgar year about half what they be when the first period of the ` great war ' begin when we come to the frigate class we find the same result in the earlier war 11 frigate of 44 and 40 gun be introduce into we navy it be worth notice that this number be not increase and by the end of the trafalgar year have on the contrary decline to 10 the smallest frigate of 28 gun be 27 in 1793 and 13 at the end of the trafalgar year on the other hand the increase in the medium frigate class -lrb- 38 36 and 32 gun -rrb- be very large from 1793 to the end of the trafalgar year the 38-gun frigate increase from 8 to 50 and the 36-gun frigate from 16 to 54 ------------------------------------------------------------- | | | napoleonic war to | |

so the area move with it skilful disposition and manoeuvring add largely to the extent of sea within which the maritime interest that the fleet be mean to protect would be safe it seem reasonable to expect that it will be the same with modern fleet of suitable battleship the tactic of ` single ship action ' at the time of trafalgar be base upon pure seamanship back up by good gunnery the better a captain handle he ship the more likely he be to beat he antagonist superior speed where it exist be use to ` gain the weather gage ' not in order to get a suitable range for the faster ship 's gun but to compel she enemy to fight superior speed be also use to run away capacity to do which be not then and ought not to be now reckon a merit in a ship expressly construct for fight not flee it be sometimes claim in these day that superior speed will enable a modern ship to keep at a distance from she opponent which will be the best range for she own gun it have not be explain why a range which best suit she gun should not be equally favourable for the gun of she opponent unless indeed the latter be assume to be weakly arm in which case the distance at which the faster ship might engage she would be a matter of comparative indifference there be nothing in the tactic of the time of trafalgar to make it appear that -- when a fight have once begin -- superior speed of course within moderate limit confer any considerable tactical advantage in ` single ship action ' and still less in general or fleet action take up a position ahead or astern of a hostile ship so as to be able to rake she be not facilitate by originally superior speed so much as by the more damaged state of the ship to be rake -- rake as a rule occur rather late in a action a remarkable result of long experience of war make itself clearly apparent in the era of trafalgar i have already allude to the tendency to restrict the construction of line-of-battle ship to those of the medium class the same thing may be notice in the case of the frigate -lrb- 93 -rrb- those of 44 40 and 28 gun relatively or absolutely diminish in number whilst the number of the 38-gun 36-gun and 32-gun frigate increase the officer who have personal experience of many campaign be able to impress on the naval architect of the day the necessity of recognize the sharp distinction that really exist between what we should now call the ` battleship ' and what we should now call the ` cruiser ' in the earlier time there be ship which be intermediate between the ship of the line and the frigate these be the two-decker of 56 54 50 44 and even 40 gun they have long be regard as not ` fit to lie in a line ' and they be never count in the frigate class they seem to have hold a nondescript position for no one know exactly how to employ they in war any more than we now know exactly how to employ we armored cruiser as to which it be not settle whether they be fit for general action or should be confine to commerce defend or other cruiser service the two-decker just mention be look upon by the date of trafalgar as form a unnecessary class of fight ship some be employ chiefly because they exist on special service but they be be replace by true battleship on one side and true frigate on the other -lrb- 94 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 93 : see footnote 92 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 94 : see footnote 92 -rrb- in conclusion i would venture to say that the strategical and tactical lesson teach by a long series of naval campaign have be master by we navy by the time of the trafalgar campaign the effect of those lesson show itself in we ship-building policy and have be place on permanent record in the history of maritime achievement and of the adaptation of material mean to belligerent end xii the supply and communication of a fleet -lrb- 95 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 95 : write in 1902 -lrb- read at the hong-kong united service institution -rrb- -rrb- a problem which be not a attractive one but which have to be solve be to arrange the proper method of supply a fleet and maintain its communication in time of peace as well as in time of war there be a continuous consumption of the article of various kind use on board ship viz naval store ordnance store engineer ' store victual store coal water & c if we know the quantity of each description of store that a ship can carry and if we estimate the progressive consumption we can compute approximately but accurately enough for practical purpose the time at which replenishment would be necessary and to what amount it should be make up as a general rule ship stow about three month ' store and provision the amount of coal and engineer ' store measure in time depend on the proceedings of the ship and can only be calculate if we know during what portion of any given period she will be under way of course this can be only roughly estimate in peace time we know nearly exactly what the expenditure of ammunition within a give length of time -- say a quarter of a year -- will be for war condition we can only form a estimate base upon assumption the consumption of provision depend upon the number of officer and man and in war or peace would be much the same the greater activity to be expect in war would lead to more wear and tear and consequently to a larger expenditure of naval store in peaceful time the quarterly expenditure of ammunition do not vary materially in case we be at war a single action might cause we to expend in a few hour as much as half a dozen quarterly peace allowance there be a certain average number of day that a ship of a particular class be under way in a year and the difference between that number and 365 be of course the measure of the length of time she be at anchor or in harbor expenditure of coal and of some important article of engineer ' store depend on the relation between the time that she be stationary and the time she be under way it should be particularly note that the distinction be not between time at anchor and time at sea but between time at anchor and ` time under way ' if a ship leave she anchorage to run a engine-trial after refit or to fire at a target or to adjust compass or to go into dock -- she burn more coal than if she remain stationary these occasion of movement may be count in with the day in which the ship be at sea and the total take as the number of day under way it may be assume that altogether these will amount to six or seven a month in time of war the period under way would probably be much longer and the time spend in expectation of get under way in a hurry would almost certainly be considerable so that expenditure of coal and machinery lubricant would be greatly increase the point to be make here be that -- independently of strategic condition which will be consider later -- the difference in the supply of a give naval force in war and in peace be principally that in the former the requirement of nearly everything except provision will be greater and consequently that the article must be forward in larger quantity or at shorter interval than in peace time if therefore we have arrange a satisfactory system of peace supply that system -- defense of the line of communication be leave out of consideration for the present -- will merely have to be expand in time of war in other word practice in the use of the system during peace will go a long way towards prepare we for the duty of work it under war condition that a regular system will be absolutely indispensable during hostility will not be doubt the general principle which i propose to indicate be applicable to any station we may allow for a squadron compose of -- 4 battleship 4 large cruiser 4 second-class cruiser 13 smaller vessel of various kind and 3 destroyer be away from the principal base-port of the station for several month of the year the number of officer and man would be in round number about 10000 in estimate the amount of store of different kind require by men-of-war it be necessary -- in order to allow for proper means of conveyance -- to convert ton of dead-weight into ton by measurement as the two be not always exactly equivalent in the follow enumeration only estimate amount be state and the figure be to be consider as approximate and not precise it be likely that in each item a expert maybe able to discover some variation from the rigorously exact but the general result will be sufficiently accurate for practical purpose especially as experience will suggest correction a thousand man require about 31 ton of victual store package include daily we may make this figure up to 35 ton to allow for ` medical comfort ' and canteen store consequently 10000 man require about 35 ton a day and about 6300 ton for six month the assume squadron judge from experience would require in peace time about 600 ton of engineer ' store about 400 ton of naval store and -- if the ship start with only they exact allowance on board and then carry out a full quarterly practice twice -- the quantity of ordnance store and ammunition require would be about 1140 ton to meet the ordinary peace rate of expenditure we thus get for a full six month ' supply the follow figure : -- victual store 6300 ton engineer ' store 600 naval store 400 ordnance store and ammunition 1140 ----- total 8440 some allowance must be make for the need of the ` auxiliary ' -lrb- 96 -rrb- the vessel that bring supplies and in other way attend on the fight ship this may be put at 7 per cent the tonnage require would accordingly amount in all to about 9000 -lrb- footnote 96 : the 7 per cent mention in the text would probably cover nearly all the demand -- except coal -- of auxiliary which would not require much or any ammunition coal be provide for separately -rrb- the squadron would burn in harbor or when stationary about 110 ton of coal a day and when under way about 1050 ton a day for 140 harbour-day the consumption would be about 15400 ton and for 43 day under way about 45150 : so that for coal requirement we should have the following : -- harbor consumption 15400 ton under-way consumption 45150 ------ total for fight ship 60550 7 per cent for auxiliary -lrb- say -rrb- 4250 ------ grand total 64800 some time ago -lrb- in 1902 -rrb- a representation be make from the china station that engine-room oil be expend whenever coal be expend there must be some proportion between the quantity of each it be therefore suggest that every collier should bring to the squadron which she be supply a proportionate quantity of oil this have be approve and it have be order that the proportion will be 75 gallon of oil to every 100 ton of coal -lrb- 97 -rrb- it be also suggest that the oil should be carry in cask of two size for the convenience of both large and small ship -lrb- footnote 97 : i be inform -lrb- on the 10th December 1902 -rrb- some time after the above be write that the collier supply the united state navy be go to carry 100 gallon of oil for every 100 ton of coal -rrb- there be another commodity which ship have never be able to do without and which they need now in higher proportion than ever that commodity be fresh water the squadron constitute as assume would require a average of about 160 ton of fresh water a day and nearly 30000 ton in six month of this the ship without add very inconveniently to they coal consumption might themselves distil about one-half but the remain 15000 ton would have to be bring to they and another thousand ton would probably be want by the auxiliary make the full six month ' demand up to 16000 ton the tonnage requirement of the squadron and its ` auxiliary ' for a full six month ' period would be about 74000 without fresh water as however the ship would have start with full store-room hold and bunker and might be expect to return to the principal base-port of the station at the end of the period store for four-and-a-half month ' and coal to meet twenty week ' consumption would be sufficient these would be about 6750 ton of store and ammunition and 46000 ton of coal -lrb- 98 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 98 : to avoid complicate the question the water or distil vessel the hospital ship and the repair vessel have not be consider specially they coal and store have be allow for -rrb- the store & c would have to be replenish twice and -- as it would not be prudent to let the ship run right out of they -- replenishment should take place at the end of the second and at the end of the fourth month two vessel carry store and ammunition if capable of transport a cargo of nearly 1700 ton apiece would bring all that be want at each replenishment to diminish risk of lose all of one description of supplies if carry by itself in a separate vessel it have be consider desirable that each supply-carrier when employ be to contain some ammunition some store and some provision there be great advantage in have supply-carrier include of course collier of moderate size many officer must have have experience of the inconvenience and delay due to the employment of a single very large vessel which could only coal one man-of-war at a time several vessel each carry a moderate amount of cargo would permit much more rapid replenishment of the ship of a squadron the inconvenience that would be cause by the loss or breakdown of a supply-carrier would be reduce by employ several vessel of moderate cargo-capacity instead of only one or two of great capacity each battleship and large cruiser of the assume squadron may be expect to burn about 1000 ton of coal in five week so that the quantity to be use in that time by all those ship would be 8000 ton the remain ship scatter between different place as most of they would probably be would require about 3500 ton therefore every five week or so 11500 ton of coal would be require four replenishment would be necessary in the whole period make a total of 46000 ton each replenishment could be convey in five collier with 2300 ton apiece moderate dimension in store - and coal-carrier would prove convenient not only because it would facilitate take in store and coal if all the squadron be assemble at one place but also if part be at one place and part at another division into several vessel instead of concentration in a few would give great flexibility to the system of supply a single very capacious cargo-carrier might have to go first to one place and supply the ship there and then go to supply the remain ship lie at another anchorage this would cause loss of time the same amount of cargo distribute amongst two or more vessel would permit the ship at two or more place to be supply simultaneously you may have notice that i have be deal with the question as though store and coal be to be transport direct to the men-of-war wherever they might be and put straight on board they from the carrying-vessel there be as you all know another method which may be describe as that of ` secondary basis ' speaking generally each of we naval station have a principal base at which considerable or even extensive repair of the ship can be effect and at which store be accumulate visit to it for the sake of repair be necessary the occasion may be take advantage of to replenish supplies so that the maintenance of a stock at the place make for convenience provide that the stock be not too large the so-called ` secondary base ' be a place at which it be intend to keep in store coal and other article in the hope that when war be in progress the supply of we ship may be facilitate it be a supply and not a repair base a comparison of the ` direct ' system and ` secondary base ' system may be interesting a navy be maintain for use in war it follow as a matter of course that the value of any part of its equipment or organization depend on its efficiency for war purpose the question to be answer be -- which of the two system promise to help we most during hostility this do not exclude a regard for convenience and economy in time of peace provide that care be take not to push economy too far and not to make ordinary peace-time convenience impede arrangement essential to the proper conduct of a naval campaign it be universally admit that a secondary base at which stock of store be keep should be properly defend this necessitate the provision of fortification and a garrison nearly every article of naval store of all class have to be bring to we basis by sea just as much as if it be bring direct to we ship consequently the communication of the base have to be defend they would continue to need defend even if we ship cease to draw supplies from it because the communication of the garrison must be keep open we know what happen twice over at minorca when the latter be not do the object of accumulate store at a secondary base be to facilitate the supply of fight ship it be rather confidently assume that the ship can go to it to replenish without be oblige to absent themselves for long from the position in which they could best counteract the effort of the enemy when war be go on it be not within the power of either side to arrange its movement exactly as it please movement must at all event very often conform to those of the enemy it be not a bad rule when go to war to give you enemy credit for a certain amount of good sense we enemy 's good sense be likely to lead he to do exactly what we wish he not to do and not to do that which we wish he to do we should of course like he to operate so that we ship will not be employ at a inconvenient distance from we base of supplies if we have create permanent basis in time of peace the enemy will know they whereabouts as well as we do ourselves and unless he be a greater fool than it be safe to think he be he will try to make we derive as little benefit from they as possible he be likely to extend he operation to locality at a distance from the place to which if we have the secondary base system of supply he know for certain that we ship must resort we shall have to do one of two thing -- either let he carry on he operation undisturbed or conform to he movement to this be due the common if not invariable experience of naval warfare that the fleet which assume the offensive have to establish what be sometimes call ` fly basis ' to which it can resort at will this explain why nelson rarely use gibraltar as a base why we occupy balaclava in 1854 and why the american use guantanamo bay in 1898 the fly base be not fortify or garrison in advance it be merely a convenient anchorage in a good position as regard the circumstance of the war and it can be abandon for another and resume if desirable as the condition of the moment dictate it be often argue that maintenance of stock of store at a secondary base give a fleet a free hand and at least relieve it from the obligation of defend the line of communication we ought to examine both contention it be not easy to discover where the freedom come in if you must always proceed to a certain place for supplies whether convenient or not it may be and very likely will be of the utmost importance in war for a ship to remain on a particular station if she coal be run short and can only be replenish by go to a base go to the base she must however unfortunate the consequence it have be mention already that nearly every item on we store list have to be bring to a base by sea let we ascertain to what extent the accumulation of a stock at a place remove the necessity of defend the communication line coal be so much the greater item that consideration of it will cover that of all the rest the squadron as assume require about 11500 ton of coal every five week in peace time some be commonly obtain from contractor at foreign port but to avoid complicate the subject we may leave contract issue out of consideration if you keep a stock of 10000 ton at you permanent secondary base you will have enough to last you ship about four-and-a-half week consequently you must have a stream of collier run to the place so as to arrive at interval of not more than about thirty day calculation found on the experience of maneuver show that in war time ship would require nearly three time the quantity use in peace it follow that if you treble you stock of coal at the base and make it 30000 ton you would in war still require collier carry that amount to arrive about every four week picture the line of communication with the necessary collier on it and see to what extent you be release from the necessity of defend it the bulk of other store be much less than that of coal you could no doubt maintain a sufficient stock of they to last through the probable duration of the war but as you must keep you communication open to ensure the arrival of you coal it would be as easy for the other store to reach you as it would be for the coal itself why oblige yourself to use article keep long in store when much fresher one could be obtain therefore the maintenance of store depot at a secondary base no more release you from the necessity of guard you communication than it permit freedom of movement to you ship the secondary base in time of war be condition as follow if the enemy 's sphere of activity be distant from the base which you have equip with store-house and fortification the place can not be of any use to you it can and probably will be a cause of additional anxiety to you because the communication of its garrison must still be keep open if it be use freedom of movement for the ship must be give up because they can not go so far from it as to be oblige to consume a considerable fraction of they coal in reach it and return to they station the line along which you collier proceed to it must be effectively guard contrast this with the system of direct supply to the ships-of-war you choose for you fly base a position which will be as near to the enemy 's sphere of action as you choose to make it you can change its position in accordance with circumstance if you cease to use the position first choose you need trouble yourself no more about its special communication you leave nothing at it which will make it worth the enemy 's while to try a dash at it the power of change the fly base from one place to another give almost perfect freedom of movement to the fight ship moreover the defense of the line communicate with the position select be not more difficult than that of the line to a fixed base the defense of a line of communication ought to be arrange on the same plan as that adopt for the defense of a trade route viz make unceasing effort to attack the intend assailant within the last few year a good deal have be write about the employment of cruiser the favorite idea seem to be that peace-time preparation for the cruiser operation of war ought to take the form of scout and attendance on fleet the history of naval warfare do not corroborate this view we need not forget nelson 's complaint of paucity of frigate : but have the number attach to he fleet be double the general disposition of vessel of the class then in commission would have be virtually unaltered at the beginning of 1805 the year of trafalgar we have -- besides other class -- 232 frigate and sloop in commission at the beginning of 1806 we have 264 it be doubtful if forty of these be attach to fleet it be sometimes contend that supply-carrier ought to be vessel of great speed apparently in order that they may always keep up with the fight ship when at sea this perhaps be due to a mistaken application of the condition of a land force on the march to those of a fleet or squadron make a voyage in practice a land army can not separate itself -- except for a very short time -- from its supplies its movement depend on those of its supply-train the corresponding ` supply-train ' of a fleet or squadron be in the hold and bunker of its ship as long as these be fairly well furnish the ship might be hamper and could not be assist by the presence of the carrier all that be necessary be that these carrier should be at the right place at the right time which be merely another way of say that proper provision should be make for ` the stream of supplies and reinforcement which in term of modern war be call communication ' -- the phrase be mahan 's the efficiency of any arrangement use in war will depend largely on the experience of its work gain in time of peace why do we not work the direct system of supply whilst we be at peace so as to familiarise ourselves with the operation it entail before the stress of serious emergency be upon we there be two reason one be because we have use the permanent base method so long that as usually happen in such case we find it difficult to form a conception of any other the other reason be that the direct supply method be think to be too costly the first reason need not detain we it be not worthy of even a few minute ' consideration the second reason deserve full investigation we ought to be always alive to the necessity of economy the only limit to economy of money in any plan of naval organization be that we should not carry it so far that it will be likely to impair efficiency those who be familiar with the correspondence of the great sea-officer of former day will have notice how careful they be to prevent anything like extravagant expenditure this inclination towards a proper parsimony of naval fund become traditional in we service the tradition have perhaps be rather weaken in these day of abundant wealth but we should do we best not to let it die out extravagance be a serious foe to efficient organization because where it prevail there be a temptation to try imperfectly thought-out experiment in the belief that if they fail there will still be plenty of money to permit other to be try this of course encourage slovenly want of system which be destructive of good organization we may assume for the purpose of we investigation that we permanently equip secondary base contain a stock of 10000 ton of coal any proportionate quantity however may be substitute for this as the general argument will remain unaffected as already intimate coal be so much greater in bulk and aggregate cost than any other class of store that if we arrange for its supply the provision of the rest be a comparatively small matter the squadron which we have have in view require a estimated amount of 46000 ton of coal in six month ' period specify and a further quantity of 4600 ton may be expect to suffice for the ship employ in the neighbouring water during the remainder of the year this latter amount would have to be bring in smaller cargo say five of 920 ton each allow for the collier require during the six month whilst the whole squadron have to be supply a average cargo of 2300 ton we should want twenty arrival with a aggregate of 46000 ton and later on five arrival of smaller collier with a aggregate of 4600 ton to complete the year the freight or cost of conveyance to the place need not be consider here as it would be the same in either system if we keep a stock of supplies at a place we must incur expenditure to provide for the storage of the article there would be what may be call the capital charge for site building residence jetty tram line & c for which # 20000 would probably not be enough but we may put it at that so as to avoid the appearance of exaggeration a further charge would be due to the provision of tug or steam launch and perhaps lighter this would hardly be less than # 15000 interest on money sink cost of repair and maintenance would not be excessive if they amount to # 3500 a year there must be some allowance for the coal use by the tug and steam launch it be doubtful if # 500 a year would cover this but we may put it at that salary and wages of staff include person employ in tug and steam launch would reach quite # 2500 a year it be to be note that the item which these charge be assume to cover can not be dispense with if depot be establish at all they must be so arrange that the store deposit in they can be securely keep and can be utilise with proper expedition the total of the charge just enumerate be # 6500 a year there be other charge that can not be escape for example landing a ton of coal at wei-hai-wei put it into the depot and take it off again to the man-of-war require it cost $ 1 20 cent or at average official rate of exchange two shilling at hong-kong the cost be about 2s 5d a ton the charge at 2s per ton on 50600 ton would be # 5060 i be assure by every engineer officer to whom i have speak on the subject that the deterioration in coal due to the four different handling which it have to undergo if land in lighter and take off again to ship from the coal-store can not be put at less than 10 per cent note that this be over and above such deterioration as would be due to pass coal direct from the hold of a collier alongside into a ship 's bunker if anyone doubt this deterioration it would be well for he to examine report on coal and steam trial he will be unusually fortunate if he find so small a deterioration as 10 per cent the lowest that i can remember have see report be 20 per cent report of 30 and even 40 per cent be quite common some of it be for deterioration due to climate and length of time in store this of course be one of the inevitable condition of the secondary base system the object of which be to keep in stock a quantity of the article need put the purchase price of the coal as low as 15 a ton a deterioration due to repeat handle only of 10 per cent on 50600 ton would amount to # 3795 there be nearly always some loss of coal due to move it i say ` nearly always ' because it seem that there be occasion on which coal be move increase in bulk it occur when competitive coaling be be carry on in a fleet and ship try to beat record a collier in these circumstance give out more coal than she take in we shall probably be right if we regard the increase in this case as what the german philosopher call ` subjective ' that be rather existent in the mind than in the external region of objective palpable fact it may be take as hardly disputable that there will be less loss the shorter the distance and the fewer the time the coal be move without count it we see that the annual expense enumerate be -- establishment charge # 6500 landing and re-shipping 5060 deterioration 3795 ------- # 15355 this # 15355 be to be compare with the cost of the direct supply system the quantity of coal require would as say above have to be carry in twenty collier -- count each trip as that of a separate vessel -- with on the average 2300 ton apiece and five smaller one it would take fully four day to unload 2300 ton at the secondary base and even more if the labor supply be uncertain or the labourer not well practice demurrage for a vessel carry the cargo mention judge from actual experience would be about # 32 a day and probably about # 16 a day for the smaller vessel if we admit a average delay per collier of eighteen day that be fourteen day more than the time necessary for remove the cargo into store so as to allow for collier arrive when the ship to be coal be absent we should get -- 20 x 14 x 32 # 8960 5 x 14 x 16 1120 ------- # 10080 as the cost of transfer the coal from the hold to the man-of-war 's bunker on the direct supply system a average of eighteen day be probably much too long to allow for each collier 's stay till clear : because on some occasion ship require coal may be count on as sure to be present even as it be the # 10080 be a smaller sum than the # 11560 which the secondary base system cost over and above the amount due to increase deterioration of coal if a comparison be institute as regard other kind of store the particular figure might be different but the general result would be the same the first thing that we have get to do be to rid we mind of the belief that because we see a supply-carrier lie at anchor for some day without be clear more money be be spend than be spend on the maintenance of a shore depot there may be circumstance in which a secondary base be a necessity but they must be rare and exceptional we see that the establishment of one do not help we in the matter of defend we communication we now see that so far from be more economical than the alternative method the secondary base method be more costly it might have be demonstrate that it be really much more costly than the figure give make it out to be because ship oblige to go to a base must expend coal in do so and coal cost money it be not surprising that consideration of the secondary base system should evoke a recollection of the expression apply by dryden to the militia of he day : in peace a charge in war a weak defense i have to say that i do not prepare this paper simply for the pleasure of read it or in order to bring before you mere set of figure and estimate of expense my object have be to arouse in some of the officer who hear I a determination to devote a portion of they leisure to the consideration of those great problem which must be solve by we if we be to wage war successfully many proof reach I of the ability and zeal with which detail of material be investigate by officer in these day the detail refer to be not unimportant in themselves but the importance of several of they if put together would be incomparably less than that of the great question to which i have try to direct you attention the supply of a fleet be of high importance in both peace time and time of war even in peace it sometimes cause a admiral to pass a sleepless night the arrangement which it necessitate be often intricate and success in complete they occasionally seem far off the work involve in devise suitable plan be too much like drudgery to be welcome to those who undertake it all the same it have to be do : and surely no one will care to deny that the fleet which have practice in quiet year the system that must be follow in war will start with a great advantage on its side when it be at last confront with the stern reality of naval warfare postscript the question of ` communication ' if fully deal with in the foregoing paper would have make it so long that its hearer might have be tire out before its end be reach the follow summary of the point that might have be enlarged upon have time allow may interest many officer : -- in time of war we must keep open we line of communication if we can not the war will have go against we open communication mean that we can prevent the enemy from carry out decisive and sustained operation against they and along they line to keep communication open it be not necessary to secure every friendly ship traverse the line against attack by the enemy all that be necessary be to restrict the enemy 's activity so far that he can inflict only such a moderate percentage of loss on the friendly vessel that as a whole they will not cease to run keep communication open will not secure a friendly place against every form of attack it will however secure a place against attack with large force sustain for a considerable length of time if he can make attack of this latter kind it be clear that the enemy control the communication and that we have fail to keep they open if communication be open for the passage of vessel of the friendly mercantile marine it follow that the relatively much smaller number of supply-vessel can traverse the line as regard supply-vessel a percentage of loss cause by the enemy must be allow for if we put this at 10 per cent -- which take absolutely be probably sufficient -- it mean that _ on_the _ _ average _ out of ten supply-vessel send we expect nine to reach they destination we can not however arrange that a equal loss will fall on every group of ten vessel two such group may arrive intact whilst a third may lose three vessel yet the 10 per cent average would be maintain this condition have to be allow for investigation some year ago lead to the conclusion that it would be prudent to send five carrier for every four want the word ` group ' have be use above only in a descriptive sense supply-carrier will often be safer if they proceed to they destination separately this however depend on
