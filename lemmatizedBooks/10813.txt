mysterious atmosphere figure loom mistily then vanish into the gloom but we get no more than a vague impression of we surroundings throughout the interminable length of drive across the city and the subsequent slow train journey we thought be ever in advance the tardy winter daylight have scarcely come before we be jolting in a _ fiacre _ over the stony street of versaille in the gutter crone be eagerly rummage among the dust heap that await removal in france no degradation attach to open economy housewife on they way to fetch gargantuan loaf or tiny bottle of milk for the matutinal _

perfunctorily turn over the scrap with the point of he cane we have hear of a hotel and the first thing we see of it we like that be a pair of sabot on the mat at the foot of the staircase pause only to remove the dust of travel we set off to visit we son walk with timorous haste along the grand old avenue where the school be situate a little casement window to the left of the wide entrance-door

to visit he so we be thankful too chapter ii ogam -lrb- illustration : perpetual motion -rrb- we hotel be distinctively french and immensely comfortable in that it have glean and still retain the creature comfort of a century or two thus it combine the luxury of hot-air radiator and electric light with the enchantment of open wood fire view externally the building present that airy aspect almost universal in versaille architecture it be white-tinted with many window shutter without and heavily lace-draped within a wide entrance lead to the inner courtyard where orange tree in green tub and trelliswork with shrivel stem and leave still adhering suggest that it would be a pleasant summer lounge we hotel boast a _ grand salon _ which open from the courtyard it be a elaborately ornate room but on a chilly December day even a plethora of embellishment can not be trust to raise by a single degree the temperature of the apartment it adorn and the soul turn from a cold hearth however radiant its garnish of artificial blossom a private parlor be scarcely necessary for with most french bedroom ours share the composite nature of the accommodation know in a certain class of advertisement as bed-sitting-room so it be that during these winter day we make ourselves at home in we chamber the shape of the room be a geometrical problem the three window each reveal different view and the remainder of the wall curve amazingly at first sight the furniture consist mainly of drapery and looking-glass for the room though of ordinary dimension own three large mirror and nine pair of curtain a stately bed endowed with a huge square down pillow which serve as quilt stand in a corner two armchair in brocaded velvet and a center table be addition to the customary article a handsome timepiece and a quartette of begilt candelabrum deck the white marble mantelpiece and be duplicated in the large pier glass the floor be of well-polished wood a strip of bright-hued carpet before the bed a second before the washstand its only covering need i say that the provision for ablutions be one basin and a liliputian ewer and that there be not a fix bath in the establishment it be a resting-place full of incongruity but apart from or perhaps because of its oddity it have a cosy attractiveness from the moment of we entrance we feel at home i think the log that purr and crackle on the hearth have much to do with its air of welcome there be a sense of companionship about a wood fire that more enduring coal lack like a delicate child the very care it demand nurture you affection there be something delightfully foreign and picturesque to we town idea in the heap of log that karl carry up in a great _ panier _ and pile at the side of the hearth even the little faggot of kindling wood willow-knotted and with the dry copper-tinted leaf still cling to the twig have a rustic charm these be pleasant moment when ascend from the chill outer air we find we chamber aglow with ruddy firelight that glint in the mirror and sparkle on the shine surface of the polished floor when we draw we chair up to the hearth and scorn the electric light revel in the beauty of the leap and dart flame it be only in the _ salle-à-manger _ that we see the other occupant of the hotel and when we learn that several of they have live _ en pension _ under the roof of the assiduous proprietor for period vary from five to seven year we feel ephemeral mere creature of a moment and wholly unworthy of regard -lrb- illustration : ursa major -rrb- at eight o'clock karl bring the _ petit déjeûner _ of coffee and roll to we room at eleven we morning visit to the school hospital over we breakfast in the _ salle-à-manger _ a large bright room one or other of whose many south window have almost daily even in the depth of winter to be shaded against the ray of the sun three chandelier of glittering crystal star with electric light depend from the ceiling half a dozen small table stand down each side four larger one occupy the center of the floor and be reserve for transient custom the first thing that strike we as peculiar be that every table save ours be lay for a single person with a half bottle of wine red or white place ready in accordance with the known preference of the expect guest we soon gather that several of the regular customer lodge outside and accord to the french fashion visit the hotel for meal only after the early day of keen anxiety regard we invalid have pass we begin to study we fellow guest individually and to note they idiosyncrasy sit at we allotted table during the progress of the leisurely meal we use to watch as one _ habitué _ after another enter and hang coat and hat upon certain peg sit silently down in he accustomed place with a unvarying air of calm deliberation then iorson the swift-footed _ garçon _ would skim over the polished board to the newcomer and tender the menu would wait pencil in hand until the guest after careful contemplation select he five _ plat _ from its comprehensive list -lrb- illustration : meal consideration -rrb- the most picturesque man of the company have white moustache of surprising length on cold day he appear envelop in a fur coat a garment of shaggy brown which in conjunction with he hirsute countenance make he aspect suggest the hero in pantomime rendering of beauty and the beast but in we hotel there be no beauty unless indeed it be yvette and yvette could hardly be term beautiful yvette also live outside she do not come to _ déjeûner _ but every night precisely at a quarter-past seven the farther door would open and yvette she face express disgust with the world and all the thing thereof would enter yvette be blonde with neat little feature a pale complexion and tiny hand that be always ringless she ring the change on half a dozen handsome cloak of different degree of warmth to a intelligent observer they wear might have serve as a thermometer yvette be _ blasée _ and she millinery be in sympathy with she feeling she hat have all a fringe of disconsolate feather whose melancholy plumage emphasise the downward curve of she mouth to see yvette enter from the darkness and seat herself at she solitary table droop over she plate as though there be nothing in versaille worth sit upright for be to view _ ennui _ personify yvette invariably drink white wine and the food rarely pleased she she would cast a contemptuous look over the menu offer by the deferential henrus then turn wearily away esteem that no item on its length merit even she most perfunctory consideration but after one or two despondent glance yvette ever make the best of a bad bargain and order quite a comprehensive little dinner which she eat with the same air of utter disdain she always conclude by eat a orange dip in sugar even have a special table not be reserve for she one could have tell where yvette have dine by the bowl of powdered sugar just as one could have locate the man with the fierce moustache and the fur coat by the presence of he pepper-mill or the place of madame from she prodigal habit of rend a quarter-yard of the crusty french bread in twain and consume only the soft inside from the ignorance of we cursory acquaintance we have judge the french a sociable nation we stay at versaille speedily convinced we of the fallacy of that belief nothing could have impressed we so forcibly as do the frigid silence that characterise the company many of they have feed there daily for year yet within the wall of the sunny dining-room none exchange even a salutation this unexpected taciturnity in a people whom we have be teach to regard as lively and voluble make we almost ashamed of we own garrulity and when in the presence of the silent company we be tempt to exchange remark we find ourselves do it in hushed voice as though we be in church a clearer knowledge however show we that though some unspoken convention render the hotel guest oblivious of each other 's presence while indoors beyond the hotel wall they might hold communion two retired military man both wear the red ribbon of the legion of honor as indeed do most of we _ habitués _ sit at adjacent table one tall and thin be a colonel the other little and neat a colonel also to the casual gaze they appear complete stranger and we have consume many meal in they society before observe that whenever the tall colonel have suck the last cerise from he glass of _ eau-de-vie _ and begin to fold he napkin -- a formidable task for the serviette fully deserve the designation later bestow on they by the boy of young table-cloth -- the little colonel make haste to fold he also both rise from they chair at the same instant and the twain have receive they hat from the attentive iorson vanish still mute into the darkness together -lrb- illustration : the two colonel -rrb- once to we consternation the little colonel replace he napkin in its ring without wait for the signal from the tall colonel but we apprehension that they in they dealings in that mysterious outer world which twice daily they seek together might have fall into a difference of opinion be dispel by the little colonel who have rise step to he friend and hold out he hand this the tall colonel without withdraw he eye from _ le journal des débats _ which he be read silently press then still without a word speak or a look exchange the little colonel pass out alone -lrb- illustration : the young and brave -rrb- the average age of the ogam be seventy true there be dunoi the young and brave who could not have be more than forty-five what he name really be we know not but something in he comparatively juvenile appearance among the chevalier suggest the appellation which for lack of a better we retain dunoi ' youth might only be comparative but he bravery be indubitable for who among the ogam but he be daring enough to tackle the _ pâté-de-foie-gras _ or the _ abatti _ a stew compose of the gizzard and liver of fowl and who but dunoi would have be so reckless as to follow baked mussel and _ crépinettes _ with _ rognon frit _ dunoi too reveal intrepid leaning toward strange liquor sometimes -- it be usually at _ déjeûner _ when he have dine out on the previous evening -- he would demand the wine-list of iorson and reject the _ vin blanc _ or _ vin rouge _ which be _ compri _ contented the other would order himself something of a choice brand one of he favorite papers be _ le rire _ and henrus iorson 's youthful assistant regard he with admiration -lrb-

period she sole exercise have be take in slowly descend from she chamber in the upper region for she meal and then leisurely assimilation complete in yet more slowly ascend madame 's allotted seat be place in close proximity to the hot-air register and though madame be usually one of the first to enter the dining-room she be generally the last to leave madame 's appetite be as animated as she body be lethargic she always drink she half-bottle of red wine to the dregs and she invariably conclude with a greengage in brandy so it be small marvel that when at last she leave she chair to tortoise upstairs she complexion should be two shades darker than when she descend five dish irrespective of _ hors d'oeuvre _ at luncheon and _ potage _ at dinner be allow each guest and madame 's selection be a affair of time we hotel be justly note for its _ cuisine _ yet on infrequent occasion the food supply to madame be not to she mind at these time the whole establishment suffer until the irascible old lady 's taste be suit one night at dinner iorson have the misfortune to serve madame with some turkey that fail to meet with she approval with the air of a insult empress madame order its removal the conciliatory iorson obediently carry off the dish and speedily return bear what profess to be another portion but from the glimpse we get as it pass we table we have a shrewd suspicion that iorson the wily have merely turn over the piece of turkey and re-serve it with a little more gravy and a additional dress of _ cresson _ madame it transpire share we suspicion for this portion also she decline with renew indignation then follow a long period of wait wherein madame fidget restlessly on she seat keep fierce eye fix on the door through which the viand enter just as she impatience threaten to vent itself in action iorson appear bear a third help of turkey place it before the irate lady he flee as though determine to debar a third repudiation for a moment a air of triumph pervaded madame 's feature then she begin to gesticulate violently with the evident intention of again attract iorson 's notice but the forbearance even of the diplomatic iorson be at a end re-double he attention to the diner at the farther side of the room he remain resolutely unconscious of madame 's signal which be rapidly become frantic the less sophisticated henrus however feel a boyish interest in the little comedy could not resist a curious glance in madame 's direction that be sufficient wave imperiously madame compel he approach and move reluctantly fearful of the issue henrus advance couteau hiss madame henri fly to fetch the desire implement and realize that madame have at last be satisfy we again breathe freely a more attractive personage be a typical old aristocrat officer of the legion of honor who use to enter walk with great dignity to he table eat sparingly of one or two dish drink a glass of he _ vin ordinaire _ and retire sometimes he be accompany by a tiny spaniel which occupy a chair beside he and frequently a middle-aged son whose bourgeois appearance be in amazing contrast to that of he refined old father attend he -lrb- illustration : the aristocrat -rrb- there be other less interesting perhaps but equally self-absorbed one afternoon enter the cable car that run -- for fun apparently as it rarely boast a passenger -- to and from the trianon we recognize in its sole occupant a ogam who during the week of we stay have eat in evident oblivion of he human surroundings at the table next to ours forget that we be without the wall of silence we expect no greet but to we amazement he rise and place himself opposite we converse affably and in most excellent english for the rest of the journey to speak with he be to discover a courteous and travel gentleman yet during we stay in versaille we never know he exchange even a bow with any of he fellow ogam who be man of like qualification though as he tell we he have take he meal in the hotel for over five year early in the year we peace be rudely break by the advent of a commercial man -- a short grey-haired being of a activity so foreign to we usage that a feeling of unrest be impart to the _ salle-à-manger _ throughout he stay he movement be distractingly erratic in he opinion meal be thing to be treat casually to be consume haphazard at any hour that chance to suit he do not enter the dining-room at the exact moment each day as do the ogam he would rush in throw he hat on a peg devour some food with unseemly haste and depart in less time than it take the other to reach the _ légumes _ -lrb- illustration : papa mama et bébé -rrb- he be hospitable too and have a disconcerting way of invite guest to luncheon or dinner and then forget that he have do so one morning a stranger enter and after a brief conference with iorson be conduct to the commercial man 's table to await he arrival the regular customer take they wonted place and begin in they leisurely fashion to breakfast and still the visitor sit alone start up expectantly every time a door open then despondently resume he seat at last iorson take compassion urge the neglect guest to while away he period of wait by trifle with the _ hors-d'oeuvre _ he be proceed to allay the pang of hunger with selection from the tray of anchovy sardine pickle beet and sliced sausage when he host enter voluble and irrepressible as ever the dignified ogam shudder inwardly as he strident voice awake the echo of the room and they already stiff limb become rigid with disapproval in winter transient visitor but rarely occupy one or other of the square center table though not infrequently a proud father and mother who have come to visit a soldier son at the barracks bring he to the hotel for a meal and for a space the radiance of blue and scarlet and the glint of steel cast a military glamour over the staid company a amusing little circumstance to we onlooker be that although the supply of cook food seem equal to any demand the arrival of even a trio of unexpected guest to dinner invariably cause a dearth of bread for on they advent iorson would dash out bareheaded into the night to reappear in a incredibly short time carry a loaf nearly as tall as himself one morning a stalwart young briton bring to breakfast a pretty english cousin on leave of absence from she boarding-school he knowledge of french be limit when anything be want he shout garçon in a lordly voice but it be the pretty cousin who give the order _ déjeûner _ over they depart in the direction of the château and at sunset as we chance to stroll along the boulevard de la reine we see the pretty cousin all the gaiety flee from she face bidding she escort farewell at the gate of a pension pour demoiselle the ball be over poor little cinderellum be perforce return to the dust and ash of learning -lrb- illustration : juvenile progress -rrb- chapter iii the town the english-speaking traveller find versaille vastly more foreign than the antipode he may voyage for many week and at each distant stopping-place find he own tongue speak around he and he convention govern society but let he leave london one night cross the channel at its narrowest -- and most turbulent -- and sunrise will find he a alien in a land whose denizen differ from he in language temperament dress food manners and custom of a former visit to versaille we have retain little more than the usual tourist 's recollection of a hurry run through a palace of fatiguing magnificence a confusing peep at the trianon a glance around the gorgeous state equipage a unsatisfactory meal at one of the open-air _ cafés _ and a scamper back to pari but we winter residence in the quaint old town reveal to we the existence of a life that be all its own -- a life widely variant in its calm repose from the bustle and gaiety of the capital but one that be replete with charm and abound in picturesque-interest -lrb- illustration : automoblesse oblige -rrb- versaille be not ancient it be old completely old since the fall of the second empire it have stand still most of the clock have run down as though they realize the futility of try to keep pace with the rest of the world the future merge into the present the present fade into the past and still the clock of versaille point to the same long eventide -lrb- illustration : sable garb -rrb- the proximity of pari be evince only by the vividly tint automobile that make versaille they goal even they rarely tarry in the old town but turn at the château gate lose no time in retrace they impetuous flight towards a city whose usage accord better with they creed of feverish hurry-scurry than do the convention of reposeful versaille and these fiery chariot of modernity with they ghoulish fur-garbed and hideously spectacled occupant once they raucous cigale-like birr-r-r have die away in the distance leave infinitely less impression on the placid life of versaille than do they wheel on the road they traverse under the grand tree of the wide avenue the townsfolk move quietly about busy themselves with they own affair and practise they little economy as they have be do any time during the last century perhaps it be the emphatic and demonstrative nature of the mourning wear that give we the idea that the better-class female population of versaille consist chiefly of widow when walk abroad we seem incessantly to encounter widow : widow young and old from the aged to the absurdly immature it be only after a period of bewilderment that it dawn upon we that the sepulchral garb and heavy crape veil reach from head to heel be not necessarily the emblem of widowhood but might signify some state of minor bereavement in britain a display of black such as be a everyday sight at versaille be undreamt of and one see more crape veil in a day in versaille than in london in a week little girl though they leg might be uncover have they chubby feature shroud in disfigure gauze and to we unaccustomed foreign eye a genuine widow represent nothing more shapely than a more or less stubby pillar festoon with crape but for a inborn conviction that a frugal race like the french would not invest in a plethora of mourning garb only to cast it aside after a few month ' wear and that therefore the period of wear the willow must be greatly protracted we would have be haunt by the idea that the adult male mortality of versaille be enormous do they wear such deep mourning for all relative i ask we hotel proprietor who have just tell we that during the first month of mourn the disguise veil be wear over the face monsieur shake he sleek head gravely but no madame not for all for a husband yes for a father or mother yes for a sister or brother a uncle or aunt yes but for a cousin _ no _ he pronounce the _ no _ so emphatically as almost to convince we of he belief that in refuse to mourn in the most lugubrious degree for cousin the versaillese act with praiseworthy self-denial there seem to be no medium between sackcloth and gala-dress we seldom note the customary degree of half-mourning plain color be evidently unpopular and fancy tartan of the most flamboyant hue predominate amongst those who during a spell of say three year have be fortunate enough not to lose a parent sister brother uncle or aunt a perfectly natural reaction appear to urge the _ ci-devant _ mourner to robe themselves in lively check and tartan it be as though they say -- here at last be we opportunity for gratify we natural taste in color it will probably be of but short duration therefore let we select a combination of all the most brilliant tint and wear they for who know how soon that gruesome pall of woe may again enshroud we probably it be the vicinity of we hotel to the church of notre dame that until we discover its brighter side lead we to esteem versaille a veritable city of the dead for on we bi-daily walk to visit the invalid we be almost certain to encounter a funeral procession either approach or leave notre dame and on but rare occasion be the great central door undraped with the sepulchral insignia which proclaim that a mass for the dead be in prospect or in progress sometimes the sable valance and portières be heavily trim and fringe with silver at other there be only the scantiest display of time-worn black cloth -lrb- illustration : a football team -rrb- the humblest funeral be affect and impressive as the sad little procession move along the street -- the wayfarer reverently uncover and soldier salute as it pass -- the dirge-like chant of the _ miserere _ never fail to fill my eye with unbidden tear of sympathy for the mourner who with bow head walk behind the wreath-laden hearse despite the abundant emblem of woe versaille can never appear other than bright and attractive even in mid-winter the sky be clear and on the shortest day the sun seldom forget to cast a warm glow over the gay white-painted house and though the woman 's dress tend towards depression the brilliant military uniform make amends there be 12000 soldier station in versaille and where a fifth of the population be gorgeous in scarlet and blue and gold no town can be accuse of lack color next to the redundant manifestation of grief the thing that most impressed we be the rigid economy practice in even the smallest detail of expenditure among the lower class there be none of that aping of fashion so prevalent in prodigal england the different social grade have each a distinctive dress and be content to wear it among the man blouse of stout blue cotton and sabot be common sometimes velveteen trousers whose original tint year of wear have tone to some exquisite shade of heliotrope and a russet coat wear with a fur cap and red neckerchief compose a effect that for harmonious coloring would be hard to beat the female of he species as be the case in all natural animal be content to be less adorn she skirt be black she apron blue while she be young she neatly dress hair even in the coldest weather be guiltless of cover as she year increase she take she choice of three head-dress and to shelter she gray lock select either a black knit hood a check cotton handkerchief or a white cap of ridiculously unbecoming design no french workaday father need fear that he earnings will be squander on such perishable adornment as feather artificial flower or ribbon the purchase of he spouse be certain to be govern by extreme frugality she select the family raiment with a view to durability flimsy finery that the sun would fade shoddy material that a shower of rain would ruin offer no temptation to she when she expend a few _ sous _ on the cutting of she boy 's hair she have it crop until he cranium resemble the soft furry skin of a mole thus render further outlay in this respect unlikely for month and when she buy a flannel shirt a six-inch strip of the stuff for future mending be always include in the price but with all this economy there be a air of comfort a complete absence of squalor in cold weather the school-girl wear snug hood or little fur turban and boy have the picturesque and almost indestructible bérets of cloth or corduroy cloth boot that will conveniently slip inside sabot for outdoor use be greatly in vogue and the comfortable capuchin cloak -- whose peaked hood can be draw over the head thus obviate the use of umbrella -- be favor by both sex and all age -lrb- illustration : mistress and maid -rrb- as may be imagine little

country folk lady ' and gentleman 's watch with chain complete in the most dazzling of aureate metal sell they at six sous apiece as quickly as he could hand they out living be comparatively cheap in versaille though as in all place where the cost of existence be low it must be hard to earn a livelihood there by far the larger proportion of the community reside in flat which can be rent at sum that rise in accordance with the accommodation but be in all case moderate housekeeping in a flat should the owner so will it be ever conducive to economy and life in a french provincial town be
