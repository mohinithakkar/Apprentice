upright and courageous citizen to serve on jury chicago papers collect a purse of $ 100000 to divide among they as a reward for work well do the case be appeal to the illinois state supreme court which on march 18 1887 find no error on which it could reverse the verdict this despite affidavit prove that the jury be choose from a carefully select panel of enemy of the man by the bailiff and the judge and many other flagrant violation of civil rights too many to enumerate and then come the appeal to the united state supreme court old as they be none of the present incumbent be then sit on the bench but they worthy forerunner be equally reactionary they find no constitutional grounds for reversal of course not even though the right of free speech and assembly have be trample underfoot at the haymarket square the right to a fair trial make into a cruel farce on November 11 1887 albert parson August spy adolph fischer and george engel be lead out to the gallows at the last moment yield
