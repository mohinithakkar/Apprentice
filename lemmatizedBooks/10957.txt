phrase evoke and parade a pageant of amours the thousand heartache the finger clutch hungrily at key that might be other finger the fiddler with he eyelid clench while he dream that the violin against he cheek be the satin cheek of the inexpressive she the singer with a cry in every note the moonlit youth with the mandolin tinkle he serenade to a ivied window the dead-march the nocturne the amorous waltz the duet the trill and trinket of flirtatious scherzo the laughing roulade the discord melt into concord as solitude into the arm of reunion -- these be music 's very own so capable of love and its expression be music indeed that you almost wonder if any but musician have ever truly love or loving have express and yet -- round every corner there lurk a and yet and if you only continue you march or you reading you always reach that corner you first thought would be that a good musician must be a good lover that a broken heart alone can add the master 's degree to the usual conservatory diploma of bachelor of music that all musician must be sentimental if musician at all and finally that only musician can know how to announce and embellish that primeval theme to which all existence be but variation more or less brilliant more or less in tune but go a little further and closer study will prove that some of the world 's greatest virtuoso in love could neither make nor carry a tune and that by corollary some of the greatest tunester in the world be tyro ignoramus or heretic in that old lover ' arithmetic which begin : 1 plus 1 equal 1 if you care to watch the cohort of musician good bad and worse that i shall have to deploy before you you shall see almost every sort and condition of love and lover that humanity can include and incidentally -- to tuck in here a preface that would otherwise be skip -- let I explain that in the follow affair i have prefer to give you the people as accurately as i can make they out in place of the easy trick of string together a number of gorgeous fairy story found on fact i have prefer the long labor of hunting down the truth and tell only what i have find and believe to be true fact and not fancy presentation and not fiction have be the aim throughout where the fact be sparse i have not hesitate to say so have not stoop to pad out gap with graceful and romantic imagining and have indeed never hazard a guess or a inference without frankly brand it as such furthermore as far as space permit and document exist the musician tell they own story in they own word for the making of this little book i have not be able to include all the man who ever write one note after or above another nor to read all the book ever publish in all the world 's language : and yet that i have be decently thorough will appear i think in the list of book at the back this do not claim to be a complete bibliography of the subject but omit hundred of book i have ransack in vain it catalogue only such work as i have consult with profit and the reader could consult with pleasure it may be well to say that with the exception of the occasional necessity or seeming-necessity for take one side or the other in a matter of dispute i have avoid the facility of bandy highly moral verdict and label these victor or victim of life with tag mark they destination in the next world he who get into another 's heart with understanding will find it impossible to indulge in wholesale blame -- _ tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner _ so without pretend to have comprehend any of these human heart altogether i have learn enough to lean almost always a little toward the defense and still more nearly always toward the praise of the woman in the case and yet the whole effort and viewpoint of the work will be find i think to be base upon a deep belief that one love be better than two and that earnestness and honesty and altruism be more bless and blissful even with poverty and suffering than any wealth of money or of fame or of amorous experience as a last chapter to this series of true story i have venture to sum up the conclusion to which the study of all these affair have compel I and to state a general opinion as to the effect of music on character it might have be more exciting to some reader if i have start out with a hard and fast theory and then discard or warped everything contradictory to it but it would have be a dishonest procedure for one who believe that musician be neither saint of exaltation nor fiend of lawless ecstasy but only ordinary clay oven of fire and ash like the rest of we he who generalise be lose and yet i make bold to believe that the conclusion of this book be true and reasonable and in accordance with such evidence as could be collect and now after this before-the-curtain lecture it be high time as artemus would say to rise the curting chapter ii the ancient the very origin and tradition of the trade of music seem to enforce a certain versatility of emotion and experience apollo the particular god of music be not much of a lover and what few affair he have be hardly happy he suit be either decline with thanks or if accept end in the death of the lady as for himself -- be a god he be deny the comfortable convenience of suicide daphne as every one know take to a tree to escape he attention and coroni as so many another woman be soon blasé of divine courtship and for variety turn she eye elsewhere she be punish with death indeed but she son be aesculapius which explain the medicinal value music have always claim old boetius -- who have affection enough for both a first and a second wife -- tell in he treatise on music many anecdote of the art 's influence not only upon sickness but upon wrathful mob bent on mischief he quote plato 's statement that the greatest caution be to be take not to suffer any change in well-moraled music there be no corruption of manners in a republic so great as that which follow a gradual declination from a prudent and modest music for whatever corruption be make in music the mind of the hearer will immediately suffer the same it be certain that there be no way to the affection more open than that of hear the musician proverbially both play upon and be a lyre this instrument as be well know be first make out of a vacant turtle-shell by mercury the god of gymnastic exercise and of theft that be to say of technic and of plagiarism mercury be nimble with he affection also among he progeny be the great god pan who be frequently report and commonly believe to be dead pan be so far from beautiful that even he nurse could not find a compliment for he and in fact drop he and run consider what one usually expect of a new-born infant pan must have be really unattractive he lack of personal charm be the origin of the invention of pan 's pipe or syrinx miss syrinx of the naiad family -- one of the first family of arcadium -- be so horrify when pan propose to she that she flee he pursue and she beg aid of certain nymph who live in a houseboat on the river ladon when pan think to seize she he find he arm fill with reed how many a lover have pursue thus ardently some charmer only to find that when he have she he have but a broken reed but pan note that the wind be sigh musically about the reed cut seven of they with a knife and bind they together as a pastoral pipe a wise fellow he and could profit even from a jilt the eminent musician arion the inventor of glee club -- a fact which should not be cherish against he -- seem to have love no one except himself and therein to have have no rival the famous fish story to the effect that when he be compel to leap into the sea by certain mariner he be carry to shore on the back of a dolphin be only jonah 's adventure turn inside out another early soloist be orpheus the beautiful love story of whose life be common property he be tear to piece by frantic woman a fate that seem always to threaten some of we prominent pianist and violinist at the hand of the matinée bacchante the patron saint of christian music saint cecilium have a remarkable married life include a platonic affair with a angel which cause she pagan husband a certain amount of natural anxiety geoffrey chaucer can tell you the legend of she martyrdom with the crystal charm of all he poesy the early christian church with its elaborate vocal worship accomplish much for the cause of music but also with its vast encouragement to the monastic life and to celibacy coerce a great number of musician to be monk this banish they from a place here -- not by any means because they be monk prevent they have love affair but because it greatly prevent a record of most of they -- though happily not all abélard for instance be a monk and he héloise become a nun and they love letter be among the most precious possession in literature liszt that hungarian rhapsodist in amours be he not also a abbé there be a priest-musician george de la hèle who about 1585 give up a lucrative benefice to marry a woman dower with the name madalena guabaelaraoen but most of they keep they benefice and they sweetheart both though we find it note as worthy of mention in the epitaph of the composer and canon pierre de la rue in the 16th century that as a adorateur diligent du très-haut ministre du christ il sut garder la chastété et se preserver du contact de l'amour sensuel but because you see it in a epitaph it be not always necessarily so sir john hawkin in he delightsome though ponderous history of music tell of the disastrous infatuation of angelus politianus who flourish in 1460 as a canon of the church and the teacher of the child of lorenzo dei medici ange politien he say a native of florence who pass for the finest wit of he time in italy meet with a fate which punish he criminal love be professor of eloquence at florence he unhappily become enamoured of one of he young scholar who be of a illustrious family but whom he could neither corrupt by he great present nor by the force of he eloquence the vexation he conceive at this disappointment be so great as to throw he into a burning fever and in the violence of the fit he make two couplet of a song upon the object with which he be transport he have no sooner do this than he raise himself from he bed take he lute and accompany it with he voice in a air so tender and affect that he expire in sing the second couplet which remind one of the actor artemus ward describe as have play hamlet in a western theater where there be no orchestra he be compel to furnish he own slow music and to play on a flute as he die chapter iii the man of flander the belgian historian van der straeten have illuminate the crowded shelf of he big work la musique aux pays-bas avant le xixe siècle with various little instance of romance that occur to the numberless minstrel and weaver of tangled counterpoint in the netherland of the old time some of these instance be simply hint upon which the fervid imagination will spin imaginary love yarn in endless gossamer thus of marc houtermann -lrb- 1537 -- 1577 -rrb- prince of musician at brussels all we know of he wife be from she epitaph she die the same year he die -- so we fancy it be of a broken heart she die and she be only twenty-six at the time -- so we can imagine how young and lithely beautiful she must have be she name too be joanna gavadium -- a sweet name surely never waste on a ungraceful woman and on she tombstone she be call pudicissima et musicis scientissima so she be good and she be skilful in music like bach 's second wife and doubtless like she of infinite help and delight to she husband van der straeten 's book be clutter up with document of musty interest among they be a number that gain a pathetic interest by the frequence of the appeal of musician or they widow for a pittance of charity from the hand of some royal or ducal patron if there be in these democratic day any musician who feel humiliate by the struggle for existence with its necessity for wire-pulling and log-rolling and sly advertisement and by the difficulty of stem the tide of public ignorance and indifference let he remember that at least he be a free man and need lick nobody 's boot and let he cast a eye upon the chronicle of shameful humiliation childish deference grovel servility and whimsical reward or punishment favor or neglect that mark the golden age when musician find patron from whose conceit or ennui they might wheedle a most uncertain living among the most pathetic of such instance be that of josse boutmy -lrb- 1680 -- 1779 -rrb- court organist at brussels and famous in he day -- which be a long day when he be at the age of eighty and the father of twelve child he have to stoop to appeal for charity again at ninety-seven he appeal at ninety-eight he plead to be retire with a pension at ninety-nine he die three day after he death he son be ask a pension for the mother of that dozen child she also write a pitiful letter still preserved my husband judocus boutmy have the happiness of serve for thirty-five year as first organist of the chapel of you highness infirmity the result of old age and twelve child raise at great cost to enable they to earn they bread have leave I at he death in indigence the greater since my son laurent boutmy who for many year give with approbation assistance to he father in the hope of succeed to he post have be deprive of this boon by other the hope of find subsistence in the heritage of my ancestor make I go back to germany where unhappily the death of my brother my absence the disorder of war of law and a faithless administration have prevent at least during my lifetime all that i could hope save for the tenderness of a daughter who be herself hardly in easy circumstance have a family i should lack the necessaries of life the infirmity result on a age of seventy pass in adversity and work prevent I from gain my own living van der straeten say that she name be katrina that she come from westphalium save a few title of he work and a few account of this pathetic struggle this be all we know of poor josse boutmy and he old wife then there be jacque buus who make various appeal for aid for he increase family a refreshing novelty in these annals of sordid poverty be give we of hj de cro court-organist at brussels in the eighteenth century who be force to make a appeal for charity because the son whom he have send abroad to study do not return to support he father but decide to marry a woman he meet at ratisbon it be pleasant to add that the appeal be grant adrian couwenhoven who die in spain in 1592 leave there a widow ana wickerslot who implore the king to grant she money to go back home to flander with she child the brebo family be famous organ-builder in the fifteenth century they be famous marrier too -- but one of they meet he match jean call to spain married there a widow marianna hita with one son the widow outlive the husband and she son succeed he in business gille brebo the best organ-builder in europe accord to he son who ought to have know marry in spain a woman who be also flemish when he die she be a widow raise to the third degree and she be compel to appeal to the king for charity in she quaint appeal she naïvely point with pride to the fact that in thirty year she have marry with three of he majesty 's servant -lrb- _ casada con tre criado de vm _ -rrb- these three be a royal mathematician a captain in the royal navy kill in the flander rebellion and finally a royal organ-builder we be not tell what further royal alliance she achieve among the most famous of early flemish musician be adrian willaert -lrb- 1480-1562 -rrb- who be bear in bruge and be count the founder of the venetian school he be a pupil of that prince of music josquin desprès -lrb- of whom too little be know save that the church get he -rrb- willaert be the teacher of zarlino and of ciprien de rore -lrb- who from he epitaph seem to have leave a son though nothing be know of he marriage -rrb- we know nothing of willaert 's life-romance but he must have be happily marry for he make six will before he die and they be all preserve in every one of they he mention he wife susana though he never give she family name in each of he will he leave she the bulk of he fortune in the fourth will he say the last word in devotion by bequeath he widow he fortune to enjoy whether she remarry or not as van der straeten say it appear that the affection the old man vow for he wife grow greater and greater the nearer the fatal day approach the most minute disposition be make in she regard strangely enough willaert never mention either he composition or he daughter catharine who be a composer too perhaps this gifted daughter have a little romance of she own and find herself disinherit one of the darkest of the royal english tragedy concern a musician one david riccus or rizzio who be bear at turin the son of a poor music-teacher and who when grow manage to join the train of the count de moretto then go as ambassador to scotland there throw upon he own resource in a far cold country this forlorn italian manage to ingratiate himself among the musician of mary the unhappy queen of scot she eventually notice he and engage he as a singer he gradually rise higher in she political and personal favor till he become secretary for french affair and conduct himself with such odious pride and grow so rich and so powerful that at last he be drag from the very presence of the queen and slay and this be in the year 1566 chapter iv orland di lassus and he regina a contemporary of the rizzio so humble as a musician and so soar in he intrigue be the great roland de lattre better know as orland di lassus or orlandus lassus the belgian orpheus _ le prince des musiciens _ there be as much dispute over the date of he birth as over the early condition of he life but he be bear in either 1520 or 1530 at mon in hainault and accord to the old annale du hainault he change he name from roland de lattre to orland di lassus because he father have be convict of make spurious coin and as a false moneyer have to wear a string of he evil utterance round he neck rarely in history have a composer hold a more lofty position than that of this son of a criminal and even to-day he rival palestrina in the esteem of historian as one of the pillar of he art he be in the service of the duke of bavarium who give he as much honor as the later king of bavarium give wagner he stand so high at court that a year later he win the hand of a maid of honor regina weckinger she bear he two daughter and four son one of the daughter be name after she regina and when she grow up marry a court painter two of the son become prominent composer the mother be probably beautiful since a old biographer van ouickelberg describe she child as _ elegantissimus _ there be every reason to believe that the wed life of these two be thoroughly happy save that lassus be a indefatigable fiend of work as he biographer delmotte say he life indeed have be the most toilsome that one could think of and he fecund imagination always alert have _ enfanté _ a multitude of composition so great that they very number astound we -lrb- they exceed two thousand -rrb- and forbid we almost to believe they the work of one man this incessant tension of soul make imperious demand for the distraction of repose far from this he redouble he work till nature wear out refuse to lassus the aid she have lavish he mental power abandon he abruptly regina one day when she return find he in a very precarious state he have lose he mind and know she no more in she terror she send word at once to the princess maximilienne sister of the duke william who send at once to the invalid she own physician the doctor mermann thanks to he care the health of orland improve but he reason do not return from that moment he become sad dreamy absorb in melancholy ` he be no longer ' say regina ` what he be before gay and content but be become sombre and speak always of death ' while lassus be in this sad condition he grow petulant over he imagine ill-treatment at the hand of the new duke and write a letter bitterly complain that he have not carry out he father 's promise in fact orland in he condition of semi-insanity threaten to resign and when the insult duke maximilian show sign of accept the resignation it be the wife that save the family from disgrace and poverty regina make a fervent appeal -lrb- quote in mathieu 's poem on lassus -rrb- that he _ altesse sérénissime _ be please not to heap on the poor family of orland the wrong that the unhappy father may have deserve through he _ fantaisy bizarre _ the result of too much thought for he art and too incessant zeal but that the duke deign to continue he former treatment for to put he out of the service of the court chapel would be to kill he he be leave undisturbed in he post but before long death force the acceptance of he resignation over he grave be place a tomb on which besides the effigy of himself be show also he devoted wife and some of they child regina two year later found a perpetual annual funeral service for he by a later intercession she secure for she son ferdinand the succession to he father 's dignity at the court of bavarium she die June 5 1600 and on she tomb she be name la noble et vertueuse dame regina de lassin veuve de feu orland de lassus she have be a good wife to a good husband the sadness of she latter year with she beloved and demented husband remind one of the pathetic fate of robert schumann and he wife chapter v henry and france purcell if lassus deserve the name of the netherlandish orpheus henry purcell deserve the name he loveing wife france purcell give he when she publish after he death a collection of he song under the name of orpheus britannicus the analogy hold good also in the devotion of these married couple for henry will to france the whole of he property absolutely yet the legend of the cause of he death would verify the old theory about the joltiness of the course of true love for sir john hawkin pass along the gossip that purcell meet he death by a cold which he catch in the night wait for admittance into he own house it be say that he use to keep late hour and that he wife have give order to he servant not to let he in after midnight unfortunately he come home heat with wine from the tavern at a hour later than that prescribe he and through the inclemency of the weather contract a disorder of which he die if this be true it reflect but little honor on madam purcell for so she be style in the advertisement of he work and but ill agree with those expression of grief for she dear lament husband which she make use of to lady elizabeth howard in the dedication of the orpheus britannicus it seem probable that the disease of which he die be rather a linger than a acute one perhaps a consumption and that for some time at least it have no way affect the power of he mind since one of the most celebrated of he composition the song ` from rosy bower ' be in the print book say to have be the last of he work and to have be set during that sickness which put a period to he day hawkin guess that purcell be marry young because at the age of twenty-five he be advertise the sale of he first sonata at he own house also that musician-like he leave he family dependent upon the favor of he benefactor particularly upon the graciousness of he pupil and patroness lady elizabeth howard who place on he tomb in westminster abbey the famous inscription often credit to dryden : here lye henry purcell esq who leave this life and be go to that bless place where only he harmony can be exceed we now know that purcell 's marriage be either in 1680 or 1681 when he be twenty-two or twenty-three year old August 2d 1682 purcell 's father a venerable and distinguished musician and a friend of pepy the diarist be bury in westminster abbey where later he more distinguished son be lay a few day after the elder purcell 's burial henry and he wife come to westminster abbey again for the baptism of a son new-born he die in a few month and a third time they come to the sad old abbey to lay they child in the cloister there the next year 1683 a second son die and in 1687 a third boy two month old be bury in the cloister of the abbey this monotonous return of the hand of death must have embittered the life of these two who seem to have remain lover always but in may 1688 a daughter be bear name france after she mother and she outlive both parent she marry a poet when she and she lover be each nineteen and name a child france after the grandmother on sept 6th 1689 henry purcell 's son edward be baptise and he also live to attain some distinction as a organist in 1693 a daughter mary peter be bear two year later on may 21st 1695 the young father die -- on the eve of st cecilium 's day at he bedside be he old mother he young wife and the two little child purcell be bury under the organ of westminster abbey and the anthem he have compose for the funeral of queen mary be sing at he own and there he rest near he fellow musician pelham humphry who lie as runciman say by the side of he younger wife in the thames-sodden vault of westminster abbey purcell 's will make the very day of he death be as follow : in the name of god aman i henry purcell of the citty of manchester gent be dangerously ill as to the constitution of my body but in good and perfect mind and memory -lrb- thanks be to god -rrb- doe by these present publish and declare this to be my last will and testament and i do hereby give and bequeath unto my loving wife france purcell all my

testament revokee all my former will or will witnesse my hand and scale this twentieth first day of November annoq dnus one thousand six hundred ninety-five and in the seventh yeare of the raigne of king william the third & c h purcell as to hawkin 's theory that purcell leave he wife in needy circumstance cumming he biographer believe the thought refute by the will leave by the widow herself who outlive she husband by eleven year and on st valentine 's day 1706 be bury at he side in she will she say that : accord to she husband 's desire she have give she deare son -lrb- edward -rrb- a good education and she alsoe do give he all the booke of musicke in generall the organ the double spinett the single spinett a silver tankard a silver watch two pair of gold button a hair ring a mourning ring of dr busby 's a larum clock mr edward purcell 's picture handsome furniture for a room and he be to be maintain until provide for all the residue of she property she give to she say daughter france cumming also assail hawkin 's story that purcell be dissipate and catch he death from be lock out but runciman object that if purcell have not be dissipate in those day he would have be call a puritan and say : i picture he as a sturdy beef-eating englishman a puissant masterful as well as lovable personality a bear king of man ambitious of greatness determine as tudway say to excel every one of he time the love france purcell bear she husband be keep green by she anxiety for he fame she be in she littler way a cosima wagner in 1696 she publish a collection of harpsichord lesson by she husband three edition be sell quickly the next year she issue ten sonata and a collection of ayre in 1698 she issue -lrb- or reissue -rrb- the orpheus britannicus in all of these she write dedication breathe devotion to she husband in a ode print in the second volume of the orpheus in 1704 purcell 's personality be thus limn : nor be he beauty to he art confin would so justly be he soul and body join would you would think he form the product of he mind a conquer sweetness in he visage dwell he eye would warm he wit like lightning melt but those must no more be see and that no more be feel pride be the sole aversion of he eye himself as humble as he art be high purcell die at the age of thirty-seven -- be grant only two year more of life than mozart and only six year more than schubert he be the moon of english music and he melody be as exquisite and as silvery and as full of enamoured radiance as the tintinnabulation of the moonbeam themselves but unfortunately for english music this beautiful moon who be the most nearly great of all the composer england have furnish the world be speedily obscure in the blinding glare of the sun of english music which come shoulder up from the east and which have not yet sink far enough in the west to cease from dazzling the eye of english music-maker but of händel as a lover we must postpone the gossip till we have mouth one of the most delicious morsel in musical scandal a choice romance that be say to have affect purcell very deeply the story concern the strenuous career of alessandro stradellum and when you read it you will not wonder that it should have make a great success as a opera or that it give flotow he greatest popularity next to martha even though its conclusion be make tamely theatrical chapter vi the strange adventure of stradellum there be historian sour and cynical who have try to contradict the truth of the life story of stradellum as bourdelot tell it in he histoire de la musique et de ses effets but they can not offer we any satisfactory substitute in its place and without trouble to give they merely destructive complaint and without attempt to improve upon the pompously fascinating english of old sir john hawkin i will quote the story for you delectation certain it be that there be a composer name stradellum and that he be a opera composer to the venetian republic as well as a frequent singer upon the stage to he own harp accompaniment he occupy a position in musical history of some importance the follow story of he adventure be no more improbable than many a story we read in the daily newspaper -- and surely no one could question the credibility of the daily newspaper but here be the story as hawkin tell it as the cook-book say salt it to you taste he character as a musician be so high at venice that all who be desirous of excel in the science be solicitous to become he pupil among the many whom he have the instruction of be one a young lady of a noble family of rome name hortensium who notwithstanding she illustrious descent submit to live in a criminal intimacy with a venetian nobleman the frequent access of stradellum to this lady and the many opportunity he have of be alone with she produce in they both such a affection for each other that they agree to go off together for rome in consequence of this resolution they embark in a very fine night and by the favor of the wind effect they escape upon the discovery of the lady 's flight the venetian have recourse to the usual method in that country of obtain satisfaction for real or suppose injury : he despatch two assassin with instruction to murder both stradellum and the lady give they a sum of money in hand and a promise of a larger if they succeed in the attempt be arrive at naple the assassin receive intelligence that those whom they be in pursuit of be at rome where the lady pass as the wife of stradellum upon this they determine to execute they commission write to they employer request letter of recommendation to the venetian embassador at rome in order to secure a asylum for they to fly to as soon as the deed should be perpetrate upon the receipt of letter for this purpose the assassin make the best of they way toward rome and be arrive there they learn that on the morrow at five in the evening stradellum be to give a oratorio in the church of san giovannus laterano they fail not to be present at the performance and have concerted to follow stradellum and he mistress out of the church and seize a convenient opportunity to make the blow the performance be now begin and these man have nothing to do but to watch the motion of stradellum and attend to the music which they have scarce begin to hear before the suggestion of humanity begin to operate upon they mind they be seize with remorse and reflect with horror on the thought of deprive of he life a man capable of give to he auditor such pleasure as they have just then feel in short they desist from they purpose and determine instead of take away he life to exert they endeavor for the preservation of it they wait for he come out of the church and courteously address he and the lady who be by he side first return he thanks for the pleasure they have receive at hear he music and inform they both of the errand they have be send upon expatiate upon the irresistible charm which of savage have make they man and have render it impossible for they to effect they execrable purpose and conclude with they earnest advice that stradellum and the lady should both depart from rome the next day themselves promise to deceive they

jealousy be the motive to it he lament he fate exceedingly and in regard of he great merit as a musician say he could have forgive he any injury in that kind which add the relater ` those who remember how lovingly mr purcell live with he wife or rather what a loving wife she prove to he may understand without farther explication ' chapter vii giovannus and lucrezium palestrina almost exactly a century before purcell die in england there die in italy at rome a composer who have make he birthplace immortal though he own name have almost be lose to public recognition in the process that be the man whose name in english would be john peter lewi or as he father call he giovanni pier luigus who be bear at palestrina at some date between 1514 and 1530 and who die in the fulness of he fame February 2 1594 when shakespeare be thirty year old and be it seem just get into print for the first time the man whom all posterity know by the name of he birthplace as palestrina be the greatest composer the catholic church ever have he be a younger contemporary of willaert 's but be bear a italian and all he glory belong to italy of he youth nothing be know he first appear as the organist and director at the chief church in palestrina from 1544 to 1551 of he early love-making nothing be know it be only certain that he marry young and it would seem very happily yet this marriage bring he the greatest shock of he life he wife 's name be lucrezia he equal and a honest damsel -lrb- _ donzellum onesta e sua para _ -rrb- accord to the biographer bainus who add : with she giovannus divide the pleasure of see himself elect the first maestro of the vatican with she he suffer the most strait penury of he life with she he sustain the most cruel affliction of he spirit and with she also he eat the hard crust of sorrow : yet with she again he rest in the sunlight that beam from time to time to he glory and to he gain and so they pass together these two faithful consort nearly thirty year lucrezia bear he four child all son angelo ridolfo sillum and igino the first three die in early manhood after show themselves in some sort heir of they father 's genius : in the second book of he motet palestrina have include some of they composition the last son igino outlive he parent and he own welfare he be _ un ' anima disarmonica _ after he father 's death he attempt to complete and market a unfinished and reject composition of he father 's but he be legally restrain he lose some of he father 's unpublished work while certain nodding of genius better lose and refuse even by the pope palestrina dedicate they to still remain with a dedication to yet another pope put on they by the scapegrace igino a certain writer pitonus by a bit of careless reading multiply palestrina 's wife by two and divide he son by the same number claim that lucrezium the first wife of palestrina be the mother of angelo that after she death he marry one doralice and that she be the mother of igino but bainus expose pitonus 's carelessness prove the existence of ridolfo and sillum by the inclusion of they work in the father 's book and show that doralice be the wife of palestrina 's son angelo it be establish then that palestrina be marry but once and it be assume that he be happily marry it be strange to see how this happy marriage come near prove fatal to he palestrina who be like michelangelo intimate with various pope dedicate in 1554 he first print book of mass to pope julius iii as a reward the careless pontiff make he one of the singer of he sistine chapel omit the usual severe examination and overlook as a small matter the fact that palestrina be so far from be a priest that he be very much married and very much the father and furthermore have no voice but palestrina resign he post as maestro at saint peter 's and enter the chapel the pope die shortly afterward and be succeed by a cardinal who be a patron of palestrina 's and continue he favor as pope marcellus ii three week later this pope also die and be follow by paul iv unfortunately for palestrina the new pope be a strict constructionist and he find it indecent that there should be marry man -lrb- _ ammogliatus _ -rrb- interfere in holy office in spite of the action of the two previous pontificate he determine to expel the three benedick who have enter the choir leonardo barè domenico ferrabosco and palestrina uominus ammogliatus e chus con grandissimo scandalo ed in vilipendio del divin culto contro le disposizioni dei sagri canoni e contro le costituzioni e le consuetudini della cappella apostolica cantano i medesimi tre ammogliati imitamente be capellani cantorus he then declare that after mature deliberation cassiamo discacciamo e togliamo from the list of chappellary singer these three and that they ought to be cassati discacciatus e tolti dalla cappellum and that after the present order they cassino discaccino e tolgano and excommunication be threaten if any more married man -lrb- _ uxoratus _ -rrb- be receive in the chapel this be on the 30th of July 1555 just six month after palestrina have resign he important post at saint peter 's he be a young man with a family and apparently keenly sensitive for when this sonorous thunderbolt be launch at he head he immediately fall ill of a fever and come nigh to death but he recover and two month later find another post as canon of the lateran of which by the 1st of October 1555 he be maestro eleven year later a year after he have write he immortal improperium we find he beg on account of the need of he family to be give a increase of salary or the acceptance of he resignation they give he the acceptance again he find another post and ten year later be back again as maestro of the vatican after he many wanderings and vicissitude in the meanwhile he have write he famous mass name after he old friend pope marcellus ii the ten year between 1561 and 1571 have mark a epoch not merely in the life of palestrina but in the history of religious music the reform palestrina undertake or be entrust with be the ending of the old scandal bring upon the church by the elaborate length to which contrapuntal composer have go in use popular melody and often even street song of a obscene nature as a foundation melody or cantus firmus for they vocal gymnastics the churchman of that day do in a more elaborate fashion what wesley do in he day and the salvation army in ours for the popular ballad of the street the trouble be that many of the congregation would think only of the original word of these catchy tune and in the general uproar some of the priest would sing the actual text think that the people would not hear they and forget that they be suppose to be for a all-hearing ear i find a interesting example of this custom in the career of a musician a contemporary of palestrina 's mention by van der straeten he name be ambrosio de cote he be the maestro de capillum of the king 's chapel at grenada he be of either flemish or english birth and though he be a churchman be a gambler and drunkard he keep a mistress who ought to have be pretty to fit she pretty name juana de espinosa besides de cotes carouse miscellaneously he run the street at night in bad company and singing bad song in 1591 he be officially reprove for these habit and for singing improper word to sacred music -lrb- _ y cantan mucho reze letras profanas yndecente _ -rrb- so great be the scandal throughout the whole world of church music that contrapuntal music come near be abandon entirely it be give a last chance in a proposition to palestrina to see if it be worthy and capable of redemption he compose three mass and the third of they dedicate to the memory of pope marcellus ii be accept not only as the rescue of the old school of vocal worship but also as the final word and ultimate model for future church music some year later at the very height of he glory palestrina 's heart suffer its final blow in the word of baini lucrezia _ la sua dolce consorte _ after have piously accompany the solemn procession for the transport of the body of saint gregory nazianzeno from the church of the monk of s marium campa marzo to the vatican the fourth of June 1580 be assail by a most oppressive malady the attention of she husband and the remedy of the medical art of that day keep she alive up to the first of July then the sickness begin anew and neither the tear nor the voice of the loving companion prevail against the inexorable scythe of death on the 21st of July lucrezia die the next day she body be receive at the vatican giovannus watch in the schoolroom of the chapel it be easy to picture the wild grief of this man whom a previous anxiety have throw into a almost mortal fever yet he live fourteen busy year and in he old age he feel both fatigue and want and be compel to join the long list of those musician who have appeal to they patron for charity but at least he life like bach 's and that of many another have prove that marriage be not always and necessarily a failure when set to music chapter viii bach the patriarch the genealogy of the bach show they to have be in the habit of marry at least two or three time apiece and of be very prolific johann ambrosius bach the father of the father of modern music have a twin brother johann cristoph they be astonishingly alike in mind and manner and mien they suffer the same disorder and die nearly together they wife it be say -- _ horresco referen _ -- could not tell they apart j christoph be sue for breach of promise by a girl whom he say he have discuss matrimony with and exchange ring with but tire of the consistory order he to marry she but he appeal to a higher court and be absolved from the tenacious woman whom he say he hate so that he could not bear the sight of she he marry another woman four year later the great bach johann sebastian be the youngest of six child he mother die when he be nine year old but with bachic haste he father remarry the new wife be a widow and seem to be in the habit of it for she bury j ambrosius two month after the wedding the boy sebastian be put in charge of a uncle at eighteen he be organist at arnstadt -- at twenty-one he go on foot fifty mile to lübeck to hear the great buxtehude play the organ he have be give four week ' leave and take sixteen he be severely reprove for this by the consistory and the reproof be in existence still while they be about it they reprove he for he wild modulation and variation also for have play too long interlude and then when rebuke play they too short he be give eight day to answer and wait eight month then they remonstrate with he mildly again add that they furthermore remonstrate with he on he have latterly allow the stranger maiden to show herself and to make music in the choir he answer to this be simply that he have speak about it to the parson further explanation we have none spitta speculate on the identity of this stranger maiden in the older church-cantata woman do not sing : in the newer form they occasionally do she might have be a professional from the brunswick opera but spitta decide that it must have be marium barbara bach he cousin from a neighbouring town she be know to have have relative and friend in arnstadt and bach married she a year later assume this to be true spitta note that a delightful episode in the courtship of the young couple be disclose to we view perhaps too when bach speak to the parson he confess he love and he betrothal further spitta comment : the plan on which bach wish to find he own family show how he too be fill with that patriarchal feeling by which he race be distinguish and bring to such flourishing condition without stray into foreign circle he find in a relation who bear he name the person whom he feel to be the most certain of understand he if we must call it a coincidence it be at any rate a remarkable one that sebastian in whom the gift of he race reach they highest perfection should also be the only one of its member to take a bach to wife if we be right in regard the marriage union of individual from family not ally in blood as the cause of a stronger growth of development in the child bach 's choice may signify that in he the highest summit of a development have be reach so that he instinct disdain the natural way of attempt further improvement and attract he to he own race he second wife indeed be not ally with he in blood but that with the first he find in some respects he more natural development may perhaps be conclude from the fact that the most remarkable of he son be all the child of he first marriage upton say that bach love marium barbara when he be only eighteen and they agree to wait till he get a better post this be not till three year have pass and then he salary be only eighty-five gulden -lrb- about # 7 or $ 35 -rrb- besides a little corn and wood and some kindling-wood it be on October 17 1707 that accord to the record the respectable herr j bach the survive lawful son of the late most respectable herr ambrosius bach the famous town-organist and musician of eisenach be marry to the virtuous maiden marium barbara bach the youngest survive unmarried daughter of the late very respectable and famous artist herr johann michael bach a little inheritance of fifty gulden -lrb- # 4 or $ 20 -rrb- aid the new couple but it be small wonder that we find bach sighing later : modest as be my way of life with the payment of house-rent and other indispensable article of consumption i can with difficulty live a year after he marriage however he be appoint court organist to the grand duke of weimar a post he hold nine year then he become musical director with the prince of anhalt-köthen in 1720 he go to carlsbad with he prince when he return to the bosom of he family he find that he wife be not only dead but bury spitta imagine he grief as he stand over the grave of the woman who have follow he from humility to success and have not be able to wish he a last godspeed she have bear he seven child three of whom die of the son be wilhelm friedemann the father 's favorite and karl philipp emanuel whom the world long prefer to sebastian himself and whom later time spitefully underrate the shock of come home to he dead wife do not annul bach 's power and he next cantata with the suggestive title he that exalteth himself shall be abased show a larger grasp of resource and power in the same year he make a sensation by he playing in hamburg win the high praise of the eminent organist reinken -lrb- whom by the way mattheson accuse of be a constant admirer of the fair sex and much addict to the wine-cellar of the council -rrb- for all they may say of the superior genius of bach 's first wife 's child it be in he second wife that he seem to have find he more congenial and appreciative helpmeet bach 's father have remarry after seven month of widowering and live two month longer bach wait from July 7 1720 to December 3 1721 and he live nearly thirty year more he new wife bear he thirteen child six of they son none of whom be remarkable musically though they mother be more musical than the mother of bach 's first child perhaps the newcomer think it time to take the name out of the rut anna magdalena wülken be the daughter of the court trumpeter in the ducal band at weissenfel she be twenty-one year old while bach be thirty-six they be betroth as early as September 1721 and together stand sponsor to the child of the prince 's cellar-clerk the wedding take place at bach 's own house the new wife be very musical a gifted singer and a devoted student she make the bach home a little musical circle it be evident that she keep up she singing for October 28 1730 he write of he family they be one and all bear musician and i can assure you that i can already form a concert both vocal and instrumental of my own family particularly as my present wife sing a very clear soprano and my eldest daughter join in bravely soon after the marriage sebastian and anna start to keep a musical book together she name appear in she own hand then she husband 's cheery note that it be _ anti-calvinismus _ and _ anti-melancholicus _ in this book and another begin in 1725 be composition by himself and other man copy in the handwriting of both husband and wife there be aria write apparently for anna magdalena and when in a unusually domestic humor he write in a song edifying reflection of a smoker in d minor she transpose it up to g minor in she own hand -- doubtless that she might sing it to he while he puff contentment in uxorious ease later on be a wedding-poem gallantly begin irh diener werthe jungfer braut viel glücke zur heutgen freude and exclaim that at the sight of she in she garland and wedding-garb the heart laugh out in rapture -- and what wonder that lip and breast overflow with joy there be rule he write out for she instruction in thorough-bass with a note that other must be teach orally and there be a love-song for soprano which he must have write for she to judge from the word willst du dein herz mir schenken upton declare this song to have be write during and for they first courtship a portrait of this ideal wife be paint by cristoforus and pass into the keep of she stepson karl philipp emanuel bach but alas it be lose while so many a less interesting face be repeat in endless picture twenty-eight year after she marriage this faithful woman stand by she husband 's side in he blindness and through the two operation by the english surgeon in leipzig how must she have rejoice when on July 18 1750 he suddenly find that he could see and endure with delight the bless sunshine how she heart must have sink when a few hour later he be stricken with apoplexy and a high fever that give he only ten more day of life at he death-bed stand he wife he daughter he youngest son a pupil and a son-in-law a old chorale of he be as spitta say float in he soul and he want to complete and perfect it the original name have be when we be in the highest need but he change the name by dictation now to before thy throne with this i come -lrb- _ vor deiner thron tret ich hiemit _ -rrb- the preacher say he have fall calmly and blessedly asleep in god and he be bury in st thoma ' churchyard but later the grave be lose sight of and he bone be now as unhonoured as he memory be revere it be a dismal task to write the epilogue to the beautiful life and death of this father of music the woman who have make he life so happy and aid he with hand and voice and heart -- what have she do to deserve the dingy aftermath of she fidelity bach leave no will and he child seize he manuscript what little money remain from he salary of 87 thaler a year -lrb- # 13 or $ 65 -rrb- they divide with the widow now fifty year old she husband 's salary be continue half a year longer but the son all go away to other town some of they to considerable success the mother and three daughter be leave to shift for themselves two year later they must sell a few musical remains and the town must aid they out of its fund in the winter ten year after she husband 's death on feb 27 1760 anna magdalena die a alms-woman she only mourner be she daughter and a fourth of the public school child who be force by the custom of the day to follow to the grave the body of the very poor in 1801 bach 's daughter regina be still live a good old woman who would have starve have there not be a public subscription to which beethoven contribute the proceeds of a composition gradually the name and fame of johann sebastian bach be obliterate almost from man 's memory half a century of oblivion be follow by the great revival and the apotheosis of he genius in that apotheosis some radiance must always be vouchsafe the sweet memory of she to whom he owe so much of he life 's delight and he art 's inspiration to whom also he dedicate he life and he music -- anna magdalena chapter ix papa and mamma haydn such music by such a nigger exclaim one prince another call he a moor and two other could not endure he at all he be undersized and slender as well and he leg be so very short that they hardly reach the ground he nose be long and beaked and disfigured with nostril of different shape and he be undershot like a bulldog and unusually pit with smallpox even for those ante-vaccination day when it be the ordinary thing to show the mark of this plague he always wear a wig too begin when he be a child of six for the sake of cleanliness and continue to the day of he death even when wig be out of style this do not read like the portrait of a man particularly successful in he love affair it do not certainly read like a description of the hero of a novel write by the duchess or even by miss jane austen yet this be the picture of a man plentifully beloved large-minded but strangely naïf a revolutionist of childlike directness everybody know the story of the early life of joseph haydn one of the twelve child of a journeyman wheelwright and throughout he youth a shuttlecock of ill treatment and contempt love seem to have reach he heart at a late day but with compensate suddenness it be nearly incredible that a man whose after life be so heart-busy should not have feel the tender passion till he be nearly thirty but stranger thing have happen and the anecdote give by he friend griesinger of he wild agitation when at the age of twenty-seven he be accompany a young countess and she neckerchief become disarrange for a moment would seem to indicate a remarkably unsophisticated nature a year later he find himself somewhat relieved of the burden of poverty that have always hamper he and he remember he of the two daughter of a viennese wig-maker name keller keller have frequently be kind to haydn and the younger daughter seem to have inspire he with a ardent love but she take the veil elise polko have work up a elaborate fiction on this affair with she usual saccharinity when the convent close the younger keller from the world she father ingeniously suggest to haydn that he might marry the elder sister as loui nohl say whatever may have be the reason gratitude ignorance helplessness in practical matter or wish to have a wife at once -- whatever may have be the motive he marry and sorely suffer for it anna keller be older than haydn and the family religiousness that lead the younger daughter to enter the convent lead anna to contribute more of money to the church of food and society to the churchman and of she husband 's composition to the choir than even so pious a catholic as haydn could afford or endure a account of the married life of these two be give by haydn 's friend carpanus which incidentally bring up a bit of literary thievery of unusual quaintness carpanus write he le haydine in the form of letter from vienna they be publish in milan some time after one marie henrus beyle publish in paris what purported to be a original series of letter write from vienna he publish these under the pen name of lac bombet carpanus expose the theft but a little later the imperturbable beyle publish a second edition of he work under the name de stendhal a english translation from the french work be commonly see though never with credit to carpanus carpanus in he account of the home life of the haydn say they be happy for a honeymoon \* \* \* \* \* but soon the caprice of mr anna turn the knot to a chain the bliss to torment and affair go so far that after suffer many year this new socrate end by separate from he xantippe mr anna be not pretty nor yet ugly she manners be immaculate but she have a wooden head and when she have fix on a caprice there be no way to change it the woman love she husband but be not congenial a excess of religious piety badly direct come to disturb this happy harmony mr anna want the house always full of priest to whom she furnish good dinner supper and luncheon haydn be a bit economical but rather for cause than desire at this time he have hardly enough to live on discreetly and he begin to look with evil eye on this endless procession of holy grasshopper -lrb- _ locuste _ -rrb- who ravage he larder nor be it appropriate to the house of a studious man this ceaseless clatter of a numerous genial and lazy society therefore solidly religious as he be he could not enjoy these sacred repast and he have to close the door of the refectory after that the deluge -lrb- _ inde iræ _ -rrb- mr anna have a religious brother haydn could not keep he from visit he sister monk be like cherry if you lift one from the basket ten come along with it haydn 's convent be not depopulate nor do the demand decrease every now and then mr anna have a new request to-day a responsory to-morrow a motet the day after a mass then hymn then psalm then antiphon and all _ grati _ if she husband decline to write they there appear on the scene the great confederate of capricious woman the effect of hysteria spleen -lrb- _ glus insultus di stomaco _ -rrb- spasm then shriek then crimination weeping quarrel and bad humor unceasing haydn end with have to appease the woman to lose he point and pay the doctor and the druggist to boot he have always drouth in he purse and despair in he mind it be a true miracle that a genius in such a contrast could create the wonderful work that all the world know it be at this time that seek solace in friendship he contract that bond of sentiment which last till death with bosellus a singer in the service of prince esterházy this friendship rousing jealous suspicion in the mind of mr anna end by render she unendurable the hostile fate will that no fruit should be bear of haydn 's marriage -lrb- on this point haydn once open he heart to griesinger saying : my wife be incapable of bear child and therefore i be less indifferent to the charm of other womankind -rrb- lack its most solid link the marital chain could not stand such shock and grow fatally weaker the pair cease to live together and only that sacramental knot remain indissoluble and strong which haydn have contract at the age of twenty-seven mr anna live to seventy year on a sufficient pension which she husband faithfully pay and she die in 1800 these vicissitude in great part explain why haydn though he earn much could not for a long while put aside a penny and make himself a little ease it be not a pretty picture that carpani draw of this home life and anna be make out to be far from a lovable creature she be compare to the patron saint of shrew xantippe but even xantippe have she side of the story to tell and with all possible admiration for that man socrate of such godlike wisdom and such great heart it must be remember that socrate have many habit which would not only cause ostracism from society to-day but would have try the temper of even such a wife as the meek griselda of chaucer 's poem we constantly meet these husband who be seemingly rich in geniality and yet be mysteriously unhappy at home it be the custom of the acquaintance of these fellow to put all the blame on the wife but there be a distinct type of mind which always enjoy dine abroad and appreciate a few herb in a stranger 's house more than a stall ox at home these people be gentle and genial and tender only out-of-door you might call they extra-mural saint i have a strong suspicion that haydn who be so dear and good a soul that he be commonly call papa by he friend and disciple be one of the soul that shrivel up inside the house in any case he can never be forgive for publish he domestic misery as he do he talk inexcusably to he friend about he wife he complain everywhere of she extravagance and of she quarrelsomeness when griesinger wish to make haydn 's wife a present haydn forbid he say : she do not deserve anything it be little matter to she whether she husband be a artist or a cobbler as he pass in front of a picture of she once he seize the violinist baillot by the arm and point to the picture say that be my wife many a time she have madden I in 1792 he write to he mistress from london : -- my wife the infernal beast -lrb- _ bestia infernale _ -- pohl translate this _ höllische bestie _ -rrb- have write so much stuff that i have to tell she i would not come to the house any more which have bring she again to she sens this be thirty-two year after he marriage and a year later he write again : my wife be ail most of the time and be always in the same miserable temper but i do not let it distress I any longer there will sometime be a end of this torment loui nohl speak of this as write in a gentle and almost sorrowful tone as he biographer find gentleness in such write it be easy to see why mr haydn have have few defender heaven forbid that i should be consider as throw all the blame for the unhappiness upon the husband anna keller have a remarkably long and sharp tongue whose power she do not neglect she once complain to she husband that there be not money enough in the house to bury he in case he die suddenly he point to a series of canon which he have write and frame when he be in london revel in he triumph she send he a letter in which she ask he for money enough to buy a certain little house she have set she heart on naïvely add that it be just a cosy size for a widow haydn buy it later for himself and live in it several year as a widower carpanus in he thirteenth letter draw a pleasant picture of haydn 's life with he mistress bosellus and incidentally describe how various composer compose : gluck with he piano in a summer meadow and the bottled sunshine of champagne on each side sartus in a dark room at night with a funereal lamp pendant from the ceiling salierus in the street eat sweet paer while joke with he friend gossip on a thousand thing scold he servant quarrel with he wife and child and pet he dog cimarosa in the midst of noisy friend sacchinus with he sweetheart at he side and he kitten play on the floor about he paesiello in bed zingarellus after read the holy father or a classic anfossus in the midst of roast capon steam sausage gammon of bacon and ragout but haydn like newton alone and obscure voyage the sky in he chair on he finger the ring of frederick like the invisible ring of angelica when he return among mortal bosellus and he friend divide he time for thirty year he lead this life _ monotona ma dolcissima _ not know he grow fame nor dream of leave eisenstadt save when he muse on italy then boselli die and he begin to feel the ennui -lrb- _ le noje _ -rrb- of a void in he day it be then that he go to london this mistress of haydn 's whom carpanus and fétis call bosellus and whom die call pulcellus be now generally call polzellus follow the spelling in haydn 's own handwriting the pleasant legend carpanus give of haydn 's life with this woman undisturbed by ambition until she death be as much upset by later writer as be the spelling of she name pohl closely follow by haydn 's recent biographer schmidt describe luigium polzellus as a neapolitan who be nineteen when she be engage to sing at the theater of the prince esterházy she be the wife of anton polzellus a insignificant and sickly violinist with whom she be apparently not in love luigium be picture -- doubtless by guesswork -- as not beautiful but of a please appearance show the indication of she italian birth in she small slim face she dark complexion she black eye she chestnut-coloured hair she body of medium height and elegant form to this woman say schmidt haydn fetch he own deep and lasting sorrow polzellus be in the same position as he : she live unhappily with she spouse whether she honestly return haydn 's love can not be know fact hint that she often abused and take advantage of he good nature but for all that she beautify he life so often joyless by the tenderness which she awake in he and the woman who throughout twenty year could do that deserve well of the man whose friend she be and she earn we consideration and sympathy besides from london the master write she the tenderest letter both as they correspondence show only postpone they union till the day when ` four eye shall be close ' yet when finally both be free time have work he almighty influence haydn have grow gray outwardly as well as spiritually a estrangement have widen between they and of they once so dear a desire there be no more word yet haydn never cease to provide for he friend as well as to care for the education and the success of she son the elder pietro haydn 's favorite on whom he hang with he whole heart die early -lrb- pohl quote many allusion to he in haydn 's letter -rrb- the younger anton who be report without proper foundation to be haydn 's natural son later become musical director of the prince 's chapel but then give up music and turn farmer finally die of the plague in sad circumstance pohl be somewhat fuller upon this alliance than schmidt who in fact merely condense and paraphrase he he say that polzellus 's maiden name be moreschi -lrb- which be interpret be moor a name once give to haydn -rrb- she be a mezzo-soprano who play secondary rôles in the opera she earn the same salary as she husband 465 gulden a year the letter haydn write she be always in italian and in one of they he wish she better rôles and a good master who will take the same interest as thy haydn haydn have come to she for sympathy since as pohl say and we have see thanks to he wife he have hell at home -lrb- _ die holle im house _ -rrb- when increase fame take haydn by the hand and lead he away to royal triumph in london he do not take jealousy along with he other luggage he seem to have hear that he place be promptly fill in polzellus 's heart but with all he geniality he could write of the rumor rival as this man whose name i do not know but who be to be so happy as to possess thee then there be a recrudescence of the old ardor : oh dear dear polzelli thou lingerest always in my heart never never shall i forget thee -lrb- _ o cara polzellus tu mi stai sempre nel core mal mal scordeo di te _ -rrb- when some one in london tell he that polzellus have sell the piano he have give she he could not believe it and only write she see how they tease I about you -lrb- _ vedus come mi seccano per via di te _ -rrb- still less will he believe that she have speak ill of he and he write : may god bless thee and forgive thee everything for i know that love speak in thee be careful for thy good name i beg thee and think often of thy haydn who cherish and tenderly love thee and to thee will always be true even to bologna whither polzellus go with she two son say pohl follow haydn 's love -- and he gold he intend after he first london visit to go to italy to visit she and write further : i cherish thee and love thee as on that first day and be always sad that i can not do more for you yet have patience surely the day will come when i can show thee how much i love thee loisa 's choice of a spouse have be unhappy as so many marriage have be where the wife be a singer on the stage and the husband a fiddler in the band haydn seem to have sympathise with loisa in she unhappy domestic affair as cordially as she have sympathise with he in he he have sympathy too for she similarly ill-matched sister christine negrus for he write of she as -- already long separate from she husband that beast she have be as unhappy as even you and awake my sympathy also in march 1791 he write loisa about she husband in a manner imply that he be a brute or a maniac : thou hast do well to have he take to the hospital to save thy life haydn and loisa be catholic never think of seek divorce : they only hope of celebrate a formal marriage lay in the death of both she brutish husband and he shrewish wife -- when four eye shall close loisa 's husband be the first to oblige for in August 1791 he death wring a charitable word from even haydn : thy poor husband i tell thee that providence have manage well in free thee from thy heavy burden for it be better to be in the other world than useless in this one the poor fellow have suffer enough later he write : dear polzellus : -- probably that time will come which we have so often long for already two eye be close but the other two -- ah well as god will eight year more and the reluctant and wide-eyed anna haydn be foiled of she desire to be a widow in the snug cottage of she choice the lover at last be both single but now free of they shackle why do they not rush to each other 's arm the only answer we receive be this chill and shocking document find long after haydn 's death it be write in italian and date shortly after frau haydn 's death : i the undersigned promise signora loisa polzellus -lrb- in case i shall be dispose to marry again -rrb- to take no other for wife than the say loisa polzellus and if i remain a widower i promise the say loisa polzellus after my death to leave she a life pension of 300 gulden that be 300 florin in vienna money valid before every court i sign myself joseph haydn _ maestro di cappella of he highness the prince esterhazy _ vienna may 23 1800 on this sad and icy postscript to the ardent love affair schmidt comment : the form of this write leave the conclusion plain that haydn be force to this act by the polzellus this throw a poor light on she character and we dare not evade the conclusion that for twenty year in this love affair for life she have in mind a business arrangement with the master thus cynically write schmidt of the woman who for a score of year occupy haydn 's affection and all of the biographer be incline to heap upon she more or less contempt but as you shall see a little later the genial master himself be not above reproach and loisa 's anxiety be not unfounded for she joseph be cast amorous glance elsewhere thus after the long ardor the love letter have freeze into a hard and fast negative betrothal in which haydn promise to marry no one else this schmidt say be drag out of haydn but if such a bond be necessary it speak surely as ill for haydn as for the woman who have give she life and she good name to brighten he joyless heart yet dead as he love be honor remain with he though it be a rather close-reckoning honor three month later he answer with money she request for house-rent and in a will date may 5 1801 occur this clause cancel he former agreement and make new provision : to the widow aloysium polzellus formerly singer at prince nikolaus esterházy 's payable in ready money six month after my death 100 florin and each year from the date of my death for she life 150 florin after she death she son anton polzellus to receive 150 florin for one year have always be a good son to he mother and a grateful pupil to I nb -- i hereby revoke the obligation in italian sign by I which may be produce by mme polzellus otherwise so many of my poor relation with greater claim would receive too little finally mme polzellus must be satisfy with the annuity of 150 florin two year later we find he write to she -lrb- and rumor say he -rrb- son : i hope thy mamma find herself well in a new will date 1809 the year of he death haydn withdraw the cash gift to loisa and leave she only 150 florin annuity she still remain however he chief heir meanwhile without wait for he death she have marry again to luigi francus like herself a singer and a italian she outlive he and haydn also only to die in poverty and senility far away in hungary poor eighty-two year old loisa she affair have be sadly mismanage why have loisa give up all hope of marry haydn even when he wife be dead and she be possess of he agreement sign seal and deliver to marry no one but she awhile ago i stooped to repeat the scandal that during signora polzellus 's life haydn have be cast sheep 's eye elsewhere but it be such a pretty scandal besides these old contrapuntist be train from youth to keep two or more tune go at once i be not refer to haydn 's friendship with frau von genzinger it be karajan who discover and publish this pleasant correspondence with she she be the wife of a very successful physician a lady ' doctor -lrb- _ damen doktor _ -rrb- she be the daughter of the hofrath von kayser she name be marium anna sabina she be bear nov 6th 1750 and have be marry some seventeen year and be the mother of five child when haydn begin take he every Sunday dinner with the family karajan say that she be a _ ausgezeichnete _ singer and pianist a deep friendship spring up at once between they and they correspond freely haydn 's letter to she be publish by nohl and you may read they in lady wallace 's translation they be full of the most interesting light upon haydn 's life and experience and be brimful of affection for frau von genzinger but the husband and the child be almost always refer to in the letter and the friendship seem to have be entirely and only a friendship -- as schmidt call it _ eine tiefe und zugleich respectvolle neigung _ mr upton who accept the friendship as honorable find in frau von genzinger the only true feminine inspiration haydn ever have for composition we owe much of he music to he wife but the savage and truculent manner in which she inspire he be not conducive to the best work of he genius there be no record that the polzellus be of any benefit to he musically certainly she be not morally but there be another woman who idolise haydn the musician and with haydn the man conduct a quaint and curious love duet embalm in many a billet-doux fragrant with charm it be not then frau von genzinger that threaten polzellus 's supremacy nor be it madame bartolozzi for whom haydn write a sonata and three trio nor mr john hunter who write word for many of he canzonet nor yet mr hodge for whom he compose and whom he call the loveliest woman i ever see nor yet again the fascinating actress mr billington of whom the pleasant story be tell that haydn when he go to london call on sir joshua reynold at he studio find he painting mr billington as saint cecilium listen to the angel and protest gallantly that reynold ought to have paint the angel listen to she for which sprightliness he receive immediately a fervent hug and a kiss from those so sweet and promiscuous lip the skeptic object that reynold exhibit the picture in london in 1790 a year before haydn reach london but it be a shame to spoil a good and famous story the true woman in the case make she _ entrée _ in this innocent style : mr schroeter present she complement to mr haydn and inform he that she be just return to town and will be very happy to see he whenever it be convenient to he to give she a lesson james-st buckingham gate Wednesday June the 29th 1791 this little note be the first of a series of genuine love letter preserve for many year by haydn he answer to they seem to have be lose though the whimsical spade of time that have recently bring to light the work of bacchylide after two thousand year and more of oblivion may with equal speed unsod haydn 's letter to this interesting personage may we be there to see just nineteen year before this little preludising note mr schroeter be a englishwoman of wealth and aristocracy in that year there come to london a german musician johann samuel schroeter a brother of corona schroeter one of that amazonian army of beauty to whom goethe make love and write poetry he become music-master to the english queen as successor to that son of sebastian bach who be know as the english bach he speedily win pupil and esteem among the higher circle of london society but be welcome as a musician be one thing and as a son-in-law quite another when therefore he make one of he most aristocratic pupil he wife by a clandestine marriage there be accord to feti such scandal and such a threat of legal proceedings that he consent to the annulment of the marriage in consideration of a pension of five hundred pound and retire from the city to escape notoriety sixteen year after he entry into london schroeter die of consumption three year later another german musician joseph haydn appear in london and be take up by society mr schroeter apparently not sate by she first experience proceed to repeat it pat just as before she become a pupil in music and later a pupil in love of the newcomer but whereas she husband have die at the age of thirty-eight she new lover haydn be fifty-nine when she meet he die quote haydn 's own word as say in london i fall in love with a widow though she be sixty year old at the time but mr krehbiel show good reason for believe that die must have misunderstand haydn to I it occur as a possibility that haydn say to die not though she be sixty year old but though i be sixty year old i think we be safe in assume with mr krehbiel that she be not more than thirty-five or forty a age not yet so great accord to statistics as that of helen of troy cleopatra and marian delorme at the time of they most potent beauty let we also dismiss as unauthorised and gratuitous the word of pauline d townsend in she biography of haydn when she say of mr schroeter that she be a attractive although accord to modern taste a somewhat vulgar woman of over sixty year of age and there be no disguise the fact that she make violent love to haydn she letter to haydn be full of tenderness and in questionable taste he to she have not be preserve but we can have little doubt that they be warmer in tone than they would have be have not the channel roll between he and frau haydn in vienna we know how little frau haydn have have to do with haydn 's life in he own town you may judge for yourself as to the charge of vulgarity the existence of mr schroeter 's veritable love letter of a englishwoman be know for many year and pohl in he book on mozart und haydn in london quote from they but for they complete publication in the original english we be indebted to mr krehbiel 's music and manners in the classical period this captivating work contain also a note-book which haydn keep in london it be fill with amusing blunder in english and vivid picture of london life of the time picture as delectable in they way as the immortal garrulity of pepy i can not do better than let these letter speak for themselves through such quotation as i have room to make there be twenty-two of they in all in mr krehbiel 's book the abbreviation be curious and explain themselves ml be my love dl be dear love md be my dear and m dst be its superlative the abbreviation be possibly due to the fact that the letter exist only in haydn 's own handwriting copy into he note-book without attention to they proper order or they may have be simply the amorous shorthand of that day two of they be sign r and this lead I to believe that mr schroeter 's first name begin with r though we know neither that nor she maiden name in the first letter mr schroeter say that she enclose he the word of the song you desire this letter be date February 8th in he note-book there be a entry on February 13 1792 and just precede it a little italian poem in which i have be please to see what be possibly this very song its first line be suggestively like the first line of mr schroeter 's letter io vi mando questo foglio dalle lagrime rigato sotto scritto dal cordoglio daus pensierus sigillato testimento del mio amore -lrb- io -rrb- vi mando questo core among the letter there be many anxious allusion which may indicate that haydn be suffer from insomnia unless you be incline to give they a more subtle significance but to the quotation with regret that they must be incomplete Wednesday febr 8th 1792 md inclo

be the last of these letter to which one could apply so fitly the barbarous word yearnful once coin by keat after haydn 's return to london in 1794 there be no letter to indicate a continuance of the acquaintance but it doubtless be renew judge from the sagacious guess base upon the fact that haydn do not come back to he old lodgings but take new one at no 1 bury street st jame 's this much more pleasantly situated dwelling he probably owe to the considerate care of mr schroeter who by the same token thus bring he nearer to herself a short and pleasant walk of scarcely ten minute through st jame 's palace and the mall -lrb- a broad alley alongside of st jame 's park -rrb- lead he to buckingham palace and near at hand be the house of mr schroeter perhaps he prefer the walk to letter-writing when he go away from london for ever he leave behind he the score of he six last symphony in the hand of a lady probably mr schroeter it be this same woman to whom haydn dedicated three trio he first second and sixth it be undoubtedly she to whom he refer when he make that little speech which die probably misquote in tell the answer haydn give he when he be ask what the letter be they be letter from a english widow in london who love I she be though she already count she sixty year still a pretty and lovely woman whom i would very probably have marry have i then be single let we remember that these old love letter so fragrant with fade affection be be receive by papa haydn even while he be write to polzellus rejoicing in the closing of two of those four baleful eye that forbid they union and let we not judge too harshly the italian woman who have give this unbeautiful austrian of such beautiful genius so much of she sunshine and tenderness nor let we judge too harshly the enamoured english widow why indeed need we judge harshly at all when haydn die he have no child to leave he wealth to -- even the fable that anton polzellus be he natural son be take away from we by pohl who point out how small and temporary be the provision make for he in haydn 's will among the heirloom leave by haydn be a watch give to he by that admiral of admiral lord nelson -- and that point to we as a by-path which it be pleasant though forbid now to wander the story of nelson 's fervent amour with lady hamilton that beautiful work of art that pet of artist as a postscript to haydn 's story we may tag on here a concise statement in he note-book of the domestic affair of one whom we do not think of now as a musician on June 15th i go from windsor to slough to doctor herschel where i see the great telescope it be forty foot long and five foot in diameter the machinery be vast but so ingenious that a single man can put it in motion with ease there be also two smaller telescope of which one be twenty-two foot long and magnify six thousand time the king have two make for himself of which each measure twelve schuh he give he one thousand guinea for they in he younger day doctor herschel be in the prussian service as a oboe player in the seven year ' war he desert with he brother and come to england for many year he support himself with music become organist at bath turn however to astronomy after provide himself with the necessary instrument he leave bath rent a room not far from windsor and study day and night he landlady be a widow she fall in love with he marry he and give he a dowry of # 100000 besides this he have # 500 for life and he wife who be forty-five year old present he with a son this year 1792 ten year ago he have he sister

musicker boon companion one twenty-two and the other eighteen strike the town of lübeck in 1703 they be draw thither by a vacancy in the post of town-organist and they competition be to be friendly two flamboyant young musicker leave the town of lübeck as soon as can be for they have learn that the successful candidate must marry the daughter of the man in whose shoe they would fain have trodden the pedal one look at the daughter be enough she be not fair to see and she year be thirty-four -- just six year less than the total year of the two young candidate back to hamburg the two friend go and the next year they friendship suffer a serious strain the elder now aged twenty-three be produce cleopatra a opera of he own composition and incidentally play the role of antony the younger of the friend be the conductor and preside as be the custom of the time at the clavecin there be another custom in the performance of that opera a curious one too for it be the wont of the composer-singer when he have die as antony to come to life again and conduct the rest of he opera at the clavecin but the younger friend now full of the importance of nineteen year and be the successor to the great reinhard keiser be not dispose to yield the clavecin even to he versatile friend a quarrel that narrowly escape ruin the melodious swan-song of cleopatra be postpone till after the final curtain then it take the form of a duel the composer manage at last to elude the parry of the conductor he throw all he weight and venom into a lunge that must prove fatal -- but a large brass button shed the point of the sword and save its wearer for a better fate by the strange medicinal virtue of duel the wound in the friendship be heal honor be poulticed and the friendship begin again lasting with healthful interruption until the younger musician go he way toward the fulness of he glory the elder he way along the line of versatility -- which leave he in the eye of posterity rather value as a writer than aught else the old organist whose death have bring these two younker on they wild-goose chase be dietrich buxtehude the famous man whom johann sebastian bach walk fifty mile on foot to hear and whose composition he study and profit from old buxtehude himself the son of a organist have himself marry the daughter of the organist who have precede he the daughter he leave behind to frighten away aspire candidate do not languish long accord to chrysander a certain jc schieferdecker who be famous for nothing else wed the daughter and get the pretty job -lrb- _ erhielt den schönen

relative of a british admiral that be all of he story that belong here the younger man whose life hang on a button be that great personage whose name have be spell almost every way imaginable between hendtler and handel -- the later form be prefer by the english who as somebody say love to speak learnedly of handel and glück it be not needful here to tell the story of he brilliant life and the big event it crowd into the four and seventy year between 1685 and 1759 he friend mattheson like beethoven spend he later year in the dungeon of deafness händel like he great rival bach -lrb- who be bear the same year -rrb- spend seven year in almost total blindness three operation have fail in almost every other respect the career of these two man be unlike particularly in the obscure and prolific married life of the one and in the almost royal prominence of the other 's bachelorhood händel never marry and seem never even to have be in love though he be a unusually pious son and a fond brother the only time on record when he take a woman into he arm be the occasion when the great singer cuzzonus refuse to sing a air of he the way he wish it he seize she and drag she to a window threaten to throw she out thunder i always know you be a devil but i 'll show you that i be beelzebub the prince of devil händel 's greatest love seem to have be for thing to eat in the memoirs of he publish anonymously -lrb- by doctor mainwaring -rrb- in 1760 the author say that händel be always habituate to a uncommon portion of food and nourishment and accuse he of excessive indulgence in this lowest of gratification he certainly pay more attention to it than be become in any man but it be some excuse that nature have give he so vigorous a constitution so exquisite a palate so craving a appetite that fortune enable he to obey these call and to satisfy these demand of nature have he hurt he health or fortune by indulgence of this kind they would have be vicious as he do not they be at the most indecorous a story be tell of he that he once order up enough dinner for three note that the servant dawdle about händel demand why the servant answer that he be wait for the company to come whereupon händel storm in he famous broken english den pring up der tinner prestissimo i be de gombany in he later year händel be not so beautiful as he might have be and queen anne allude to he bulk say that he hand be foot and he finger toe mr bray however say that in he youth he be the most handsome man of he time handel resemble lully somewhat in he reputation for be a lover of the table and a neglecter of womankind schoelcher in he biography state that not one woman occupy the smallest place in the long career of he life and yet contradict himself in he very next sentence for he add : when he be in italy a certain lady name vittorium fall in love with he and even follow he from florence to venice burney describe vittorium as ' a songstress of talent ' fetis call she the archduchess vittorium but both agree that she be beautiful and that she fill the part of the prima donna in ` roderigo ' he first italian score at that period and even later it be not uncommon to find prince and princess singing in the piece which be produce at they court artist or archduchess either title be enough to turn the head of a young man twenty-four year old but händel disdain she love all the english biographer say that he be too prudent to accept a attachment which would have be ruin to both this be calumny for he be never prudent this vittorium be a interesting problem in romance doctor mainwaring say that händel be apollo and she daphne chrysander in he great biography properly note that the legend have be twist and represent here the god as flee from the nymph coxe say that vittorium be a excellent singer the favorite mistress of the grand duke of tuscany -- which give a decidedly different look to händel 's prudence chrysander try to prove that this vittorium be no other than the famous singer vittorium tesi a contralto of masculine strength as one listener describe she voice she be very dramatic and make she chief success in man 's role singing bass song

man of the utmost historical importance to the lordly händel however he be more or less contemptible and people who know nothing else of either genius know that händel say gluck understand about as much counterpoint as my cook gluck do not make a success on he london visit and begin to criticise both he own work and contemporary school of opera with a thoroughness that result in a determination to reform it altogether from london he go to vienna in 1748 and there he be soon a figure of importance move in the best family and entertain at the best home among the home in which he be most

property of my wife and consequently not include in my previous bequest ' none of the letter of gluck that i have be able to find concern he married life though many of they be in existence concern he operatic warfare burney meet he in 1773 in paris where he be live with he wife and niece in 1775 on he way back home from paris he stop off at strasburg to meet the poet klopstock df strauss quote a description by a merchant of karlsruhe of this scene : old gluck sing and play _ con amore _ many passage from the ` messiah ' set to music by himself he wife accompany he in a few other piece on the 15th of November 1787 when gluck be seventy-three year old he be at he home in vienna under doctor 's care after dinner it be he custom to take coffee out-of-door in the free fresh air and the golden sunlight where he use to have he piano place when he would compose two old friend from pari have dine with he and they be soon to leave frau von gluck leave the guest for a moment to order the carriage while she be go one of the guest decline the liqueur set before he now gluck be always addict to look upon the champagne when it be yellow in fact he use always to have a bottle at each wing of he piano when he compose and be wont to end he composition he bottle and he sobriety in one grand _ fine _ but now he be forbid to take wine for fear of heat he blood on this day however he pretend to be angry at he guest for refuse the choice liqueur in a burlesque rage he seize the glass drain it at a gulp and jokingly beg the guest not to tell he wife she come back to the room to say that the carriage be ready frau von gluck and the guest leave he for half a hour and he bid they a cheerful farewell fifteen minute later he third stroke of apoplexy attack he and he horrified wife return find he unconscious in a few hour he be dead this wife with whom he live so congenially and whose money give he even more luxury than he operatic success could have procure -- indeed the very house he die in she have buy for eleven thousand florin -- outlive he less than three year die march 12 1800 at the age of seventy-one she be bury near he and she tomb build by she nephew have the follow epitaph : here rest in peace near she husband marium anne edle von gluck bear pergin she be a good christian and without ostentation a mother to the poor she be love and cherish by all who know she rousseau the confessor during the fierce battle gluck fight in paris one of he most ardent partisan be jean jacque rousseau who be a musician in a small way write song a enormously successful opera le devin du village and other musical work besides make a attempt to reform musical notation and write a dictionary of music the world however do not accept he as a musician but as a writer and he numerous and curious love affair be tell in so much detail in he immortal confession that i can not attempt to treat they here vandam in he book on great amours dissect rousseau 's heart ruthlessly for he ability to do this he must thank rousseau most for the unequalled frankness of he own biography franci greble dissect rousseau 's first love have neatly dub he the great high priest of those who kiss and tell the amiable piccinnus in this same war of operatic school and composer which rage in paris upon the reform of gluck the italian composer piccinnus be hale to the front as a unwilling opponent of gluck the world be needlessly cruel to those who happen to interfere in any way with the favorite of posterity and piccinnus 's name be a byword in the history of music we hear much of the unscrupulous opposition that he partisan make to the reform of gluck but we should also take into consideration the unscrupulous opposition that the partisan of gluck make to the prosperity and honest endeavor of piccinnus a man of no mean talent whose misfortune and not whose fault it be that he be not a genius of the first order but we be not concern here with the history of music only with the intimate history of musician piccinnus 's domestic life be so beautiful that it make it all the more pitiable that he should have be drag willy-nilly into a contest for which he have neither inclination nor ability piccinnus fall in love with a pupil like he a italian vicenza sibillum when he be twenty-eight he marry she he biographer ginguené say : she join to the charm of she sex a most beautiful and touching voice all that happy disposition assiduous study under so good a master could accomplish especially when teacher and pupil love each other passionately and be equally impassioned for the art which one teach and the other learn it be all that which you must imagine to get a idea of the talent of mme piccinnus he do not wish she to go on the stage where everything promise she the greatest success and the most brilliant fortune but at home almost every evening at the private concert or as the italian say in all the ` academy ' where one be glad to be invite she sing only she husband 's music she render it with the true spirit of the master and i have it from he that he never hear he work especially he ` cara cecchina ' sing with such perfect art and what would put it above art so much soul and expression as by he wife in 1773 piccinnus find himself suddenly deprive of the fickle support of the roman public worst of all it be he own pupil and protégé anfossus who supplant he the tender-hearted piccinnus like palestrina be so overcome with this humiliation that he fall ill and keep he bed for several month two year later the prince of brunswick 's younger brother go to naple to visit he and there he happen upon a domestic scene which give we a pretty notion of piccinnus 's home life he surprise piccinnus in the midst of he family and be amaze at the tableau piccinnus be rock the cradle of he youngest child bear that same year another of he child tug at he coat to make he tip over the cradle the mother revelling in the spectacle she flee in dismay at see the stranger who stand at the door enjoy the scene himself the young prince make himself known begged pardon for he indiscretion and say with feeling ' i be charm to see that so great a man have so much simplicity and that the author of the good daughter -lrb- one of he most successful opera -rrb- can be so good a father ' the next year 1776 piccinnus be call to pari as a unwilling conscript in the musical revolution which be rage no less fiercely than the american revolution of the same time it be a bitter December day when piccinnus arrive in pari with he wife and he eldest daughter aged eighteen devote to he art foreign to all intrigue to all ambition to the moral taste custom and language of the country piccinnus live in he family circle and devoted himself quietly to he work in oblivion of the effort that the gluckist make to thwart the success and even to prevent the representation of he work it must be say that gluck himself stoop to be the instigator of these intrigue in spite of all the day come for the presentation of piccinnus 's opera roland and the family break into tear when he go to the theater he alone be calm in the midst of this desolation reassure he wife and depart with he friend he return home in a triumph which be perhaps greater than the work deserve but certainly not greater than so good a man merit piccinnus be large-hearted enough to cherish no malice against either of he rival sacchinus or gluck when sacchinus die piccinnus deliver the funeral oration and when a year later gluck die in vienna piccinnus make a vain effort to organise a fitting memorial festival he remain upon the field of battle and the victory for the time must be grant he in spite of certain defeat then the french revolution break out and he lose he favor with the public and the friendship of the aristocracy become a danger to he very life he go to naple where he find some success and be well receive by the court but everything seem now to conspire against he the republican of pari have drive he to italy into the arm of the aristocracy there whereupon in 1792 he daughter marry a french republican this bring he into such disgrace with the italian court that he do not dare leave he house and fall into neglect and poverty in 1798 he make he way back to pari and there he reunited family give little opera sing by he wife and daughter here one hear with pleasure always new air take from he italian opera sing by mme piccinnus with a voice that age have render more grave and less light without make it less beautiful or touching and with a method as wise as it be learn and well oppose to these pretentious display these eternal embroidery which disfigure italian song to-day and which piccinnus never admit into he school but which he always detest so say ginguené of the theory of piccinnus which be not as we see so oppose to the theory of gluck as we be sometimes urge to believe in the course of time napoleon take up piccinnus but he be too old to revive under this new favor and ginguené have this last picture of he : it be in this state that he have the courage to give a concert at he home the small number of amateur who gather there will long remember the impression of that which one may call the last song of the swan they be profoundly move to hear mme piccinnus sing with due expression the beautiful air from ` zendium ' _ lasciamus o ciel pietoso _ compose in all the vigor of youth by this illustrious man now old and unfortunate he accompany it now with a languish hand but with eye relight by this beautiful production of he genius they will not forget the admirable ` sommeil d'aty ' nor the trio from ` iphigenia in auli ' execute as it have be in naple by the mother and the two daughter group behind a husband and father who seem in accompany they to be reborn in the touching accord of those voice so tender and so dear and to feel again some spark of that fire which have animated he when he produce those sublime work poor old piccinnus die in 1800 at the age of seventy-two and he tomb say that he be _ cher aux art et à l'amitie _ he leave to he widow and six child no property but the memory of he genius madame piccinni be give a pension but she proudly decline to accept it purely as a charity and ask that four pupil of the conservatoire be assign to she for instruction which be do piccinnus leave two son the younger have some success as a opera writer and the elder have a natural son who be quite successful as a composer of opera of the other participant in the gluck-piccinnus feud there be not much to say sacchinus be a man of notoriously luxurious and voluptuous life but i do not find that he marry salierus -- whom gluck assist in the most generous manner even to the extent of have one of salierus 's opera produce under he own name and declare the true author when it be a success -- be marry and have many daughter who lavish upon he much affection méhul be befriend by a doctor gastoldus and marry a daughter of he benefactor they have no child but adopt a nephew it may be well here while we be in the midst of opera composer to take a glance at some of the predecessor of these man begin with the first of all opera composer who in he declaration of what opera should be and do very curiously foreshadow almost the exact word of gluck and wagner revolutionist who be really reactionists chapter xii a few tunester of france and italy -- peri monteverde et al though it sound strange to speak of the invention of opera that be the word which may be apply to the work of jacopo perus and he friend they however think of it rather as a revival of the manner of the ancient greek tragedy which be in a sense a crude form of wagnerian recitation with musical accompaniment as the english novel owe its origin to the commission give to mr samuel richardson to prepare a ready letter writer which he decide to put in the form of a story tell in letter so grand opera which have almost rival the novel in the world 's favor find its origin in a conference among certain aristocratic gentleman of the city of florence concern the possibility of revive part of greek tragedy as a experiment they prepare a small work call dafne for private presentation at the palace of the corsus rinuccinus be the first of a long and usually incompetent lineage of librettist the music be write by perus and caccinus it be appropriate that they should have choose the love affair of the first musician orpheus and the coy daphne see what a vast amount of love-making pretended

genius pergolesus die in 1736 at the age of twenty-six it be consumption that carry he off and i find no record of any love of he the saccharine romance-monger elise polko have a rather mawkish story which she connect with he name though on what authority i be ignorant as lincoln say for those that like that sort of thing it be about the sort of thing they 'll like keiser a contemporary of he be reinhard keiser who die three year later at the age of sixty-six and who write one hundred and sixteen opera for the german stage like he contemporary händel he attempt management and like händel go into a magnificent bankruptcy but quite unlike the woman-hater händel he marry he way out of poverty in 1709 he enter into a matrimonial and financial partnership with the daughter of a aristocratic

a great admirer of the style of alessandro scarlattus a eminent composer both in opera and sacred music of whom little be know except he work he leave a son domenico who be hardly less famous but he be a confirm gambler and leave he family in great destitution from which the famous artificial soprano farinellus rescue they chapter xiii mozart as we come nearer to we own day the document concern the personal life of composer begin to multiply of the love of bach we have only that tantalise allusion to the stranger maiden of haydn we have amorous document enough to make a brochure when we reach mozart he letter alone fill two comfortable volume of beethoven there be still more numerous possession by wagner and liszt we be fairly overwhelmed search not for the artist 's self in he work of art this be good cautious advice but there be occasional exception and of these mozart be the most radiant the quality of eternal youth and of juventine gaiety of intimate tenderness of swagger that wink while it swagger of love that be ever deep but sunlit to the depth and of tragedy with a touch of fatalistic horror -- all those quality that be find scatter through he sonata and symphony and he various opera -- all the quality that be combine in don giovannus be the quality of mozart 's own nature always except the ruthlessness and the fanatic libertinism of he don juan schopenhauer say that the genius be he who never quite outgrow the childhood of he attitude toward the world mozart be always the sublime child all the quality of youth give life and personality to he letter and place they consequently among the most delightful letter in existence ludwig nohl collect most of they into two volume and lady wallace have translate they into english with a certain amount of inaccuracy but a surprising amount of spirit withal they may be pick up without much difficulty though they be out of print and any one interested in musician or in lover or in letter should make haste to add these two golden volume to he library as the first letter be write in he thirteenth year and the last in the thirty-fifth and final year of he life and as they constitute two volume of the size of this one it be manifest that i be here empower only to make a skim summary of he heart-history -- woe 's I the human affection grow by exercise mozart be so devoted and so enthusiastic in he fondness for he father and mother and he sister that he heart be graduate early for any demand the most unmusical people know that mozart stand unrivalled among infant prodigy that he be a pocket-paderewskus at a period when most child can not even trundle a hoop and that he be deep in composition before the usual child be out of kilt everybody have see the picture of the littler mozart and he little sister perch like robin on a piano stool and give a concert before crown head with the assistance of the father and the mother themselves musician the elder mozart make a life-work out of the career of he child though he be a gifted musician and a shrewd and intelligent man on he own account he be in no sense one of you child-beating brute who make a easy livelihood by turn they child into slave he believe that he son be capable of be one of the world 's greatest musician and he give a splendid and permanent demonstration of he theory through all he vicarious ambition he keep he son 's love and keep it almost to the point of idolatry indeed the boy once write next to god come papa the domestic relation of the family be indeed as happy as they well could be mozart 's letter to he sister marium anna who be nickname nannerl be brimful of cheerful affection and of sprightly interest in she own love affair he relation with he mother and father be full not only of filial piety but of that far better proof of real affection a playful humor mozart 's mother die in paris when she son and she be there alone together he write the news of she death to a friend of he father 's and bid he tell the father only that she be seriously ill but would probably recover and gradually to prepare he for the worst this letter he write at two o'clock in the morning the same night he write he father a long letter full of news incidentally say that he mother be very ill but that he hope for the best and that in any case resignation to the will of god be imperative a few day later he write another letter tell the bitter truth and tell it with most devout concern for he father 's health and reconciliation with the divine dispensation in this letter he seem rather the father to he own father than the young gallant of twenty-two it be a good heart the boy have mozart have be so much caress and flatter by court beauty as a child that he be precocious in flirtation he sister be the confidante and messenger of all sort of boyish amours there be a fine mysteriousness in the letter he write he mother while he be make a musical conquest of milan like a veteran musician and betray he fourteen-year-old boyishness only in such phrase as this : i kiss you hand a thousand time and have a great deal to say to my sister but what that be know only to god and myself please god i hope soon to be able to confide it to she verbally this do not sound like the writing of a composer who be add in a letter a few day later pray to god that my opera may be successful the opera be successful and the pope give he a knighthood and he be only fourteen year old perhaps this mysterious sweetheart be the same one he allude to later as annamindl and concern whom he send he sister such solemn message as these : do not i entreat forget about _ the one other _ where no other can ever be say to fraulein w von mölk that i rejoice at the thought of salzburg in the hope that i may again receive the same kind of present for the minuet which be bestow on I at a similar concert she know all about it carissima sorella -- spero che voi sarete stata dalla signora che voi già sapete my dearest sister -- i entreat you not to forget before you journey to perform you promise that be to make a certain visit i have my reason for this pray present my kind regard in that quarter but in the most impressive and tender manner -- the most tender and oh -- but i need not be in such anxiety i beg my compliment to roxalana who be to drink tea this evening with the sultan all sort of pretty speech to madlle mizerl she must not doubt my love i have she constantly before my eye in she fascinating _ négligé _ i have see many pretty girl here but not one whose beauty can be compare with hers the daughter of doctor barisanus the family physician be for a time he heart 's queen later rosa cannabich be the magnet and wendling 's daughter pay she visit to he heart 's best room these instance of puppy-love can have give little anxiety to the father and mother but soon old leopold begin to fear that this amorous activity might interfere with he son 's wedlock to he art when therefore he be sixteen year old and begin to take a solemn interest in a opera singer at munich to weep over the beauty of she singing and to seek she acquaintance the father begin to protest this be mlle keiserin the daughter of a cook and mozart be later a little ashamed of he easy enthusiasm there seem to be a imply affair perhaps more serious in this letter to he father date 1777 -- he be bear in 1756 : as to the baker 's daughter i have no objection to make i foresaw all this long ago this be the cause of my reluctance to leave home and find it so difficult to go i hope the affair be not by this time know all over salzburg i beg you dear papa most urgently to keep the matter quiet as long as possible and in the meantime to pay she father on my account any expense he may have incur by she entrance into the convent which i will repay gladly when i return to salzburg meanwhile he be well immerse in he dalliance with he bäsle or cousin in 1777 when mozart be twenty-one and travel on a concert-tour with he mother he meet at augsburg marianne mozart the daughter of he uncle a book-binder he experience at augsburg with certain impertinent snob disgust he with the place and he write he father that the meeting with he fair cousin be the only compensation of visit the town he find she pretty intelligent lovable clever and gay and like he rather incline to be satirical they strike up a correspondence which show he in most hilarious mood he letter be full of that _ possenhaften jargon _ with which he sprinkle he letter to he sister he call he cousin by the pet name of bäsle with which he rhyme häsle a colloquial word for rabbit he first letter to she overflow with nonsense and meaningless rhyme pun and quibble such as : ich hoffe sie werden auch meinen brief -- trief welchen ich ihnen aus mannheim geschrieben erhalten haben -- schaben desto besser besser desto lady wallace have make a translation which reproduce well the nonsense if not literally the sense this be a sample : my dear coz-buzz : -- i have safely receive you precious epistle -- thistle and from it i perceive -- achieve that my aunt -- gaunt and you -- shoe be quite well -- bell i have to-day a letter -- setter from my papa -- ah-ha safe in my hand -- sand a week later he write she a letter begin : my dear niece cousin daughter mother sister and wife -- potz himmel croatian demon witch hag and cross battery potz element air earth fire and water europe asia africa and america jesuit augustine benedictine capucin minorite franciscan dominican carthusian and knight of the cross privateer canon regular and irregular sluggard rascal scoundrel imp and villain all donkey buffalo oxen fool blockhead numskull and fox what means this four soldier and three shoulder-belt such a packet and no portrait it seem that she have promise he she picture she send it later and it be still in the mozart museum show she as jahn declare to have a good-natured and cheerful face and rather a stocky figure he add without be beautiful she seem right please it be certain that in whatever butterfly humor mozart regard she she take he and he kiss and he flowery declaration seriously have he not say in this very letter love I as i love you and then we shall never cease loving each other have he not thence break into french je vous baise vos main -- vôtre visage -- afin tout ce que vous I permettez de baiser je suis de tout mon coeur etc he sister later have a target paint for a club of salzburg friend who meet for crossbow practice and the target represent the melancholy farewell of two person dissolve in tear wolfgang and the bäsle he flirtation with he cousin seem to have anger he father who be eager for he to go to france and conquer pari the father be the more indignant as mozart be at the same time become entangled with aloysium weber -- of whom more later mozart love he father and treat he with the utmost respect but he could rise to a sense of he own dignity when the occasion demand and he write he : the bitter way in which you write about my merry and innocent intercourse with you brother 's daughter make I justly indignant but it be not as you think i require to give you no answer on the subject a few day later he write to he cousin with all the old hilarity he letter be mostly in doggerel rhyme beginning : you may think or believe that i have croak -lrb- _ crepirt _ -rrb- or kick the bucket -lrb- _ verreckt _ -rrb- but i beg you not to think so for how could i write so beautifully if i be dead nearly a year later he write to she regret that he could not have she visit he at kaisersheim and beg she to meet he in munich in munich it be mozart 's fate to find a tragedy await he for aloysium -lrb- whom he have love as solemnly as he have love he cousin frivolously and to whom he look forward longingly after he long absence -rrb- show herself indifferent he have plan that he cousin should have a great part to play in this meeting with aloysium this i would rather interpret as evidence that mozart be quite ignorant of any deep affection in he cousin there be nothing in he life that show he as anything other than the most tender-hearted of man and it be inconceivable that he should have bring he cousin to munich simply to drag she at the chariot of he triumph with aloysium and yet he flirtation with the bäsle certainly go past mere bantering and repartee she stay several week in munich and must have furnish mozart grateful diversion from he humiliation she go with he to salzburg and later when she return to she own home we find he write with the same exuberance address she as -- dearest best lovingest fairest enticingest by-an-unworthy-cousin-to-harness-broken with she name he pun on _ bäsle _ and _ bass _ thence _ bäschen oder violoncellchen _ -- a little bass-viol or violoncelline he write as he say to appease she alluring beauty -lrb- _ visibilium et invisibilia _ -rrb- heighten by wrath to the height of you slipper-heel then he write she a passionate parody on a poem of klopstock 's and write it in circular form around he own sketch of she portrait which imply neither beauty on she part nor art on he this be the last letter he seem ever to have write she excepting a business letter two year later and this mark the end of a flirtation which he seem to have regard as sheer frivolity but this be not she mood biographer jahn say : the bäsle seem to have take she cousin 's courtship seriously at least all the neighbor think from the way she speak of he that there be something of deluded expectation in she tone she speak neither gladly nor often of this time she be not musical and could not have have a proper appreciation of mozart 's artistic value he vivacity and velocity of musical performance seem comical to she of she later life nothing be know to I she live later with the postmaster streite in bayreuth and die there jan 25 1841 at the great age of eighty-three so much for the bäsle poor girl but while the hollyhock be take the bee 's fickleness so solemnly a rose be reveng she upon he a more serious -- for mozart a very serious -- affair be he infatuation with aloysium weber a fifteen-year-old girl with much beauty and little heart when mozart be in manheim in 1778 write flowery letter to the bäsle he have occasion to have certain music copy to be sing before the princess of orange who have become interested in he work the copyist be also a prompter in the theater and a very poor but hospitable man he name be weber and he brother become the father of carl marium von weber the composer the fact that weber be poor be the first recommendation to mozart another magnet be that weber have a daughter fifteen year old who be gifted with a voice and seem capable of a great artistic career it be this vicarious ambition that have interested he in the young singer keiserin some year before and now we find he write to he father on jan 17 1778 the follow description of the weber family : he have a daughter who sing admirably and have a lovely pure voice she be only fifteen she fail in nothing but in stage action be it not for that she might be the prima donna of any theater she father be a downright honest german who bring up he child well for which very reason the girl be persecute here he have six child -- five girl and a son he and he wife and child have be oblige to live for the last fourteen year on a income of 200 florin but as he have already do he duty well and have lately provide a very accomplished singer for the elector he have now actually 400 florin my aria for de ' amicis she sing to perfection with all its tremendous passage he and he mother have be live with the wendling frl wendling who have engage mozart 's interest for a time turn out to be a disreputable character and the father to be devoid of all religion the deeply pious mozart write in the same letter to he father friend who have no religion can not long be we friend then with man 's usual consistency he outline the white lie by which he be go to break off the association with the wendling and go on to say that he wish to form a similar connection with the weber family the daughter aloysium be improve vastly in she singing under he tuition he have write a aria especially for she and he plan a trip to italy principally for she benefit they could live very comfortably he say because aloysium 's eldest sister could cook the father weber remind he greatly of he own father and aloysium will be he be sure a congenial friend for nannerl mozart be so much in love with aloysium that in this long letter to he father he declare : i be so deeply touch with this oppressed family that my greatest wish be to make they happy and perhaps i may be able to do so i will be answerable with my life for she singing and she do credit to my recommendation i will gladly write a opera for verona for thirty zeccinus solely that madlle weber may acquire fame by it for if i do not i fear she may be sacrifice i have now write you of what be in my heart my mother be satisfy with my plan how well the mother be satisfy with the plan be evident from the postscript in she own hand add secretly to the letter and display a slight touch of motherly jealousy : no doubt you perceive by the accompany letter that when wolfgang make new friend he would give he life for they it be true that she do sing incomparably still we ought not to lose sight of we own interest i write this quite secretly while he be at dinner for i do not wish he to know it five day afterwards mozart recur to the subject refer to a friend who marry for money and comment : i hope never to marry in this way i wish to make my wife happy but not to become rich by she means the nobility must not marry from love or inclination but from interest and all kind of other consideration it would not at all suit a grandee to love he wife after she have do she duty and bring in to the world a heir to he property but we poor humble people be privileged not only to choose a wife who love we and whom we love but we may can and do take such a one because we be neither noble nor high-born nor rich but on the contrary lowly humble and poor we therefore need no wealthy wife for we wealth be in we head die with we and these no man can deprive we of unless he cut they off in which case we need nothing more next week he write again ask he father to concern himself for the weber the poor father have be implore wolfgang to go to pari for fame and fortune 's sake now he find he so far from be willing to pursue he own promising career that he wish to give up all thought of pari and subordinate he genius to the task of boost into fame the daughter of a poverty-stricken music-copyist leopold answer in the violent tone he could adopt on occasion and try to distract he son 's attention by appeal to he ambition he ask he to decide whether he wish to become a commonplace artist whom the world will forget or a celebrated capellmeister of whom posterity will read year after in book -- whether infatuate with a pretty face you one day breathe you last on a straw sack you wife and child in a state of starvation or after a well-spent christian life you die in honor and independence and you family well provide for get to pari without delay take you place by the side of really great people _ aut caesar ant nihil _ little the father could have realize how much truth there be to be in the dark side of he prophecy and that too in spite of the fact that he son take he advice leave aloysium behind the son and he mother go to pari he land there in the very midst of the tempest rage around gluck pari do not at all please mozart and the french people disgust he for this pari be not entirely to blame see that mozart have go there unwillingly and be part from he beloved aloysium it be in paris too that he mother die and now while he be so deeply concerned for aloysium 's career and be try so desperately to secure she a engagement in paris she be blandly forget he of this however he have no suspicion until he reach munich where she the star of he heart and of he ambition be wait for he what the change be that have come over aloysium it be impossible to tell the first thought be that have rise to prominence by mozart 's tuition and assistance she spurn the ladder that have uplift she but nohl 's theory that she head be turn by she admission to the favor that quickly surround the successful prima donna be hardly to be hold in view of the fact that in reject a man of mozart 's prominence she take the actor lange who have little if any more prominence it be doubtless simply the old story of the one who love and the other who let herself be love just to keep up practice until she learn to love elsewhere when mozart reach munich he be still in mourning for he mother and dress accord to the french custom of the time in red coat with black button he hurry to meet aloysium and feel at once the chill of she jilt the lip once so warm under he give he merely the formal german kiss she seem scarcely to recognize the one for whose sake once she shed so many tear whereupon mozart immediately fling himself upon the piano stool and sing in a loud voice with forced gaiety ich lass das mädel gern das mich nicht will -- which you might translate gladly i give up the girl that give up I it be on christmas day that mozart have hasten to the presence of he beloved for the christmas gift she give he back he heart and right gallantly he take it but he gaiety be hollow and when he go to the house of a friend he lock himself in a room and weep for day still he continue to live with the weber and to brave out he despair before they all he fear to turn to he father for full sympathy and he fear be apparently justified for he father seem only to have answer with rebuke he for he foolish dream of pleasure to this ill-timed reproof mozart answer : what do you mean by dream of pleasure i do not wish to give up dream for what mortal on the whole compass of the earth do not often dream above all dream of pleasure -- peaceful dream sweet cheer dream if you will -- dream which if realize would have render my life -lrb- now far rather sad than happy -rrb- more endurable in a few week however he return home to salzburg and there he cousin the bäsle who have brighten a part of he trial in munich follow he and this be in the month of January of the year 1779 as for aloysium she have cause enough to regret jilt one of the greatest as well as one of the most gentle soul in the world she marry the actor lange and live unhappily with he accord to jahn each both give and receive cause for jealousy year after mozart drift back into she vicinity under curious circumstance the lover become good friend and such friend that for he at least lange could not feel jealousy accord to jahn who add otherwise he would hardly have take the rôle of pierrot in the pantomime in which he wife play columbine and mozart the harlequin nohl thus sum up the whole affair : neither happiness nor riches brighten aloysium 's path in life nor the peace of mind arise from the consciousness of purity of heart not till she be a aged woman and mozart long dead do she recognize what he have really be she like to talk about he and he friendship and in thus recall the brightest memory of she youth some of that lovable charm seem to revive that mozart have impart to she and to all with whom he have any intercourse every one be captivate by she gay unassuming manner she freedom from all the usual virtuoso caprice in society and she readiness to give pleasure by she talent to every one as if a portion of the tender spirit with which mozart once love she have pass into she soul and bring forth fresh leaf from a withered stem but year of fault and folly intervene for aloysium meanwhile he part from she with much pain though the esteem with which he have hitherto regard she be no longer the same \* \* \* \* \* of all strange thing in the strange history of life upon this earth there can not be many more strange than this that mozart after be so sadly treat by this woman should have he next love affair with she youngest sister a novelist would not dare tax the credulity of he reader with such a plot but such impossibility and implausibility belong exclusively to the historian the weber move to vienna where aloysium be highly successful as a prima donna in march 1781 the archbishop to whom mozart play the part of musical lackey summon he to the same city the archbishop be one whose petty malicious and grind temper almost drive the pious mozart to contempt of all churchman at least he drive he finally to a declaration of independence which in we modern eye he be very long in reach the archbishop 's brother count arco be so infuriate at the impertinence of a mere musical flunkey like mozart daring to present a formal resignation that he heap abuse upon he and finally kick he out of the room everybody know about this kick but seemingly ignore the fact that mozart be restrain from retaliation only by the fact that he be in the apartment of the prince and that it be the dream of he life and he very definite plan to meet count arco and return the kick with interest but the archbishop and the count go back to salzburg and the opportunity do not occur the portrait usually present of mozart meekly accept the humiliation be of a piece with the legend that keat die of a broken heart because of a bitter review of he poetry the fact being of course that keat ' death be due to constitutional weakness and that the emotion inspire by the attack upon he art be a burning desire to punch the critic 's head strange to say mozart could not convince he pusillanimous father that he do not owe a apology to the archbishop for be kick but he be so deeply offended that he never return to salzburg so much for those who cherish the pathetic belief that the day of patron be of benefit to the artist and he art mozart do not starve upon be leave positionless in vienna the emperor desire to establish a national opera and mozart take up the composition of he die entführung aus dem serail in the first moment of he quarrel with the archbishop mozart have leave the retinue and seek room outside where could he go for a home but back to the household of the weber -- now more than ever in poverty since the good father have die and aloysium have marry soon after obtain she new engagement the very name of weber be a red rag to leopold mozart and he begin a series of bitter rebuke which the son answer with ample dignity and gentleness what you write about the weber i do assure be not the fact i be a fool about madame lange i own but what be a man not when he be in love but i do love she truly and even now i feel that she be not indifferent to I it be perhaps therefore fortunate that she husband be a jealous booby and never leave she so that i seldom have a opportunity of see she believe I when i say that old madame weber be a very obliging person and i can not serve she in proportion to she kindness to I for indeed i have not time to do so a little later one of mozart 's letter be interrupted and be finish in a strange hand as follow : you good son have just be summon by countess thun and he have not time to finish the letter to he dear father which he much regret and request I to let you know this for be post-day he do not wish you to be without a letter from he next post he will write again i hope you will excuse my p which can not be so agreeable to you as what you son would have write i beg my compliment to you amiable daughter i be you obedient friend constanze weber this be the first appearance in mozart 's correspondence of this name constanze weber be the younger sister of aloysium she have no dramatic or vocal ambition though she have musical taste and sing and play fairly well especially at sight strangely enough she have a unusual fondness for fugue and make mozart write down many of he improvisation the gossip of vienna lose no time in construe he renewal of friendship with the weber the buzz become so noisy that it reach the alert ear of the father in salzburg and he write demand that wolfgang should move at once mozart answer that he have be plan to move but only to quiet the gossip that he be to marry constanze -- ridiculous gossip he call it i will not say that living in the same house with the young lady to whom people have marry I i be ill-bred and do not speak to she but i be not in love with she i banter and jest with she when time permit -lrb- which be only in the evening when i chance to be at home for in the morning i write in my room and in the afternoon be rarely in the house -rrb- but nothing more if i be oblige to marry all those with whom i have jest i should have at least two hundred wife among the room elsewhere offer to mozart be one at aurnhammer 's the daughter of the family throw herself at mozart 's head with a vengeance accord to he picture of she she be so ugly and untidy that even mozart could not flirt with she he draw a amusing picture of he predicament -- a sort of venus and adonis affair with a homely venus : she be not satisfy with my be two hour every day with she -- i be to sit there the livelong day while she try to be agreeable but worse still she be seriously smitten with I i think at first it be a joke but now i know it to be a fact when i first observe it -- by she beginning to take liberty such as reproach I tenderly if i come later than usual or could not stay long and similar thing -- i be oblige to prevent she make a fool of herself to tell she the truth in a civil manner this however do no good and she become more loving than ever at last i be always very polite except when she begin any of she prank and then i snub she bluntly but one day she take my hand and say ` dear mozart do not be so cross you may say what you please i shall always like you ' all the people here say that we be to be marry and great surprise be express at my choose such a face she tell I that when she hear anything of the sort she always laugh at it i know however from a third person that she confirm it add that we be to travel immediately afterwards this do enrage I i tell she my opinion pretty plainly and warn she not to take advantage of my good nature now i no longer go there every day but only every two day so the report will gradually die away she be nothing but a amorous fool life in vienna have always be gay enough in those day it be far from prudish and mozart be always of unusual fascination for woman he love frivolity and go about much but he seem by no means to have deserve the reputation give he by the gossip of that time and this that he be a confirm rake it be impossible for any one acquaint with mozart 's career and letter to accuse he of studious hypocrisy and this accusation be necessary to support the theory that he be anything but a serious-minded toiler and for he time and surroundings a well-behaved and conscientious man he finally leave the home of the weber and have previously write he father as we have see that he be not at all in love with constanze but he be either in love with she without know it or he soon tumble headlong in love with she for soon after leave the house he plight he troth with she he be some time however in muster courage enough to break the news to he father to a letter date December 5 1781 he add a vague hint of new idea this be enough to provoke he father 's curiosity it be satisfy in mozart 's long reply of December 15th : my very dearest father you demand a explanation of the word in the closing sentence of my last letter oh how gladly long ago would i have open my heart to you but i be deter by the reproach i dread from even think of such a thing at so unseasonable a time although merely think can never be unseasonable my endeavor be direct at present to secure a small but certain income which together with what chance may put in my way may enable I to live -- and to marry you be alarm at this idea but i entreat you my dearest kindest father to listen to I i have be oblige to disclose to you my purpose you must therefore allow I to disclose to you my reason also and very well-grounded reason they be my feeling be strong but i can not live as many other young man do in the first place i have too great a sense of religion too much love for my neighbor to do so and too high a feeling of honor to deceive any innocent girl my disposition have always incline I more to domestic life than to excitement i never have from my youth upward be in the habit of take any charge of my linen or clothes etc and i think nothing be more desirable for I than a wife i assure you i be force to spend a good deal owe to the want of proper care of what i possess i be quite convinced that i should be far better off with a wife -lrb- and the same income i now have -rrb- for how many other superfluous expense would it save a unmarried man in my opinion enjoy only half of life but now who be the object of my love do not be startle i entreat you not one of the weber surely yes one of the weber -- not josepha not sophie but the third daughter constanze i never meet with such diversity of disposition in any family the eldest be idle coarse and deceitful -- crafty and cunning as a fox madame lange -lrb- aloysium -rrb- be false and unprincipled and a coquette the youngest be still too young to have she character define -- she be merely a good humored frivolous girl may god guard she from temptation the third however namely my good and beloved constanze be the martyr of the family and probably on this very account the kindest heart the cleverest and in short the best of they all she take charge of the whole house and yet do nothing right in they eye oh my dear father i could write you page be i to describe to you all the scene i have witness in that house she be not plain but at the same time far from be handsome she whole beauty consist of a pair of bright black eye and a pretty figure she be not witty but have enough of sound good sense to enable she to fulfil she duty as a wife and mother she dress be always neat and nice however simple and she can herself make most of the thing requisite for a young lady she dress she own hair understand housekeeping and have the best heart in the world i love she with my whole soul as she do I tell I if i could wish for a better wife all i now wish be that i may procure some permanent situation -lrb- and this thank god i have good hope of -rrb- and then i shall never cease entreat you consent to my rescue this poor girl and thus make i may say all of we quite happy as well as constanze and myself for if i be happy you be sure to be so dearest father and one-half of the proceeds of my situation shall be yours pray have compassion on you son this news be answer by a simoom of rage from salzburg the father have a partial justification for he wrath in the fact that a busybody have carry to he all manner of slander about mozart and likewise slander about constanze he write remind wolfgang of he mistake about aloysium and mention a rumor that wolfgang have be decoy into sign a write contract of marriage with constanze to this mozart write very frankly and in a manner that show constanze in a beautiful light : you be well aware that she father be no longer alive a guardian stand in he place to he -lrb- who be not acquaint with I -rrb- busybody and officious gentleman must have no doubt bring all sort of report such as that he must beware of I that i have no fixed income that i would perhaps leave she in the lurch etc etc the guardian become very uneasy at these insinuation we converse together and the result be -lrb- as i do not explain myself so clearly as he desire -rrb- that he insist on the mother put a end to all intercourse between she daughter and myself until i have settle the affair with he in write what could i do i be force either to give a contract in write or renounce the girl who that sincerely and truly love can forsake he beloved would not the mother of the girl herself have place the worst interpretation on such conduct such be my position the contract be in this form : ' i bind myself to marry madlle constanze weber in the course of three year and if it should so happen which i consider impossible that i change my mind she shall be entitle to draw on I every year for 300 florin ' nothing in the world could be easier than to write this for i know that the payment of 300 florin never would be exact because i could never forsake she and if unhappily i altered my view i would only be too glad to get rid of she by pay the 300 florin and constanze as i know she would be too proud to let herself be sell in this way but what do the angelic girl do when she guardian be go she desire she mother to give she the write paper say to I ` dear mozart i require no write contract from you i rely on you promise ' she tear up the paper this trait endear constanze still more to I the correspondence between father and son wax fast and furious mozart do not attempt to defend madame weber or the guardian but he will not have a word say against the devotion and honor of he constanze jealous perhaps of the activity of the prospective father-in-law madame weber now begin to go into training for a traditional rendition of the rôle of mother-in-law she make the life of she daughter and of mozart as miserable as possible and fix in they the determination that whatever happen they would not live with she after they be marry mozart and he sweetheart make a determine combination to win the affection of mozart 's sister and constanze send to nannerl many a little present apologising because she be too poor to send anything worth send finally she be bold enough to enclose a letter to nannerl the composition of such a letter under such circumstance be at best no easy matter and i can not help think that constanze have evolve a little model : my dear and value friend : -- i never should have be so bold as to yield to my wish and longing to write to you direct if you brother have not assure I that you would not take amiss this step on my part i do so from my earnest desire to make acquaintance by write at least with a person who though as yet unknown to I bear the name of mozart a name so precious to I may i venture to say that though i have not have the pleasure of see you i already love and esteem you as the sister of so excellent a brother i therefore presume to ask you for you friendship without undue pride i think i may say that i partly deserve it and shall wholly strive to do so i venture to offer you mine which indeed have long be yours in my secret heart i trust i may do so and in this hope i remain you faithful friend constanze weber my compliment to you papa with so much quarrel go on around they and concern they it be small wonder that the two lover be finally nag into the condition of such nervousness that they fall to quarrel with each other one feud add spice to the very first of these letter to constanze which she so carefully guard -- aloysium weber seem never to have preserve any of mozart 's correspondence it throw also a curious light on the social diversion of vienna society at that time vienna April 29 1782 my dear and beloved friend : -- you still i hope allow I to give you this name surely you do not hate I so much that i may no longer be you friend nor you mine and even if you do not choose henceforth to be call my friend you can not prevent my thinking of you as tenderly as i have always do reflect well on what you say to I to-day in spite of my entreaty you have meet I on three occasion with a flat refusal and tell I plainly that you wish to have no more to do with I it be not however a matter of the same indifference to I that it seem to be to you to lose the object of my love i be not therefore so passionate so rash or so reckless as to accept you refusal i love you too dearly for such a step i beg you then once more to weigh well and calmly the cause of we quarrel which arise from my be displeased at you tell you sister -lrb- nb in my presence -rrb- that at a game of forfeit you have allow the size of you leg to be measure by a gentleman no girl with become modesty would have permit such a thing the maxim to do as other do be well enough but there be many thing to be consider besides -- whether only intimate friend and acquaintance be present -- whether you be a child or a girl old enough to be marry -- but above all whether you be with people of much higher rank than yourself if it be true that the baroness -lrb- waldstädten -rrb- do the same still it be quite another thing because she be a _ passée _ elderly woman -lrb- who can not possibly any longer charm -rrb- and be always rather flighty i hope my dear friend that you will never lead a life like hers even should you resolve never to become my wife but the thing be past and a candid avowal of you heedless conduct would have make I at once overlook it and allow I to say if you will not be offend my dearest friend will still make I do so this will show you how truly i love you i do not fly into a passion like you i think i reflect and i feel if you feel and have feeling then i know i shall be able this very day to say with a tranquil mind : my constanze be the virtuous honorable discreet and faithful darling of she honest and kindly disposed mozart this letter seem to have end the quarrel -- the only one we know of they have for a week later in a letter to he father mozart imply that constanze and he be once more on excellent term also that nannerl have answer constanze 's letter with appropriate courtesy meanwhile in spite of the excitement of produce he opera and fight the strong opposition to it mozart be still more deeply absorb in gain he father 's consent to he marriage he briefly dismiss he account of he opera 's immense success and bend all he ardor to win over he father the agony of he soul quiver in every line vienna be alive with gossip some say that he and constanze be already marry he fear to compromise the woman he love he hint that if he can not wed she with he father 's blessing he will wed she without it meanwhile the young woman 's mother have by this time get the bit fast in she tooth now the baroness waldstädten have be touch by the trouble of the young lover and have invite constanze to visit she for some week this excite the mother 's apprehension perhaps not unwisely in view of the levity of the baroness ' standard of conduct and she insist upon constanze cut she visit short when constanze refuse this frau weber send word that if she do not return immediately the law would be send for she this threat drive mozart to desperation and the marriage degenerate into a race between the priest and the policeman fortunately the priest win the baroness write in person to the father for he consent advance mozart 1000 gulden to cover the 500 gulden which constanze would have as a marriage portion and secure they release from the delayful necessity of publish the banns romeo and he juliet be marry on August 4 1782 shortly after the wedding the father 's consent arrive it be a rather stingy consent however and warn mozart that he could not expect pecuniary assistance and that he ought to tell constanze of this fact there be a imply insult to the girl 's love in this ungracious remark and it sting mozart deeply for constanze who have tear up the contract of betrothal on a previous occasion have not be the girl to take money into account three day after the wedding mozart write to he father a long account of it with a promise that he and he bride would take the first opportunity of ask forgiveness in person no one attend the marriage but constanze 's mother and youngest sister herr von thorwarth in he capacity of guardian herr von zetto -lrb- landrath -rrb- who give away the bride and gilofsky as my best man when the ceremony be over both my wife and i shed tear all present -lrb- even the priest -rrb- be touch on see the emotion of we heart we sole wedding festivity consist of a supper which baroness waldstädten give we and indeed it be more princely than baronial my darling be now one hundred time more joyful at the idea of go to salzburg and i be willing to stake -- ay my very life that you will rejoice still more in my happiness when you really know she if indeed in you estimation as in mine a high-principled honest virtuous and please wife ought to make a man happy now we enter upon the test of this romantic devotion -- this wedlock of the twenty-six year old musician and the maiden of nineteen who marry in spite of the opposition of both family and in spite of the poverty that await they there be many account of the domestic career of these two write in a tone of patronage or cynicism but this tone be gratuitous on the part of those who assume it as thorough a study of the fact and document as i can make show no ground whatsoever for refuse to accept this love-match as a ideal wedding of ideal congeniality and mutual and common devotion poverty come with all its vicissitude and settle upon the hearth but we ought not to forget that both wolfgang and constanze have always be poor that they be use to poverty and be light-hearted in its presence when they have no money to buy fuel they be find dancing together to keep warm surely for two such heart poverty be only a detail and could in no sense be count of sufficient weight to counterbalance the affection each find in each as for mozart 's career we must feel that no amount of wealth would have avail against he improvidence and he extravagance in the small way in which fate permit he to be extravagant nor could a life of bachelorhood or a life with some woman marry for money conceivably have make he produce greater composition -- for no greater composition than those he produce during he married life have ever be produce by any composer under any circumstance let we then read without conviction such account as we may find tend to belittle the goodness or cheapen the virtue of constanze or of mozart the weber have live at vienna in a house call auge gotte and mozart use to refer to he elopement as die entführung aus dem auge gotte as a pun on the name of the opera that have make he marriage possible die entführung aus dem serail it be a curious coincidence that the name of the principal character of this opera be constanze and that she be a model of devotion through all trial once away from the wrangle mother-in-law the young couple enjoy domestic bliss to the height later mother weber seem to have reform and to have become a welcome guest in mozart 's house where aloysium herself become also a cherish friend nothing could exceed the tenderness of the lover for each other it continue to the last constanze be so watchful of he that she cut up he meat at dinner when he mind be on he composition lest he might cut himself she use to read aloud to he and tell he story and hear he improvisation and insist upon they be write out for permanence while the wife be show all this solicitude the husband genius though he be be show equal tenderness to the wife all vienna gossip about he devotion when she be ill he be the most assiduous of nurse and on one occasion get so into the habit of put he finger to he lip and say psst to any one who enter the room where she be sleep that on one occasion on be speak to in the street he involuntarily place he finger on he lip and give the warning signal when he be call away from home early before she be awake he would leave such a note for she as this : _ guten morgen liebe weibchen ich wünsche dass du gut geschlafen habest _ etc or as it run in english : good morning my darling wife i hope that you sleep well that you be undisturbed that you will not rise too early that you will not catch cold nor stoop too much nor overstrain yourself nor scold you servant nor stumble over the threshold of the adjoining room spare yourself all household worry till i come back may no evil befall you i shall be home at -- o'clock punctually two week after the marriage we find mozart write to he father in this tone : indeed previous to we marriage we have for some time past attend mass together as well as confess and take holy communion and i find that i never pray so fervently nor confess so piously as by she side and she feel the same in short we be make for each other and god who order all thing and consequently this also will not forsake we they look forward with great eagerness to visit salzburg and it be not the least evidence of the kindness of constanze 's heart that one of she chief ambition seem to have be the win over of the father and the sister the visit home be to be in November 1782 but the weather grow very cold and the wife 's condition forbid mozart write to he father that he wife carry about a little silhouette of you which she kiss twenty time a day at least he letter be full of little domestic joy such as a ball last from six o'clock in the evening until seven in the morning -- a game of skittle of which constanze be especially fond -- a concert where aloysium sing with great success a aria mozart write for she -- and financial trouble of the most petty and annoying sort in June 1783 mozart write he father ask he to be godfather to the expect visitor who be to be name after the grandfather either leopold or leopoldine accord as fate decide fate decide that the first-born should be a son and the young couple start gaily to salzburg for a visit but fate also decide that the visit should not be in any sense a success even as they set forth they be stop at the carriage by a creditor who demand thirty gulden -lrb- about $ 15 -rrb- a small sum but not in mozart 's power to pay at salzburg mozart 's father and sister seem not to have outdo themselves in cordiality and worst of all the poor little fat baby die after six month of life there be little profit and less pleasure in describe the financial trouble of the young couple they be generally blame for extravagance and bad management for which constanze be chiefly hold responsible but there be many reason for disbelieve this charge perhaps the chief of all be old leopold mozart 's own statement that when he visit they he find they very economical that be praise from sir hubert of mozart 's devotion to he wife in the depths of he heart there can be no doubt but the circle he move in and he volatile mischievous beauty-idolising nature play havoc with he good intention though not to the extent imply by some critic who have picture he as a reckless voluptuary but just herein be the final proof of constanze 's devotion and she understanding of he for while there never be a breath of slander against herself she find heart to forgive mozart 's fickleness he actually make she the confessional of he excursion from the path of rectitude and find forgiveness there he love she dearly and confide everything to she even he little sin and she requite he with tenderness and true solicitude she always say one have to forgive he one have to be good to he since he be himself so good four child be bear to the devoted couple all son the first child live as we have see only six month the second be name carl the third be name leopold the fourth wolfgang amadeus nohl say he wife 's recovery on these occasion be always very tedious in 1787 mozart 's father die and he letter to he sister show the depth of he grief nannerl have marry three year before she first lover have relinquish she on account of she poverty but she have capture a widower of means and position mozart 's letter to constanze be not very numerous because he be away from home neither often nor long but they make up in tenderness and radiant congeniality what they lack in number in 1789 he decide that a concert tour be necessary to replenish he flatten resource and to take he out of the rut in which the emperor be gradually drop he as a mere composer of dance music for mask ball at the court mozart travel in the carriage of he friend and pupil prince carl lichnowsky and those who consider railroad travel unpoetical will do well to read in mozart 's and beethoven 's letter the vivid picture of the downright misery and tedium of the traveller of that time even in a princely carriage to say nothing of the common diligence mozart write to he wife frequently and always in the most loverly fashion he end he first letter on this journey as follow : at nine o'clock at night we start for dresden where we hope to arrive to-morrow my darling wife i do so long for news of you perhaps i may find a letter from you in dresden may providence realize this wish -lrb- _ o gott mache meine wünsche wahr _ -rrb- after receive my letter you must write to I poste restante leipzig adieu love i must conclude or i shall miss the post kiss we carl a thousand time for I and -lrb- _ ich bin dich von ganzem herzen küssend dein ewig getreuer mozart _ -rrb- i be kiss you with all my heart you ever faithful mozart _ adieu aime-moi et gardez votre santé si précieuse a votre époux _ in he next three day later he say : my darling wife : -- would that i have a letter from you if i be to tell you all my folly about you dear portrait it would make you laugh for instance when i take it out of

king what i have write to you must rest between ourselves he disappointment at the meager financial return from he tour be embittered by the serious illness of he constanze and the drain upon he sympathy he time and he money it be necessary for he to despatch in various direction a series of those pathetic beg letter that make up so much of he later correspondence shortly after the failure of he concert tour desperation goad he to set forth again he write again to he _ herzen weibchen _ or he _ herzaller-liebste _ with renew hope : i be quite determine to do the best i can for myself here and shall then be heartily glad to return to you what a delightful life we shall lead i will work and work in such a manner that i may never again be place by unforeseen event in so distressing a

many a tear have fall on it but now let we be merry look swarm of kiss be fly about -- quick catch some i have catch three and delicious they be this tour be again unsatisfactory he come back almost poorer than he go in march 1791 constanze have to go to baden to take the water for she health mozart write a letter in advance engaging room for she and take great care that they be on the ground floor while constanze be at baden mozart be get deeper and deeper into financial hot water but he letter betray great anxiety that she should not be worry especially as she be about to become a mother again one of he letter to she be as follow part of it be french which i have not translate and the rest in german part of which also it seem more vivid to leave in the original : ma très-chère épouse : -- j' écris cette lettre dans la petite chambre au jardin chez leitgeb -lrb- a salzburg horn-player -rrb- où j' be couché cette nuit excellement -- et j' espère que ma chère épouse aura passé cette nuit aussi bien que moi j' attend avec beaucoup d'impatience une lettre que m ` apprendra comme vous avez passé le jour d'hier je tremble quand je pense au baigne de st antoine car je crain toujor le risque de tomber sur l'escalier en sortant -- et je I trouve entre l'espérance et la crainte -- une situation bien désagréable si vous n'éties pas grosse je craignerais moin -- mais abandonons cette idée triste -- le ciel aura eu certainement soin de ma chère stanza maria i have this moment receive you dear letter and find that you be well and in good spirit madame leitgeb tie my neck-cloth for I

ebben die comodität adieu 1000 tender kiss ever you mozart it be evident that during she stay in baden some person attempt familiarity with constanze and be reward with a box on the ear mozart write playfully to she advise she to be even more generous with she punishment and suggest that the man 's wife would probably assist she if inform it be about this time that mozart be implicate by the gossip in a domestic tragedy frau hofdämmel be a pupil of mozart 's whose husband grow fiendishly jealous of she attack she with a razor wound she almost to death and then commit suicide the story gradually grow up that mozart be the cause of the man 's jealousy and otto jahn in he first edition of he monumental biography accept the story which he later discard after köchel another biographer have succeed in prove that the assault and suicide take place five day after mozart 's death hofdämmel seem to have be so far from jealousy of mozart that he be one of the elect to whom mozart apply for a loan there be however a young and beautiful singer henriette baranius in berlin who seem to have weave a stray web around mozart while he be there in 1789 -- 90 she sing in he entführung and it be say that he friend have to help he out of he entanglement with she but jahn scout the idea among the most dramatic and therefore the most familiar incident of mozart 's life be the strange story of the anonymous commission he receive to write a requiem mass we be sure now that it be count walsegg who wish to palm off the composition as one of he own to mozart however there be something uncanny in the whole matter and he could not work off the suspicious dread that the death-music he be write be a omen of he own end shortly before he father have die mozart have write he a letter beg he to be reconcile to death when it should come and speaking of death as this good and faithful friend of man and add : i never lie down at night without think young as i be that i may be no more before the morning dawn constanze have be away for the cure at baden return to find he suddenly decline in health to divert he she take he for a drive but he could talk only of he death and of he morbid conviction that he have be poison constanze greatly alarmed call in the family physician doctor closset he blame mozart 's state to overwork and overabsorption in the composition of the requiem mass which he toil at and brood over until he swoon away in he chair after a brief recovery of spirit he sink rapidly again and could not leave he bed constanze attend he devoutly and she younger sister sophie and she mother now much endear to mozart be very solicitous and attentive it be sophie who describe in a letter the last hour of this genius who die at the age of thirty-five mozart even in he ultimate agony be most solicitous for he wife and say to sophie that she must spend the night at the house and see he die when she try to speak more cheerfully he would only answer : i have the taste of death on my tongue i smell the grave and who can comfort my constanze if you do not stay here sophie go home to tell she mother and constanze follow she to the door beg she for god 's sake to go to the priest at st peter 's and ask one of they to call as if by chance but the priest hesitate for some time and she have great difficulty in persuade one of these unchristian father to do as she wish after a long search the family doctor be find at the theater but he would not come until the end of the piece and then order cold application to mozart 's feverish head which shock he into unconsciousness he die at one o'clock in the morning of November 5 1791 and the last movement of he lip be a effort to direct where the kettledrum should be sound in he requiem the ruling passion crowd the next day pass the house of mozart and weep before he window as for constanze she grief be boundless and she stretch herself out upon he bed in the hope of be attack by he disease think to be malignant typhus she wish to die with he she grief be indeed so fierce that it break she health completely she be take to the home of a friend and by the time of he funeral she be unable to leave the house on that day so furious a tempest rage that the friend decide not to follow the coffin through the driving rain and sleet so the body go unattended to the cemetery and be thrust into a pauper 's grave three corpse deep it be some time before constanze be strong enough to leave the house she then go to the cemetery to find the grave it could not be identify and never since have it be find no one have tip the old sexton to strengthen he memory of the resting-place and it be a new and ignorant sexton that greet the anxious constanze there be those who speak ill of this devoted wife and even mr krehbiel whose book of essay i have quote from with such pleasure speak of constanze as indifferent to the disposition of the mortal remains of she husband whose genius she never half appreciate for this and other slighting allusion to constanze in other biography there exist absolutely no support evidence but for the highest praise of she wifely devotion she patience and unchanging love and for she lofty admiration of mozart both as man and musician there be a superfluity of proof after he death she find herself in the deepest financial distress and be compel to appeal to the emperor for a small pension which he grant she nobility of character can be see also in the concert of she husband 's work which she arrange and with such success that she pay all mozart 's debt some three thousand gulden -lrb- $ 1500 -rrb- thus she take the last stain from he memory she also interested herself like mr purcell in the publication of she husband 's composition she be only twenty-seven when he die and she interest in he honor as well as the conspicuous motherliness she show to the child he have leave she be all the more praiseworthy neimtschek who publish a biography of mozart in 1798 emphasise she fidelity to we raphael of music she grief still keen for he and she devotion to the child he leave fatherless and penniless for eighteen year constanze mourn she husband indeed she never cease to mourn he but after nearly a score of year in 1809 when she have reach the age of forty-five she be seek in marriage by a councillor from denmark george nicolaus von nissen he undertake the education of she two boy and win she hand she live with he in copenhagen till 1820 when she return to salzburg the quaintness of this affair should not blind we to the unusual depth of affection it reveal constanze inspire even she new husband with such devotion to mozart 's fame that nissen write a biography of he predecessor in she affection there can not be many instance of a second husband write a eulogistic biography of the first but nissen write he with a candor and enthusiasm that speak volume for he goodness and for that of constanze he die however before the biography be complete and constanze finish it herself she include in the publication a portrait of nissen and a tender tribute to he memory many of the most beautiful anecdote of mozart 's life we owe to nissen 's gentle unjealousy and constanze could frankly sign herself widow of staatsrath nissen previously widow of mozart she include a anonymous poem on mozart 's death beginning : will ist dein grab will duften die cypressen which be in its way evidence enough that she do not hold herself or she indifference responsible for the dingy entombment of this genius and the disappearance of he grave as she last word to the public she say : may the reader accept this apologetic this intimate love-offering in the spirit in which it be give salzburg 1828 what reader can refuse this sympathy to one who feel and give so much to one who crave sympathy as the very food of he soul when constanze be elderly and the second time widow she be accord to crowest visit by a english lady and she husband -- a eminent musician -- both of whom be anxious to converse with the relict of the great master notwithstanding the year that have pass frau nissen 's enthusiasm for she first husband be far from extinguish she be much affect at the regard which the visitor show for he memory and willingly enter into conversation about he mozart she say loved all the art and possess a taste for most of they he could draw and be a excellent dancer he be generally cheerful and in good humor rarely melancholy though sometimes pensive indeed she continue he be a angel on earth and be one in heaven now constanze outlive she second husband by sixteen year and die in march 1842 at the age of seventy-eight composer ' widow live long take in the entirety in shine and shade footlights and firelight for poorer for richer for all that could torment or delight a sensitive artist a great gentle-souled creative genius as well as a tender and sympathetic woman the married life of wolfgang and constanze mozart must be place among the most satisfactory in the catalogue of the relation of man and woman they be lover always chapter xiv beethoven : the great bumblebee no artist have ever penetrate further for none have ever thrust the thorn of life deeper into he own heart and win by the surrender of it he success and he immortality so say the profuse ludwig nohl in he reprint of the diary of a young spanish-italian woman fanny giannatasio del rio who know beethoven well and love he well and as mutely as a violet bloom at he foot in utter disregard beethoven the man would be vote altogether impossible either as friend or as lover if he have not have so marvellous so compulsive a genius he be short pock-marked ugly slovenly surly to the point of ferocity whimsical to the brink of mania egotistic to the environs of self-idolatry diseased and deaf embittered morose -- all the brutal epithet you wish to hurl at he but withal he have the majesty of a prometheus chained to the rock like prometheus he have steal the very fire of heaven like prometheus he do not suffer in silence but roar or moan he demigodlike anguish in immortal rhythm a strange contrast he make with the versatile the catholic the elegant and cheerful goethe he acquaintance and he rival in collect woman 's love into a encyclopaedic emotional life beethoven unlike he fellow giant händel despise the pleasure of the table he substitute a passion for nature no man on earth can love the country as i do he write and prove it in he life he mother die when he be young and he find a foster-mother in frau von breuning of bonn she daughter eleonore nickname lorchen seem to have win he heart awhile she knit he a angola waistcoat and a neckcloth which bring tear to he eye they spat and he write she two humbly affectionate note which you may read with much other intimate matter in the two volume of he publish letter he still have she silhouette in 1826 when he be fifty-six three year before he have succumb at the age of twenty to the charm of barbara koch the daughter of a widow who keep the café where beethoven eat she make it almost a salon of intellectual conversation barbara later become a governess in the family of count von belderbusch whom eventually she marry next be the highborn blonde and coquettish jeannette d'honrath who use to tease he by singing ironical love ditty then come fräulein westerhold whom he love vainly in the wertherlike fashion doctor wegeler who marry eleonore von breuning say that in vienna at all event while i be there from 1794 to 1796 beethoven be always in love with some one and very often succeed in make a conquest where many a adoni would have find it most difficult to gain a hearing i will also call attention to the fact that so far as i know each of beethoven 's beloved one be of high rank to continue the catalogue there be a picture extant of a cupid singeing psyche 's wing with a torch it be inscribe : a new year 's gift for the tantalising countess charlotte von brunswick from she friend beethoven there be magdalena willmann a singer whom he as a youth befriend and propose to in later day only to be refuse because he be very ugly and half crazy as she tell she niece a army captain cut he out with fräulein d'honrath he good friend stephan von breun win away from he the schöne und hochgebildete julie von ver whom beethoven love and by whom he be encouraged she marry stephan in 1808 and die eleven month later after beethoven have dedicate to she part of a concerto he write a letter beautiful with sympathy to poor stephan then he love fräulein thérèse von malfattus and beg she in vain to marry he he call she the volatile thérèse who take life so lightly she marry the baron von droszdick we have a letter wherein beethoven say : farewell my dearest thérèse i wish you all the good and charm that life can offer think of I kindly and forget my folly she have a cousin mathilde -- later the baroness gleichenstein -- who also leave a barb in the well-smitten and accessible target of he heart even hummel the pianist be he successful rival in a love affair with fräulein roeckel the hungarian countess marie erdödy -lrb- _ née _ countess niczky -rrb- be list among he flame though schindler think it nothing more than a friendly intimacy between the two still she give beethoven a apartment in she house in 1809 and he write that she have pay a servant extra money to stay with he -- a task servant always require bribe to achieve but thayer say that such a ménage could not last as beethoven be too irritable too freakish and too stubborn too easily injure and too hardly reconcile beethoven dedicate to she certain trio and she erect in one of she park in hungary a handsome temple in he honor with a inscription of homage to he in he letter he call she he confessor and in one he address she as liebe liebe liebe liebe gräfin show that she be he dearie to the fourth power also there be amalie sebald a nut-brown maid of berlin a twenty-five-year-old singer of beauty and brain in a letter to tiedge in 1812 beethoven say : two affectionate word for a farewell would have suffice I alas not even one be say to I the countess von der recke send I a pressure of the hand it be something and i kiss she hand as a token of gratitude but amalie have not even salute I every day i be angry at myself in not have profit by she sojourn at teplitz seek she companionship sooner it be a frightful thing to make the acquaintance of such a sweet creature and to lose she immediately and nothing be more insupportable than thus to have to confess one 's own foolishness be happy if suffer humanity can be give on my part to the countess a cordial but respectful pressure of the hand and to amalie a right ardent kiss -- if nobody there can see in nohl 's collection of beethoven 's letter be a inscription in the album of the singer mine auguste sebald -lrb- a mistake for amalie -rrb- the inscription read as lady wallace ungrammatically english it : ludwig van beethoven : who even if you would forget you never should in another work nohl mention the existence of a mass of short note from beethoven to she showing not so much the warm effervescent passion of youth as the deep quieter sentiment of personal esteem and affection which come later in life and in consequence be much more lasting one of the letter he quote it run : what be you dream about say that you can be nothing to I we will talk this over by word of mouth i be ever wish that my presence may bring peace and rest to you and that you could have confidence in I i shall hope to be better to-morrow and that we shall be able to pass a few hour together in the enjoyment of nature while you remain here good night dear amalie many many thanks for the proof you give I of you attachment to you friend beethoven there be other of these note in thayer 's biography she seem to have call the composer a tyrant and he have much playfulness of allusion to the idea and there be much about the wretchedness of he health amalie sebald seem to have be of great solace to he but like all the rest she marry some one else justice-councillor krause it be for she that beethoven compose he cycle of song to the far-away love _ -lrb- a die ferne geliebte -rrb- _ accord to thayer and of she that he write to rie : all good wish to you wife i alas have none i have find but one and she i can never possess year later he say to he friend giannatasio that five year before he have love unhappily he would have consider marriage the happiness of he life but it be not to be think of for a moment almost a utter impracticability a chimera still he say he love be as strong as ever he have never find such harmony and though he never propose he could never get she out of he mind in 1812 carl marium von weber be in berlin and become ever after a devoted admirer of amalie 's virtue she intellect and she beauty five year later we learn of beethoven 's receive letter and present from a bremen maiden a pianist elise müller and there be a poetess who also annoy he in this same year 1817 he be much in the society of the beautiful and amiable frau marie l pachler-koschak of gratz he have meet she in 1812 and admire she playing as late as 1826 we have letter from she invite he to visit she in gratz but in 1817 -- he be then forty-seven year old -- the acquaintance be so cordial that schindler who observe it call it a autumnal love though the woman 's son later assert that it be only a kinship of artistic sympathy -- in fact beethoven call she a true foster-mother to the creation of he brain thayer say however that beethoven never meet she till after she marry beethoven be implicate in the riddle of the letter of bettina brentano von arnim this freakish young woman have some acquaintance with goethe and after he death publish letter allege to have be send to she by he she also give the world certain letter say to have come to she from beethoven it have be pretty well prove that the naive bettina be a ardent and painstaking forger on a large scale she include a series of sonnet which be write to another of goethe 's garden of girl before he ever meet bettina but she appear to have vitiate she clever forgery by a certain alloy of truth and it may be that she beethoven letter be after all fiction found on fact the language of these letter be somewhat overstrained but beethoven could rant on occasion and ludwig nohl believe the letter to be genuine since a friend of he say he have see they and recognize beethoven 's script thayer accept the entanglement with bettina as a fact and think it be at that crisis in beethoven 's life a happy circumstance that bettina brentano come with she beauty she charm and she spirit to lead he thought in other path wegeler have allude to the fact that beethoven 's love affair be always with woman of high degree but other have call he a promiscuous lover because he once use to stare amorously at a handsome peasant girl and watch she labor in the garden only to be mock by she and more especially because of a memorandum of he pupil rie who write : beethoven never visit I more frequently than when i live in the house of a tailor with three very handsome but thoroughly respectable daughter in 1804 beethoven write he a twit allusion to these girl but such a flirtation mean little and besides they be beauty these daughter of the tailor and beethoven 's own mother be a cook rie describe he as a sad flirt beethoven have a great liking for female society especially young and beautiful girl and often when we meet out-of-door a charming face he would turn round put up he glass and gaze eagerly at she and then smile and nod if he find i be observe he he be always fall in love with some one but generally he passion do not last long once when i tease he on he conquest of a very beautiful woman he confess that she have enchant he longest and most seriously of all -- namely seven whole month rie also record a humourous scandal of a occasion when he find beethoven flirt desperately with a fair unknown rie sit down at the piano and improvise incidental music to beethoven 's direction -- _ amoroso a malinconico _ and the like once a devoted admirer wife of a vienna pianist long for a lock of the composer 's outrageously unkempt hair and ask a friend to get she one at he suggestion beethoven who be a practical joker of boorish capability send she a tuft from the chin of a goat the trick be discover and the scorned woman vent she fury in a letter the repentant beethoven make ample apology to she and spend he wrath on the head of the suggester of the mischief crowest spin a pretty yarn of beethoven 's act as _ postillon d'amour _ by carry love letter for a clandestinely

more be to come and yet in the face of such a directory of desire you 'll find von seyfry and haslinger venture the statement that beethoven be never marry and what be more marvellous still never have any love passage in he life while franci hueffer can speak of he grand chaste way on this latter point there be room for debate crowest adopt both side at once by say : in the main authority concur in beethoven 's attachment be always honorable there can be no doubt however that he be a impetuous suitor ready to continue a acquaintance into a more serious bond on the slenderest ground and without the slightest regard to the consequence on either side thayer take a middle ground -- that in the vienna of he time and he social grade it be impossible that beethoven should have be a puritan while he be however a man of distinctly clean mind he could not endure loose talk and he once box the ear of a barmaid who tease he all he life he have a horror of intrigue with another man 's wife and he once snub a man who conduct such a affair why then thus warm-hearted and clean-hearted thus woman-loving do he never marry ah here be one of the sombrest tragedy of art to say poor beethoven be like pity the sick lion in he lair yet what be more pitiful love be the thorn in this lion 's flesh and there be no fräulein androcle to take it away beethoven be bear to the humblest station and the haughtiest aspiration be leave to a sot and a slave-driver for a father and be early orphan of he mother in the first letter we have of he he say : she be a good and tender mother to I she be my best

ambition frustrated of love unsated or unreturned of friendship misprize or think to be misprize and then he deafness when he be only thirty the black fog of silence begin to sink across he life two year later he be stone-deaf and nearly half he day be spend in the dungeon of isolation from real communion with man or with he own great music he live indeed as he say _ inter lacrima et luctum _ the blind be usually placid and trustful it be the major affliction of the deaf that they grow suspicious of they intimate and abhorrent of themselves there be nothing in history more majestic than the battle of this giant soul against he doom nothing more heartrending than he bitter outcry nothing loftier than he high determination to serve he turn on earth in spite of all he be the very king lear of music trudge he lonely way with heart broken and hair wild in the storm that buffet he vainly toward the cliff of self-destruction to such a man a home be a refuge pitifully need and for a while longingly seek i have mention various woman to whom he offer the glorious martyrdom that a life with he must need have be there be two other whom he deeply love one of these be the famous italienne whose very name be honey and romance as he write it in the dedication of he moonlight sonata -lrb- op 27 no 2 -rrb- -- _ alla damigella contessa giulietta guicciardus _ it be in 1802 when he be thirty-two and she eighteen that he write she so luscious name on the lintel of that sonata so deep with yearning so delicious in its middle mood and so passionately despair in its close she have be he pupil she tell otto jahn long year after when she be sixty-eight year old that beethoven have first inscribe to she the rondo op 51 no 2 but in he fickle way he transcribe it to the countess lichnowsky and put she own name over the moonlight sonata instead it be probably the beauty and tender reciprocation of giulietta that inspire beethoven to write to wegeler in 1801 : life have be a little brighter to I of late since i have mingle more with my fellow i think you can have no idea how sad how intensely desolate my life have be during the last two year my deafness like a spectre appear before I everywhere so that i flee from society and be oblige to act the part of a misanthrope though you know i be not one by nature this change have be work by a dear fascinating girl whom i love and who love I after two year i bask again in the sunshine of happiness and now for the first time i feel what a truly happy state marriage might be unfortunately she be not of my rank in life be it otherwise i could not marry now of course so i must drag along valiantly but for my deafness i should long ago have compass half the world with my art -- i must do it still there exist for I no greater happiness than work at and exhibit my art i will meet my fate boldly it shall never succeed in crush I but giulietta go over to the great majority of beethoven 's sweetheart and married wisely otherwise three year after at she father 's behest she wed a writer of ballet music the count gallenberg to whom beethoven later advance money twenty year afterward in 1823 beethoven write in one of those conversation-book which he deafness compel he to use : i be well beloved of she more than ever she husband be love she come to see I and weep but i scorn she -lrb- he write it in french j' étais bien aimé d'elle et plus que jamais son époux et elle cherche moi pleurant mais je la méprisais -rrb- and he add : if i have part thus with my strength as well as my life what would have remain to I for nobler and better thing giulietta be long credit with be the woman to whom he write those three famous letter or rather the one with the two postscript find in the secret drawer of a old cabinet

thine ever mine ever each other 's these impassioned letter to he immortal beloved be believe by schindler to have be intend for giulietta and date by he at first in 1803 and then in 1806 but thayer after show how careless beethoven be of date and how inaccurate decide that these letter could not have be write before 1804 since giulietta be marry nov 3 1803 to count gallenberg she could not have be the one whose life he hope to share who then remain thayer suggest that the woman thus honor may have be another thérèse the countess thérèse von brunswick she be the cousin of giulietta whose husband say of beethoven that thérèse adore he about the time of these letter he write to she brother kiss you sister thérèse and later he dedicate to she he sonata op 78 some month after this he give up he marriage scheme of thérèse thayer say that she live to a great age -- _ ça va san dire _ -- and be famed for a noble and large-hearted but eccentric character as for remembrance of beethoven one may apply to she the word of shakespeare ` she die and give no sign ' be it perhaps that she do not dare even after see the above word in type i be able to add something more definite to thayer 's argument -- if one be to believe a book i stumble on in a old bookshop and have not find mention in any of the beethoven bibliography the book bear every sign of tell the truth as it make no effort at the charm of fiction it be by miriam tenger who claim to have know the countess thérèse well for many year and who describe the adoration with which she friend regard she the painter peter von cornelius call she the most remarkable woman i have ever know she be a scholar in the classic a piano pupil of mozart and beethoven he go on and a woman who must have be rarely beautiful in she youth only a perfectly pure spirit could give the gentle look in she large dark eye she speak with inimitable beauty and clearness because she be inwardly so transparent and beautiful almost like a beatify spirit he tell fräulein tenger the story of a early encounter of thérèse and beethoven she be a pupil who feel for he that mingled love and terror he instil in woman one bitterly cold and stormy day he come to give the young countess she lesson she be especially eager to please he but grow so anxious that she playing go all askew he be under the obsession of one of he savagery he grow more and more impatient with she and finally strike she hand from the key and rush out barehead into the storm she first horror at he brutality fade before she fear for he health without hat without cloak good heaven she cry seize they she rush after he -- she the countess pursue the music-teacher like a valet a servant follow she and take the thing from she hand to give to beethoven while she unseen return she mother rebuke she and order she to she room but the lesson continue and in thérèse 's diary beethoven appear constantly as mon maître mon maître chéri she be doom to a long jealousy she see beethoven fall in love with she cousin giulietta guicciardus giulietta come to she for advice say that she long to throw over count gallenberg for that beautiful horrible beethoven -- if it be not such a come-down she do not condescend as we have see and live to regret it bitterly the idolatry of the pupil finally seize the teacher beethoven come to dote upon the large heart the pure soul and the serene mind of thérèse one night as he extemporise as only he could he sing a song of love to she one day he say suddenly : i have be like a foolish boy who gather stone and do not observe the flower grow by the way it be in the spring of 1806 that they become engage only she brother franz who revere beethoven be in the secret they dare not tell thérèse 's mother but beethoven take up life and art with a new and thorough zest of course be beethoven he wax wroth often at the delay and the secrecy but the sun break through again for four year of he life the engagement endure beethoven it seem at last grow furious he quarrel with franz and in 1810 one day in a frenzy snap the bond with thérèse as she herself tell fräulein tenger the word that part we be not speak by I but by he i be terribly frightened turn deadly pale and tremble even after this the demon in he might have be exorcise but thérèse have grow afraid of the lightning of he wrath and fear outweigh love in the girl 's heart sometimes she feel ashamed in later year of she timidity at other time she be glad that she have not hamper he art as any wife must have do but now she return he he letter he destroy they all evidently except the famous letter to he immortal beloved which he have write in July 1806 soon after the betrothal and with it he keep a portrait she have give he as for thérèse she too have keep a copy of this letter and as she tell fräulein tenger : i have read it so often that i know it by heart -- like a poem -- and be it not a beautiful poem i can only humbly say to myself ` that man love thee ' and thank god for it she also show a sheet of old paper with a spray of immortelle and on it a inscription from ludwig : l'immortelle à son immortelle luigus these immortelle she sew into a white silk cushion with a request that it be place under she head in she coffin when fräulein tenger have first meet the countess as a child she have be ask to go every year on march 27th and lay a wreath of immortelle on beethoven 's grave the acquaintance continue and they meet again at long interval till the countess 's death in 1861 fraulein tenger write she book in she old age when she have lose she diary but enough of she reminiscence remain to prove thayer 's ingenious guess correct thérèse von brunswick be beethoven 's immortal beloved and the picture find with the letter be she portrait it be paint by lampus when thérèse be about twenty-eight and on the frame can be see still the word : to the rare genius to the great artist to the good man from tb the picture be in the beethoven museum at bonn and in the national museum at pesth be a bust of thérèse in she later year erect in she honor because she organise out of she charity the first infant ' school in the austrian empire and do many other good work it be both pity and solace that the noble woman do not wed beethoven she be he muse for year that be as she say something to thank god for she be also a beautiful spiritual influence on he once the baron spaun find beethoven kiss thérèse 's portrait and muttering : thou wast too noble -- too like a angel the baron withdraw silently and return later find beethoven extemporise in heavenly mood he explain : my good angel have appear to I in 1813 he write in he diary : what a fearful state to be in not to be able to trample down all my longing for the joy of a home to be always revel in these longing o god o god look down in mercy upon poor unhappy beethoven and put a end to this soon let it not last much longer and so beethoven never marry the woman indeed whom he love whom he propose to always awake with a shock to the risk of join for life a man of such explosive whim of such absorption in he own self and art of such utter deafness untidiness and morose habit of mind but beethoven himself be not always eager to wed he could write to gleichenstein : now you can help I get a wife if you find a pretty one -- one who may perhaps lend a sigh to my harmony do the court for I but she must be beautiful i can not love anything that be not beautiful if i could i should fall in love with myself one feel here a touch of disdain and frivolity yet he could grow fervid in such a outcry as that of he forty-sixth year : love and love alone can give I a happy life o god let I find she who will keep I in the path of virtue the one i may rightly call my own again he could coldly rejoice that he have not sacrifice any of he individuality or any of he devotion to music to giulietta guicciardus and the diary of fanny giannatasio whose father take care of beethoven 's nephew quote a conversation beethoven hold on the subject of wedlock accord to this he say that marriage should not be so indissoluble liberty-crushing a bond that a marriage without love be best but that no marriage be happy he add : for himself he be excessively glad that not one of the girl have become he wife whom he have passionately love in former day and think at the time it would be the highest joy on earth to possess to this cynic wisdom the poor fanny giannatasio del rio whose love for beethoven would never have be know have not she diary enamber it for publication after she death add the word : i will not repeat my answer but i think i know a girl who beloved by he would not have make he life unhappy ay there be the rub could any one have weave a happiness about the life of that ferocious master of art that pinion but struggle victim of fate chapter xv von weber -- the rake reform though thou hast now offend like a man do not persever in it like a devil yet yet thou hast a amiable soul if sin by custom grow not into nature christopher marlowe 's doctor faustus few novel be so brilliantly write or so variously absorb as the life of von weber write by he son the baron max marium von weber for year the son have resist the urgence of he mother to undertake the work fear that partiality would warp and indelicacy stain any such memorial of a father who have live so lively a life when at last the work be begin and do it be a miracle of impartiality of frankness which seem complete of sin confess and expiate in they confession and of trenchant characterisation which one will hardly find surpass outside of dickens the von weber be the most numerous musical dynasty after the bach we have already see something of the fortune of the family into which mozart marry the father of mozart 's wife be the older brother of franz anton von weber father of carl marium this franz anton be a strange mixture of stalwart and shiftless quality he give up he orchestral position to fight against frederick the great and bring home a red badge of courage it be wonderful by the way how many musician have earn distinction as soldier -- what indeed would the soldier do without music later franz anton enter civil service and succeed to the position of court financial-councillor fumettus and marry he beautiful daughter marium anna but franz anton be so rabid a fiddler that he use to be see play he violin in public place follow by he large family of child or even saw away in the open field to the neglect of he work and finally the loss of he position thereupon he decide that he large family should help in its own support and drag they one and all upon the stage the proud mother see she fortune squander and she pride massacre she die some year later franz anton 's heart be too industrious to remain idle long and though he be now fifty year of age he somehow win the hand of genofeva von brenner who be only sixteen year old it be gratuitous to say that the young girl be not happy in 1786 she bear he the child who be to realize the father 's one great and vicarious ambition : to bring a musical genius into the world while carl marium von weber be still a babe franz anton start once more after the will-o ' - the-wisp of theatrical fame with he weber 's company of comedian genofeva sickly and melancholy drag herself about with the troupe until carl marium be ten year old when she health give way and the travel be discontinue poverty and consumption end she day two year later within a year franz anton be betroth to a widow whom strange to say he never marry again franz anton the bedouin that he be drag he son back into the nomad life the boy seem astonishingly stupid in learn music though the father encourage he with intemperate zeal meanwhile carl 's character be form and he be become as brilliant as the mercurial life he be lead and at the same time as irresponsible like he relative mozart he be precocious at fall in love perhaps he first flame be elise vigitill in whose autograph album he write : dearest elise always love you sincere friend carl von weber in the sixth year of he age nüremberg the 10th of September 1792 we hear of no more sweetheart for eleven long year when carl marium be seventeen franz anton leave he in vienna where he plunge into dissipation at a tempo presto appassionato as he son write through carolling kiss drinking vienna he wander with a troop of choice spirit drink kiss carol the intoxicating draught of pleasure quaff in the lively capital fever the lad 's blood and the ardent imaginative temperament burst forth in that adoration of female beauty which strew he life 's path with rose not without thorn he teacher abbé vogler however secure he a position as conductor at the breslau opera and he be compel to tear himself away from a sweetheart of rank who be somewhat older than he he father go with he and by he bumptiousness bring the boy many enemy and through he speculation many debt in addition to those he acquire for himself here another entanglement await he he son tell it thus : many a female heart no doubt both within the theater and without its wall be allure by the sweet smile and seductive manners of the pale slender languish but passionately ardent young conductor whilst he own heart seem to have be more seriously involve in a unfortunate and misplace attachment for a singer in the theater this woman be marry to a rough drunkard who mishandle she the couple be daily fall more and more into a abject state of poverty young carl marium pity the woman and pity be soon transform in the feeling next akin that she be a unworthy object of either pity or affection be very clear : she misuse he goodness of heart gnaw incessantly at he slender purse and quickly plunge he into a slough of difficulty nigh equal to she own various misfortune and indiscretion bring von weber to the loss of he post but a woman intervene to save he from disaster this be a fräulein von belonda maid of honor to the duchess of würtemberg who take a deep interest in carl and persuade the duke to make he musical director the continual success of the french army overrun europe forbid the duke to keep up he retinue of artist but he secure weber a post at stuttgart as private secretary to he brother ludwig another younger brother of the king of würtemberg a monster of corpulence who have to have he dining-table make crescent-wise that he might get near enough to eat into the circle of these two unlovable figure and they ugly court weber be thrust thus then the fiery young artist he wild oats not yet fully sown plunge into a new world where no true sense of right or wrong be know where virtue and morality be laugh to scorn where in the chaotic whirlpool of a reckless court money and influence at any price be the sole end and aim of life where in the confusion of the time the insecurity of condition and the ruthless despotism of the government the sole watchword of existence from high to low be ` après moi le deluge ' the prince ludwig be a great spendthrift and be continually appeal to he brother for fund it be poor weber 's pleasant task to be the go-between and to receive on he head the rage of behemoth again to quote the vivid language of the baron max : the stammering stuttering shriek rage of the hideously corpulent king who on account of he unwieldy obesity be unable to let he arm hang by he side and who thus gesticulate wildly and perspire incessantly and have the habit moreover of continually address he favorite generally present on these occasion with the appeal ` pas vrai dillen ' after each broken sentence -- would have be inexpressibly droll have not the low-comedy actor of the scene be a autocrat who might at a wink have transform laughter into tear but there be a demoniacal comicality about the performance which if it do not convulse the spectator make he shudder to he heart 's core weber hate the king of whose wild caprice and vice he witness daily scene before whose palace-gate he be oblige to slink bareheaded and who treat he with unmerited ignominy he be wont in thoughtless levity of youth to forget the danger he run and to answer the king with a freedom of tone which the autocrat be all unused to hear in turn he be detest by the monarch the royal treatment rouse young carl marium 's indignation to the utmost and he irritation lead he one day to a mad prank which be nigh result in some year ' imprisonment in the fortress of hohenasberg or of hohenhaufen smart under some foul indignity he have just leave the private apartment of the king when a old woman meet he in the passage and ask he where she could find the room of the court washerwoman ` there ' say the reckless youth point to the door of the royal cabinet the old woman enter and be violently assail by the king who have a horror of old woman in she terror she stammer out that a young gentleman who have just come out have inform she that there she would find the ` royal washerwoman ' the infuriate monarch guess who be the culprit and despatch a officer on the spot to arrest he brother 's secretary and throw he into prison to those who have any idea how foul a den be then a royal prison it must appear almost marvellous that carl marium should have possess sufficient equanimity to have occupy himself with he beloved art during he arrest but so it be he manage to procure a dilapidated old piano put it in tune with consummate patience by means of a common door-key and actually then and there on the 14th of October 1808 compose he well-known beautiful song ` ein steter kampf ist unser leben ' the storm pass over prince ludwig 's influence obtain the young man 's pardon and release but the insult be never forget by the king : he take care to remember it at he own right time nor have prison cure carl marium of he boyish desire to play trick upon the hate monarch when he conceive that he could do so without danger to himself carl proceed to make himself a appropriate graduate of such a university of moral and devoted himself to wine woman and debt with a small proportion of song he belong to a society of young man who call themselves by the gentle name of faust 's ride to hell he now begin also the composition of a opera sylvana this bring he into acquaintance with operatic people and he fall under the charm of that coquettish little serpent margarethe lang to stem such a passion or even to have give it a legal form would have be merely ridiculous and absurd in the eye of the demoralised circle by which he be surround gretchen possess a little plump seductive form be about twenty year of age and in addition to she undoubted musical talent be endowed with a fund of gay sprightly humor wholly in sympathy with the youth 's own joyous nature she become the central point of all he life and aspiration thus the biographer describe the new dissipation which carry carl away from he old riot the new magnet that drag from he all the money he could earn and more than he could borrow it be a wild and reckless crew and addict to such entertainment as the travesty on marc antony with music by carl who play cleopatra while gretchen play antony the last straw upon carl 's break back be the arrival of he father who descend upon he with a bass viol a enormous basket-bed for he beloved poodle and a large bundle of debt as well as a increase luggage of eccentricity while weber be try to secure loan to pay off one of he father 's debt he be innocently implicate in a scandal of bribery by which it be make to seem that he have offer a post in the prince 's household in return for a advance of money the king have be drive to despair by the disaster of the german army and the increase of discontent of the german people and desire to gain a reputation for virtue by the comfortable step of reform he brother 's household learning of the proffer bribe in which weber seem to be concerned but of which he be perfectly innocent the king have he arrest during a rehearsal of he opera sylvana and have he throw into prison for sixteen day when at last he be examine there be nothing find to justify the accusation of dishonesty he be release from the prison for criminal and transfer to the prison for debt and then a little later he and he father be place into a carriage and drive across the border to exile this sudden plunge from the froth of dissipation to the dregs of disgrace be a fall that weber could never thereafter think or speak of and every mention of it be forbid almost from this moment weber 's life be one of seriousness with a occasional relapse into some of he old quality but never a complete lay aside of earnestness he gain friend elsewhere and finally settle in darmstadt where he still find woman 's heart susceptible in spite of he small weak frame he great long neck and he calfless leg of which he write : and oh my calf they might have do honor to a poodle eight month after he banishment he opera sylvana be produce at frankfort the first soprano be gretchen lang and the part of sylvana be take by caroline brandt of whom much more later at munich the next year he find himself in high favor with two singer they be vie with each other for he while two society beauty exert they rival charm weber be keep busy with he quadruple flirtation he be drive into cynicism and he motto become all woman be good for nothing -lrb- _ alle weiber taugen nichts _ -rrb- which he use so often that he abbreviate it to awtn in the column of he account-book he be provoke to write : a coquette with I though she know i be make love to she friend b abuse n tell I horrid story of she and say i must not go home with she he take a journey to switzerland where the beautiful frau peyermann occupy he heart long enough to inspire he to the scene in athalie and to he song the artist 's declaration of love he wander here and there for about three year and he biographer spitta thus portray he : rove restlessly from place to place win all heart by he sweet insinuate lively melody he eccentricity make he a impose figure to the young of both sex and a annoyance to the old exciting the attention of everybody and then suddenly disappear he person unite in the most seductive manner aristocratic bearing and tone with indolent dissipation he mood alternate between uproarious spirit and deep depression -- in all way he resemble a figure from some romantic poem wholly unlike anything see before in the history of german art in 1813 he find himself at prague with the post of musical director to the opera in the company be two woman who take hold of he heart one a spirit of evil the other a angel of good the former be theresa brunettus wife of a ballet-dancer and mother of several child the acquisition of which have rob she of neither she fine plump figure nor she devotion to the art of coquetry there be no improve upon the description of max von weber as give of this entanglement so here it be at length with all its frankness of exposure and its writhe humiliation : he soon conceive

duty could extinguish vain be all he effort to conceal it in a very short time it become the topic of general remark excite the ridicule or grave anxiety of he friend involve he in a thousand disagreeable position lower he character without the slightest compensate advantage to he artistic career and nigh drag he down into a abyss beyond hope of rescue the new opera-director be soon lodge in the house of the careless husband of the light woman she herself may have have some inclination for the man but as soon as she feel she true power over he she hold out she fair hand only to lead he into a life of torment the woman 's power over she poor victim be immense he be drag in she train against he better reason to country excursion supper ball at which whilst he watch she every look she every breath to discover she slightest wish although nigh dead with fatigue she would be bestow she attention on other man wholly regardless of she slave now again he would scour the town in scorching heat or drenching rain frequently sacrifice the only moment he could snatch from business for he dinner to procure a ribbon a ring or some dainty which she desire and which be difficult to obtain and on he return she would receive he perhaps with coldness and toss the prize aside sometimes when the proof become too evident that she have dupe deceive betray he the scene between the two be fearful and then she would cleverly find means of assert that it be she who have the best right to be jealous and thus turn the table on he by every thought in every action in every moment of he life there be but one feeling ever present -- ` how will she receive I ' even in he account-book now so often neglect be to be find the lamentation of he despairing heart over she unworthiness and again but a few hour later expression of delight that she have smile on he there be something terrible in the bitter slavery to which he better nature be condemn by this wild passion one day he write : ' a fearful scene the sweetest dream of my life be over confidence be lose for ever the chain be break ' on the next : ' a painful explanation i shed the first tear my grief have wring from I this reconciliation have clear the thunder from the air both of we feel better ' and then again : ` my dream be over i shall never know the happiness of be love i must for ever be alone she can sit near I hour long and never say one word and when some other man be mention burst out in ecstasy i will do all i can to please she but i must withdraw within myself bury all my bitter feeling in my own heart and work -- work -- work ' it be in the fall of 1813 -- _ prosit omen _ -- that von weber meet the brunettus in the next year he be still cling to she whom the biographer call the rotten plant and write in a note-book : i find calina with thérèse and i could scarcely conceal the fearful rage that burn in I or a elegy like this : no joy without she and yet with she only sorrow cupid have always be jealous of the cook on thérèse 's birthday carl present she with a double gift first a gold watch with a cluster of trinket each of they a symbol of love with this cluster of trinket something very rare and costly in prague -- oyster thérèse glance -- merely glance -- at the jewelry she fairly gobble the oyster carl 's love have survive he jealousy of calina but he could not endure a rivalry with mollusk as he son explain : on a sudden the scale fall from he eye ought he not rather have say the shell lack even this ogress for a idol poor carl be lonely indeed even music turn unresponsive and success be only ash on he tongue then faith give he unsought ability to revenge himself on the brunettus she have despise he as a mere genius toddle after the frou-frou of she skirt but she begin to prize he when she see he cast interested look in another direction now it be she turn to writhe with jealousy and to writhe in vain she storm and tirade have more effect upon he than he plea have have upon she but whereas she have formerly be _ insouciante _ and amuse at he pain she pain hurt he to distraction break down he health and drive he to ask for a leave of absence that he might recover he strength when he go away he carry with he in he heart a new regret sweeten or perhaps embittered by a tinge of new hope but he could not know that he have reach the end of the worthless page of he life and that the new leaf be to be inscribe with a story of happiness which be by no means untroubled but yet be constructive happiness worth-while happiness in the year 1810 he opera sylvana have be sing as i have say with caroline brandt in the title rôle when in 1813 he be give the direction of the opera at prague though he fall into the clutch of the brunettus he have unconsciously prepared himself a better cleaner experience by engage for the very first member of he new company this same caroline brandt who happen to write he that she happen to be at liberty as they say like carl himself she have know stage-life from childhood be the daughter of a tenor and appear on the stage at the age of eight she be describe as small and plump in figure with beautiful expressive gray eye and fair wavy hair and a peculiar liveliness in she movement she be a woman of large and tender heart electrify with a temper incisive and immediate she be a actress of genuine skill she sense of grace and beauty in all thing infallible she do not appear at the theater in prague until the first day of January 1814 she bear a curious resemblance to thérèse brunettus in a fresher edition and be not long in give that lady a sense of uneasiness the oyster as we have see have give the brunettus the _ coup de disgrâce _ caroline win the poor director 's gratitude first by be quick to adopt suggestion and to rescue he from the embarrassment buzz about the head of a operatic manager she be glad to undertake task and slow to show professional jealousy she live in seclusion with she mother and receive no visit even the young nobleman could not woo she at the stage door though the brunettus advise she to accept the advance of a certain banker say : he be worth the trouble for he be rich have fail to drag caroline into she own game the brunettus try to keep von weber from breathe the better air of she presence as we have see she drive he almost to distraction and send he a wreck to the bath in friedland caroline 's mother have permit von weber to pay he court to she and she father and brother have find he intention worthy caroline have not hesitate to confess that she affection be grow with carl 's but what she have see of he life with the brunettus and what she must have hear of he magnificent dissipation give she pause therefore when carl go away for he health he take with he a riddle and leave behind a sweet beloved be who might -- who may -- make I happy the absence of three month shall test we love they write each other long and daily letter he be all of yearning while hers be mingle with fear lest he be as she write he a sweet poison harmful to the soul after take the bath he go on to berlin arrive there August 3d in the very ferment of rapture over the downfall of napoleon at prague he be move to write a number of patriotic song from koerner 's leier und schwert these chorus for man be sing throughout the fatherland as they still be sing but from the height of glory to which he be now bear as the living voice of the nation he be drag back to the depths by the little hand and the little finger-nail of caroline who could be jealous enough to suspect that not all the adoration von weber be receive from the woman of berlin be pure and impersonal patriotism von weber have from the first insist that no marriage of theirs could have hope of success unless she leave the stage this sacrifice of herself and she career and she large following among the public be a deal to ask and a deal to grant she combined reluctance to sacrifice she all and she jealous fear that he would not find she all in all at last lead she to write he that they would better give up they dream and break they troth in he first bitterness at this inopportune humiliation come like a drop of vinegar in the honey of royal favor he write furiously to gansbacher i see now that she view of high art be not above the usual pitiful standard -- namely that art be but a means of procure soup meat and shirt to another friend lichtenstein he write more solemnly : all my fondest hope be vanish day by day i live like a drunken man who dance on a thin coating of ice and spite of he better reason would persuade himself that he be on solid ground i love with all my heart and soul and if there be no truth in she affection the last chord of my whole life have be strike i shall still live on -- marry perhaps some day -- who know but love and trust again never more in September he return to prague with a anxious heart and take up in person a new battle for caroline 's hand they be agree upon the subject of affection but wrangle upon the clause in the treaty of marriage while this debate be wage weber take care of she money and she mother 's a benefit be give she he announce that he himself would sell the ticket at the box-office and he spend a whole day bartering he quick wit and he social influence for increase price such public devotion bring scandal buzz about the ear of the two but still caroline would not give up she career nor weber he opinion of stage marriage even he patriotic song the lyre and the sword be a cause of disagreement for caroline like so many woman deify napoleon and she lover 's lyric assault upon he be so much sacrilege while to he she adoration of that personify prairie-fire who have devastate the fatherland be treason the brunettus be well out of the run caroline find new cause of jealousy in the newly engage actress christine bohler indeed carl and caroline do little but fight and make up for month until even caroline be convince that one of the two must leave prague at least for a period of probation it be carl who leave and in a condition of almost complete spiritual collapse how little music have to do with one 's state of mind may be see from the fact that in he weak and complain despair he compose one of he sturdiest work kampf und sieg he settle in munich and continue to correspond with caroline write she the most minute description of he life and he lodgings and beg she to write he with equal fulness he loneliness however at length tell upon he spirit and gradually stifle he creativeness at length it become time for he to return to prague again and on the eve of he home-going he receive a letter from caroline which she say she have be for week try in vain to write she be now convince that they must absolutely give up all thought of love and marriage this blow smite he to the ground he have no strength even for wrath he could only write in abject meekness as if thank she for delay the blow so long : be not angry my beloved one that i repeat my word of love and sorrow again and again they flow from a pure heart that know no other wish than you happiness when time shall have go by and you can look back in peace and quiet on the broken tie between we you will then acknowledge that never be a truer heart than mine thanks my dearest life my never-to-be-forgotten love for the many sweet flower you have weave into the garland of my life for all you love for all you care forgive I for my excess of love -- forgive the passion that may have tear many a wound when it should have soothe and heal -- forgive I all the sorrow i have cause you though heaven know it be through no will of mine -- forgive I for have steal one whole sweet year of you precious life for which i would willingly give ten of my own could i but buy it back for you farewell -- farewell on the 7th of September he arrive in prague he first view of caroline be as she sing the cinderellum on the stage the sight of she be too much he break down and run home but still as director he must frequently meet she in more or less familiar situation and as for she she later confess that she be suffer even more than carl she every strength and resolution melt away one afternoon in the autumn at a reception where the lover meet face to face they gaze blended they hand blended the war be over instantly with the resumption of he love-life he interest in music begin again caroline apparently alarm at the condition of he health never robust persuade she mother to let he board at she house new health and old-time gaiety begin again but he be tire of prague and determine to find a larger field elsewhere while he be hunting for a place for himself he secure a star engagement for caroline at the then high salary of ten gold loui per performance before he leave prague he announce he engagement publicly by a curious coincidence the engagement be announce at a reception just after a total eclipse of the sun when the daylight come out of the darkness carl rise and proclaim he conquest on christmas morning he receive a costly ring from the king of hanover a splendid snuff-box from the king of bavarium and a appointment as kapellmeister to the king of saxony at dresden there be honor enough and jealousy more but carl assail they with new strength and now he take up a opera on a subject he have think of but discard fortunately for himself and the world he write caroline that a friend of he be write a libretto base on the old national legend der freischütz kind the librettist write night and day for ten day and carl in great enthusiasm forward the libretto for caroline 's opinion she send it back with violent criticism base upon she long stage experience and she intuition of stage effect we can never thank she sufficiently for cut out endless page of song and recitative by the melancholious old hermit who in the original version be to commence the opera and wander in and out of it incessantly caroline write like horace : away with all these scene plunge at once into the popular element begin with the scene before the tavern this seem outrageous mutilation at first to the composer and the librettist take it with still more violence threaten for a time to withdraw he book completely but often thereafter do carl express he gratitude to she whom he call he public with two eye would to heaven that there have be some caroline brandt to give similar advice to wagner concern he wotan and he king mark meanwhile during the composition of der freischütz which be to mean so much for the happiness of germany and the betterment of opera generally carl the genius who strike out the magnificent work be spend almost less time upon the detail of composition and score than upon the purchase of article for the home he be make for he bride-to-be he write she long letter describe he purchase of chair crockery curtain knife fork spoon pail broom and mustard-pot she have cease to be in he mind the brilliant and fascinating soubrette and have become in the silly lover 's - latin he pug he duck he bird he answer a letter she write he describe she success in the magic flute : i be amuse with you account of the ` zauberflöte ' but you know i hope soon to see you lay by all you pretty papagena feather all you satin and ermine must give place to a coarse apron then you will be only applaud by my hungry stomach call out before the cook-wench and salute with ` da capo ' when you kiss you carl it be very shocking i know what will my own pearl say to be dissolve in the sour vinegar of domestic life and swallow by a bear of a husband in march 1817 weber be call to prague on business connect with he opera company he be overjoy at the thought of see caroline who be still singing there just as he be step into the travelling-carriage a letter be hand he say that the firm in prague with which he have deposit all he savings and those of caroline be about to go into bankruptcy there be indeed of he long and careful hoarding only as much leave as caroline have deposit on he advice she savings be quite sweep away but without say a word to she he transfer the last penny he have in the world to she name and leave himself except for he strength and fame a pauper it be many year after and then only by chance that caroline learn the beautiful sacrifice he have make from he great love for she when he reach prague he conceal from she all the distress he have suffer and there be nothing but happiness in they reunion return to dresden he take up more seriously the composition of der freischütz the first note of it that he write be the second act duet between agathe and aennchen he take caroline as he ideal indeed through the whole composition of the work he declare that he see caroline always preside he seem to hear she voice singing every note and see she finger play it on the piano now smile over what she like now shake she head over what displeased she this spirit he take as the critic and judge of the whole work there have rarely be such instance of actual personal inspiration in any work of art and certainly none which do more credit to the absorption of the artist-mind in the worship of its idol furthermore much of the composition be do at the home prepare for caroline 's actual presence and he write those suave and optimistic page of music to a accompaniment of hammer and saw the wrangling of carpenter painter upholsterer and scrub-women sleeping at night in the kitchen and glad to find a kitchen-table to compose upon the longed-for marriage could not take place until a court wedding for which he be write music this be postpone and postpone until he be drive to distraction but at last when the royal bridegroom be send on he way the composer flee toward prague caroline surprise he by come part way to meet he on November 4 1817 they be marry carl give caroline 's mother a pension of nine hundred thaler though she husband and son be live the honeymoon be pay for by concert here and there in which both take part and by a benevolent royal commission to hunt for artist caroline though she matrimonial treaty forbid she singing on the stage be allow to sing at concert and at some of they she sing duet with carl at the piano while she play the guitar carl have often tell caroline that she must expect a chaos in she new home in dresden when she arrive and find everything beautiful and in perfect order she weep with rapture late on the last night of the year 1817 carl write in a diary these word they show what depths there be in the soul and what height in the ambition of one whose youth and training and early recklessness have promise so little of solidity and solemnity the great important year have close may god still grant I the blessing he have hitherto so graciously accord I that i may have the power to make the dear one happy and as a brave artist bring honor and advantage to my fatherland aman as for caroline who have be so volatile a soubrette and so happy in the footlight glitter she turn out to be even a greater success as a _ haus-frau _ she begin to win a more limited but a equally profound reputation for she perfect dinner and reception and for the minute care with which she keep all she account-book housekeeping-book cellar-book finally she even learn to cook and the household become a dove-cote the instinct of jealousy be one that be not easily uproot and caroline do not permit carl 's life to grow too monotonous he high favor at court keep she in subject for uneasiness he finally attempt a violent cure he begin to absent himself from the house with unusual frequence but would not explain where he have be even though caroline weep and wail at length he work she to the pitch of desperation by he heartless indifference then one day he bring home a portrait bust which a sculptor friend have make and with it a sign record of every hour and minute of he absence this if not a permanent cure be at least a partial remedy weber 's home become a proverb of hospitality and good cheer the two sing duet or caroline recite poem while carl improvise accompaniment excursion to the field and water party and hilarious reunion of the opera-troupe keep life busy later he take a country home where he surround himself with the dumb animal whose society he so enjoy these include a large hound a raven a starl a angora cat and a ape on December 22 1818 the first child a girl be bear caroline be dangerously ill the child be not strong and carl 's own health always at the brink of

not be keep from he and he be send into delirium caroline 's health give way completely and the unhappy couple lay in neighbouring room where they could only cry ` comfort ' to each other through the wall and where in the still hour of night each smother the sob of grief in the pillow that the other might not hear caroline be the first to recover carl 's health and strength be on the final ebb -- the long slow ebb that make of he last year one dismal tragedy which only he superb devotion to he wife and he immitigable optimism could brighten in July 1820 they decide to take a tour they meet with great success but he find he weakness almost unbearable at hanover he and caroline be both prostrated and could not join in the concert plan on the road to bremen the postilion fall asleep and the coach be overturn into the ditch the driver be stunned and the sick carl have himself to revive the man untie the baggage from the roof unharness the horse put everything in place again and drive the postilion to the next station at hamburg caroline be too ill to continue the tour she be about to become a mother and carl be compel to go on without she but he write she daily letter full of devotion it be the first separation of they married life later she rejoin he and at hamburg the oyster enter once more into weber 's domestic career the brunettus have cure he of he love for she by she inordinate fondness for bivalve caroline on the other hand hate they but weber say : there can be no true sympathy between we while you detest a food i relish for the love of I swallow this oyster the first three be a severe trial but as the french might say ce n'est pas que la première huitre qui coute afterward weber would groan alas why do i ever teach you the trick in 1821 there rise a famous operatic war between spontinus and weber at berlin caroline be prostrate with terror spontinus 's olympic be give first with enormous success and der freischütz in which caroline have have so large a share and which mean so much to the two be force into a dramatic comparison in spite of a somewhat dubious begin the first night be one of the greatest ovation a musician have ever live to see in the midst of the tempestuous applause every one look for the composer who be sit in a dark corner of he wife 's box and kiss away she tear of joy when they return to dresden in July caroline 's health be undermine by the emotion of the berlin triumph and it be necessary for she to be take to switzerland where carl be compel to leave she a accident in cross the elbe lead he to write he will leave caroline everything without reserve and he die curse upon any one who should disturb he wish now consumption begin to fasten its claw more deeply on he and when he wife return she find he constantly rack with cough and fever one day he see the first fatal spot of blood upon he handkerchief he turn pale and sigh : god 's will be do from that moment neither he conviction that he be doom to a early death nor he courage to die pluckily ever leave he when der freischütz be give in dresden caroline be ill at home carl arrange a courier service by which he receive after every scene news of he wife in February of the next year he be compel to leave dresden he place in he wife 's hand a sealed letter only to be open in case of he death this letter give a complete account of all he

life without you all pride be shear of its splendor my only real joy can be in that which give you joy too from now on he spend a large part of he time away from she always torment to the last degree by homesickness always harrow by the fear that he might die out of the reach of he adored wife and two child and never feel that he have lay by money enough to leave they free of the danger of want after he should have drift into the grave that yawn just before he weary foot it be hard to find in story or history a more pitiful struggle against fate and the frustration of every deep desire than the last day of carl marium von weber hurry from triumph to triumph and die as he jolt along he way or stand bow with hollow heart before uproarious multitude homesickness grow to be a positive frenzy with he they carry I in triumph he write to caroline : they watch for every wink to do I kindness but i feel i can only be happy there where i can hear my lamb bleat and they mother low and can beat my dog or turn away my maid if they be at all too troublesome in 1825 christmas find he at a distance and he could not reach home i shall think of you all on christmas-eve he write but that i never cease to do all my labor be for you -- all my joy be with you can i but be with you on new year 's eve he write again with that tinge of superstition which always more or less pervade he character i shall be with you all the year now london beckon to he as she have to so many german musician to whom she always have stand for the city of gold and of rescue from pauperdom ghastly as von weber look in the clutch of he disease hungry as he heart and body be for a long a eternal rest he feel that he must not shrink from this final goal as he son write with ache heart in the biography : to gublitz who doubt of he ability to undertake the journey to london he reply in a tone of melancholy irony : ` whether i can or no i must money must be make for my family -- money man i be go to london to die there not a word i know it as well as you ' the bright cheery lively weber who revel in the triumph of he ` freischütz ' be already dead and go before he departure weber regulate all he affair in the most punctilious manner the presentiment of the fast-approaching end render he doubly careful that all should be in order and in he last conference with he legal friend he be always anxious to insure the presence of he wife whose strong practical good sense he know during these painful duty he personal appearance become so fearfully change that most of he friend begin to fear he would no longer find strength sufficient for he journey he form sink together : he voice be almost totally go : he cough be incessant in the circle of intimate who still visit he at that tea-table of which he wit and pleasantry and genial humor have so long make the charm he would often murmur with a faint smile ` do not take it ill good people if i drop asleep : indeed i can not help it ' and he head would fall upon he breast he poor wife suffer cruel agony : she could not but feel that he be really spend the small remain breath of life for the sake of she and the child she manoeuvre in secret to induce friend to persuade he that he ought to renounce he fearful journey when all she own affectionate effort to this intent have fail but the response be ever the same sad one ` whether i undertake this journey or no it be all one within a year i be a dead man but if i go my child will have bread when they father be go : if i do not want may stare they in the face what be to be do ' on one occasion he add ' i should like to come back once more and see my dear one ' face again : and then in god 's name let god 's will be do but to die there it would be hard very hard ' the morning of the 7th of February have not yet dawn after a night of bitter tear when weber 's travelling-carriage drive up to he door the time be come for the separation of the husband who scarcely hope to see he home again from the loving wife who feel that he be a die man another tear upon the forehead of he sleep child -- another long linger kiss -- the suffer man drag he swollen foot into the carriage huddle

then but he have never forget the sound of that terrible cry when he mother slowly recover from she swoon clasp he convulsively in she arm and wet he face with a flood of tear nearly twenty year later it be before von weber 's body at last reach the fatherland the agony of homesickness he have endure seem to haunt even the cold clay in 1841 a writer make a ardent appeal for the restoration of this glory of german song to the german soil the idea become a crusade but it be not until 1844 and then chiefly by the aid of wagner then conductor in dresden and a close friend of caroline and she child that success be attain the younger son alexander have already be bury on December 14 1844 the father 's body be place by he side it have be carry through the street of dresden behind a black banner on which be inscribed word which once would have mean so much : weber in dresden in the richly decorate chapel of the cemetery all the lady of the theater with schröder-devrient at they head await the body and cover the coffin with they laurel the ceremony be at a end the torch be extinguish the crowd disperse but by the light of two candle still burn on the altar might be see the form of a small now middle-aged woman who have fling herself upon the bier whilst a pale young man kneel pray by she side this pale young man be the baron max marium von weber to whose pen we owe a wonderful portrait of a wonderful man it be the son 's love strangely temper with wisdom that show we all the phase of this character which by reveal its worser side make the better side convincing complete alive weber have live hardly more than half of the allotted three score and ten but he have live life in all its phase from riotous dissipation amid royal splendor and insolence to a brave and whole-souled battle for the welfare of he home it be futile to attempt judge the effect of music upon life and of life upon music too many sort of man have write too many sort of music and live too many sort of life but if you wish to use von weber 's life as a example of the influence of music surely you would write von weber 's name on the credit side of the ledger for he reach he best music when he life be best manage he take a musician for he wife and she high ideal of art and life make he a man and a soldier against fate home they bring he body a pride to he fatherland and the greater wagner who owe the great weber so much speak over he grave these word : here rest thee then wherever thy genius bear thee to whatsoever distant land it stay for ever link by a thousand tendril to the german people 's heart that heart with which it weep and laugh a child believe in the tale and legend of he country and though the briton may yield thee justice the frenchman admiration yet the german alone can love thee he thou art a beautiful day in he life a warm drop of he own blood a morsel of he heart -- and who shall blame we that we wish thy ash too to mingle with this earth to form a part of we dear german soil chapter xvi the felicity of mendelssohn happy they say be the country that have no history happy too the man whose love affair make tame reading it be not often that people live up to they name so thoroughly as mendelssohn live up to he he parent be prophet when they call he felix for he life be happy though he enjoy it only thirty-eight year and though it be not without its disappointment and rebuff -- be a christianised jew he be acceptable to neither the jew nor the gentile none the less mendelssohn 's life be as human life go one of complete felicity well begin be half do and half the struggle for happiness be achieve if one 's childhood year be make pleasant mendelssohn 's home life be so brilliantly joyous and so busy with artistic and domestic comfort that it have almost pass into proverb as ideal mendelssohn be describe as have be enthusiastically almost fanatically fond of he father who without possess musical technic possess a remarkable spiritual grasp of it he mother be something of a pianist and a woman of great sweetness and firmness of character to whom the child be devoted and with whom they be confidential to the utmost degree in this atmosphere the flower of mendelssohn 's genius bear early fruit and we find he in 1826 at the age of seventeen write he overture to a midsummer-night 's dream a wonderful fabric of harmony and instrumentation which sound like wagner at he best though it be write when wagner be only thirteen year old and have never dream of write music nor have even turn out that old-fangled and empty sonata which be beautiful only because it be he first and last offence of the sort mendelssohn like mozart give he heart first to he sister who be like he a prodigy at the piano and so thoroughly congenial that when she die suddenly the shock shorten he own life some of she composition be publish with he and he take she advice in many thing at the age of twenty-four she marry the painter hensel and at the age of forty-two she die mendelssohn be a man of many friend among man he be small and excitable but be count handsome he be versatile to a unusual degree be a adept at painting as well as billiards chess ride swimming and general athletics he be also something of a scholar in greek and latin and he correspondence be so enthusiastically keep up that he publish letter take a high place in such literature overflow as they be with comment of all kind on the people and thing he see in he wide travels as a aunt of he once write he mother : if god spare he he letter will in long long year to come create the deepest interest take care of they as of a holy relic indeed they be sacred already as the effusion of so pure and childlike a mind he heart be indeed remarkably clean stratton say of he : he be always fall in love as he letter show but no breath of scandal bedimm the shine brightness of he character he wear he heart upon he sleeve say stratton he also wear it on the tip of he pen and one who wish to know how possible it be to be both a good and joyous man and a great busy musician can find such a one in mendelssohn 's publish letter though the most personal family matter have be omit from they as print and he wife before she death burn all the letter he have write she we however be concern only in he amours when he be twenty year old he go to england and thence to scotland and wale where he spend a time compose sketch and exercise he fascination he write home : yes child i do nothing but flirt and that in english wherever he go he see something beautiful in nature or in womankind and at munich in 1830 he be as he sister write the darling in every house the center of every circle the fifteen-year-old josephine or peppus lang and delphine von schauroth seem to have touch he heart most deeply to the latter he dedicate a piano composition to the former he teach double counterpoint a forbid subject which the two doubtlessly find gay enough in italy in 1831 he find he heart capture easily and as once in schumann 's case it be a english girl who entangled he she be a beauty whom he first meet at a ball at torlonium 's he dance with she again at the palazzo albanus but music hold he fast through all though he could on occasion impatiently vow that he would be more serious and no longer alter he composition to suit the whim of pretty girl mendelssohn 's life flow on in smoothness in thorough contrast with the violent up and downs of beethoven 's mind and music for he be as stratton say on the most excellent term with himself as with the world in general he be extremely sensitive to criticism and to false friendship but he be never sting into those virulent humor which poison beethoven 's career so placid a life he be indeed that some of he admirer have wish that he have meet with more tragedy in order that he might have write more poignant music against this view grove wisely protest compare schubert 's word : my music be the product of my genius and my misery and that which i have write in my greatest distress be that which the world seem to like best grove moralise thus on mendelssohn with sane philosophy : he be never try by poverty or disappointment or ill-health or a morbid temper or neglect or the perfidy of friend or any of the other great ill which crowd so thickly around beethoven schubert or schumann who can wish that he have be that that bright pure aspire spirit should have be dull by distress or tear with agony it might have lend a deeper undertone to he song or have enable he adagio to draw tear where now they only give a saddened pleasure but let we take the man as we have he surely there be enough of conflict and violence in life and in art when we want to be make unhappy we can turn to other it be well in these agitate modern day to be able to point to one perfectly balanced nature in whose life whose letter and whose music alike all be at once manly and refined clever and pure brilliant and solid for the enjoyment of such shine height of goodness we may well forego for once the depths of misery and sorrow in November 1835 mendelssohn 's father die among he last wish be the wish that he son should marry as the two sister already have the blow to mendelssohn be exceedingly severe and he condition alarm he sister who urge upon he he father 's advice mendelssohn tell she that he would look about he on the rhine next summer in 1836 he visit frankfort and make the acquaintance of the widow of a french clergyman who have preach at the french reform church the widow be madame jeanrenaud -lrb- _ née _ souchay -rrb- she be so well preserved and handsome that she be credit with have win mendelssohn 's love but it be she second daughter cécile charlotte sophie who have stick the first pin of permanence through he butterfly heart she be seventeen and he twenty-seven he love beauty and she be beautiful the hyper-romantic elise polko often see cécile and describe she : to the present hour she have always remain my beau ideal of womanly fascination and loveliness she figure be slight of middle height and rather droop like a flower heavy with dew she luxuriant gold-brown hair fall in rich curl on she shoulder she complexion be of transparent delicacy she smile charming and she have the most bewitching deep blue eye i ever behold with dark eyelash and eyebrow she whole aspect have a madonna air what berthold auerbach so beautifully call _ marienhaft _ she manner be generally think too reserved indeed she be consider cold and call ` the fair mimosa ' in music we have a expressive term ` calm but impassioned ' and this i deem a appropriate conception for the portrait of cécile mendelssohn be so surprised at the depth of the impression the young girl have make upon he that he be worry to make sure that he be really at last in love he go away for a month to take sea-bath at scheveningen near the hague but salt water would not wash away he emotion and after a month 's absence he return propose and on the 9th of September 1836 be betroth he write he mother at once : my head be quite giddy from the event of the day it be already late at night and i have nothing else to say but i must write to you i feel so rich and happy it be a proof of the fondness the people cherish for mendelssohn that when the engagement become noised abroad the director of the gewandhaus in leipzig put on the program the second finale in fidelio he who have gain a charming wife -lrb- _ wer ein holde weib errungen _ -rrb- the audience see the meaning at once and shout in its enthusiasm until mendelssohn be force to seat himself at the piano and extemporise upon the theme felix and cecile be marry march 28 1837 at the walloon french reform church in frankfort and he friend hiller surprise they with a new bridal chorus the wedding tour last nearly a month and the honeymooner keep a journal in which they both sketch and write humourous nothing the home they choose be in leipzig where fanny hensel visit they and find cécile possess not only of the beautiful eye felix have rave over so much but possess also of a wonderfully soothing temperament that calm she husband 's whim and promise to cure he of he irritability the married life of the two be interrupt by the journey the husband have to make for he important engagement till he growl vigorously and regret be a conductor at all in February 1838 the first child be bear and cécile be dangerously ill on other tour of he even to england she accompany he she bear he five child three boy and two girl they life together be almost perfect he write in 1841 to a friend who be to be marry : if i have still a wish to form it be that you blissful betrothal-mood may be continue in marriage that be may you be like I who feel every day of my life that i can not be sufficiently thankful to god for my happiness in another letter he thus picture he private paradise : eating and sleep without dress coat without piano without visiting-card without carriage and horse but with donkey with wild flower with music-paper and sketch-book with cécile and the child again in 1844 he write of a return home : i find all my family well and we have a joyful meeting cécile look so well again -- tan by the sun but without the least trace of she former indisposition my first glance tell this when i come into the room but to this day i can not cease rejoice afresh every time i look at she the child be as brown as moor and play all day long in the garden and so i be myself again now and i take one of the sheet of paper that cécile paint for I to write to you i be sit here at the open window look into the garden at the child who be play with they ` dear johann ' the omnibus to koenigstein pass here twice every day we have early strawberry for breakfast at two we dine have supper at half-past eight in the evening and by ten we be all asleep the country be cover with pear-tree and apple-tree so heavy with fruit that they be all prop up then the blue hill and the winding of the main and the rhine the confectioner from whom you can buy thread and shirt-button the list of visitor which come out every Saturday as _ punch _ do with you the walking-post who before go to frankfort call as he pass to ask what we want and next day bring I my linen back the woman who sell cherry with whom my little four-year-old paul make a bargain or send they away just as he please above all the pure rhenish air -- this be familiar to all and i call it germany grove make this sketch of the blissful circle : the pleasure in he simple home life which crop out now and then in these frankfort letter be very genuine and delightful now marie be learn the scale of c he have actually forget how to play it and have teach she to pass she thumb under the wrong finger now paul tumble the other about so as to crack they skull as well as he own another time he be drag off from he letter to see a great tower which the child have build and on which they have range all they slice of bread and jam -- ' a good idea for a architect ' at ten carl come to he for reading and sum and at five for spelling and geography -- and so on ` and ' to sum up ` the best part of every pleasure be go if cécile be not there ' he wife be always somewhere in the picture even when mendelssohn go to england and be cordially receive by the young queen victorium and when she ask he what she could grant he for he pleasure he ask to see the royal nursery stratton describe the strange reward of he art as follow : delighted beyond everything the queen lead the way and the two be soon deep in the mystery of child 's clothing dietary ailment and all that appertain to the duty of the head of a family perchance he inspect the juvenile wardrobe of the future empress of he own germany on one of the home festival cécile and she sister give and act a comic dialogue between two lady ' maid in frankfort dialect gradually however mendelssohn 's overbusy musical enthusiasm wear down he health and at thirty-seven he be near the end of he marvellous vitality and vivacity in may 1847 he sister fanny be conduct a rehearsal of she choir she sit at the piano till suddenly she hand drop from the key and she be dead the news be tell to mendelssohn without any preparation with a scream he drop senseless it be say that a blood-vessel have break in he brain from this time on he be a changed man weary of everything he sink gradually until the evening of November 4 1847 he die painlessly in the presence of he wife he brother and three friend he funeral be a fitting close to he splendid life six year later cécile die at frankfort of consumption of mendelssohn 's character there be no need to speak further here it be strangely sum up in he own word in a letter he write to a man who have tell he that he be speak of as a veritable saint how few saint be canonise in they own time and how few deserve it ever but let we take mendelssohn 's own word for he own epitaph : so i be say to be a saint if this be intend to convey what i conceive to be the meaning of the word and what you expression lead I to think you also understand by it then i can only say that alas i be not so though every day of my life i strive with greater earnestness accord to my ability more and more to resemble this character i know indeed that i can never hope to be altogether a saint but if i ever approach to one it will be well if people however understand by the word ` saint ' a pietist one of those who lay they hand on they lap and expect that providence will do they work for they and who instead of strive in they vocation to press on towards perfection talk of a heavenly call be incompatible with a earthly one and be incapable of love with they whole heart any human being or anything on earth -- then god be praise such a one i be not and hope never to become so long as i live and though i be sincerely desirous to live piously and really to be so i hope this do not necessarily entail the other character it be singular that people should select precisely _ this _ time to say such a thing when i be in the enjoyment of so much happiness both through my inner and outer life and my new domestic tie as well as my busy work that i really know not how sufficiently to show my thankfulness and as you wish I to follow the path which lead to rest and peace believe I i never expect to live in the rest and peace which have now fall to my lot chapter xvii the nocturne of chopin he write to he parent : i have make the acquaintance of a important celebrity mme dudevant well know as george sand but i do not like she face there be something in it that repel I and then of course he fall in love with she for she lean on he piano and improvise flattery across the string to he and turn full on he the luminous midnight of she ox-eyed beauty a punster would say that he be oxidise at once the two lover be strangely unlike -- of course she be masculine self-poised and self-satisfied she have take excellent care of herself at a time when the independent woman have less encouragement than now so more than masculinely coarse she be in some way indeed that henry jame once insinuate that while she may have be to all intent and purpose a man she be certainly no gentleman heine rave over she beauty but judge from she portrait she later have a face as homely as that of george eliot who as carlyle say look like a horse the poet de musset one of sand 's later lover say she dark complexion give reflection like bronze therefore de musset find she very beautiful chopin be -- well some say he be not effeminate and he could break chair when he be angry at a pupil but they also speak of he frail fairylike ethereal manner and those quality i for one have never know in any non-effeminate man -- outside of book the first meeting of chopin and sand be a curious proof of the value of presentiment and should interest those who have such thing and believe they chopin accord to karasovskus go to the salon of the countess de custine as he climb the stair he fancy that he be follow by a shadow odorous of violet he want to turn back but resist the superstitious thrill those violet be the perfumery of george sand she snare he first with violet-water and thereafter surround he with she multitudinous wreath of tobacco -- though he neither make nor like smoke she however puff voluminously at cigarette and even accord to von lenz at long black cigar -- as do liszt 's princess other account be give of the first meeting and liszt claim the credit for arrange it all at she request in spite of chopin 's desire not to meet she but be that as it may he come he see and she conquer the two be alike chiefly in they versatility as lover chopin 's first love be he family on whom he dote with polish fervor george sand once exclaim that he mother be he only love she be a polish woman whose name be krzyzanovska -- a good name to change for the shorter tinkle of chopin it be from she that chopin take that deep-burning patriotism which characterise he and give he music a national tinge and at that time polish patriotism be bind to be all one elegy but chopin 's father be a frenchman and when finally the composer reach paris he find himself instantly at home and the darling of the salon how different this feeling be from the loneliness and disgust that pari fill mozart 's soul withal as we find mozart 's first serious wound in the heart come from a public singer so chopin -lrb- unless we except he pupil the princess elisa radziwill -rrb- seem to have be catch very young by constantium gladkovska she make a great success at warsaw in the year which be chopin 's twentieth he have previously indulge in a mild flirtation with a pretty little pianist and composer leopoldine blahetka but in she case he seem less to have love than to have graciously permit himself to be love when he fall under the witchery of gladkovska however he be genuinely pierce to the heart and he letter be as full of vague morose yearning as he préludes he leave warsaw for vienna but the memory of she pursued he she have sing at he farewell concert in warsaw and make a ravishing success as a picture and as a singer in vienna he long for she so deeply that he go about wear the black velvet mantle of gloom which be so effective on the musician and poet of that day to-day we will hardly permit a artist a extra half-inch of hair and he must be very well groomed very prosperous businesslike and in appearance at least athletic -- even if he must ask he tailor to furnish the look of brawn personally i prefer the mode of to-day but with to-day 's fashion we should not have have chopin such music as he draw from he familiar and dæmon the piano and such letter as he write about the gladkovska to he friend matuszynskus : god forbid that she should suffer in any way on my account set she mind at rest and tell she that as long as my heart beat i shall not cease to adore she tell she that even after my death my ash shall be strew under she foot while chopin be thus moon over she memory she seem to have be find consolation elsewhere than in she music even as mozart 's aloysium have do this letter be send on new year 's day 1831 after a few more reference to she she name vanish from he letter and the incident be close it may best be sum up in the word of jame huneker who be one of the few writer who have keep he sanity on the subject of chopin : he never see he gladkovska again for he do not return to warsaw the lady be marry in 1832 -- prefer a solid merchant to nebulous genius -- to joseph grabovskus a merchant at warsaw she husband so saith a romantic biographer count wodzinskus become blind perhaps even a blind country gentleman be preferable to a lachrymose pianist chopin must have hear of the attachment in 1831 she name almost disappear from he correspondence time as well as other nail drive from he memory she image if she be fickle he be inconstant and so let we waste no pity on this episode over which lake of tear have be shed and river of ink have be spill this same year 1831 bring chopin to pari thenceforward he residence and home he great elegance of manner as well as of music bring he into the most aristocratic dove-cote or salon as they call they and it be small wonder that he find himself unable to avoid accept and buttonhole for a while some of the countless heart that be fling like rose at he foot even george sand be amaze at he dexterity in juggle with heart and in this matter praise or blame from george sand be praise from lady hubert it seem that he could modulate from one love affair to another as fleetly and as gracefully as from one key to its remotest neighbor she say he could manage three flirtation of a evening and begin a new series the very next day apparently even distance be no barrier for george sand declare that he be at the same moment try to marry a girl in poland and another in paris the parisienne he cancel from he list because say sand when he call on she with another man she offer the other man a chair before she ask chopin to be seat chopin conduct himself in paris very much _ en prince _ accord to von lenz and such a sacrilege to the law of precedence naturally be unpardonable the polish woman whom sand refer to may have be the one woman with whom chopin be definitely know to have plan marriage this be marium wodzinska she two brother have board year before at the pension which chopin 's father keep at warsaw the acquaintance with the brother be renew in pari and when in 1835 chopin visit dresden after a long journey to see he parent he meet the sister marium then nineteen year old and fall deeply and seriously in love with she accord to she brother who write a biographical romance on chopin 's three love affair marium while not classically a beauty have a indefinable charm she black eye be full of sweetness reverie and restrained fire a smile of ineffable voluptuousness play around she lip and she magnificent hair be as dark as ebony and long enough to serve she as a mantle they flirt at the piano and behind a fan and he dedicate she a little waltz and she draw he portrait as usual the different biographer tell different story but from they the chief biographer of all frederick neick decide that chopin propose and marium depose and here endeth the second of chopin 's three romance so this bring we back to pari and george sand and the year 1837 when chopin be twenty-eight and george sand thirty-three thus far we have follow the standard authority but the year 1903 have do much in the way of unveiling chopin 's life he letter to he family and they letter to he be believe to have perish they be in the possession of he sister isabellum barcinska and she be live in the palace of count zamoyskus at warsaw in 1863 when a bomb be throw from a window as the russian lieutenant-general be pass in revenge the soldier sack the palace and burn what they do not carry off chopin 's portrait by ary scheffer he piano and he pari furniture perish and he papers be believe to be among the lose but all the while the family be keep they very existence secret until after forty year it be think proper to give they to the public m karlovicz be entrust with this honor and _ la revue musicale _ of paris choose as the medium the letter be say to make a large bulk but i have be able to see only the first three instalment of which two be family letter to he they be exuberant with tenderness admiration and of hope for he great fame the father constantly plead with the son to lay up he sous against a rainy day -- advice which meet the usual fate of good advice karlovicz say with some exaggeration : in he letter to he family chopin as if he wish to avoid pronounce the name of george sand always call she ` my hostess ' sometimes even employ strange to say the plural for instance ` elle si chères elle rirent pour tous ' or ` here the vigil be sad because _ les malades _ do not wish a doctor ' the first letter sign fritz be a most cordial welcome to a man about to marry he sister the third be a double letter from george sand and chopin to louise who have just visit the two lover at nohant in 1844 sand tell she that she visit have be the best tonic he have ever have and write to the whole family : tell they all that i love they too and would give my life to unite they with he one day under my roof chopin refer to sand as my hostess and sign himself ton vieux in he next he detail with much amusement a scandalous escapade of victor hugo 's a husband 's discovery and madame hugo 's forgiving manner he announce -lrb- July 20 1845 -rrb- that le télégraphe électro-magnétique entre baltimore et washington donne des resultats extraordinaires he revel in pun and gossip karlovicz mention the existence of a despairing letter in which chopin call he sister louise to pari where he be die she come in 1849 with she husband and daughter and remain till the end give he the last tenderness in she power this be all i have glean from karlovicz more immediate help have come from a new biography publish in warsaw in 1903 by ferdinand hoesick and accord to alfred nossig destine to upset the supremacy of nieck 's biography this latest work be really the carry out of the plan of chopin 's friend and fellow student julian fontana who share joy and sorrow with he in pari and collect letter and datum for a biography on chopin 's death liszt spring into print with a rhapsody which lead fontana to defer he work at he death in 1869 he leave it unfinished bequeath he document to he son who permit hoesick the use of they hoesick blame chopin 's notable melancholy to early experience of love requite indeed but not unite in marriage he love be as rathe as he music alfr nossig review the biography say of chopin : as he talent so do he heart mature early it be at warsaw in he early youth that he find he first ideal although he father a frenchman who have marry a polish woman do not occupy a foremost position in society frédéric move in the highest circle in addition to he genius he have always the princely way with he one of he admirer be the duchess ludvika czetvertynska whose majestic figure and aureole of hair remind one of the picture of giorgione she friend the governor of poland the grand duke konstantin through she introduction accept chopin as one of he most welcome guest he be musical and greatly admire chopin 's music whenever he violent temper carry he away the grand duchess would send secretly for chopin who would seat himself at the piano and at the first note the grand duke would appear in the drawing-room with he temper cure thus be chopin another david to a latter-day saul chopin be a intimate friend of the grand duke 's son paul whose instructor be a count moriolle it be he daughter the comtesse alexandra in whose eye chopin find inspiration he improvise never so beautifully as when she sit next to he at the piano he adoration be no secret he be often tease on account of the beautiful mariolka as he call she in he letter to he friend we find many allusion that prove that the young comtesse love he in turn but both know that this love be hopeless and therefore chopin 's musical expression of he dream for she be melancholy one remembrance of this attachment be the rondo _ à la mazur _ op 5 which he dedicate to the comtesse de moriolles in 1830 chopin tour the continent as in he later relation to george sand the passion of a poet alfr musset rival he so at this time he find a rival in the polish poet julius slovaki the pretty vivacious and perhaps somewhat flirtatious girl comtesse marium wodzinska be the bone of contention or rather the rag and the bone and the hank of hair of contention it chance that chopin and slovakus whose work show most startling similarity be also much alike in look in slenderness dreaminess of feature and even in expression of countenance they very fate be like : both leave they country never to return in they wander through europe they stop in the same capital both at last take up they residence in paris where both die of consumption it be these twin of fate whom fate put in love with the same teasing girl the black-eyed demoiselle as she be call by the poet and the musician manage so well that she two admirer never meet at the same time she travel through europe with she mother and brother and find a opportunity to meet chopin in one and slovakus in another town and to pass several week with each it be slovakus 's turn to meet she in geneva here she inspire he to much verse especially he in der schweiz but all this while the little vixen correspond with chopin he improvise in pari on theme she compose and then she repeat he inspiration to keep slovakus hover at she piano when chopin meet the wodzinski in dresden he compose for marium he f-minor étude which he call the soul-portrait of the comtesse a year later he pass a month with the family at marienbad where he propose for she hand and be accept in he bridegroom mood he compose the graceful f-minor waltz and later the c-sharp minor nocturne in the meantime slovakus travel on in blissful ignorance glorify chopin 's fiancée in poetic song full of passionate admiration the distant slovakus finally learn that chopin have win he muse and he write to he mother : they say that chopin and ` my marium ' be to be a pair how sentimental to marry a person who be the image of one 's first love swedenborg say that in a case of this kind after death not out of two of the soul but out of all three only one angel can be create but this tripartite angel die unborn for in 1837 chopin find himself desert by she so much we learn from hoesick and now we may return to chopin 's immortal if immoral affair with george sand george sand will be remember for the famous love affair she have contribute to history long after she book have lose they last reader it have be my habit in these papers to take the woman 's side and even for george sand there be much to be say in praise and in palliation for she peculiar view of life she peculiar husband may be largely blame along with the peculiar ideal of the literary circle into which she unhappy married life drive she that she show good taste in either the management or the publication of she amorous entanglement one could hardly maintain and yet the man in the case seem to have be at least as caddish as she be unwomanly but it would take volume to recount what volume have already recount and bewilderment and contradiction would still be the chief result since so much of the story be familiar i can be brief with it here george sand 's relation with chopin have be accept in almost every conceivable manner there have even be writer of such intelligence as hadow who have maintain that she be entirely and solely a mother to he before a trust in humanity as bland as this before a credulity that can deny itself to certain record and stretch itself to certain other there be nothing to say except to express gratitude that in some heart at least the belief in fairy story be not leave behind in the nursery on the other hand it be not necessary to fly to the opposite extreme and condemn the year that chopin and sand spend together as year devoid of very earnest sympathy intellectual and artistic communion and of mutual advantage the relation be irregular and be harrow by the temperament of each sand be masculine energetic restless and by nature -- for which she be surely not thoroughly to blame -- a voluptuary chopin while not the whine mooncalf some have paint he be never of truly virile character he be a man whose genius be as limit in scope as a diamond 's lustre even while it have the brilliance the firmness and the solitariness of that jewel and most of all he be that most pathetic of wretch a sick man he be drift down the current of that stream which have carry off he gifted and adored sister when she be half he present age sand be the former of the two to fall in love and the earlier to fall out after the first meeting there be little delay in begin that form of unchurched marriage so fashionable in the art world of that day in 1838 they go to majorca with sand 's two child a son and daughter who have be bear to she husband the weather be atrocious the accommodation primitive and chopin 's health wretch he be beset by presentiment and fierce anxiety and torment by a hatred of the place and the clime in June of the next year they go back to nohant she château we owe to sand herself the account of chopin 's manner of life he petulance he self-inflicted torment and the agony of he art and he disease we owe to she also the picture of she devotion both to he health and to he music the tendency of course be to take she praise of herself with a liberal sprinkling of salt and to feel that chopin be not the detestable invalid she paint he but need we withdraw charity from one to give to the other need we rob pauline to pay peter there should be easily a plenty of sympathy for both for the woman infatuate with a strange exotic genius gather he into she heart and home only to find that she have take upon herself the rôle of nurse as well as mistress and to find she time and she vitality devote to a invalid while she own life-work as a famous writer be make demand on she as wild as those of a sick musician she junior in year as in fame after grant she this justice there should still be no stint of sympathy for the poor chopin work to a frenzy with the revolution he be so gorgeously effect not only in the music of the piano but in all harmony rack with pain and unmanned with the weakening effect of he disease struggle vainly against the chill and clammy wrestler who be to drag he to he grave before he life be half complete we feeling again should not be wrath at george sand because she do not eternally resist the centrifugal force of such a life but rather a deep sense of gratitude that she give chopin some sort of home and mental support for ten long year george sand 's book be full of allusion to chopin and from the many that be quoteworthy the follow may be cite from she histoire de ma vie as throw a few fleck of light on the woman 's attitude in the affair : he be the same in friendship -lrb- as in love -rrb- become enthusiastic at first sight get disgusted and correct himself -lrb- _ se reprenant _ -rrb- incessantly live on infatuation full of charm for those who be the object of they and on secret discontent which poison he dearest affection chopin accord to I i may say honor I with a kind of friendship which be a exception in he life he be always the same to I the friendship of chopin be never a refuge for I in sadness he have enough of he own ill to bear we never address a reproach to each other except once which alas be the first and the final time but if chopin be with I devotion kind attention grace obligingness and deference in person he have not for all that abjure the asperity of character towards those who be about I with they the inequality of he soul in turn generous and fantastic give itself full course pass always from infatuation to aversion and vice versa chopin when angry be alarming and as with I he always restrain himself he seem almost to choke and die it be generally believe that in the character of _ prince karol _ in she novel lucrezium florianus publish in 1847 sand use that lethal weapon of revenge novelist possess and portray or caricature chopin it be only fair to give she disclaimer though liszt repeat the charge in he life of chopin and though karasovskus say that sand 's own child tell chopin that he be picture as prince karol none the less hearken to the novelist 's own defense : it have be pretend that in one of my romance i have paint he -lrb- chopin 's -rrb- character with a great exactness of analysis people be mistaken because they think they recognize some of he trait and proceeding by this system too convenient to be sure liszt himself in a life of chopin a little exuberant as regard style but nevertheless full of very good thing and very beautiful page have go astray in good faith i have trace in _ prince karol _ the character of a man determine in he nature exclusive in he sentiment exclusive in he exigency chopin be not such nature do not design like art however realistic it may be she have caprice inconsequence probably not real but very mysterious art only rectify these inconsequence because it be too limited to reproduce they chopin be a résumé of these magnificent inconsequence which god alone can allow himself to create and which have they particular logic he be modest on principle gentle by habit but he be imperious by instinct and full of unlegitimate pride which be unconscious of itself hence suffering which he do not reason out and which do not fix themselves on a determine object however _ prince karol _ be not a artist he be a dreamer and nothing more have no genius he have not the right of genius he be therefore a personage more true than amiable and the portrait be so little that of a great artist that chopin in read the manuscript every day on my desk have not the slightest inclination to deceive himself -- he who nevertheless be so suspicious and yet afterwards by reaction he imagine i be tell than this be the case enemy -lrb- he have such about he who call themselves he friend as if embitter a suffer heart be not murder -rrb- enemy make he believe that this romance be a revelation of he character at that time he memory be no doubt enfeebled he have forget the book why do he not re-read it this history be so little ours -- it be the very reverse of it there be between we neither the same rapture _ -lrb- envirement -rrb- _ nor the same suffering we history have nothing of a romance its foundation be too simple and too serious for we ever to have have occasion for a quarrel with each other _ à propo _ of each other as to the final separation follow my principle of let the people tell they own story so far as possible i may turn again to george sand 's own version : after the last relapse of the invalid he mind have become extremely gloomy and maurice -lrb- she son -rrb- who have hitherto tenderly love he be suddenly wound by he in a unexpected manner about a trifling subject they embrace each other the next moment but the grain of sand have fall into the tranquil lake and little by little the pebble fall there one after another -- all this be bear but at last one day maurice tire of the pin-prick speak of give up the game that could not be and should not be chopin would not stand my legitimate and necessary intervention he bow he head and say that i no longer love he what blasphemy after these eight year of maternal devotion but the poor bruised heart be not conscious of its delirium i think that some month pass at a distance and in silence would heal the wound and make he friendship again calm and he memory equitable but the revolution of February come and pari become momentarily hateful to this mind incapable of yield to any commotion in the social form free to return to poland or certain to be tolerate there he have prefer languish ten -lrb- and some more -rrb- year far from he family whom he adore to the pain of see he country transform and deform -lrb- _ dénaturé _ -rrb- he have flee from tyranny as now he flee from liberty i see he again for a instant in march 1848 i press he tremble and icy hand i wish to speak to he he slip away now it be my turn to say that he no longer love I i spare he this infliction and entrust all to the hand of providence and the future i be not to see he again there be bad heart between we there be good one too who be at a loss what to do there be frivolous one who prefer not to meddle with such delicate matter i have be tell that he have ask for I regret I and love I filially up to the very end it be think fit to conceal from he that i be ready to hasten to he it be think fit to conceal this from I till then this then be george sand 's story which have not be grant very much credence the cause of they -- divorce one might call it -- be blur by the usual discrepancy of gossip the most probable account seem to be that accord to which chopin mortally wound sand by receive she daughter and she son-in-law when they be out of sand 's favor all account agree that this be to she only a pretext for break shackle that have begin to be irksome all be agree that it be sand and not chopin who end the relationship and that she as nieck bluntly put it have recourse to the heroic means of kick he metaphorically speak out-of-door the woman seem easily to have forget the man who have prove at best of little joy to she for as she say she could never go to he with she trouble since he have always a plenty of he own it be a relief then to she be a far busier woman than he a man to find herself free but chopin be rob of he last support the strong woman he have lean upon be go and he be alone with the consumption that be eat he life away he start forth upon a concert tour but the chill climate of england and scotland be not refuge from he haunting disease he die slowly and in poverty though he be unconscious of want thanks to the generosity of a russian countess and a scotch woman dependent upon woman to the last in he die hour it be say that george sand call at he house but be not admit to see he though as he wail two day before he death she say i should die in no other arm than hers -lrb- _ que je ne mourrais que dans ses bras _ -rrb- but even the story of she visit be deny turgeniev say that fifty countess have claim that he die in they arm among the number be the countess potocka who be cherish traditionally as one of chopin 's love and who be much with he during he last day and sing for he at he request as he lay die poor genius he must even have a woman sing he swan-song for he potocka be best know by a familiar portrait that you will find in a thousand home but how the higher criticism undermine the gospel of tradition the truth be that chopin deny ever have be in love with she or she with he and huneker even claim that the famous portrait of she be not of she at all but however attend visit caress chopin die at the threshold of he prime he life light at most with a little feverish twinkling of star one nocturne end of volume i end of the project gutenberg
