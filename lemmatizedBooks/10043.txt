produce by pg distribute proofreader klondyke nugget a brief description of the great gold region in the northwest territory and alaska by joseph ladue founder of dawson city nwt explorer miner and prospector September 1897 preface the extraordinary excitement arise from the report of the discovery of gold in the klondyke region in the great canadian northwest be not surprising to one who through personal residence and practical experience be thoroughly conversant with the locality have recently return for a temporary stay after a somewhat successful experience i have receive application for information in number so great that it far exceed my ability and the time at my disposal to make direct reply i have therefore arrange with the american technical book co 45 vesey street new york city for the issue of this brief description preparatory to the publication of my larger book klondyke fact a book of 224 page with illustration and map in which will be find a vast fund of practical information statistics and all particulars seek for by those who intend emigrate to this wonderful country it be well-nigh impossible to tell the truth of these recent discovery of gold but while i can only briefly describe the territory in this small work it shall be my endeavor to give the intend prospector in the large work above mention as many fact as possible and these may thoroughly be rely upon as from one who have live continuously in those region since 1882 joseph ladue \* \* \* \* \* klondyke nuggets chapter i klondyke klondyke the word and place that have startle the civilized world be to-day a series of thrive mining camp on the yukon river and its tributary in the canadian northwest territory prior to August 24 1896 this section of the country have never be hear of it be on this day that a man name henderson discover the first gold on the first day of the follow month the writer commence erect the first house in this region and call the place dawson city now the central point of the mining camp dawson city be now the most important point in the new mining region its population in June 1897 exceed 4000 by June next it can not be less than 25000 it have a saw-mill store church of the presbyterian baptist methodist and roman catholic denomination it be the headquarters of the canadian northwest mount police _ and perfect law and order be maintain _ it be at dawson city that the prospector file he claim with the government gold commissioner in the recording office dawson city face on one of the bank of the yukon river and now occupy about a mile of the bank it be at the junction of the klondyke river with the yukon river it be here where the most valuable mining claim be be operate on a scale of profit that the world have hitherto never know the entire country surround be teem with mineral wealth copper silver and coal can be find in large quantity but little or no attention be now be pay to these valuable mineral as every one be engage in gold-hunting and work the extraordinary placer mining claim already locate the entire section be give up to placer mining very few claim have be file for quartz mining the field of gold will not be exhaust in the near future no man can tell what the end will be from January to April 1897 about $ 4000000 be take out of the few placer claim then be work this be do in a territory not exceed forty square mile all these claim be located on klondyke river and the little tributary empty into it and the district be know as big bonanza gold bottom and honker i have ask old and experienced miner at dawson city who mine through californium in bonanza day and some who mine in australium what they think of the klondyke region and they reply have invariably be the world never see so vast and rich a find of gold as we be work now dawson city be destine to be the greatest mining camp in the history of mining operation chapter ii klondyke fact there be a great popular error in reference to the climate of the gold region many report have appear in the newspaper which be mislead it have be even state that the cold be excessive almost throughout the year this be entirely a mis-statement i have find i have suffer more from winter cold in northern new york than i ever do in alaska or the canadian northwest i have chop wood in my shirt-sleeve in front of my door at dawson city when the thermometer be 70 degree below zero and i suffer no inconvenience we account for this from the fact that the air be very dry it be a fact that you do not feel this low temperature as much as you would 15 below zero in the east we usually have about three foot of snow in winter and it be as dry as sawdust as we have no winter thaw no crust form on the snow therefore we travel from the various point that may be necessary with snowshoe these may be purchase from the indian in the vicinity of dawson city at from $ 500 to $ 1000 per pair accord to the quality the winter day be very short in this region there be only two hour from sunrise to sunset the sun rise and set away in the south but there be no pitch darkness the twilight last all night and the northern light be very common then in summer it be exactly the other way the day there in July be about twenty hour long the sun rise and set in the north a great deal have be say about the short season but as a matter of fact a miner can work 12 month in the year when in that region spring open about may 1st and the ice commence to break up about that time the yukon river be generally clear of ice about may 15 the best part of the miner 's work commence then and last till about October 1st the winter commence in October but the miner keep on work through the winter the rainy season commence in the latter part of August and last two or three week a fall of two foot of snow be consider heavy there be a wide difference in the quantity of snow that accumulate on the coast and the range in the interior where the principal mining claim be located while the fall of snow on the coast be heavy the depth of snow as far down as the yukon stewart and klondyke river be inconsiderable in my new work on this territory entitle klondyke fact i deal more largely on the climate of this region there be still good digging at circle city in alaska but nearly all the miner have leave for klondyke not be satisfy with the pay dirt which they be work i know at least 20 good claim in circle city fort cudahy or as it be sometimes call forty mile creek be now practically exhaust as a mining camp and the miner have leave for other digging there will undoubtedly be new and valuable digging discover very quickly along this region as it be certain that this enormous territory be rich in gold-bearing district the entire country be teem with mineral wealth when mine operation commence on coal it will be specially valuable for steamer on the various river and greatly assist transportation facility in the next few year there will certainly be record the most marvellous discovery in this territory usually think to be only a land of snow and ice and fit only to be class with the arctic region it be marvellous to state that for some year past we have be find gold in occasional place in this territory but from the poverty of the people no effort be make to prospect among the place report it be my belief that the greatest find of gold will be make in this territory it be safe to say that not 2 per cent of all the gold discover so far have be on united state soil the great mass of the work have be do on the northwest territory which be under the canadian government it be possible however that further discovery will be make on american soil but it be my opinion that the most valuable discovery will be further east and south of the present claim and would advise prospector to work east and south of klondyke the yukon river and its tributary what the amazon be to south america the mississippus to the central portion of the united state the yukon be to alaska it be a great inland highway which will make it possible for the explorer to penetrate the mysterious fastness of that still unknown region the yukon have its source in the rocky mountain of british columbium and the coast range mountain in southeastern alaska about 125 mile from the city of juneau which be the present metropolis of alaska but it be only know as the yukon river at the point where the pelly river the branch that head in british columbium meet with the lewe river which head in southeastern alaska this point of confluence be at fort selkirk in the northwest territory about 125 mile south-east of the klondyke the yukon proper be 2044 mile in length from fort selkirk it flow north-west 400 mile just touch the arctic circle thence southward for a distance of 1600 mile where it empty into behr sea it drain more than 600000 square mile of territory and discharge one-third more water into behr sea than do the mississippus into the gulf of mexico at its mouth it be sixty mile wide about 1500 mile inland it widen out from one to ten mile a thousand island send the channel in as many different direction only native who be thoroughly familiar with the river be entrust with the piloting of boat up the stream during the season of low water even at the season of high water it be still so shallow as not to be navigable anywhere by seago vessel but only by flat-bottomed boat with a carry capacity of four to five hundred ton the draft of steamer on the yukon should not exceed three and a half foot the yukon district which be within the jurisdiction of the canadian government and in which the bulk of the gold have be find have a total area approximately of 192000 square mile of which 150768 square mile be include in the watershed of the yukon illustrate this so that it may appeal with definiteness to the reader it may be say that this territory be greater by 71100 square mile than the area of great britain and be nearly three time that of all the new england state combine a further fact must be bear in mind the yukon river be absolutely close to navigation during the winter month in the winter the frost-king assert he dominion and lock up all approach with impenetrable ice and the summer be of the briefest it endure only for twelve to fourteen week from about the first of June to the middle of September then a unending panorama of extraordinary picturesqueness be unfold to the voyager the bank be fringe with flower carpet with the all-pervading moss or tundra bird countless in number and of infinite variety in plumage sing out a welcome from every treetop pitch you tent where you will in midsummer a bed of rose a clump of poppy and a bunch of bluebell will adorn you camping but high above this paradise of almost tropical exuberance giant glacier sleep in the summit of the mountain wall which rise up from a bed of rose by September everything be change the bed of rose have disappear before the icy breath of the winter king which send the thermometer down sometimes to seventy degree below freezing point the bird fly to the southland and the bear to he sleep chamber in the mountain every stream become a sheet of ice mountain and valley alike be cover with snow till the follow may that part of the basin of the yukon in which gold in greater or less quantity have actually be find lie partly in alaska and partly in british territory it cover a area of some 50000 square mile but so far the infinitely richest spot lie some one hundred mile east of the american boundary in the region drain by the klondyke and its tributary this be some three hundred mile by river from circle city we have describe some of the beauty of the yukon basin in the summer season but this radiant picture have its obverse side horsefly gnat and mosquito add to the joy of live throughout the entire length of the yukon valley the horsefly be larger and more poignantly assertive than the insect which we know by that name in dress or undress it have a pleasant habit of detect any bare spot in the body and bite out a piece of flesh leave a wound which a few day later look like a incipient boil schwatka report that one of he party so bitten be completely disabled for a week ` at the moment of infliction ' he add ` it be hard to believe that one be not disabled for life ' the mosquito accord to the same authority be equally distressing they be especially fond of cattle but without any reciprocity of affection ` accord to the general term of the survival of the fittest and the growth of muscle most use to the detriment of other ' say the lieutenant in a unusual burst of humor ' a band of cattle inhabit this district in the far future would be all tail and no body unless the mosquito should experience a change of number ' i be indebted to wm ogilvie esq for the follow valuable information relative to the yukon district the yukon district comprise speak generally that part of the northwest territory lie west of the water shed of the mackenzie river most of it be drain by the yukon river and its tributary it cover a distance of about 650 mile along the river from the coast range of mountain in 1848 campbell establish fort selkirk at the confluence of the pelly and lewe river it be plunder and destroy in 1852 by the coast indian and only the ruin now exist of what be at one time the most important post of the hudson 's bay company to the west of the rocky mountain in the far north in 1869 the hudson 's bay company 's officer be expel from fort yukon by the united state government they hay ascertain by astronomical observation that the post be not located in british territory the officer thereupon ascend the porcupine to a point which be suppose to be within british jurisdiction where he establish rampart house but in 1890 mr jh turner of the united state coast survey find it to be 20 mile within the line of the united state consequently in 1891 the post be move 20 mile further up the river to be within british territory the next people to enter the country for trading purpose be messr harper and mcquestion they have be trade in the country since 1873 and have occupy numerous post all along the river the greater number of which have be abandon mr harper be now located as a trader at fort selkirk with mr joseph ladue under the firm name of harper & ladue and mr mcquestion be in the employ of the alaska commercial company at circle city which be the distribute point for the vast region surround birch creek alaska in 1882 a number of miner enter the yukon country by the taiya pass it be still the only route use to any extent by the miner and be shorter than the other pass though not the lowest in 1883 lieutenant schwatka cross this same pass and descend the lewe and yukon river to the ocean the explorer find that in proximity to the boundary line there exist extensive and valuable placer gold mine in which even then as many as three hundred miner be at work mr ogilvie determine by a series of lunar observation the point at which the yukon river be intersect by the 141st meridian and mark the same on the ground he also determine and mark the point at which the western affluent of the yukon know as forty mile creek be cross by the same meridian line that point be situate at a distance of about twenty-three mile from the mouth of the creek this survey prove that the place which have be select as the most convenient owe to the physical conformation of the region from which to distribute the supplies import for the various mining camp and from which to conduct the other business incident to the mining operation -- a place situate at the confluence of the forty mile creek and the yukon and to which the name of fort cudahy have be give -- be well within canadian territory the greater proportion of the mine then be work mr ogilvie find to be on the canadian side of the international boundary line but he report the existence of some mining field to the south the exact position of which with respect to the boundary he do not have the opportunity to fix the number of person engage in mining in the locality mention have steadily increase year by year since the date of mr ogilvie 's survey and it be estimate that at the commencement of the past season not less than one thousand man be so employ incident to this mineral development there must follow a corresponding growth in the volume of business of all description particularly the importation of dutiable goods and the occupation of tract of the public land for mining purpose which accord to the mining regulation be subject to the payment of certain prescribe due and charge the alaska commercial company for many year subsequent to the retirement of the hudson 's bay company have a practical monopoly of the trade of the yukon carry into the country and deliver at various point along the river without regard to the international boundary line or the custom law and regulation of canada such article of commerce as be require for the prosecution of the fur trade and latterly of placer mining these be the only two exist industry with the discovery of gold however come the organization of a compete company know as the north american transportation and trading company have its headquarters in chicago and its chief trading and distribute post at cudahy this company have be engage in this trade for over three year and during the past season despatch two ocean steamer from san francisco to st michael at the mouth of the yukon the merchandise from which be at the last mention point tranship into river steamer and carry to point inland but chiefly to the company 's distribute center within canadian territory importation of considerable value consist of the immediately requisite supplies of the miner and they tool also reach the canadian portion of the yukon district from juneau in the united state by way of the taiya inlet the mountain pass and the chain of waterway lead therefrom to cudahy upon none of these importation have any duty be collect except a sum of $ 324880 pay to inspector constantine in 1894 by the north american transportation and trading company and other and it be safe to conclude especially when it be remember that the country produce none of the article consume within it except fresh meat that a large revenue be be lose to the public exchequer under the then exist condition for the purpose of ascertain officially and authoritatively the condition of affair to which the correspondence refer to in the next precede paragraph relate the honorable the president of the privy council during the spring of 1894 despatch inspector charle constantine of the northwest mount police force accompany by sergeant brown to fort cudahy and the mining camp in its vicinity the report make by mr constantine on he return establish the substantial accuracy of the representation already refer to the value of the total output of gold for the season of 1894 he estimate at $ 300000 the fact recite clearly establish -- first that the time have arrive when it become the duty of the government of canada to make more efficient provision for the maintenance of order the enforcement of the law and the administration of justice in the yukon country especially in that section of it in which placer mining for gold be be prosecute upon such a extensive scale situate near to the boundary separate the northwest territory from the possession of the united state in alaska and second that while such measure as be necessary to that end be call for in the interest of humanity and particularly for the security and safety of the life and property of the canadian subject of she majesty resident in that country who be engage in legitimate business pursuit it be evident that the revenue justly due to the government of canada under its custom excise and land law and which would go a long way to pay the expense of government be be lose for the want of adequate machinery for its collection accordingly in June last a detachment -lrb- 1 -rrb- of twenty member of the mount police force include officer be detail for service in that portion of the northwest territory the officer in command in addition to the magisterial and other duty he be require to perform by virtue of he office and under instruction from the department of mount police be duly authorize to represent where necessary and until other arrangement can be make all the department of the government have interest in that region particularly he be authorize to perform the duty of dominion land agent collector of custom and collector of inland revenue at the same time instruction be give mr william ogilvie the surveyor refer to as have with dr dawson be entrust with the conduct of the first government expedition to the yukon to proceed again to that district for the purpose of continue and extend the work of determine the 141st meridian of lay out building lot and mining claim and generally of perform such duty as may be entrust to he from time to time mr ogilvie 's qualification as a surveyor and he previous experience as explorer of this section of the northwest peculiarly fit he for the task -lrb- footnote 1 : the detachment be make up as follow : -- inspector c constantine officer command yukon detachment nwm police inspector dae strickland assistant surgeon ae will 2 staff sergeant 2 corporal 13 constable -rrb- as it appear quite certain from the report make by mr ogilvie on he return to ottawa in 1889 and from the report of mr constantine that the operation of the miner be be conduct upon stream which have they source in the united state territory of alaska and flow into canada on they way to join the yukon and as doubtless some of the placer digging under development be situate on the united state side of the boundary it be highly desirable both for the purpose of settle definitely to which country any land occupy for mining or other purpose actually belong and in order that the jurisdiction of the court and officer of the united state and canada for both civil and criminal purpose may be establish that the determination of the 141st meridian west of greenwich from the point of its intersection with the yukon as mark by mr ogilvie in 1887-88 for a considerable distance south of the river and possibly also for some distance to the north should be proceed with at once mr ogilvie 's instruction require he to go on with the survey with all convenient speed but in order that this work may be effective for the accomplishment of the object in view the co-operation of the government of the united state be necessary correspondence be in progress through the proper authority with a view to obtain this co-operation it may be mention that a united state surveyor have also determine the point at which the yukon river and forty mile creek be intersect by the 141st meridian route distance and transportation after considerable experience i have decide that the best route for a man to take to the gold region be from seattle washington to juneau alaska and then to dawson city by the pass and waterway and i will therefore describe this route more in detail than any of the other i be devote a special chapter to the outfit for traveller and will therefore deal in this chapter with the route only the traveller have pay he fare to seattle should on arrival there have not less than $ 500 this be the minimum sum necessary to pay he fare from seattle to juneau purchase he outfit and supplies for one year and pay he necessary expense in the gold region for that length of time i think it deplorable that so many be start at this time for the gold-field i do not recommend start before march 15 i will return at that time to my claim on the klondyke if it be wise to go sooner i should certainly go the reason march 15 be best be that the season be better then if a man have only say $ 500 and want to do he own packing over the taiya pass it give he time to do it by start march 15 as he will then be in juneau April 1st i fear a great deal of hardship for those who start out so as to reach juneau for winter travel of course while i say $ 500 be sufficient to go to dawson city a man should take $ 1000 or even more if possible as he will have many opportunity to invest the surplus while price will undoubtedly advance at dawson city owe to the large influx of people i do not think the advance will be excessive it have never be the policy of the two trading company to take advantage of the miner the traveller have arrive in juneau from seattle a journey of 725 mile by water immediately purchase he complete outfit as describe in another chapter he then lose no time in leave juneau for dyea take a small steamboat which run regularly to this port via the lynn canal dyea have recently be make a custom port of entry and the head of navigation this side of the taiya pass the distance between juneau and dyea be about one hundred mile from dyea which be the timber-line he pack he outfit to the foot of the taiya pass -- the length of which to the summit be about 15 mile he must now carry he outfit up the pass which he generally do in two or more trip accord to the weight of he outfit unless he be able to hire indian or mule but so far there be very few indian to be hire and still fewer mule he now start for lake lindeman from the head of the pass a distance of eight mile -- the distance from dyea to lake lindeman be 31 mile at lake lindeman he commence to make he boat for which he have bring the proper supplies in he outfit with the exception of the timber which he find at lake lindeman he spend one week at lake lindeman make he boat and get ready for the long trip down the waterway to dawson city the heart of the klondyke region the trip through lake lindeman be short the lake be only five mile long at the foot of the lake he must portage to lake bennet the portage however be very short less than a mile lake bennet be 28 mile long while go through this lake the traveller cross the boundary between british columbium and the northwest territory after go down lake bennet the traveller come to caribou cross -- about four mile long which take he to lake tagish twenty mile in length after leave tagish he find himself in mud or marsh lake 24 mile long then into the lynx river on which he continue for 27 mile till he come to mile canyon five-eighth of a mile long immediately on leave mile canyon he have three mile of what be call bad river work which while not hazardous be dangerous from the swift current and from be very rocky great care have to be take in go down this part of the river he now find himself in white horse canyon the rapid of which be three-eighth of a mile in length and one of the most dangerous place on the trip a man be here guard by a sign keep a good lookout no stranger or novice should try to run the white horse rapid alone in a boat he should let he boat drop down the river guide by a rope with which he have provide himself in he outfit and which should be 150 foot long it would be better if the traveller should portage here the miner have construct a portage road on the west side and put down roller-way in some place on which they roll they boat over they have also make some windlass with which they haul they boat up the hill till they be at the foot of the canyon the white horse canyon be very rocky and dangerous and the current extremely swift after leave the white horse canyon he go down the river to the head of lake labarge a distance of 14 mile he can sit down and steer with the current as he be go down the stream all the way it be for this reason that in return from the digging he should take another route of which he will get full particulars before leave dawson therefore i do not take the time to give a full description of the return trip via the yukon to st michael he now go through lake labarge -- for 31 mile -- till he strike the lewe river this take he down to hootalinqua he be now in the lewe river which take he for 25 mile to big salmon river and from big salmon river 45 mile to little salmon river -- the current all this time take he down at the rate of five mile a hour of course in the canyon it be very much swifter the little salmon river take he to five finger rapid a distance of one hundred and twenty mile in the five finger rapid the voyage should be make on the right side of the river go with the current these rapid be consider safe by careful management but the novice will already have have sufficient experience in guide he boat before reach they from five finger rapid the traveller go six mile below down the lewe to the rink rapid on go through the rink rapid he continue on the lewe river to fort selkirk the trading post of harper and ladue where the pelly and lewe at they junction form the headwater of the yukon you be now at the head of the yukon river and the worst part of you trip be over you now commence to go down the yukon and after a trip of ninety-eight mile you be in the white river you keep on the white river for ten mile to the stewart river and then twenty-five mile to fort ogilvie you be now only forty mile from dawson city you journey be now almost end after a forty-mile trip on the yukon you arrive at dawson city where the klondyke empty in the yukon all through this trip you have be go through a mountainous country the tree there be pine a small amount of spruce cottonwood and birch you have not see much game if any as it be grow scarce along that line of river and very hard to find the traveller have therefore better make preparation to depend on the provision he have bring with he if he have stop to fish he may have be successful in catch whitefish grayling and lake trout along the lake and river the total journey from seattle to dawson city have take about two month in connection with this trip from juneau to dawson city it be perhaps better to give the reader the benefit of the trip of mr william stewart who write from lake lindeman may 31st 1897 as follow : -- we arrive here at the south end of the lake last night by boat we have have a awful time of it the taiya pass be not a pass at all but a climb right over the mountain we leave juneau on Thursday the twentieth on a little boat smaller than the ferry at ottawa there be over sixty aboard all in one room about ten by fourteen there be baggage pile up in one end so that the floor-space be only about eight by eight we go aboard about three o'clock in the afternoon and go ashore at dyea at seven o'clock Friday night we get the indian to pack all we stuff up to the summit but about fifty pound each i have forty-eight pound and my gun we leave dyea a indian village Sunday but only get up the river one mile we tow all the stuff up the river seven mile and then pack it to sheep camp we reach sheep camp about seven o'clock at night on the queen 's birthday a beautiful time we have i can tell you climb hill with fifty pound on we back it would not be so bad if we could strap it on rightly we leave sheep camp next morning at four o'clock and reach the summit at half-past seven it be a awful climb -- a angle of about fifty-five degree we could keep we hand touch the trail all the way up it be blow and snow up there we pay off the indian and get some sleigh and sleigh the stuff down the hill this hill go down pretty swift and then drop at a angle of fifty-five degree for about forty foot and we have to rough-lock we sleigh and let they go there be a awful fog and we could not see where we be go some fellow help we down with the first load or there would have be nothing left of we when we let a sleigh go from the top it jump about fifty foot clear and come down in piece we load up the sleigh with some of we stuff about two hundred and twenty-five pound each and start across the lake the trail be awful and we wade through water and slush two and three foot deep we get to the mouth of the canyon at about eight o'clock at night do out we leave there that night and push on again until morning we get to the bottom of a awful hill and pack all we stuff from there to the hill above the lake we have about two and a half mile over hill in snow and slush i carry about five hundred pound over that part of the trail we have to get dog to bring the stuff down from the summit to the head of the canyon we work two day bring the stuff over from the canyon to the hill above the lake Saturday we work all day pack down the hill to the lake and come here on a scow we be out yesterday morning cut down tree to build a boat the timber be small and i do not think we can get more than four-inch stuff it rain all afternoon and we could not do anything there be about fifty boat of all sort on lake bennet which be about half a mile from here i have long rubber boot up to the hip and i do not have they on come from the summit down but i have wear they ever since we meet barwell and lewi of ottawa to-day they be out look for knee for they boat they leave ottawa six week ago and have not get any farther than we have there be a little saw-mill go here and they have they lumber sawn we have it that warm some day here that you would fairly roast and the next day you would be look for you overcoat everybody here seem to be take in enough food to do they a couple of year we be now in canadian territory after we pass the summit i will have to catch somebody go through to dyea to give he this letter but i do not know how long before i can get any one go through this be the last you will hear from I until i get down to the klondyke mr stewart add : i write this in the tent at 11 o'clock at night during twilight if you take this trip in winter however you have to purchase a sled at juneau and sled it over the frozen waterway to dawson city for the benefit of my reader in canada and for party leave for the great northwest territory for the gold field i take pleasure in quote the follow description of a canadian route : -- canadian should awaken to the fact that they have emphatically ` the inside track ' to they own gold field a route not half the distance largely cover by railway and steamboat with supply station at convenient interval all the way by this route the gold-field can be reach in two month or six week and the cost of travel be ridiculously cheap -- nearly anybody can afford to go even now and by the spring it should be fit out for the accommodation of any amount of traffic the detail of the information in the follow article be give by mr ahh heme the artist who accompany mr whitney in he journey towards the barren land and the datum may be accept as correct as they be secure from the hudson bay official the detail of the inland canadian route briefly be as follow : by cpr to calgary and thence north by rail to edmonton from there by stage to athabasca landing 40 mile then there be a continuous waterway for canoe travel to fort macpherson at the mouth of the mackenzie river from which point the peel river lie southward to the gold region the exact figure be as follow : mile edmonton to athabasca landing 40 to port mcmurray 240 fort chippewyan 185 smith landing 102 fort smith 16 fort resolution 194 fort providence 168 fort simpson 161 fort wrigley 136 fort norman 184 fort good hope 174 fort macpherson 282 ----- total 1882 there be only two portage on this route of any size -- that from edmonton to athabasca landing over which there be a stage and wagon line and at smith landing sixteen mile over which the hudson bay company have a tramway there be four or five other portage of a few hundred yard but with these exception there be a fine down grade water route all the way it be the old hudson bay trunk line to the north that have be in use for nearly a century wherever there be a lake or a long stretch of deep water river navigation the company have small freight steamer which ply back and forward during the summer between the portage point or shallows with comparatively little expenditure the company or the government can improve the facility along the line so that any amount of freight or any number of passenger can be take into the gold region at less than half the time and cost that it take american to reach it from port st michael at the mouth of the yukon to the klondyke exclusive of the steamer trip of 2500 mile from seattle to port st michael canadian can leave here on a Monday at 1115 be and reach edmonton on Friday at 7 pm from that point a party of three man with a canoe should reach fort macpherson easily in from 50 to 60 day provide they be able-bodied young fellow with experience in that sort of travel they will need to take canoe from here unless they propose to hire indian with large birch bark canoe to carry they birch bark canoe can be secure of any size up to the big one man by ten indian that carry three ton but birch bark be not reliable unless indian be take along to doctor they and keep they from get water-logged the hudson bay company will also contract to take freight northward on they steamer until the close of navigation traveller to the gold mine leave now would probably reach fort macpherson before navigation close the letter from rev mr stringer the missionary publish in the spectator on July 2 show that the ice have only commence to run in the peel river which be the water route south-east from fort macpherson into the gold region on September 30 last year any canadian who be anxious to get into the klondyke ahead of the american can leave between now and August 1 reach fort macpherson and if winter come on they can exchange they canoe for dog train and reach the klondyke without half the difficulty that would be experience on the alaska route the great advantage of the inland route be that it be a organized line of communication traveller need not carry any more food than will take they from one hudson bay post to the next and then there be abundance of fish and wild fowl en route they can also be in touch with such civilization as prevail up there can always get assistance at the post and will have some place to stay should they fall sick or meet with a accident if they be lucky enough to make they pile in the klondyke they can come back by the dog sled route during the winter -lrb- there be one winter mail to fort macpherson in winter -rrb- dog for team can be purchase at nearly any of the line of hudson bay post that form a chain of road-house on the trip party travel alone will not need to employ guide until they get near fort macpherson and from there on to the klondyke as the rest of the route from edmonton be so well define have be travel for year that no guide be require you do not need a couple of thousand dollar to start for klondyke to-morrow by the edmonton route all you need be a good constitution some experience in boat and camping and about $ 150 suppose a party of three decide to start first they will need to purchase a canoe about $ 35 or less first-class ticket from hamilton to edmonton $ 7140 second class ditto $ 4090 cost of food at edmonton for three man for two month -lrb- should consist of pork flour tea and baking-powder -rrb- $ 35 freight on canoe to edmonton $ 23 total for three man from hamilton to fort macpherson provide they travel second-class on the cpr will be $ 21870 these figure be furnish by mr heming who have be over the route 400 mile north of edmonton and get the rest of he datum from the hudson bay official if three man chip in $ 150 each they would have a margin of over $ 200 for purchase they tool and for transport from fort macpherson to the klondyke this be how it may be do on the cheap though mr heming consider it ample for any party start this summer price will likely rise on the route when the rush begin if the hudson bay people be alive to they interest they will forward a large amount of supplies for fort macpherson immediately and make it the base of supplies for the klondyke during the come winter party should consist of three man each as that be the crew of a canoe it will take 600 pound of food to carry three man over the route passenger on the cpr be entitle to carry 600 pound of baggage the paddling be all down stream except when they turn south up peel river and sail should be take as there be often a favorable wind for day there be large scow on the line man by ten man each and know as ` sturgeon head ' they be like canal boat but be punt along and be use by the hudson bay people for take forward supply to the fort the return trip to the united state be usually make by the yukon steamer from dawson city direct to st michael via the yukon and anvik river thence by ocean steamer from st michael to san francisco the follow letter be interesting to the prospector as show the difficulty to overcome up the taiya pass to lake lindeman _ winnipeg _ July 27 1897 a letter have be receive from george mcleod one of the member of the winnipeg party of gold hunter that leave here recently for the yukon he write from lake lindeman under date of July 4 and state that the party expect to leave on the journey from the river a week later they have a fine boat with a freight capacity of two ton about complete the real work of the expedition start when the small steamer which convey the party from juneau arrive at dyea the man have to transfer they goods to a lighter one mile from shore each man look after he own package after get everything ashore the party be organize for ascent of the mountain pass which at the hardest point be 3000 foot above sea level mcleod and he chum to save time and money too engage 35 indian to pack they supplies over the mountain but they have to carry they own bedding and grub to keep they on the road it be fifteen mile to the summit of the pass and the party make twelve mile the first day go into camp at night tire from climb over rock stump log and hill work through river and creek and push they way through brush at the end of twelve mile they think they have go fifty on the second day out they begin to scale the summit of the mountain hill after hill confront they each one be steeper than the last there be snow on the top of the mountain and rain be fall and this add greatly to the difficulty of the ascent in many place the man have to crawl on they hand and knee so precipitous be the mountain side time after time the man would slip back several inch but they recover themselves and go at it again finally the summit be gain mcleod be the first of the party to reach the top after rest and change they clothes the descent be commence mcleod and he chum purchase sleigh on which they load they goods and haul for five mile this be extremely laborious work and the man be so use up work in the scorching sun that they be compel to work at night and sleep during the day two day after the descent begin the sleigh be abandon and the man pack the goods for three mile and a half they be fortunate in secure the service of a man who have two horse to convey the goods to lake lindeman mcleod say the worry in get over the pass be terrible and he have no desire to repeat the experience he advise all who go in to have they goods pack all the way from dyea to lake lindeman it cost 17 or 18 cent per pound for pack mcleod expect that klondyke would not be reach before July 25 i think it specially valuable for the reader to give he the approximate distance to fort cudahy which be below dawson city via the various route this table of distance have be prepare by mr jame ogilvie and i also give a number of he note which will be of great value to the traveller when make the trip from juneau to dawson city approximate distance to fort cudahy via st michael mile san francisco to dutch harbor 2400

now be explore between telegraph creek and teslin lake and will soon be open telegraph creek be the head of steamer navigation on the stikine river and be about 150 mile from teslin lake the yukon be navigable for steamer from its mouth to teslin lake a distance of 2300 mile a road be be locate by the dominion government a grant of $ 2000 have be make by the province of british columbium for open it j dalton a trader have use a route overland from chilkat inlet to fort selkirk go up the chilkat and klaheelum river he cross the divide to the tahkeena river and continue northward over a fairly open country practicable for horse the distance from the sea to fort selkirk be 350 mile last summer a juneau butcher send 40 head of cattle to cudahy g bound the man in charge cross the divide over the chilkat pass follow the shore of lake arkell and keep to the east of dalton 's trail reach the yukon just below the rink rapid here the cattle be slaughter and the meat float down on a raft to cudahy where it retail at $ 1 a pound it be propose to establish a winter road somewhere across the country travel over by dalton and bound the yukon can not be follow the ice be too much break so that any winter road will have to be overland a thorough exploration be now be make of all the pass at the head of lynn canal and of the upper water of the yukon in a few month it be expect that the best route for reach the district from lynn canal will be definitely know it be say by those familiar with the locality that the storm which rage in the upper altitude of the coast range during the greater part of the time from October to march be terrific a man catch in one of they run the risk of lose he life unless he can reach shelter in a short time during the summer there be nearly always a wind blow from the sea up chatham strait and lynn canal which lie in almost a straight line with each other and at the head of lynn canal be chilkat and chilkoot inlet the distance from the coast down these channel to the open sea be about 380 mile the mountain on each side of the water confine the current of air and deflect inclined current in the direction of the axis of the channel so that there be nearly always a strong wind blow up the channel come from the sea this wind be heavily charge with moisture which be precipitate when the air current strike the mountain and the fall of rain and snow be consequently very heavy in chilkat inlet there be not much shelter from the south wind which render it unsafe for ship call there capt hunter tell I he would rather visit any other part of the coast than chilkat to carry the survey from the island across to chilkoot inlet i have to get up on the mountain north of haine mission and from there could see both inlet owe to the bad weather i could get no observation for azimuth and have to produce the survey from pyramid island to taiya inlet by read the angle of deflection between the course at taiya inlet i get my first observation and deduce the azimuth of my course up to that point taiya inlet have evidently be the valley of a glacier its side be steep and smooth from glacial action and this with the wind almost constantly blow landward render get upon the shore difficult some long sight be therefore necessary the survey be make up to the head of the inlet on the 2d of June preparation be then commence for take the supplies and instrument over the coast range of mountain to the head of lake lindeman on the lewe river commander newell kindly aid I in make arrangement with the indian and do all he could to induce they to be reasonable in they demand this however neither he nor any one else could accomplish they refuse to carry to the lake for less than $ 20 per hundred pound and as they have learn that the expedition be a english one the second chief of the chilkoot indian recall some memory of a old quarrel which the tribe have with the english many year ago in which a uncle of he be kill and he think we should pay for the loss of he uncle by be charge a exorbitant price for we packing of which he have the sole control commander newell tell he i have a permit from the great father at washington to pass through he country safely that he would see that i do so and if the indian interfere with I they would be punish for do so after much talk they consent to carry we stuff to the summit of the mountain for $ 10 per hundred pound this be about two-third of the whole distance include all the climbing and all the wood and be by far the most difficult part of the way on the 6th of June 120 indian man woman and child start for the summit i send two of my party with they to see the goods deliver at the place agree upon each carrier when give a pack also get a ticket on which be inscribe the contents of the pack its weight and the amount the individual be to get for carry it they be make to understand that they have to produce these ticket on deliver they pack but be not tell for what reason as each pack be deliver one of my man receipt the ticket and return it the indian do not seem to understand the import of this a few of they pretend to have lose they ticket and as they could not get pay without they my assistant who have duplicate of every ticket furnish they with receipted copy after examine they pack while they be pack to the summit i be produce the survey and i meet they on they return at the foot of the cañon about eight mile from the coast where i pay they they come to the camp in the early morning before i be up and for about two hour there be quite a hubbub when pay they i try to get they name but very few of they would give any indian name nearly all after a little reflection give some common english name my list contain little else than jack tom joe charlie & c some of which be duplicated three and four time i then find why some of they have pretend to lose they ticket at the summit three or four who have thus act present themselves twice for payment produce first the receipted ticket afterwards the one they claim to have lose demand pay for both they be much take aback when they find that they duplicity have be discover these indian be perfectly heartless they will not render even the smallest aid to each other without payment and if not to each other much less to a white man i get one of they whom i have previously assist with he pack to take I and two of my party over a small creek in he canoe after put we across he ask for money and i give he half a dollar another man step up and demand pay state that the canoe be he to see what the result would be i give to he the same amount as to the first immediately there be three or four more claimant for the canoe i dismiss they with a blessing and make up my mind that i would wade the next creek while pay they i be a little apprehensive of trouble for they insist on crowd into my tent and for myself and the four man who be with I to have attempt to eject they would have be to invite trouble i be strongly of the opinion that these indian would have be much more difficult to deal with if they have not know that commander newell remain in the inlet to see that i get through without accident while make the survey from the head of tide water i take the azimuth and altitude of several of the highest peak around the head of the inlet in order to locate they and obtain a idea of the general height of the peak in the coast range as it do not appear to have be do before i have take the opportunity of name all the peak the position of which i fix in the above way the name and altitude appear on my map while go up from the head of canoe navigation on the taiya river i take the angle of elevation of each station from the precede one i would have do this from tide water up but find many of the course so short and with so little increase in height that with the instrument i have it be inappreciable from these angle i have compute the height of the summit of the taiya pass -lrb- 2 -rrb- above the head of canoe navigation as it appear to I in June 1887 and find it to be 3378 foot what depth of snow there be i can not say the head of canoe navigation i estimate at about 120 foot above tide water dr dawson give it as 124 foot -lrb- footnote 2 : the distance from the head of taiya inlet to the summit of the pass be 15 mile and the whole length of the pass to lake lindeman be 23 mile messr healy and wilson dealer in general merchandise and miner ' supplies at taiya have a train of pack horse carry freight from the head of lynn canal to the summit they hope to be able to take freight through to lake lindeman with they horse during the present season -rrb- i determine the descent from the summit to lake lindeman by carry the aneroid from the lake to the summit and back again the interval of time from start to return be about eight hour take the mean of the reading at the lake start and return and the single reading at the summit the height of the summit above the lake be find to be 1237 foot while make the survey from the summit down to the lake i take the angle of depression of each station from the precede one and from these angle i deduce the difference of height which i find to be 1354 foot or 117 foot more than that find by the aneroid this be quite a large difference but when we consider the altitude of the place the sudden change of temperature and the atmospheric condition it be not more than one might expect while at juneau i hear report of a low pass from the head of chilkoot inlet to the head water of lewe river during the time i be at the head of taiya inlet i make inquiry regard it and find that there be such a pass but could learn nothing definite about it from either whites or indian as capt moore who accompany I be very anxious to go through it and as the report of the taiya pass indicate that no wagon road or railroad could ever be build through it while the new pass appear from what little knowledge i could get of it to be much lower and possibly feasible for a wagon road i determine to send the captain by that way if i could get a indian to accompany he this i find would be difficult to do none of the chilkoot appear to know anything of the pass and i conclude that they wish to keep its existence and condition a secret the tagish or stick indian as the interior indian be locally call be afraid to do anything in opposition to the wish of the chilkoot so it be difficult to get any of they to join capt moore but after much talk and encouragement from the whites around one of they name jim be induce to go he have be through this pass before and prove reliable and useful the information obtain from capt moore 's exploration i have incorporate in my plan of the survey from taiya inlet but it be not as complete as i would have like i have name this pass white pass in honor of the late hon tho white minister of the interior under whose authority the expedition be organize commence at taiya inlet about two mile south of its north end it follow up the valley of the shkagway river to its source and thence down the valley of another river which capt moore report to empty into the takone or windy arm of bove lake -lrb- schwatka -rrb- dr dawson say this stream empty into taku arm and in that event capt moore be mistaken capt moore do not go all the way through to the lake but assume from report he hear from the miner and other that the stream flow into windy arm and this also be the idea of the indian jim from what i could gather from he remark in broken english and chinook capt moore estimate the distance from tide water to the summit at about 18 mile and from the summit to the lake at about 22 to 23 mile he report the pass as thickly timber all the way through the timber line on the south side of the taiya pass as determine by barometer reading be about 2300 foot above the sea while on the north side it be about 1000 foot below the summit this large difference be due i think to the different condition in the two place on the south side the valley be narrow and deep and the sun can not produce its full effect the snow also be much deeper there owe to the quantity which drift in from the surround mountain on the north side the surface be slope and more expose to the sun 's ray on the south side the timber be of the class peculiar to the coast and on the north that peculiar to the interior the latter would grow at a greater altitude than the coast timber it be possible that the summit of white pass be not higher than the timber line on the north of the taiya pass or about 2500 foot above tide water and it be possibly even lower than this as the timber in a valley such as the white pass would hardly live at the same altitude as on the open slope on the north side capt moore have have considerable experience in building road in mountainous country he consider that this would be a easy route for a wagon road compare with some road he have see in british columbium assume he distance to be correct and the height of the pass to be probably about correctly indicate the grade would not be very steep and a railroad could easily be carry through if necessary after complete the survey down to the lake i set about get my baggage down too of all the indian who come to the summit with pack only four or five could be induce to remain and pack down to the lake although i be pay they at the rate of $ 4 per hundred pound after one trip down only two man remain and they only in hope of steal something one of they appropriate a pair of boot and be much surprised to find that he have to pay for they on be settle with i could not blame they much for not care to work as the weather be very disagreeable -- it rain or snow almost continuously after the indian leave i try to get down the stuff with the aid of my own man but it be slavish and unhealthy labor and after the first trip one of they be lay up with what appear to be inflammatory rheumatism the first time the party cross the sun be shine brightly and this bring on snow blindness the pain of which only those who have suffer from this complaint can realize i have two sled with I which be make in juneau specially for the work of get over the mountain and down the lake on the ice with these i succeed in bring about a ton and a-half to the lake but find that the time it would take to get all down in this way would seriously interfere with the program arrange with dr dawson to say nothing of the suffering of the man and myself and the liability to sickness which protracted physical exertion under such uncomfortable condition and continue suffer from snow blindness expose we to i have with I a white man who live at the head of the inlet with a tagish indian woman this man have a good deal of influence with the tagish tribe of whom the greater number be then in the neighborhood where he reside try to get some odd job of work and i send he to the head of the inlet to try and induce the tagish indian to undertake the transportation offer they $ 5 per hundred pound in the meantime capt moore and the indian jim have rejoin I i have they assistance for a day or two and jim 's presence aid indirectly in induce the indian to come to my relief the tagish be little more than slave to the more powerful coast tribe and be in constant dread of offend they in any way one of the privilege which the coast tribe claim be the exclusive right to all work on the coast or in its vicinity and the tagish be afraid to dispute this claim when my white man ask the tagish to come over and pack they object on the grounds mention after considerable ridicule of they cowardice and explanation of the fact that they have the exclusive right to all work in they own country the country on the side of the north side of the coast range be admit by the coast indian to belong to the tagish tribe just as the coast tribe have the privilege of do all the work on the coast side of the mountain and that one of they number be already work with I unmolested and likely to continue so nine of they come over and in fear and tremble begin to pack down to the lake after they be at work for a few day some of the chilkoot come out and also start to work soon i have quite a number at work and be get my stuff down quite fast but this good fortune be not to continue owe to the prevail wet cold weather on the mountain and the difficulty of get through the soft wet snow the indian soon begin to quit work for a day or two at a time and to gamble with one another for the wages already earn many of they want to be pay in full but this i positively refuse know that to do so be to have they all apply for they earnings and leave I until necessity compel they to go to work again i once for all make they distinctly understand that i would not pay any of they until the whole of the stuff be down as many of they have already earn from twelve to fifteen dollar each to lose which be a serious matter to they they reluctantly resume work and keep at it until all be deliver this do i pay they off and set about get my outfit across the lake which i do with my own party and the two peterborough canoe which i have with I these two canoe travel about 3000 mile by rail and about 1000 mile by steamship before be bring into service they do considerable work on chilkoot and tagish inlet and be then pack over to the head of lewe river -lrb- lake lindeman -rrb- from where they be use in make the survey of lewe and yukon river in this work they make about 650 landing they be then transport on sleigh from the boundary on the yukon to navigable water on the porcupine in the spring of 1888 they descend the latter river heavily loaded and through much rough water to the mouth of bell 's river and up it to mcdougall 's pass they be then carry over the pass to poplar river and be use in go down the latter to peel river and thence up mackenzie river 1400 mile or exclusive of railway and ship carriage they be carry about 170 mile and do about 2500 mile of work for the expedition make in all about 1700 landing in no easy manner and go through some very bad water i leave they at fort chipewyan in fairly good condition and with a little painting they would go through the same ordeal again after get all my outfit over to the foot of lake lindeman i set some of the party to pack it to the head of lake bennet i employ the rest of the party in look for timber to build a boat to carry my outfit of provision and implement down the river to the vicinity of the international boundary a distance of about 700 mile it take several day to find a tree large enough to make plank for the boat i want as the timber around the upper end of the lake be small and scrubby my boat be finish on the evening of the 11th of July and on the 12th i start a portion of the party to load it and go ahead with it and the outfit to the cañon they have instruction to examine the cañon and if necessary to carry a part of the outfit past it -- in any case enough to support the party back to the coast should accident necessitate such procedure with the rest of the party i start to carry on the survey which may now be say to have fairly start ahead on the lake this prove tedious work on account of the stormy weather in the summer month there be nearly always a wind blow in from the coast it blow down the lake and produce quite a heavy swell this would not prevent the canoe go with the deck on but as we have to land every mile or so the roller break on the generally flat beach prove very troublesome on this account i find i could not average more than ten mile per day on the lake little more than half of what could be do on the river the survey be complete to the cañon on the 20th of July there i find the party with the large boat have arrive on the 18th have carry a part of the supplies past the cañon and be await my arrival to run through it with the rest in the boat before do so however i make a examination of the cañon the rapid below it particularly the last rapid of the series -lrb- call the white horse by the miner -rrb- i find would not be safe to run i send two man through the cañon in one of the canoe to await the arrival of the boat and to be ready in case of a accident to pick we up every man in the party be supply with a life-preserver so that should a casualty occur we would all have float those in the canoe get through all right but they would not have like to repeat the trip they say the canoe jump about a great deal more than they think it would and i have the same experience when go through in the boat the passage through be make in about three minute or at the rate of about 12-1\/2 mile a hour if the boat be keep clear of the side there be not much danger in high water but in low water there be a rock in the middle of the channel near the upper end of the cañon that render the passage more difficult i do not see this rock myself but get my information from some miner i meet in the interior who describe it as be about 150 yard down from the head and a little to the west of the middle of the channel in low water it barely project above the surface when i pass through there be no indication of it either from the bank above or from the boat the distance from the head to the foot of the cañon be five-eighth of a mile there be a basin about midway in it about 150 yard in diameter this basin be circular in form with steep sloping side about 100 foot high the lower part of the cañon be much rougher to run through than the upper part the fall be apparently much greater the side be generally perpendicular about 80 to 100 foot high and consist of basalt in some place show hexagonal column the white horse rapid be about three-eighth of a mile long they be the most dangerous rapid on the river and be never run through in boat except by accident they be confine by low basaltic bank which at the foot suddenly close in and make the channel about 30 yard wide it be here the danger lie as there be a sudden drop and the water rash through at a tremendous rate leap and seethe like a cataract the miner have construct a portage road on the west side and put down rollway in some place on which to shove they boat over they have also make some windlass with which to haul they boat up hill notably one at the foot of the cañon this roadway and windlass must have cost they many hour of hard labor should it ever be necessary a tramway could be build past the cañon on the east side with no great difficulty with the exception of the five finger rapid these appear to be the only serious rapid on the whole length of the river five finger rapid be form by several island stand in the channel and back up the water so much as to raise it about a foot cause a swell below for a few yard the island be compose of conglomerate rock similar to the cliff on each side of the river whence one would infer that there have be a fall here in past age for about two mile below the rapid there be a pretty swift current but not enough to prevent the ascent of a steamboat of moderate power and the rapid themselves i do not think would present any serious obstacle to the ascent of a good boat in very high water warping might be require six mile below these rapid be what be know as ` rink rapid ' this be simply a barrier of rock which extend from the westerly side of the river about half way across over this barrier there be a ripple which would offer no great obstacle to the descent of a good canoe on the easterly side there be no ripple and the current be smooth and the water apparently deep i try with a 6 foot paddle but could not reach the bottom on the 11th of August i meet a party of miner come out who have pass stewart river a few day before they see no sign of dr dawson have be there this be welcome news for I as i expect he would have reach that point long before i arrive on account of the many delay i have meet with on the coast range these miner also give I the pleasant news that the story tell at the coast about the fight with the indian at stewart river be false and state substantially what i have already repeat concern it the same evening i meet more miner on they way out and the next day meet three boat each contain four man in the crew of one of they be a son of capt moore from whom the captain get such information as induce he to turn back and accompany they out next day the 13th i get to the mouth of the pelly and find that dr dawson have arrive there on the 11th the doctor also have experience many delay and have hear the same story of the indian uprising in the interior i be please to find that he be in no immediate want of provision the fear of which have cause I a great deal of uneasiness on the way down the river as it be arrange between we in victorium that i be to take with I provision for he party to do they until they return to the coast the doctor be so much behind the time arrange to meet I that he determine to start for the coast at once i therefore set about make a short report and plan of my survey to this point and as i be not likely to get another opportunity of write at such length for a year i apply myself to a correspondence design to satisfy my friend and acquaintance for the ensue twelve month this necessitate three day ' hard work on the morning of the 17th the doctor leave for the outside world leave I with a feeling of loneliness that only those who have experience it can realize i remain at the mouth of the pelly during the next day take magnetic and astronomical observation and make some measurement of the river on the 19th i resume the survey and reach white river on the 25th here i spend most of a day try to ascend this river but find it impracticable on account of the swift current and shallow and very muddy water the water be so muddy that it be impossible to see through one-eighth of a inch of it the current be very strong probably eight mile or more per hour and the numerous bar in the bed be constantly change place after try for several hour the base man succeed in do about half a mile only and i come to the conclusion that it be useless to try to get up this stream to the boundary with canoe have it prove feasible i have intend make a survey of this stream to the boundary to discover more especially the facility it offer for the transport of supplies in the event of a survey of the international boundary be undertake i reach stewart river on the 26th here i remain a day take magnetic observation and get information from a miner name mcdonald about the country up that river mcdonald have spend the summer up the river prospecting and explore he information will be give in detail further on fort reliance be reach on the 1st of September and forty mile river -lrb- cone-hill river of schwatka -rrb- on the 7th in the interval between fort reliance and forty mile river there be several day lose by rain at forty mile river i make some arrangement with the trader there -lrb- messr harper & mcquestion -rrb- about supplies during the winter and about get indian to assist I in cross from the yukon to the head of the porcupine or perhaps on to the peel river i then make a survey of the forty mile river up to the cañon i find the canon would be difficult of ascent and dangerous to descend and therefore conclude to defer further operation until the winter and until after i have determine the longitude of my winter post near the boundary when i would be in a much better position to locate the intersection of the international boundary with this river a point important to determine on account of the number and richness of the mining claim on the river i leave forty mile river for the boundary line between alaska and the northwest territory on the 12th September and finish the survey to that point on the 14th i then spend two day in examine the valley of the river in the vicinity of the boundary to get the most extensive view of the horizon possible and to find a tree large enough to serve for a transit stand before leave toronto i get mr foster to make large brass plate with v 's on they which could be screw firmly to a stump and thus be make to serve as a transit stand i require a stump at least 22 inch in diameter to make a base large enough for the plate when properly place for the transit in a search which cover about four mile of the river bank on both side i find only one tree as large as 18 inch i mention this fact to give a idea of the size of the tree along the river in this vicinity i have this stump enlarged by firmly fix piece on the side so as to bring it up to the requisite size this do i build around the stump a small transit house of the ordinary form and then mount and adjust my transit meanwhile most of the party be busy prepare we winter quarter and build a magnetic observatory as i have be lead to expect extremely low temperature during the winter i adopt precautionary measure so as to be as comfortable as circumstance would permit during we stay there description of the yukon its affluent stream and the adjacent country i will now give from my own observation and from information receive a more detailed description of the lewe river its affluent stream and the resource of the adjacent country for the purpose of navigation a description of the lewe river begin at the head of lake bennet above that point and between it and lake lindeman there be only about three-quarter of a mile of river which be not more than fifty or sixty yard wide and two or three foot deep and be so swift and rough that navigation be out of the question lake lindeman be about five mile long and half a mile wide it be deep enough for all ordinary purpose lake bennet -lrb- 3 -rrb- be twenty-six and a quarter mile long for the upper fourteen of which it be about half a mile wide about midway in its length a arm come in from the west which schwatka appear to have mistake for a river and name wheaton river this arm be wider than the other arm down to that point and be report by indian to be longer and head in a glacier which lie in the pass at the head of chilkoot inlet this arm be as far as see surround by high mountain apparently much higher than those on the arm we travel down below the junction of the two arm the lake be about one and a half mile wide with deep water above the fork the water of the east branch be muddy this be cause by the stream from the numerous glacier on the head of the tributary of lake lindeman -lrb- footnote 3 : a small saw-mill have be erect at the head of lake bennet lumber for boat building sell at $ 100 per m boat 25 foot long and 5 foot beam be $ 60 each last year the ice break up in the lake on the 12th June but this season be earlier and the boat be expect to go down the lake about the 1st of June -rrb- a stream which flow into lake bennet at the south-west corner be also very dirty and have shoal quite a large portion of the lake at its mouth the beach at the lower end of this lake be comparatively flat and the water shoal a deep wide valley extend northwards from the north end of the lake apparently reach to the cañon or a short distance above it this may have be originally a course for the water of the river the bottom of the valley be wide and sandy and cover with scrubby timber principally poplar and pitch-pine the water of the lake empty at the extreme north-east angle through a channel not more than one hundred yard wide which soon expand into what schwatka call lake nare -lrb- 4 -rrb- through this narrow channel there be quite a current and more than 7 foot of water as a 6 foot paddle and a foot of arm add to its length do not reach the bottom -lrb- footnote 4 : the connect water between lake bennet and tagish lake constitute what be now call caribou cross -rrb- the hill at the upper end of lake lindeman rise abruptly from the water 's edge at the lower end they be neither so steep nor so high lake nare be only two and a half mile long and its greatest width be about a mile it be not deep but be navigable for boat draw 5 or 6 foot of water it be separate from lake bennet by a shallow sandy point of not more than 200 yard in length no stream of any consequence empty into either of these lake a small river flow into lake bennet on the west side a short distance north of the fork and another at the extreme north-west angle but neither of they be of any consequence in a navigable sense lake nare flow through a narrow curved channel into bove lake -lrb- schwatka -rrb- this channel be not more than 600 or 700 yard long and the water in it appear to be sufficiently deep for boat that could navigate the lake the land between the lake along this channel be low swampy and cover with willow and at the stage in which i see it do not rise more than 3 foot above the water the hill on the south-west side slope up easily and be not high on the north side the deep valley already refer to border it and on the east side the mountain rise abruptly from the lake shore bove lake -lrb- call tagish lake by dr dawson -rrb- be about a mile wide for the first two mile of its length when it be join by what the miner have call the windy arm one of the tagish indian inform I they call it takone lake here the lake expand to a width of about two mile for a distance of some three mile when it suddenly narrow to about half a mile for a distance of a little over a mile after which it widen again to about a mile and a half or more ten mile from the head of the lake it be join by the taku arm from the south this arm must be of considerable length as it can be see for a long distance and its valley can be trace through the mountain much farther than the lake itself can be see it be apparently over a mile wide at its mouth or junction dr dawson include bove lake and these two arm under the common name of tagish lake this be much more simple and comprehensive than the various name give they by traveller these water collectively be the fishing and hunting grounds of the tagish indian and as they be really one body of water there be no reason why they should not be all include under one name from the junction with the taku arm to the north end of the lake the distance be about six mile the greater part be over two mile wide the west side be very flat and shallow so much so that it be impossible in many place to get we canoe to the shore and quite a distance out in the lake there be not more than 5 foot of water the member of my party who be in charge of the large boat and outfit go down the east side of the lake and report the depth about the same as i find on the west side with many large rock they pass through it in the night in a rainstorm and be much alarm for the safety of the boat and provision it would appear that this part of the lake require some improvement to make it in keep with the rest of the water system with which it be connect where the river debouch from it it be about 150 yard wide and for a short distance not more than 5 or 6 foot deep the depth be however soon increase to 10 foot or more and so continue down to what schwatka call marsh lake the miner call it mud lake but on this name they do not appear to be agree many of they call the lower part of tagish or bove lake mud lake on account of its shallowness and flat muddy shore as see along the west side the side nearly always travel as it be more sheltered from the prevail southerly wind the term mud lake be however not applicable to this lake as only a comparatively small part of it be shallow or muddy and it be nearly as inapplicable to marsh lake as the latter be not markedly muddy along the west side and from the appearance of the east shore one would not judge it to be so as the bank appear to be high and gravelly marsh lake be a little over nineteen mile long and average about two mile in width i try to determine the width of it as i go along with my survey by take azimuth of point on the eastern shore from different station of the survey but in only one case do i succeed as there be no prominent mark on that shore which could be identify from more than one place the piece of river connect tagish and marsh lake be about five mile long and average 150 to 200 yard in width and as already mention be deep except for a short distance at the head on it be situate the only indian house to be find in the interior with any pretension to skill in construction they show much more labor and imitativeness than one know anything about the indian in he native state would expect the plan be evidently take from the indian house on the coast which appear to I to be a poor copy of the house which the hudson 's bay company 's servant build around they trading post these house do not appear to have be use for some time past and be almost in ruin the tagish indian be now generally on the coast as they find it much easier to live there than in they own country as a matter of fact what they make in they own country be take from they by the coast indian so that there be little inducement for they to remain the lewe river where it leave marsh lake be about 200 yard wide and average this width as far as the cañon i do not try to find bottom anywhere as i go along except where i have reason to think it shallow and there i always try with my paddle i do not anywhere find bottom with this which show that there be no part of this stretch of the river with less than six foot of water at medium height at which stage it appear to I the river be at that time from the head of lake bennet to the cañon the correct distance be ninety-five mile all of which be navigable for boat draw 5 foot or more add to this the westerly arm of lake bennet and the takone or windy arm of tagish lake each about fifteen mile in length and the taku arm of the latter lake of unknown length but probably not less than thirty mile and we have a stretch of water of upward of one hundred mile in length all easily navigable and as have be point out easily connect with taiya inlet through the white pass no stream of any importance enter any of these lake so far as i know a river call by schwatka mcclintock river enter marsh lake at the lower end from the east it occupy a large valley as see from the westerly side of the lake but the stream be apparently unimportant another small stream apparently only a creek enter the south-east angle of the lake it be not probable that any stream come from the east side of the lake be of importance as the strip of country between the lewe and teslintoo be not more than thirty or forty mile in width at this point the taku arm of tagish lake be so far with the exception of report from indian unknown but it be equally improbable that any river of importance enter it as it be so near the source of the water flow northwards however this be a question that can only be decide by a proper exploration the cañon i have already describe and will only add that it be five-eighths of a mile long about 100 foot wide with perpendicular bank of basaltic rock from 60 to 100 foot high below the cañon proper there be a stretch of rapid for about a mile then about half a mile of smooth water follow which be the white horse rapid which be three-eighth of a mile long and unsafe for boat the total fall in the cañon and succeed rapid be measure and find to be 32 foot be it ever necessary to make this part of the river navigable it will be no easy task to overcome the obstacle at this point but a tram or railway could with very little difficulty be construct along the east side of the river past the cañon for some distance below the white horse rapid the current be swift and the river wide with many gravel bar the reach between these rapid and lake labarge a distance of twenty-seven and a half mile be all smooth water with a strong current the average width be about 150 yard there be no impediment to navigation other than the swift current and this be no stronger than on the lower part of the river which be already navigate nor be it worse than on the saskatchewan and red river in the more eastern part of we territory about midway in this stretch the tahkeena river -lrb- 5 -rrb- join the lewe this river be apparently about half the size of the latter its water be muddy indicate the passage through a clayey district i get some indefinite information about this river from a indian who happen to meet I just below its mouth but i could not readily make he understand I and he reply be a compound of chinook tagish and sign and therefore largely unintelligible from what i could understand with any certainty the river be easy to descend there be no bad rapid and it come out of a lake much larger than any i have yet pass -lrb- footnote 5 : the tahkeena be formerly much use by the chilkat indian as a means of reach the interior but never by the miner owe to the distance from the sea to its head -rrb- here i may remark that i have invariably find it difficult to get reliable or definite information from indian the reason for this be many most of the indian it have be my lot to meet be expect to make something and consequently be very chary about do or say anything unless they think they will be well reward for it they be naturally very suspicion of stranger and it take some time and some knowledge of they language to overcome this suspicion and gain they confidence if you begin at once to ask question about they country without previously have they understand that you have no unfriendly motive in do so they become alarmed and although you may not meet with a positive refusal to answer question you make very little progress in get desire information on the other hand i have meet case where either through fear or hope of reward they be only too anxious to impart all they know or have hear and even more if they think it would please they hearer i need hardly say that such information be often not at all in accordance with the fact i have several time find that some act of mine when in they presence have arouse either they fear superstition or cupidity as a instance : on the bell river i meet some indian come down stream as i be go up we be ashore at the time and invite they to join we they start to come in but very slowly and all the time keep a watchful eye on we i notice that my double-barrelled shot gun be lie at my foot load and pick it up to unload it as i know they would be handle it after land this alarm they so much that it be some time before they come in and i do not think they would have come ashore at all have they not hear that a party of white man of whom we answer the description be come through that way -lrb- they have learn this from the hudson 's bay company 's officer -rrb- and conclude we be the party describe to they after drink some of we tea and get a supply for themselves they become quite friendly and communicative i cite these as instance of what one meet with who come in contact with indian and of how trifle affect they a sojourn of two or three day with they and the assistance of a common friend would do much to disabuse they of such idea but when you have no such aid you must not expect to make much progress lake labarge be thirty-one mile long in the upper thirteen it vary from three to four mile in width it then narrow to about two mile for a distance of seven mile when it begin to widen again and gradually expand to about two and a-half or three mile the lower six mile of it maintain the latter width the survey be carry along the western shore and while so engage i determine the width of the upper wide part by triangulation at two point the width of the narrow middle part at three point and the width of the lower part at three point dr dawson on he way out make a track survey of the eastern shore the western shore be irregular in many place be indent by large bay especially at the upper and lower end these bay be as a rule shallow more especially those at the lower end just above where the lake narrow in the middle there be a large island it be three and a-half mile long and about half a mile in width it be show on schwatka 's map as a peninsula and call by he richtofen rock how he come to think it a peninsula i can not understand as it be well out in the lake the nearest point of it to the western shore be upward of half a mile distant and the extreme width of the lake here be not more than five mile which include the depth of the deepest bay on the western side it be therefore difficult to understand that he do not see it as a island the upper half of this island be gravelly and do not rise very high above the lake the lower end be rocky and high the rock being of a bright red color at the lower end of the lake there be a large valley extend northwards which have evidently at one time be the outlet of the lake dr dawson have note it and its peculiarity he remark regard it will be find on page 156-160 of he report entitle ` yukon district and northern portion of british columbium ' publish in 1889 the width of the lewe river as it leave the lake be the same as at its entrance about 200 yard its water when i be there be murky this be cause by the action of the wave on the shore along the lower end of the lake the water at the upper end and at the middle of the lake be quite clear so much so that the bottom can be distinctly see at a depth of 6 or 7 foot the wind blow almost constantly down this lake and in a high wind it get very rough the miner complain of much detention owe to this cause and certainly i can not complain of a lack of wind while i be on the lake this lake be name after one mike labarge who be engage by the western union telegraph company explore the river and adjacent country for the purpose of connect europe and america by telegraph through british columbium and alaska and across behr strait to asia and thence to europe this exploration take place in 1867 but it do not appear that labarge then nor for some year after see the lake call by he name the successful lay of the atlantic cable in 1866 put a stop to this project and the explore party send out be recall as soon as word could be get to they it seem that labarge have get up as far as the pelly before he receive he recall he have hear something of a large lake some distance further up the river and afterwards speak of it to some trader and miner who call it after he after leave lake labarge the river for a distance of about five mile preserve a generally uniform width and a easy current of about four mile per hour it then make a short turn round a low gravel point and flow in exactly the opposite of its general course for a mile when it again turn sharply to its general direction the current around this curve and for some distance below it -- in all four or five mile -- be very swift i time it in several place and find it from six to seven mile a hour it then moderate to four or five and continue so until the teslintoo river be reach thirty-one and seven tenth mile from lake labarge the average width of this part of the river be about 150 yard and the depth be sufficient to afford passage for boat draw at least 5 foot it be as a rule crooked and consequently a little difficult to navigate the teslintoo -lrb- 6 -rrb- be so call by dr dawson -- this accord to information obtain by he be the indian name it be call by the miner ` hootalinkwa ' or hotalinqua and be call by schwatka who appear to have bestow no other attention to it the newberry although it be apparently much larger than the lewe this be so apparent that in my interim report i state it as a fact owe to circumstance already narrate i have not time while at the mouth to make any measurement to determine the relative size of the river but on he way out dr dawson make these measurement and he report before refer to give the follow value of the cross section of each stream : lewe 3015 foot teslintoo 3809 foot in the same connection he state that the lewe appear to be about 1 foot above its lowest summer level while the teslintoo appear to be at its lowest level assume this to be so and take he width as we datum it would reduce he cross section of the lewe to 2595 foot owe however to the current in the lewe as determine by dr dawson be just double that of the teslintoo the figure be 568 and 288 mile per hour respectively the discharge of the lewe take these figure again in 18644 foot and of the teslintoo 11436 foot to reduce the lewe to its lowest level the doctor say would make its discharge 15600 foot -lrb- footnote 6 : the limited amount of prospect that have be do on this river be say to be very satisfactory fine gold have be find in all part of the river the lack of supplies be the great drawback to its development and this will not be overcome to any extent until by some means heavy freight can be bring over the coast range to the head of the river indeed owe to the difficulty attend access and transportation the great drawback to the entire yukon district at present be the want of heavy mining machinery and the scarcity of supplies the government be aware of the requirement and possibility of the country have undertake the task of make preliminary survey for trail and railroad and no doubt in the near future the avenue for better and quicker transportation facility will be open up -rrb- the water of the teslintoo be of a dark brown color similar in appearance to the ottawa river water and a little turbid notwithstanding the difference of volume of discharge the teslintoo change completely the character of the river below the junction and a person come up the river would at the fork unhesitatingly pronounce the teslintoo the main stream the water of the lewe be blue in color and at the time i speak of be somewhat dirty -- not enough so however to prevent one see to a depth of two or three foot at the junction of the lewe and teslintoo i meet two or three family of the indian who hunt in the vicinity one of they could speak a little chinook as i have two man with I who understand he jargon perfectly with they assistance i try to get some information from he about the river he tell I the river be easy to ascend and present the same appearance eight day journey up as at the mouth then a lake be reach which take one day to cross the river be then follow again for half a day to another lake which take two day to traverse : into this lake empty a stream which they use as a highway to the coast passing by way of the taku river he say it take four day when they have load to carry from the head of canoe navigation on the teslintoo to salt water on the taku inlet but when they come light they take only one to two day he speak also of a stream enter the large lake from the east which come from a distance but they do not seem to know much about it and consider it outside they country if they time interval be approximately accurate they mean that there be about 200 mile of good river to the first lake as they ought easily to make 25 mile a day on the river as i see it the lake take one day to traverse and be at least 25 mile long follow by say 12 of river which bring we to the large lake which take two day to cross say 50 or 60 more -- in all about 292 mile -- say 300 to the head of canoe navigation while the distance from the head of lake bennet to the junction be only 188 assume the course of the teslintoo to be nearly south -lrb- it be a little to the east of it -rrb- and throw out every fourth mile for bend the remainder give we in arc three degree and a quarter of latitude which deduct from 61 ° 40 ' the latitude of the junction give we 58 ° 25 ' or nearly the latitude of juneau to make sure that i understand the indian aright and that he know what he be speak about i get he to sketch the river and lake as he describe they on the sand and repeat the same several time i afterwards meet mr t boswell he brother and another miner who have spend most of the summer on the river prospecting and from they i gather the following : the distance to the first and only lake which they see they put at 175 mile and the lake itself they call at least 150 mile long as it take they four day to row in a light boat from end to end the portage to the sea they do not appear to know anything about but describe a large bay on the east side of the lake into which a river of considerable size enter this river occupy a wide valley surround by high mountain they think this river must head near liard river this account differ materially from that give by the indian and to put they on they guard i tell they what he have tell I but they still persist in they story which i find differ a good deal from the account they give dr dawson as incorporate in he report many year ago sixteen i think a man name monroe prospect up the taku and learn from the indian something of a large lake not far from that river he cross over and find it and spend some time in prospecting and then recross to the sea this man have be at forty mile river and i hear from the miner there he account of the appearance of the lake which amount generally to this : the boswell do not know anything about it it be unfortunate the boswell do not remain at forty mile all winter as by a comparison of recollection they might have arrive at some correct conclusion conflict as these description be one thing be certain : this branch if it have not the greater discharge be the longer and more important of the two and offer easy and uninterrupted navigation for more than double the distance which the lewe do the cañon be only ninety mile above the mouth of the teslintoo the boswell report it as contain much more useful timber than the lewe which indeed one would infer from its lower altitude assume this as the main river and add its length to the lewes-yukon below the junction give upward of 2200 mile of river fully two-third of which run through a very mountainous country without a impediment to navigation some indefinite information be obtain as to the position of this river in the neighborhood of marsh lake tend to show that the distance between they be only about thirty or forty mile between the teslintoo and the big salmon so call by the miner or d'abbadie by schwatka the distance be thirty-three and a-half mile in which the lewe preserve a generally uniform width and current for a few mile below the teslintoo it be a little over the ordinary width but then contract to about two hundred yard which it maintain with little variation the current be generally from four to five mile per hour the big salmon i find to be about one hundred yard wide near the mouth the depth not more than four or five foot and the current so far as could be see sluggish none of the miner i meet could give I any information concern this stream but dr dawson be more fortunate and meet a man who have spend most of the summer of 1887 prospect on it he opinion be that it might be navigable for small stern-wheel steamer for many mile the valley as see from the mouth be wide and give one the impression of be occupy by a much more important stream look up it in the distance could be see many high peak cover with snow as the date be August it be likely they be always so covered which would make they probable altitude above the river 5000 foot or more dr dawson in he report incorporate fully the note obtain from the miner i will trespass so far on these as to say that they call the distance to a small lake near the head of the river 190 mile from the mouth this lake be estimate to be four mile in length another lake about 12 mile above this be estimate to be twenty-four mile long and its upper end distant only about eight mile from the teslintoo these distance if correct make this river much more important than a casual glance at it would indicate this however will be more fully speak of under its proper head just below the big salmon the lewe take a bend of nearly a right angle its course from the junction with the tahkeena to this point be generally a little east of north at this point it turn to nearly west for some distance its course between here and its confluence with the pelly be north-west and i may add it preserve this general direction down to the confluence with the porcupine the river also change in another respect it be generally wider and often expand into what might be call lake in which be island some of the lake be of considerable length and well timbered to determine which channel be the main one that be which carry the greatest volume of water or be best available for the purpose of navigation among these island would require more time than i could devote to it on my way down consequently i can not say more than that i have no reason to doubt that a channel give six foot or more of water could easily be find whenever in the main channel i have reason to think the water shallow i try it with my paddle but always fail to find bottom which give upward of six foot of course i often find less than this but not in what i consider the main channel thirty-six and a quarter mile below the big salmon the little salmon -- the daly of schwatka -- enter the lewe this river be about 60 yard wide at the mouth and not more than two or three foot in depth the water be clear and of a brownish hue there be not much current at the mouth nor as far as can be see up the stream the valley which from the mouth do not appear extensive bear north-east for some distance when it appear to turn more to the east six or seven mile up and apparently on the north side some high cliff of red rock apparently granite can be see it be say that some miner have prospect this stream but i could learn nothing definite about it lewe river make a turn here to the south-west and run in that direction six mile when it again turn to the north-west for seven mile and then make a short sharp turn to the south and west around a low sandy point which will at some day in the near future be cut through by the current which will shorten the river three or four mile eight mile below little salmon river a large rock call the eagle 's nest stand up in a gravel slope on the easterly bank of the river it rise about five hundred foot above the river and be compose of a light gray stone what the character of this rock be i could not observe as i see it only from the river which be about a quarter of a mile distant on the westerly side of the river there be two or three other isolate mass of apparently the same kind of rock one of they might be appropriately call a mountain it be south-west from the eagle 's nest and distant from it about three mile thirty-two mile below eagle 's nest rock nordenskiold river enter from the west it be a unimportant stream be not more than one hundred and twenty foot wide at the mouth and only a few inch deep the valley as far as can be see be not extensive and be very crooked it be hard to tell what its general direction be the lewe between the little salmon and the nordenskiold maintain a width of from two to three hundred yard with a occasional expansion where there be island it be serpentine in its course most of the way and where the nordenskiold join it be very crooked run several time under a hill name by schwatka tantalus butte and in other place leave it for a distance of eight mile the distance across from point to point be only half a mile below this to five finger rapid so-called from the fact that five large mass of rock stand in mid-channel the river assume its ordinary straightness and width with a current from four to five mile per hour i have already describe five finger rapid i do not think they will prove anything more than a slight obstruction in the navigation of the river a boat of ordinary power would probably have to help herself up with windlass and line in high water below the rapid for about two mile the current be strong -- probably six mile per hour -- but the water seem to be deep enough for any boat that be likely to navigate it six mile below this as already notice rink rapid be situate they be of no great importance the westerly half of the stream only be obstruct the easterly half be not in any way affect the current be smooth and the water deep below five finger rapid about two mile a small stream enter from the east it be call by dr dawson tatshun river it be not more than 30 or 40 foot wide at the mouth and contain only a little clear brownish water here i meet the only indian see on the river between teslintoo and stewart river they be engage in catch salmon at the mouth of the tatshun and be the poorest and most unintelligent indian it have ever be my lot to meet it be needless to say that none of we party understand anything they say as they could not speak a word of any language but they own i try by sign to get some information from they about the stream they be fishing in but fail i try in the same way to learn if there be any more indian in the vicinity but again utterly fail i then try by sign to find out how many day it take to go down to pelly river but although i have never know these sign to fail in elicit information in any other part of the territory they do not understand they appear to be alarm by we presence and as we have not yet be assure as to the rumor concern the trouble between the miner and indian we feel a little apprehensive but be able to learn nothing from they we have to put we fear aside and proceed blindly between five finger rapid and pelly river fifty-eight and a half-mile no stream of any importance enter the lewe in fact with the exception of the tatshun it may be say that none at all enter about a mile below rink rapid the river spread out into a lake-like expanse with many island this continue for about three mile when it contract to something like the usual width but bar and small island be very numerous all the way to pelly river about five mile above pelly river there be another lake-like expanse fill with island the river here for three or four mile be nearly a mile wide and so numerous and close be the island that it be impossible to tell when float among they where the shore of the river be the current too be swift lead one to suppose the water shallow but i think even here a channel deep enough for such boat as will navigate this part of the river can be find schwatka name this group of island ingersoll island at the mouth of the pelly the lewe be about half a mile wide and here too there be many island but not in group as at ingersoll island about a mile below the pelly just at the ruin of fort selkirk the yukon be find to be 565 yard wide about two-third be ten foot deep with a current of about four and three-quarter mile per hour the remain third be more than half take up by a bar and the current between it and the south shore be very slack pelly river at its mouth be about two hundred yard wide and continue this width as far up as could be see dr dawson make a survey and examination of this river which will be find in he report already cite yukon district and northern british columbium just here for a short distance the course of the yukon be nearly west and on the south side about a mile below the mouth of the lewe stand all that remain of the only trading post ever build by white man in the district this post be establish by robert campbell for the hudson 's bay company in the summer of 1848 it be first build on the point of land between the two river but this location prove untenable on account of flooding by ice jam in the spring it be in the season of 1852 move across the river to where the ruin now stand it appear that the house compose the post be not finish when the indian from the coast on chilkat and chilkoot inlet come down the river to put a stop to the competitive trade which mr campbell have inaugurate and which they find to seriously interfere with they profit they method of trade appear to have be then pretty much as it be now -- very onesided what they find it convenient to take by force they take and what it be convenient to pay for at they own price they pay for rumor have reach the post that the coast indian contemplate such a raid and in consequence the native indian in the vicinity remain about nearly all summer unfortunately they go away for a short time and during they absence the coast indian arrive in the early morning and surprised mr campbell in bed they be not at all rough with he but give he the privilege of leave the place within twenty-four hour after which he be inform that he be liable to be shoot if see by they in the locality they then pillage the place and set fire to it leave nothing but the remains of the two chimney which be still stand this raid and capture take place on the 1st August 1852 mr campbell drop down the river and meet some of the local indian who return with he but the robber have make they escape i have hear that the local indian wish to pursue and overtake they but to this mr campbell would not consent have they do so it be probable not many of the raider would have escape as the superior local knowledge of the native would have give they a advantage difficult to estimate and the confidence and spirit derive from the aid and presence of a white man or two would be worth much in such a conflict mr campbell go on down the river until he meet the outfit for he post on its way up from fort yukon which he turn back he then ascend the pelly cross to the liard and reach fort simpson on the mackenzie late in October mr campbell 's first visit to the site of fort selkirk be make in 1840 under instruction from sir george simpson then governor of the hudson 's bay company he cross from the head water of the liard to the water of the pelly it appear the pelly where he strike it be a stream of considerable size for he speak of its appearance when he first see it from ` pelly bank ' the name give the bank from which he first behold it as a ` splendid river in the distance ' in June 1843 he descend the pelly to its confluence with the larger stream which he name the ` lewe ' here he find many family of the native indian -- ` wood indian ' he call they these people convey to he as best they could by word and sign the danger that would attend a further descent of the river represent that the country below theirs be inhabit by a tribe of fierce cannibal who would assuredly kill and eat they this so terrify he man that he have to return by the way he come pursue as he afterwards learn by the indian who would have murder himself and party have they get a favorable opportunity thus it be not until 1850 that he could establish what he say he all along believe ` that the pelly and yukon be identical ' this he do by descend the river to where the porcupine join it and where in 1847 fort yukon be establish by mr ah murray for the hudson 's bay company with reference to the tale tell he by the indian of bad people outside of they country i may say that mackenzie tell pretty much the same story of the indian on the mackenzie when he discover and explore that river in 1789 he have the advantage of have indian along with he whose language be radically the same as that of the people he be come among and he statement be more explicit and detailed everywhere he come in contact with they they manifest first dread of himself and party and when friendship and confidence be establish they nearly always try to detain he by represent the people in the direction he be go as unnaturally bloodthirsty and cruel sometimes assert the existence of monster with supernatural power as at manitou island a few mile below the present fort good hope and the people on a very large river far to the west of the mackenzie probably the yukon they describe to he as monster in size power and cruelty in we own time after the intercourse that there have be between they and the whites more than a suspicion of such unknown cruel people lurk in the mind of many of the indian it would be futile for I to try to ascribe a origin for these fear my knowledge of they language and idiosyncrasy be so limited nothing more be ever do in the vicinity of fort selkirk -lrb- 7 -rrb- by the hudson 's bay company after these event and in 1869 the company be order by capt charle w raymond who represent the united state government to evacuate the post at fort yukon he have find that it be west of the 141st meridian the post be occupy by the company however for some time after the receipt of this order and until rampart house be build which be intend to be on british territory and to take the trade previously do at fort yukon -lrb- footnote 7 : this be now a winter port for steamboat of the north american transportation and trading company ply the yukon and its tributary there be also a trading post here own by harper & ladue -rrb- under present condition the company can not very well compete with the alaska commercial company whose agent do the only trade in the district -lrb- 8 -rrb- and they appear to have abandon -- for the present at least -- all attempt to do any trade nearer to it than rampart house to which point notwithstanding the distance and difficulty in the way many of the indian on the yukon make a trip every two or three year to procure goods in exchange for they fur the clothing and blanket bring in by the hudson 's bay company they claim be much better than those trade on they own river by the american those of they that i see who have any english blanket exhibit they with pride and exclaim ` good ' they point to a american blanket in contempt with the remark ` no good ' and speak of they clothing in the same way -lrb- footnote 8 : since the date of this report the north american transportation and trading company better know in the yukon valley as captain healy 's company have establish a number of post on the river -rrb- on many map of alaska a place name ` reed 's house ' be show on or near the upper water of stewart river i make enquiry of all whom i think likely to know anything concern this post but fail to elicit any information show that there ever have be such a place i enquired of mr reid who be in the company 's service with mr campbell at fort selkirk and after whom i think possibly the place have be call but he tell I he know of no such post but that there be a small lake at some distance in a northerly direction from fort selkirk where fish be procure a sort of shelter have be make at that point for the fisherman and a few fur might have be obtain there but it be never regard as a trading post below fort selkirk the yukon river be from five to six hundred yard broad and maintain this width down to white river a distance of ninety-six mile island be numerous so much so that there be very few part of the river where there be not one or more in sight many of they be of considerable size and nearly all be well timbered bar be also numerous but almost all be compose of gravel so that navigator will not have to complain of shift sand bar the current as a general thing be not so rapid as in the upper part of the river average about four mile per hour the depth in the main channel be always find to be more than six foot from pelly river to within twelve mile of white river the general course of the river be a little north of west it then turn to the north and the general course as far as the site of fort reliance be due north white river enter the main river from the west at the mouth it be about two hundred yard wide but a great part of it be fill with ever-shifting sand-bar the main volume of water be confine to a channel not more than one hundred yard in width the current be very strong certainly not less than eight mile per hour the color of the water bear witness to this as it be much the muddiest that i have ever see -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : the white river very probably flow over volcanic deposit as its sediment would indicate no doubt this would account for the discoloration of its water the volcanic ash appear to cover a great extent of the upper yukon basin drain by the lewe and pelly river very full treatment of the subject be give by dr dawson in he report entitle yukon district and northern portion of british columbium -rrb- i have intend to make a survey of part of this river as far as the international boundary and attempt to do so but after try for over half a day i find it would be a task of much labor and time altogether out of proportion to the importance of the end seek and therefore abandon it the valley as far as can be see from the mouth run about due west for a distance of eight mile it then appear to bear to the south-west it be about two mile wide where it join the pelly valley and apparently keep the same width as far as it can be see mr harper of the firm of harper & ladue go up this river with sled in the fall of 1872 a distance of fifty or sixty mile he describe it as possess the same general feature all the way up with much clay soil along its bank its general course as sketch by he on a map of mine be for a distance of about thirty mile a little north-west thence south-west thirty or thirty-five mile when it deflect to the north-west run along the base of a high mountain ridge if the course give be correct it must rise somewhere near the head of forty mile river and if so its length be not at all in keep with the volume of its discharge when compare with the known length and discharge of other river in the territory mr harper mention a extensive flat south of the mountain range speak of across which many high mountain peak could be see one of these he think must be mount st elia as it overtop all the other but as mount st elia be about one hundred and eighty mile distant he conclusion be not tenable from he description of this mountain it must be more than twice the height of the highest peak see anywhere on the lower river and consequently must be ten or twelve thousand foot above the sea he state that the current in the river be very swift as far as he ascend and the water muddy the water from this river though probably not a fourth of the volume of the yukon discolor the water of the latter completely and a couple of mile below the junction the whole river appear almost as dirty as white river between white and stewart river ten mile the river spread out to a mile and upward in width and be a maze of island and bar the survey be carry down the easterly shore and many of the channel pass through barely afford water enough to float the canoe the main channel be along the westerly shore down which the large boat go and the crew report plenty of water stewart river enter from the east in the middle of a wide valley with low hill on both side rise on the north side in step or terrace to distant hill of considerable height the river half a mile or so above the mouth be two hundred yard in width the current be slack and the water shallow and clear but dark color while at the mouth i be fortunate enough to meet a miner who have spend the whole of the summer of 1887 on the river and its branch prospect and explore he give I a good deal of information of which i give a summary he be a native of new brunswick alexander mcdonald by name and have spend some year mining in other place but be very reticent about what he have make or find sixty or seventy mile up the stewart a large creek enter from the south which he call rise bud creek or river and thirty or forty mile further up a considerable stream flow from the north-east which appear to be beaver river as mark on the map of that part of the country from the head of this stream he float down on a raft take five day to do so he estimate he progress at forty or fifty mile each day which give a length of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty mile this be probably a over-estimate unless the stream be very crooked which he state be not the case as much of he time would be take up in prospecting i should call thirty mile or less a closer estimate of he progress this river be from fifty to eighty yard wide and be never more than four or five foot deep often be not more than two or three the current he say be not at all swift above the mouth of this stream the main river be from one hundred to one hundred and thirty yard wide with a even current and clear water sixty or seventy mile above the last-mentioned branch another large branch join which be possibly the main river at the head of it he find a lake nearly thirty mile long and average a mile and a half in width which he call mayhew lake after one of the partner in the firm of harper mcquestion & co thirty mile or so above the fork on the other branch there be fall which mcdonald estimate to be from one to two hundred foot in height i meet several party who have see these fall and they corroborate this estimate of they height mcdonald go on past the fall to the head of this branch and find terraced gravel hill to the west and north he cross they to the north and find a river flow northward on this he embark on a raft and float down it for a day or two think it would turn to the west and join the stewart but find it still continue north and acquire too much volume to be any of the branch he have see while pass up the stewart he return to the point of he departure and after prospect among the hill around the head of the river he start westward cross a high range of mountain compose principally of shale with many thin seam of what he call quartz range from one to six inch in thickness on the west side of this range he find a river flow out of what he call mayhew lake and cross this get to the head of beaver river which he descend as before mention it be probable the river flow northwards on which he make a journey and return be a branch of peel river he describe the timber on the gravel terrace of the watershed as small and open he be alone in this unknown wilderness all summer not see even any of the native there be few man so constitute as to be capable of isolate themselves in such a manner judge from all i could learn it be probable a light-draught steamboat could navigate nearly all of stewart iver and its tributary from stewart river to the site of fort reliance -lrb- 10 -rrb- seventy-three and a quarter mile the yukon be broad and full of island the average width be between a half and three quarter of a mile but there be many expansion where it be over a mile in breadth however in these place it can not be say that the waterway be wider than at other part of the river the island be so large and numerous in this reach no stream of any importance enter -lrb- footnote 10 : this be at one time a trading post occupy by messr harper & mcquestion -rrb- about thirteen mile below stewart river a large valley join that of the river but the stream occupy it be only a large creek this agree in position with what have be call sixty mile creek which be suppose to be about that distance above fort reliance but it do not agree with description which i receive of it moreover as sixty mile creek be know to be a stream of considerable length this creek would not answer its description twenty-two and a half mile from stewart river another and larger creek enter from the same side it agree with the description of sixty mile creek and i have so marked it on my map this stream be of no importance except for what mineral wealth may be find on it -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : sixty mile creek be about one hundred mile long very crooked with a swift current and many rapid and be therefore not easy to ascend miller glacier gold little gold and bedrock creek be all tributary of sixty mile some of the richest discovery in gold so far make in the interior since 1894 have be upon these creek especially have this be the case upon the two first mention there be a claim upon miller creek own by joseph boudreau from which over $ 100000 worth of gold be say to have be take out freight for the mine be take up forty mile creek in summer for a distance of 30 mile then portage across to the head of miller and glacier creek in the winter it be haul in by dog the trip from cudahy to the post at the mouth of sixty mile river be make by ascend forty mile river a small distance make a short portage to sixty mile river and run down with its swift current come back on the yukon nearly the whole of the round trip be make down stream indian creek enter the yukon from the east about 30 mile below sixty mile it be report to be rich in gold but owe to the scarcity of supplies its development have be retard at the mouth of sixty mile creek a townsite of that name be located it be the headquarters for upward of 100 miner and where they more or less assemble in the winter month messr harper & co have a trading post and a saw-mill on a island at the mouth of the creek both of which be in charge of mr j ladue one of the partner of the firm and who be at one time in the employ of the alaska commercial company -rrb- six and a half mile above port reliance the thron-diuck -lrb- 12 -rrb- river of the indian -lrb- deer river of schwatka -rrb- enter from the east it be a small river about forty yard wide at the mouth and shallow the water be clear and transparent and of beautiful blue color the indian catch great number of salmon here they have be fish shortly before my arrival and the river for some distance up be full of salmon trap -lrb- footnote 12 : dawson city be situate at the mouth of the thron-diuck now know as klondyke and although it be located only a few month ago it be the scene of great activity very rich deposit of gold have be lately find on bonanza creek and other affluent of the thron-diuck -rrb- a miner have prospect up this river for a estimate distance of forty mile in the season of 1887 i do not see he but get some of he information at second hand the water be so beautifully clear i think it must come through a large lake not far up but as far as he have go no lake be see he say the current be comparatively slack with a occasional ` ripple ' or small rapid where he turn back the river be surround by high mountain which be then cover with snow which account for the purity and clearness of the water it appear that the indian go up this stream a long distance to hunt but i could learn nothing definite as to they statement concern it twelve and a half mile below fort reliance the chandindu river as name by schwatka enter from the east it be thirty to forty yard wide at the mouth very shallow and for half a mile up be one continuous rapid its valley be wide and can be see for a long distance look north-eastward from the mouth between fort reliance and forty mile river -lrb- call cone hill river by schwatka -rrb- the yukon assume its normal appearance have fewer island and be narrower average four to six hundred yard wide and the current be more regular this stretch be forty-six mile long but be estimate by the trader at forty from which the forty mile river take its name forty mile river -lrb- 13 -rrb- join the main river from the west its general course as far up as the international boundary a distance of twenty-three mile be south-west after this it be report by the miner to run nearer south many of they claim to have ascend this stream for more than one hundred mile and speak of it there as quite a large river they say that at that distance it have reach the level of the plateau and the country adjoining it they describe as flat and swampy rise very little above the river it be only a short distance across to the tanana river -- a large tributary of the yukon -- which be here describe as a important stream however only about twenty-three mile of forty mile river be in canada and the upper part of it and its relation to other river in the district have no direct interest for we -lrb- footnote 13 : forty mile townsite be situate on the south side of the forty mile river at its junction with the yukon the alaska commercial company have a station here which be for some year in charge of ln mcquestion there be also several blacksmith shop restaurant billiard hall bakery a opera house and so on rather more than half a mile below forty mile townsite the town of cudahy be found on the north side of forty mile river in the summer of 1892 it be name after a well know member of the north american transportation and trading company in population and extent of business the town bear comparison with its neighbor across the river the opposition in trade have be the means of very materially reduce the cost of supplies and live the north american transportation and trading company have erect a saw-mill and some large warehouse fort constantine be establish here immediately upon the arrival of the mount police detachment in the latter part of July 1895 it be describe further on in a extract from inspector constantine 's supplementary report for the year 1895 -rrb- forty mile river be one hundred to one hundred and fifty yard wide at the mouth and the current be generally strong with many small rapid eight mile up be the so-called cañon it be hardly entitle to that distinctive name be simply a crooked contraction of the river with steep rocky bank and on the north side there be plenty of room to walk along the beach at the lower end of the cañon there be a short turn and swift water in which be some large rock these can not generally be see and there be much danger of strike they run down in a boat at this point several miner have be drown by they boat be upset in collision with these rock it be no great distance to either shore and one would think a ordinary swimmer would have no difficulty in reach land but the coldness of the water soon benumb a man completely and render he powerless in the summer of 1887 a indian from tanana with he family be come down to trade at the post at the mouth of forty mile river he canoe strike on these rock and upset and he be throw clear of the canoe but the woman and child cling to it in the rough water he lose sight of they and conclude that they be lose : it be say he deliberately draw he knife and cut he throat thus perish while he family be haul ashore by some miner the chief of the band to which this indian belong come to the post and demand pay for he loss which he contend be occasion by the trader have move from belle isle to forty mile thus cause they to descend this dangerous rapid and there be little doubt that have there not be so many white man in the vicinity he would have try to enforce he demand the length of the so-called cañon be about a mile above it the river up to the boundary be generally smooth with swift current and a occasional ripple the amount of water discharge by this stream be considerable but there be no prospect of navigation it be so swift and break by small rapid from forty mile river to the boundary the yukon preserve the same general character as between fort reliance and forty mile the greatest width be about half a mile and the least about a quarter fifteen mile below forty mile river a large mass of rock stand on the east bank this be name by schwatka ` roquette rock ' but be know to the trader as old woman rock a similar mass on the west side of the river be know as old man rock the origin of these name be a indian legend of which the follow be the version give to I by the trader -- in remote age there live a powerful shaman pronounce tshaumen by the indian this be the local name for what be know as medicine man among the indian farther south and east the tshauman hold a position and exercise a influence among the people he live with something akin to the wise man or magus of olden time in the east in this powerful being 's locality there live a poor man who have the great misfortune to have a inveterate scold for a wife he bear the infliction for a long time without murmur in hope that she would relent but time seem only to increase the affliction at length grow weary of the unceasing torment he complain to the tshauman who comfort he and send he home with the assurance that all would soon be well shortly after this he go out to hunt and remain away for many day endeavor to get some provision for home use but without avail he return weary and hungry only to be meet by he wife with a more than usually violent outburst of scolding this so provoke he that he gather all he strength and energy for one grand effort and give she a kick that send she clean across the river on landing she be convert into the mass of rock which remain to this day a memorial of she viciousness and a warn to all future scold the metamorphosis be effect by the tshauman but how the necessary force be acquire to send she across the river -lrb- here about half a mile wide -rrb- or whether the kick be administer by the tshauman or the husband my narrator could not say he be altogether at a loss to account for conversion of the husband into the mass of rock on the west side of the river nor can i offer any theory unless it be that he be _ petrified _ by astonishment at the result such legend as this would be of interest to ethnologist if they could be procure direct from the indian but repeat by man who have little or no knowledge of the utility of legendary lore and less sympathy with it they lose much of they value between forty mile river and the boundary line no stream of any size join the yukon in fact there be only one stream which some of the miner have name sheep creek but as there be another stream further down the river call by the same name i have name it coal creek it be five mile below forty mile and come in from the east and be a large creek but not at all navigable on it some extensive coal seam be see which will be more fully refer to further on \* \* \* \* \* at the boundary the river be somewhat contract and measure only 1280 foot across in the winter but in summer at ordinary water level it would be about one hundred foot wider immediately below the boundary it expand to its usual width which be about 2000 foot the area of the cross section measure be 22268 foot the sectional area of the teslintoo as determine by dr dawson and already refer to be 3809 foot that of the lewe at the teslintoo from the same authority be 3015 foot have the above cross-section be reduce to the level at which the water ordinarily stand during the summer month instead of to the height at which it stand in the middle of September when it be almost at its lowest the sectional area would have be at least 50 per cent more and at spring flood level about double the above area it be a difficult matter to determine the actual discharge at the place of the cross-section owe to the irregularity in the depth and current the latter be in the deep channel at the east side when i try it in September approximately 48 mile per hour while on the bar in midstream it be not more than 25 mile per hour and between the bar and the westerly shore there be very little current the river above this for some mile be no better for the purpose of cross-section measurement at the boundary it be narrow and clear of bar and island for some mile but here i do not have a opportunity to determine the rate of the current before the river freeze up and after it freeze the drift ice be jam and pile so high that it would have be a almost endless task to cut hole through it the current from the boundary down to the confluence with the porcupine be say to be strong and much the same as that above from the porcupine down for a distance of five or six hundred mile it be call medium and the remainder easy from stewart river to the mouth of the yukon be about 1650 mile and the only difficult place in all this distance be the part near the confluence with the porcupine which have evidently be a lake in past age but be now fill with island it be say that the current here be swift and the channel generally narrow render navigation difficult chapter iii advice to beginner man who be think of go to the klondyke region and take a trip of this character for the first time will do well to carefully read the chapter on outfit for miner it be a great mistake to take anything except what be necessary the trip be a long arduous one and a man should not add one pound of baggage to he outfit that can be dispense with i have know man who have load themselves up with rifle revolver and shot-gun this be entirely unnecessary revolver will get you into trouble and there be no use of take they with you as large game of any character be rarely find on the trip i have prospect through this region for some year and have only see one moose you will not see any large game whatever on you trip from juneau to dawson city therefore do not take any firearm along you will find a list of the implement for the miner in the chapter on outfit for miner the miner here be a very mixed class of people they represent many nationality and come from all climate they life be certainly not enviable the regulation miner 's cabin be 12 by 14 with wall six foot high and gable eight foot in height the roof be heavily earthed and the cabin be generally keep very warm two or sometimes three or four man will live in a house of this size the ventilation be usually bad the window be very small those miner who do not work they claim during the winter confine themselves to these small hut most of the time very often they become indolent and careless only eat those thing which be most easily cook or prepare during the busy time in summer when they be shovel in they work hard and for long hour spare little time for eating and much less for cooking this manner of living be quite common amongst beginner and soon lead to debility and sometimes to scurvy old miner have learn from experience to value health more than gold and they therefore spare no expense in procure the best and most varied outfit of food that can be obtain in a cold climate such as this where it be impossible to get fresh vegetable and fruit it be most important that the best substitute for these should be provide nature help to supply these want by grow cranberry and other wild fruit in abundance but man in summer be usually too busy to avail themselves of these the disease meet with in this country be dyspepsia anemia scurvy cause by improperly cook food sameness of diet overwork want of fresh vegetable overheate and badly ventilate house rheumatism pneumonia bronchitis enteritis cystitis and other acute disease from exposure to wet and cold debility and chronic disease due to excess man come to klondyke should be sober strong and healthy they should be practical man able to adapt themselves quickly to they surroundings special care should be take to see that they lung be sound that they be free from rheumatism and rheumatic tendency and that they joint especially knee joint be strong and have never be weaken by injury synovitis or other disease it be also very important to consider they temperament man should be of cheerful hopeful disposition and willing worker those of sullen morose nature although they may be good worker be very apt as soon as the novelty of the country wear off to become dissatisfied pessimistic and melancholy chapter iv outfit for miner in give any advice for outfit for miner i should first state that it be a great mistake to purchase anything whatever before arrive at juneau alaska this have be a supply point for that region for upward of ten year and store-keeper and supply company carry in stock exactly what be necessary for the miner you will find that they price be reasonable consider the difference in cost of transportation at any point you might decide to purchase from in the united state in fact it be the saving of money to buy in juneau in the matter of clothing of course it must be leave to the individual taste and means of the purchaser but the miner usually adopt the native costume of the region the boot be generally make by the coast indian and be of different variety the water boot be make of seal and walrus it be important to take a pair of rubber boot along additional boot can be purchase at dawson city the native boot cost from two to five dollar a pair trousers be generally make from siberian fawn skin and the skin of the marmot or the ground squirrel the outer garment be generally make of the marmot skin the people at dawson city who be not engage in mine such as store-keeper clerk etc generally wear these garment good warm flannel be important everything in the way of underwear be make of flannel such as shirt the cost of flannel shirt at dawson city be $ 5 rubber boot at dawson city be $ 10 to $ 1200 a pair blanket and robe be use for bedding and should be purchase at juneau wolf skin make the best robe good one cost $ 100 apiece but cheaper one can be obtain from the bear mink and red fox and arctic hare warm sock be make from the skin of the arctic hare if you have any delay at juneau you will probably be ask to take trip to the giant glacier but my advice be to stay in juneau until the steamer be ready to start for dyea you will need all the rest you can get before start up the pass in the matter of provision the following be a list which be consider sufficient to last a man on he trip from juneau to dawson city : -- 20 pound of flour 12 pound of bacon 12 bean 4 butter 5 vegetable 4 can of condensed milk 5 pound of sugar 1 pound of tea 3 pound of coffee 1 1-2 pound of salt 5 pound of corn meal a small portion of pepper and mustard the follow utensil should be take : -- 1 frying pan 1 water kettle 1 yukon stove 1 bean pot 2 plate 1 tin drinking cup 1 tea pot 1 knife and fork 1 large and 1 small cooking pan the follow tool should he bring as part of the outfit : -- these will be find absolutely necessary to build a boat at lake lindeman : -- 1 jack plane 1 whip see 1 cross-cut see 1 axe 1 hatchet 1 hunting-knife 6 pound of assorted nail 1 pound of oakum 5 pound of pitch 150 foot of rope 1 juneau sled it be also necessary to have one good duck tent and a rubber blanket a good piece of mosquito net will not be heavy and will also be very great comfort on the trip do not forget to put in a good supply of match and take a small supply of fishing tackle hook etc it be very important that you have a pair of snow glass to guard against snow blindness it will be interesting to know the price at dawson city for supplies : when i leave in June 1896 flour be sell in 50 pound bag at $ 600 a bag fresh beef be supply at 50 cent a pound bacon be 40 cent coffee be 50 cent per pound brown sugar be 20 cent per pound and granulated sugar be 25 cent a pound condensed milk be 50 cent per can pick axis be $ 600 each miner ' shovel be $ 200 each lumber right at dawson city be $ 13000 per thousand foot undressed and $ 15000 per thousand foot dress it be well perhaps to advise the traveller to supply himself with a small medicine box which can be purchase in juneau but it be not necessary if he enjoy good rugged health on arrive at dawson city luxury will be find to be very high what be to be consider a very cheap cigar in the united state two for 5 cent sell in dawson city at 50 cent each liquor command very high price whisky sell in the saloon for 50 cent a glass and fluctuate from $ 1500 to $ 2500 per gallon
