be keep by a man name thompson he only companion be a old negro man they both live in a small hut near the lighthouse one evening about dark they discover a party of some fifteen or twenty indian creep upon they upon which they immediately retreat into the lighthouse carry with they a keg of gunpowder with the gun and ammunition from the window of the lighthouse thompson fire upon they several time but the moment he would show himself at the window the glass would be instantly riddled by the rifle ball and he have no alternative but to lie close the indian meanwhile get out of patience at not be able to force the door which thompson have secure collect pile of wood which be place against the door and set fire to in process of time not only burn through the door but also set fire to the stair-case conduct to the lantern into which thompson and the negro be compel to retreat from this too they be finally drive by the encroach flame and be force outside on the parapet wall which be not more than three foot wide -lrb- illustration : attack on the lighthouse -rrb- the flame now begin to ascend as from a chimney some fifteen or twenty foot above the lighthouse these man have to lie in this situation some seventy foot above the ground with a blaze furnace roast they on one side and the indian on the other embrace every occasion as soon as any part of the body be expose to pop at they the negro incautiously expose himself be kill while thompson receive several ball in he foot which he have project beyond the wall nearly roasted to death and in a fit of desperation thompson seize the keg of gunpowder which he have still preserve from the hand of the enemy throw it into the blaze lighthouse hope to end he own suffering and destroy the savage in a few moment it explode but the wall be too strong to be shake and the explosion take place out of the lighthouse as though it have be fire from a gun the effect of the concussion be to throw down the blaze material level with the ground so as to produce a subsidence of the flame and then thompson be permit to remain exempt from they influence before day the indian be off and thompson be leave alone be compel to throw off the body of the negro while strength be leave he and before it putrefy the explosion be hear on board a revenue cutter at some distance which immediately proceed to the spot to ascertain what have occur when they find the lighthouse burnt and the keeper above on top of it various expedient be resort to to get he down and finally a kite be make and raise with strong twine and so manoeuver as to bring the line within he reach to which a rope of good size be next attach and haul up by thompson finally a block which be fasten to the lighthouse and have a rope to it enable the crew to haul up a couple of man by whose aid thompson be safely land on terra firma the indian have attempt to reach he by means of the lightning rod to which they have attach thong of buckskin but could not succeed in get more than half way up a incident in the war of mexican independence the follow thrilling narrative be from a translation in sharpe 's magazine a captain in the mexican insurgent army be give a account of a meditated night attack upon a hacienda situate in the cordillera and occupy by a large force of spanish soldier after a variety of detail he continue : have arrive at the hacienda unperceived thanks for the obscurity of a moonless night we come to a halt under some large tree at some distance from the building and i ride forward from my troop in order to reconnoitre the place the hacienda so far as i could see in glide across form a huge massive parallelogram strengthen by enormous buttress of hew stone along this chasm the wall of the hacienda almost form the continuation of another perpendicular one chisel by nature herself in the rock to the bottom of which the eye could not penetrate for the mist which incessantly boil up from below do not allow it to measure they awful depth this place be know in the country by the name of ` the voladero ' i have explore all side of the building except this when i know not what scruple of military honor incite I to continue my ride along the ravine which protect the rear of the hacienda between the wall and the precipice there be a narrow pathway about six foot wide by day the passage would have be dangerous but by night it be a perilous enterprize the wall of the farm take a extensive sweep the path creep round they entire basement and to follow it to the end in the darkness only two pace from the edge of a perpendicular chasm be no very easy task even for as practice a horseman as myself nevertheless i do not hesitate but boldly urge my horse between the wall of the farm-house and the abyss of the voladero i have get over half the distance without accident when all of a sudden my horse neigh aloud this neigh make I shudder i have just reach a pass where the ground be but just wide enough for the four leg of a horse and it be impossible to retrace my step ` hallo ' i exclaimed aloud at the risk of betray myself which be even less dangerous than encounter a horseman in front of I on such a road ` there be a christian pass along the ravine keep back ' it be too late at that moment a man on horseback pass round one of the buttress which here and there obstruct this accursed pathway he advance toward I i tremble in my saddle my forehead bath in a cold sweat ` for the love of god can you not return ' i exclaimed terrify at the fearful situation in which we both be place ` impossible ' reply the horseman i recommend my soul to god to turn we horse round for want of room to back they along the path we have traverse or even to dismount from they -- these be three impossibility which place we both in presence of a fearful doom between two horseman so place upon this fearful path have they be father and son one of they must inevitably have become the prey of the abyss but a few seconds have pass and we be already face to face -- the unknown and myself we horse be head to head and they nostril dilate with terror mingle together they fiery breathing both of we halt in a dead silence above be the smooth and lofty wall of the hacienda on the other side but three foot distant from the wall open the horrible gulf be it a enemy i have before my eye the love of my country which boil at that period in my young bosom lead I to hope it be ` be you for mexico and the insurgent ' i exclaimed in a moment of excitement ready to spring upon the unknown horseman if he answer I in the negative ' _ mexico e insurgente _ -- that be my password reply the cavalier ' i be the colonel garduno ' ' i be the captain castano ' we acquaintance be of long standing and but for mutual agitation we should have have no need to exchange we name the colonel have leave we two day since at the head of the detachment which we suppose to be either prisoner or cut off for he have not be see to return to the camp ` well colonel ' i exclaimed ' i be sorry you be not a spaniard for you perceive that one of we must yield the pathway to the other we horse have the bridle on they neck and i put my hand to the holster of my saddle to draw out my pistol ' i see it so plainly ' return the colonel with alarming coolness ` that i should already have blow out the brain of you horse but for the fear lest mine in a moment of terror should precipitate I with yourself to the bottom of the abyss ' i remark in fact that the colonel already hold he pistol in he hand we both maintain almost profound silence we horse feel the danger like ourselves and remain as immovable as if they foot be nail to the ground my excitement have entirely subside ` what be we go to do ' i demand of the colonel ` draw lot which of the two shall leap into the ravine ' it be in truth the sole means of resolve the difficulty ` there be nevertheless some precaution to take ' say the colonel ` he who shall be condemn by the lot shall retire backward it will be but a feeble chance of escape for he i admit but in short there be a chance and especially one in favor of the winner ' ` you cling not to life then ' i cry out terrify at the _ sang-froid _ with which this proposition be put to I ' i cling to life more than yourself ' sharply reply the colonel ` for i have a mortal outrage to avenge but the time be fast slip away be you ready to proceed to draw the last lottery at which one of we will ever exist how be we to proceed to this drawing by lot by means of the wet finger like infant or by head and tail like the school boy both way be impracticable we hand imprudently stretch out over the head of we frightened horse might cause they to give a fatal start should we toss up a piece of coin the night be too dark to enable we to distinguish which side fall upward the colonel bethought he of a expedient of which i never should have dream ` listen to I captain ' say the colonel to whom i have communicate my perplexity ' i have another way the terror which we horse feel make they draw every moment a burning breath the first of we two whose horse shall neigh -- ` win ' i exclaimed hastily ` not so shall be looser i know that you be a countryman and as such you can do whatever you please with you horse as to myself who but last year wear a gown of a theological student i fear you equestrian prowess you may be able to make you horse neigh : to hinder he from do so be a very different matter ' we wait in deep and anxious silence until the voice of one of we horse should break forth the silence last for a minute -- for a age it be my horse who neigh the first the colonel give no external manifestation of he joy but no doubt he thank god to the very bottom of he heart ` you will allow I a minute to make my peace with heaven ' i say with fall voice ` will five minute be sufficient ' ` it will ' i reply the colonel pull out he watch i address toward the heaven brilliant with star which i think i be look to for the last time a intense and burn prayer ` it be time ' say the colonel i answer nothing and with a firm hand gather up the bridle of my horse and draw it within my finger which be agitate by a nervous tremor ` yet one moment more ' i say to the colonel for i have need of all my coolness to carry into execution the fearful manoeuver which i be about to commence ` grant ' reply garduno my education as i have tell you have be in the country my childhood and part of my earliest youth have almost be pass on horseback i may say without flattering myself that if there be any one in the world capable of execute this equestrian feat it be myself i rally myself with a almost supernatural effort and succeed in recover my entire self-possession in the very face of death take it at the worst i have already brave it too often to be any longer alarm at it from that instant i dare to hope afresh as soon as my horse feel for the first time since my rencounter with the colonel the bit compress he mouth i perceive that he tremble beneath I i strengthen myself firmly on my stirrup to make the terrify animal understand that he master no longer tremble i hold he up with bridle and the ham as every good horseman do in a dangerous passage and with the bridle the body and the spur together succeed in back he a few pace he head be already a greater distance from that of the horse of the colonel who encourage I all he could with he voice this do i let the poor tremble brute who obey I in spite of he terror repose for a few moment and then recommence the same manoeuver all on a sudden i feel he hind leg give way under I a horrible shudder run through my whole frame i close my eye as if about to roll to the bottom of the abyss and i give to my body a violent impulse on the side next to the hacienda the surface of which offer not a single projection not a tuft of weed to check my descent this sudden movement join to the desperate struggle of my horse be the salvation of my life he have spring up again on he leg which seem ready to fall from under he so desperately do i feel they tremble i have succeed in reach between the brink of the precipice and the wall of the build a spot some few inch broader a few more would have enable I to turn he round but to attempt it here would have be fatal and i dare not venture i seek to resume my backward progress step by step twice the horse throw himself on he hind leg and fall down upon the same spot it be in vain to urge he anew either with voice bridle or spur the animal obstinately refuse to take a single step in the rear nevertheless i do not feel my courage yet exhaust for i have no desire to die one last solitary chance of safety suddenly appear to I like a flash of light and i resolve to employ it through the fastening of my boot and in reach of my hand be place a sharp and keen knife which i draw forth from its sheath with my left hand i begin caress the mane of my horse all the while let he hear my voice the poor animal reply to my caress by a plaintive neighing then not to alarm he abruptly my hand follow by little and little the curve of he nervous neck and finally rest upon the spot where the last of the vertebra unite itself with the cranium the horse tremble but i calm he with my voice when i feel he very life so to speak palpitate in he brain beneath my finger and lean over toward the wall my foot gently slide from the stirrup and with one vigorous blow i bury the pointed blade of my knife in the seat of the vital principle the animal fall as if thunderstruck without a single motion and for myself with my knee almost as high as my chin i find myself a horseback across a corpse i be save i utter a triumphant cry which be respond to by the colonel and which the abyss re-echoed with a hollow sound as if it feel that its prey have escape from it i quit the saddle sit down between the wall and the body of my horse and vigorously push with my foot against the carcass of the wretched animal which roll down into the abyss i then arise and clear at a few bound the distance which separate the place where i be from the plain and under the irresistible reaction of the terror which i have long repress i sink into a swoon upon the ground when i reopen my eye the colonel be by my side a sketch from life on the ocean carthagena lie in the parallel of ten degree twenty-six minute north and seventy-five degree thirty-eight minute west longitude the harbor be good with a easy entrance the city be strongly fortify by extensive and commanding fortification and battery and i should suppose if well garrison and man they would be perfectly able to repel any force which might be bring to bear against they it be well know at this time that all the province of spain have shake off they allegiance to the mother country and declare themselves independent carthagena the most prominent of the province be a place of considerable commerce and about this time a few men-of-war and a number of privateer be fit out there the carthagenian flag now present a chance of gain to the cupidity of the avaricious and desperate among whom be we commander captain s as soon therefore as we have fill up we water & c a proposition be make by he to the second lieutenant and myself to cruise under both flag the american and carthagenian and this to be keep a profound secret from the crew until we have sail from port of course we reject the proposition with disdain and tell he the consequence of such a measure in the event of be take by a man-of-war of any nation -- that it be piracy to all intent and purpose accord to the law of nation we refuse to go out in the privateer if he persist in this most nefarious act and we hear no more of it while we lay in port in a few day we be ready for sea and sail in company with we companion she force be rather more than ours but the vessel very inferior in point of sailing while together we capture several small british schooner the cargo of which together with some specie be divide between two privateer into one of the prize we put all the prisoner give they plenty of water and provision and let they pursue they course : the remainder of the prize be burn we then part company and be short of water run in toward the land in order to ascertain if any could be procure in approach the shore the wind die away to a perfect calm and at 4 pm a small schooner be see in-shore of we as we have not steerage way upon we craft of course it would be impossible to ascertain she character before dark it be therefore determine by we commander to board she with the boat under cover of the night this be a dangerous service but there be no backing out volunteer be call for i step forward and very soon a sufficient number of man to man two boat offer they service to back I every disposition be make for the attack the man be strongly armed oar muffle and a grapple place in each boat the bearing of the strange sail be take and night come on perfectly clear and cloudless i take command of the expedition the second lieutenant have charge of one boat the arrangement be to keep close together until we get sight of the vessel the second lieutenant be to board on the bow and i on the quarter we proceed in the most profound silence nothing be hear save now and then a slight splash of the oar in the water and before we obtain sight of the vessel i have sufficient time to reflect on this most perilous enterprise my reflection be not of the most pleasant character and i find myself inwardly shrink when i be arouse by the voice of the bowman say there she be sir two point on the starboard bow there she lay sure enough with every sail hoist and a light be plainly see as we suppose from she deck it be too high for she cabin window we now hold a consultation and see no good reason to change the disposition of the attack except that we agree to board simultaneously it may be well to observe here that any number of man on a vessel 's deck in the night have double the advantage to repel boarder because they may secrete themselves in such a position as to fall upon a enemy unaware and thereby cut they off with little difficulty be fully aware of this i order the man as soon as we have gain the deck of the schooner to proceed with great caution and keep close together till every hazard of the enterprize be ascertain the boat now separate and pull for they respective station observe the most profound silence when we have reach within a few yard of the schooner we lay upon we oar for some moment but could neither hear nor see any thing we then pull away cheerily and the next minute be under she counter and grapple to she every man leap on the deck without opposition the other boat board nearly at the same moment and we proceed in a body with great caution to examine the deck a large fire be in the caboose and we soon ascertain that she deck be entirely desert and that she neither have any boat on deck nor to she stern we then proceed to examine the cabin leave a armed force on deck the cabin like the deck be desert the mystery be easily unravel probably conclude that we should board they under cover of the night they no doubt as soon as it be dark take to they boat and desert the vessel on the floor of the cabin be a part of a english ensign and some papers which show that she belong to jamaica the little cargo on board consist of jamaica rum sugar fruit & c the breeze now spring up and the privateer show light we be enable to get alongside of she in a couple of hour a prize-master and crew be put on board with order to keep company during the night we run along shore and in the morning take on board the privateer the greater part of the prize 's cargo be close in shore in the afternoon we descry a settlement of hut and suppose that water might be obtain there the two vessel be run in and anchor about two mile distant from the beach a proposition be make to I by captain s to get the water-cask on board the prize schooner and as she draw a light draught of water i be to run she in and anchor she near the beach take with I the two boat and twenty man i observe to captain s that this be probably a indian settlement and it be well know that all the indian tribe on the coast of rio de la hache be exceedingly ferocious and say to be cannibal and it be also well know that whosoever fall into they hand never escape with they life so that it be necessary before any attempt be make to land that some of the indian should be decoy on board and detain as hostage for we safety at the conclusion of this statement a very illiberal allusion be throw out by captain s and some doubt express in reference to my courage he remark that if i be afraid to undertake the expedition he would go himself this be enough for I i immediately resolve to proceed if i sacrifice my life in the attempt the next morning twenty water-cask be put on board the prize together with the two boat and twenty man well arm with musket pistol and cutlass with a supply of ammunition i repair on board get the prize under way run in and anchor about one hundred yard from the beach the boat be get in readiness and the man be well armed and the water cask sling ready to proceed on shore i have examine my own pistol narrowly that morning and have put they in complete order and as i believe have take every precaution for we future operation so as to prevent surprise there be about a dozen ill-constructed hut or wigwam but no spot of grass or shrub be visible to the eye with the exception of here and there the trunk of a old tree one solitary indian be see stalk on the beach and the whole scene present the most wild and savage appearance and to my mind argue very unfavorably we pull in with the cask in tow seven man be in each boat when within a short distance of the beach the boat 's head be put to seaward when the indian come abreast of we address he in spanish i inquire if water could be procure to which he reply in the affirmative i then display to he view some gewgaw and trinket at which he appear perfectly delighted and with many sign and gesture invite I on shore thrust my pistol into my belt and buckle on my cartridge-box i give order to the boat ' crew that in case they discover any thing like treachery or surprise after i have get on shore to cut the water-casks adrift and make the best of they way on board the prize as soon as i have jump on shore i inquire if there be any live stock such as fowl & c to be have point to a hut about thirty yard from the boat he say that the stock be there and invite I to go and see it i hesitate suspect some treachery however after repeat my order to the boat ' crew i proceed with the indian and when within about half a dozen yard of the hut at a preconcerted signal -lrb- as i suppose -rrb- as if by magic at least one hundred indian rush out with the rapidity of thought i be knock down strip of all my clothing except a inside flannel shirt tie hand and foot and then take and secure to the trunk of a large tree surround by about twenty squaw as a guard who with the exception of two or three bear a most wild and hideous look in they appearance the capture of the boat 's crew be simultaneous with my own they be so much surprised and confound at the stratagem of the indian that they have not the power or presence of mind to pull off after they have secure we man a number of they jump into the boat pull off and capture the prize without meeting with any resistance from those on board they be only six in number she cable be then cut and she be run on the beach when they proceed to dismantle she by cut the sail from the bolt-rope and take out what little cargo there be consist of jamaica ram sugar & c this be do they lead rope on shore when about one hundred of they haul she up nearly high and dry by this time the privateer have see we disaster stand boldly in and anchor within less than gun shot of the beach they then very foolishly open a brisk cannonade but every shot be spend in vain this exasperate the indian and particularly the one who have take possession of my pistol cast my eye round i see he creep toward I with one pistol present and when about five yard off he pull the trigger but as providence have no doubt order it the pistol snap at the same moment a shot from the privateer fall a few yard from we when the indian rose upon he foot cock the pistol and fire it at the privateer turn round with a most savage yell he throw the pistol with great violence which graze my head and then with a large stick beat and cut I until i be perfectly senseless this be about ten o'clock and i do not recover my consciousness until as i suppose about four o'clock in the afternoon i perceive there be four squaw around I one of whom from she appearance -- have on many gewgaw and trinket -- be the wife of a chief as soon as she discover sign of return consciousness she present I with a gourd the contents of which appear to be indian meal mix with water she first drink and then give it to I and i can safely aver that i never drink any beverage before or since which produce such relief night be now come on the privateer have get under weigh and be stand off-and-on with a flag of truce fly at she mast-head the treacherous indian with whom i have first converse come and with a malignant smile give I the dreadful intelligence that at twelve o'clock that night we be to be roasted and eat accordingly at sunset i be unloosed and conduct by a band of about half a dozen savage to the spot where i find the remainder of we man firmly secure by have they hand tie behind they they leg lash together and each man fasten to a stake that have be drive into the ground for that purpose there be no possibility to elude the vigilance of these miscreant as soon as night shut in a large quantity of brushwood be pile around we and nothing now be want but the fire to complete this horrible tragedy then the same malicious savage approach we once more and with the deepest malignity taunt we with we come fate have some knowledge of the indian character i summon up all the fortitude of which i be capable and in term of defiance tell he that twenty indian would be sacrifice for each one of we sacrifice by he i know very well that it would not do to exhibit any sign of fear or cowardice and have hear much of the cupidity of the indian character i offer the savage a large ransom if he would use he influence to procure we release here the conversation be abruptly break off by a most hideous yell from the whole tribe occasion by they have take large draught of the rum which now begin to operate very sensibly upon they and as it will be see operate very much to we advantage this thirst for rum cause they to relax they vigilance and we be leave alone to pursue we reflection which be not of the most enviable or pleasant character a thousand melancholy thought rush over my mind here i be and in all probability in a few hour i should be in eternity and my death one of the most horrible description oh think i how many be the entreaty and argument use by my friend to deter I from pursue a avocation so full of hazard and peril if i have take they advice and accede to they solicitation in all probability i should at this time have be in the enjoyment of much happiness i be arouse from this reverie by the most direful scream from the unite voice of the whole tribe they have drunk largely of the rum and become so much intoxicate that a general fight ensue many of they lay stretch on the ground with tomahawk deeply implant in they skull : and many other as the common phrase be be dead drunk this be a exceedingly fortunate circumstance for we with they sens benumb of course they have forget they avowal to roast we or it may be the indian to whom i propose ransom have confer with the other and they no doubt agree to spare we life until the morning it be a night however of pain and terror as well as of the most anxious suspense and when the morning dawn break upon my vision i feel a indescribable emotion of gratitude as i have fully make up my mind the night previous that long before this time i should have be sleep the sleep of death it be a pitiable sight when the morning light appear to see twenty human being strip naked with they body cut and lacerate and the blood issue from they wound with they hand and foot tie and they body fasten to stake with brushwood pile around they expect every moment to be they last my feeling on this occasion can be better imagine than describe suffice it to say that i have give up all hope of escape and gloomily resign myself to death when the fume of the liquor have in some degree wear off from the benumbed sens of the savage they arise and approach we and for the first time the wily indian inform I that the tribe have agree to ransom we they then cast off the lashing from we body and foot and with we hand still secure drive we before they to the beach then another difficulty arise the privateer be out of sight and the indian become furious to satiate they hellish malice they oblige we to run on the beach while they let fly they poison arrow after we for my own part my limb be so benumbed that i could scarcely walk and i firmly resolve to stand still and take the worst of it -- which be the best plan i could have adopt for when they perceive that i exhibit no sign of fear not a single arrow be discharge at I fortunately before they grow weary of this sport to my great joy the privateer hove in sight she stand boldly in with the flag of truce fly and the savage consent to let one man of they own choosing go off in the boat to procure the stipulate ransom the boat return load with article of various description and two of we man be release the boat keep ply to and from the privateer bring such article as they demand until all be release except myself here it may be proper to observe that the mulatto man who have be select by the indian perform all this duty himself not one of the privateer 's crew daring to hazard they life with he in the boat i then be leave alone and for my release they require a double ransom i begin now seriously to think that they intend to detain I altogether my mulatto friend however pledge himself that he would never leave I again for the last time he scull the boat off she quickly return with a larger amount of article than previously it be a moment of the deepest anxiety for there have now arrive from the interior another tribe apparently superior in point of number and elate with the booty which have be obtain they demand a share and express a determination to detain I for a larger ransom these demand be refuse and a conflict ensue of the most frightful and terrific character tomahawk knife and arrow be use indiscriminately and many a indian fell in that bloody contest the tomahawk be throw with the swiftness of arrow and be generally bury in the skull or the breast and whenever two come in contact with the famous indian hug the strife be soon over with either one or the other by one plunge the deadly knife up to the hilt in the body of he opponent nor be the poison arrow of less swift execution for wherever they strike the wretched victim be quickly in eternity i shall never forget the frightful barbarity of that hour although year have elapse since its occurrence still the whole scene in imagination be before I the savage yell of the warwhoop and the direful scream of the squaw still ring afresh in my ear in the height of this conflict a tall indian chief who i know belong to the same tribe with the young squaw who give I the drink come down to the beach where i be the boat have be discharge and be lie with she head off at a signal give by the squaw to the chief he catch I up in he arm with as much ease as if i have be a child wade to the boat throw I in and then with a most expressive gesture urge we off fortunately there be two oar in the boat and feeble as i be i throw all the remain strength i have to the oar it be the last effort as life or death hang upon the next fifteen minute disappoint of a share of the booty the savage be frantic with rage especially when they see i have elude they grasp rush to the beach about a dozen throw themselves into the other boat which have be capture and pull after we but fortunately in they hurry they have forget the musket and be unacquainted with the method of rowing of course they make but little progress which enable we to increase we distance the privateer have narrowly watch all these movement and see we imminent danger stand boldly on toward the beach and in the next five minute she lay between we and the indian discharge a heavy fire of musketry among they such be the high excitement of my feeling that i scarcely recollect how i gain the privateer 's deck but i be save nevertheless though i be weak with the loss of blood and savage treatment -- my limb benumb and body scorch with the pierce ray of the sun -- the whole scene rush through my mind with the celerity of electricity it unmanned and quite overpower I i faint and fall senseless on the deck the usual restorative and care be administer and i soon recover from the effect of my capture some of the other be not so fortunate two of they especially be cut in a shocking manner and the other be so dreadfully beat and mangled by club that the greatest care be necessary to save they life escape from shipwreck from life on the ocean receive order this day to proceed to london with the ship and as the easterly gale abate and the wind haul round southward and westward we get under way stand out of falmouth harbor and proceed up the british channel at sunset it commence to rain and the weather be thick and cloudy the different light be see as far as the bill of portland at midnight lose sight of the land and it blow a gale from off the french coast : close reef the topsail and steer a course so as to keep in mid-channel at daybreak the ship be judge to be off beachy head the weather be so thick the land could not be see the fore and mizzen-topsail be now furl and the ship hove to the rain begin now to fall in torrent and the heavy dense black cloud rise with fearful rapidity from the northward over the english coast when suddenly the wind shift from the south-west to the north and blow a hurricane the mist and fog clear away and to we utter astonishment we find ourselves on a lee shore on the coast of france off boulogne height the gale be so violent that no more sail could be make the ship be so exceedingly crank that when she luff up on a wind she bulwark be under water as she would not stay the only alternative be to wear of course with this evolution we lose ground and consequently be drive nearer every moment toward the awful strand of rock the scene be now terrific many vessel be in sight two of which we see dash on the rock with the tremendous roar of the breaker and the howling of the tempest and the heavy sea which break as high as the fore-yard death appear inevitable there be only one hope leave and that be that should the tide change and take we under we lee-beam it might possibly set we off on the nine-fathom bank which be situate at a distance of twelve mile north-northwest off boulogne harbor on the event of reach this bank the safety of the ship and life of the crew depend -- as it be determine there to try the anchor for there be no possibility of keep off shore more than two hour if the gale continue we be now on the larboard tack and for the last half hour it be perceive that the tide have turn and be set to the northward this be we last and only chance for the rock be not more than half a mile under we lee and as it be necessary to get the ship 's head round on the starboard tack which could only be do by wear it be certain that much ground would be lose by that evolution the anchor be get ready long range of cable be haul on deck and the end be clinch to the mainmast below this be do the axis be at hand to cut away the mast -lrb- illustration : before the gale -rrb- captain g be a old experienced seaman and i never see before or since more coolness judgment and seamanship than be display by he on this try occasion in this perilous trial the most intense anxiety be manifest by the crew and then be hear the deep-toned voice of captain g rise above the bellow storm command silence take the wheel say he to I and then follow the order in quick succession : lay aft and man the brace -- see every thing clear forward to wear ship -- steady -- ease she -- shiver away the main-topsail -- put you helm up -- haul in the weather fore-brace -- gather in the after-yard the ship be now run before the wind for a few moment directly for the rock the situation and scene be truly awful for she be not more than three hundred yard from the breaker i turn my head aside -- be at the helm -- to avoid the terrific sight and silently await the crisis i be rouse at this moment by captain g who shout she luff my boy brace the main-yard sharp up -- haul in the larboard fore-brace -- down with the fore-tack lad and haul aft the sheet -- right the helm steady so -- haul taut the weather-brace and belay all these order be give and execute in quick succession the ship be now on the starboard tack plunge bow under at every pitch cast a fitful glance over my shoulder i see that we be apparently to leeward of the rock very soon however it be quite perceptible that the tide have take she on the lee beam and be set she off shore the gloom begin now to wear away although it be doubtful whether we should be able to reach the bank and if successful whether the anchor would hold on order be give to lay aloft and send down the top-gallant-yards mast & c the helm be relieved and i spring into the main rig the chief mate go up forward with much difficulty i reach the main-topmast cross-tree and when there it be almost impossible to work for the ship lay over at a angle of at least forty-five degree and i find myself swing not perpendicularly over the ship 's deck but at least thirty foot from it it be no time however for gaze the yard rope be stopper out on the quarter of the yard the sheet clewline and buntline cast off and the shift slacken and then simultaneously from both mast-head the cry be hear sway away the parrel cut the yard be quickly top and unrigged and then lower away on deck the next duty to be perform be send down the top-gallant mast after much difficulty and hard work this be also accomplish and although i feel some pride in the performance of a dangerous service yet on this occasion i be not a little pleased when i reach the deck in safety by this time we have gain four mile off shore and it be evident that the sounding indicate we approach to the bank tackle be rove and stretch along forward of the windlass as well as deck-stopper hook on to the ringbolt fore and aft loose the fore-topsail shout captain g we must reach this bank before the tide turn or by morning there will not be leave a timber head of this ship nor one of we to tell the sad tale of we disaster the topsail be loose and set and the ship groan heavily under the immense pressure of canvass she lee rail be under water and every moment it be expect that the topmast or the canvass would yield the deep-sea-lead be take forward and heave : when the line reach the after-part of the main channel the seaman 's voice rise high in the air by the deep nine it be three o'clock clew up and furl the fore-topsail shout captain g the topsail furl of itself for the moment the weather sheet be start it blow away from the bolt-rope the foresail be immediately haul up and furl relieve from the great pressure of canvass and have now nothing on she except the main-topsail and fore-topmast-staysail she ride more upright the main-topsail be clew up and fortunately save the mizzen-staysail be set stand by to cut away the stopper of the best bower anchor -- to let it go stock and fluke say captain g man the fore-topmast-staysail down-haul put you helm down haul down the staysail this be do and the ship come up handsomely head to wind see the cable tier all clear -- what water be there say captain g the leadsman sing out in a clear voice and a half-eight by this time the ship have lose she way be you all clear forward there ay ay sir be the reply stream the buoy and let go the anchor shout captain g the order be execute as rapidly as it be give the anchor be on the bottom and already have fifty fathom of cable run out make the windlass smoke and although the cable be weather-bitted and every effort be make with the deck-stopper and tackle to check she all be fruitless ninety fathom of cable have run out stand by to let go the larboard anchor say captain g cheerily man -- let go in the same breath he shout hold on for just then there be a lull and have run out the best bower-cable nearly to the better end she bring up no time be now lose in get service on the cable to prevent its chafe she be now ride to a single anchor of two thousand weight with one hundred fathom of a seventeen-inch hemp cable the sea roll heavily and break in upon the deck fore and aft the lower yard be get down the topsail-yard point to the wind and as the tide have now turn the ship ride without any strain on she cable because it tend broad on the beam the next morning present a dismal scene for there be more than fifty sail in-shore of we some of whom succeed in reach the bank and anchor with loss of sail topmast & c many other be dash upon the rock and not a soul be leave to tell the tale of they destruction i shall not forget that on the second day a dutch galliot be drive in to leeward of we and although by carry on a tremendous press of canvass she succeed in keep off shore until five pm yet at sunset she disappear and be see no more after we arrival in london we learn that this unfortunate vessel be drive on the rock and every soul on board perish the gale continue four day at the expiration of which time it break at midnight the wind haul round to the eastward and the weather become so excessively cold that although we commence heave in the cable at five be yet we do not get the anchor until nine that night close-reefed topsail be set on the ship and we stand over to the english coast and anchor to the westward of dungeness during the whole period of this gale which last four day captain g never for one moment leave the deck and although well advance in year yet he iron constitution enable he to overcome the call of nature for rest and notwithstanding the situation of the ship be perhaps more critical than many of those less fortunate vessel which strand upon the rock yet he coolness and the seaman-like manner with which the ship be handle no doubt be the means of we be save the hunter 's wife thoma cooper be a fine specimen of the north american trapper slightly but powerfully make with a hardy weather-beaten yet handsome face strong indefatigable and a crack shot -- he be admirably adapt for a hunter 's life for many year he know not what it be to have a home but live like the beast he hunt -- wander from one part of the country to another in pursuit of game all who know tom be much surprise when he come with a pretty young wife to settle within three mile of a planter 's farm many pity the poor young creature who would have to lead such a solitary life while other say if she be fool enough to marry he it be she own look-out for nearly four month tom remain at home and employ he time in make the old hut he have fix on for they residence more comfortable he clear and till a small spot of land around it and susan begin to hope that for she sake he would settle down quietly as a squatter but these vision of happiness be soon dispel for as soon as this work be finish he recommence he old erratic mode of life and be often absent for week together leave he wife alone yet not unprotected for since he marriage old nero a favorite hound be always leave at home as she guardian he be a noble dog -- a cross between the old scottish deerhound and the bloodhound and would hunt a indian as well as a deer or bear which tom say be a proof they injin be a sort o ' warmint or why should the brute beast take to hunt 'em nat ` ral like -- he that take no notice of white man one clear cold morning about two year after they marriage susan be awaken by a loud crash immediately succeed by nero 's deep bay she recollect that she have shut he in the house as usual the night before suppose he have wind some solitary wolf or bear prowl around the hut and effect he escape she take little notice of the circumstance but a few moment after come a shrill wild cry which make she blood run cold to spring from she bed throw on she clothes and rush from the hut be the work of a minute she no longer doubt what the hound be in pursuit of fearful thought shoot through she brain she call wildly on nero and to she joy he come dash through the thick underwood as the dog draw near she see that he gallop heavily and carry in he mouth some large dark creature she brain reel she feel a cold and sickly shudder dart through she limb but susan be a hunter 's daughter and all she life have be accustom to witness scene of danger and of horror and in this school have learn to subdue the natural timidity of she character with a powerful effort she recover herself just as nero drop at she foot a little indian child apparently between three and four year old she bent down over he but there be no sound or motion : she place she hand on he little naked chest the heart within have cease to beat : he be dead the deep mark of the dog 's fang be visible on the neck but the body be untorn old nero stand with he large bright eye fix on the face of he mistress fawn on she as if he expect to be praise for what he have do and seem to wonder why she look so terrify but susan spurn he from she and the fierce animal who would have pull down a indian as he would a deer crouch humbly at the young woman 's foot susan carry the little body gently in she arm to the hut and lay it on she own bed she first impulse be to seize the loaded rifle that hang over the fire-place and shoot the hound and yet she feel she could not do it for in the lone life she lead the faithful animal seem like a dear and value friend who love and watch over she as if aware of the precious charge intrust to he she think also of what she husband would say when on he return he should find he old companion dead susan have never see tom rouse to she he have ever show nothing but kindness yet she fear as well as loved he for there be a fire in those dark eye which tell of deep wild passion hide in he breast and she know that the life of a whole tribe of indian would be light in the balance against that of he favorite hound have securely fasten up nero susan with a heavy heart proceed to examine the ground around the hut in several place she observe the impression of a small moccasined foot but not a child 's the track be deeply marked unlike the usual light elastic tread of a indian from this circumstance susan easily infer that the woman have be carry she child when attack by the dog there be nothing to show why she have come so near the hut : most probably the hope of some petty plunder have be the inducement susan do not dare to wander far from home fear a band of indian might be in the neighborhood she return sorrowfully to the hut and employ herself in block up the window or rather the hole where the window have be for the powerful hound have in he leap dash out the entire frame and shatter it to piece when this be finish susan dig a grave and in it lay the little indian boy she make it close to the hut for she could not bear that wolf should devour those delicate limb and she know that there it would be safe the next day tom return he have be very unsuccessful and intended set out again in a few day in a different direction susan he say when he have hear she sad story i wish you would leave the child where the dog kill he the squaw 's high sartain to come back a seekin ' for the body and ` tis a pity the poor crittur should be disappointed besides the indian will be high sartain to put it down to we whereas if so be as they would find the body ` pon the spot may be they would onderstand as 'twa a accident like for they be unkimmon cunning warmint though they a not get sense like christian why do you think the poor woman come here say susan i never know a indian squaw so near the hut before she fancy a dark shadow flit across she husband 's brow he make no reply and on repeat the question say angrily how should i know ` tis as well to ask for a bear 's reason as a injin 's tom only staid at home long enough to mend the broken window and plant a small spot of indian corn and then again set out tell susan not to expect he home in less than a month if that squaw come this way agin he say as may be she will just put out any victuals you have a-got for the poor crittur though may be she wont come for they injin be onkimmon skeary susan wonder at he take a interest in the woman and often think of that dark look she have notice and of tom 's unwillingness to speak on the subject she never know that on he last hunting expedition when hide some skin which he intend to fetch on he return he have observe a indian watch he and have shoot he with as little mercy as he would have show to a wolf on tom 's return to the spot the body be go and in the soft damp soil be the mark of a indian squaw 's foot and by its side a little child 's he be sorry then for the deed he have do he think of the grief of the poor widow and how it would be possible for she to live until she could reach she tribe who be far far distant at the foot of the rocky mountain and now to feel that through he means too she have lose she child put thought into he mind that have never before find a place there he think that one god have form the red man as well as the white -- of the soul of the many indian hurry into eternity by he unerring rifle and they perhaps be more fit for they happy hunting grounds than he for the white man 's heaven in this state of mind every word he wife have say to he seem a reproach and he be glad again to be alone in the forest with he rifle and he hound the afternoon of the third day after tom 's departure as susan be sit at work she hear something scratch and whine at the door nero who be by she side evince no sign of anger but run to the door show he white tooth as be he custom when pleased susan unbar it when to she astonishment the two deerhound she husband have take with he walk into the hut look weary and soil at first she think tom might have kill a deer not far from home and have bring she a fresh supply of venison but no one be there she rush from the hut and soon breathless and terrify reach the squatter 's cabin john wilton and he three son be just return from the clearing when susan run into they comfortable kitchen she long black hair streaming on she shoulder and she wild and bloodshot eye give she the appearance of a maniac in a few unconnected word she explain to they the cause of she terror and implore they to set off immediately in search of she husband it be in vain they tell she of the uselessness of go at that time -- of the impossibility of follow a trail in the dark she say she would go herself : she feel sure of find he and at last they be oblige to use force to prevent she leave the house the next morning at daybreak wilton and he two son be mount and ready to set out intend to take nero with they but nothing could induce he to leave he mistress : he resist passively for some time until one of the young man attempt to pass a rope round he neck to drag he away : then he forbearance vanish and he spring upon he tormentor throw he down and would have strangle he if susan have not be present finding it impossible to make nero accompany they they leave without he but have not proceed many mile before he and he mistress be at they side they beg susan to return tell she of the inconvenience she would be to they it be no avail she have but one answer -- i be a hunter 's daughter and a hunter 's wife she tell they that know how useful nero would be to they in they search she have secretly take a horse and follow they the party ride first to tom cooper 's hut and there have dismount lead they horse through the forest follow the trail as only man long accustom to savage life can do at night they lay on the ground cover with they thick bear-skin cloak : for susan only they heap a bed of dry leaf but she refuse to occupy it say it be she duty to bear the same hardship they do ever since they departure she have show no sign of sorrow although slight and delicately form she never appear fatigue : she whole soul be absorb in one longing desire -- to find she husband 's body for from the first she have abandon the hope of ever again see he in life this desire support she through everything early the next morning they be on the trail about noon as they be cross a small brook the hound suddenly dash away from they and be lose in the thicket at first they fancy they might have cross the track of a deer or wolf but a long mournful howl soon tell the sad truth for not far from the brook lay the faithful dog on the dead body of he master which be pierce to the heart by a indian arrow the murderer have apparently be afraid to approach on account of the dog for the body be leave as it have fall -- not even the rifle be go no sign of indian could be discover save one small footprint which be instantly pronounced to be that of a squaw susan show no grief at the sight of the body : she maintain the same forced calmness and seem comfort that it be find old wilton staid with she to remove all that now remain of she darling husband and he two son set out on the trail which soon lead they into the open prairie where it be easily trace through the tall thick grass they continue ride all that afternoon and the next morning by daybreak be again on the track which they follow to the bank of a wide but shallow stream there they see the remains of a fire one of the brother thrust he hand among the ash which be still warm they cross the river and in the soft sand on the opposite bank see again the print of small moccasined footstep here they be at a loss for the rank prairie-grass have be consume by one of those fearful fire so common in the prairie and in its stead grow short sweet herbage where even a indian 's eye could observe no trace they be on the point of abandon the pursuit when richard the younger of the two call he brother 's attention to nero who have of he own accord leave he mistress to accompany they a if he now understand what they be about the hound be trot to and fro with he nose to the ground as if endeavor to pick out a cold scent edward laugh at he brother and point to the track of a deer that have come to drink at the river at last he agree to follow nero who be now canter slowly across the prairie the pace gradually increase until on a spot where the grass have grow more luxuriantly than elsewhere nero throw up he nose give a deep bay and start off at so furious a pace that although well mount they have great difficulty in keep up with he he soon bring they to the border of another forest where find it impossible to take they horse further they tethered they to a tree and set off again on foot they lose sight of the hound but still from time to time hear he loud baying far away at last they fancy it sound nearer instead of become less distinct and of this they be soon convince they still go on in the direction whence the sound proceed until they see nero sit with he fore-paw against the trunk of a tree no longer mouth like a well-trained hound but yell like a fury they look up in the tree but could see nothing until at last edward espy a large hollow about half way up the trunk i be right you see he say after all it nothing but a bear but we may as well shoot the brute that have give we so much trouble they set to work immediately with they axis to fall the tree it begin to totter when a dark object they could not tell what in the dim twilight crawl from its place of concealment to the extremity of a branch and from thence spring into the next tree snatch up they rifle they both fire together when to they astonishment instead of a bear a young indian squaw with a wild yell fall to the ground they run to the spot where she lay motionless and carry she to the border of the wood where they have that morning dismount richard lift she on he horse and spring himself into the saddle carry the almost lifeless body before he the poor creature never speak several time they stop think she be dead : she pulse only tell the spirit have not fly from its earthly tenement when they reach the river which have be cross by they before they wash the wound and sprinkle water on she face this appear to revive she and when richard again lift she in he arm to place she on he horse he fancy he hear she mutter in iroquois one word -- revenge it be a strange sight those two powerful man tend so carefully the be they have a few hour before seek to slay and endeavor to stanch the blood that flow from wound which they have make yet so it be it would have appear to they a sin to leave the indian woman to die yet they feel no remorse at have inflict the wound and doubtless would have be better pleased have it be mortal but they would not have murder a wounded enemy even a indian warrior still less a squaw the party continue they journey until midnight when they stop to rest they jaded horse have wrap the squaw in they bear-skin they lay down themselves with no cover save the clothes they wear they be in no want of provision as not know when they might return they have take a good supply of bread and dry venison not wish to loose any precious time in seek food while on the trail the brandy still remain in they flask they preserve for the use of they captive the evening of the follow day they reach the trapper 's hut where they be not a little surprised to find susan she tell they that although john wilton have beg she to live with they she could not bear to leave the spot where everything remind she of one to think of whom be now she only consolation and that while she have nero she fear nothing they need not to tell they mournful tale -- susan already understand it but too clearly she beg they to leave the indian woman with she you have no one say she to tend and watch she as i can do besides it be not right that i should lay such a burden on you although unwilling to impose on she mind the painful task of nurse she husband 's murderess they could not allow but that she be right and see how earnestly she desire it at last consent to leave the indian woman with she for many week susan nurse she charge as tenderly as if it have be she sister at first she lay almost motionless and rarely speak then she grow delirious and rave wildly susan fortunately could not understand what she say but often turn shudder away when the indian woman would strive to rise from she bed and move she arm as if draw a bow or yell wildly and cower in terror beneath the clothes -- react in she delirium the fearful scene through which she have pass by degree reason return she gradually get better but seem restless and unhappy and could not bear the sight of nero the first proof of return reason she have show be a shriek of terror when he once accidentally follow he mistress into the room where she lay one morning susan miss she she search around the hut but she be go without have take farewell of she kind benefactress a few year after susan cooper -- no longer pretty susan for time and grief have do they work -- hear late one night a hurry knock which be repeat several time before she could open the door each time more loudly than before she call to ask who it be at that late hour of night a few hurry word in iroquoi be the reply and susan congratulate herself on have speak before unbar the door but on listen again she distinctly hear the same voice say quick -- quick and recognize it as the indian woman 's voice she have nurse the door be instantly open when the squaw rush into the hut seize susan by the arm and make sign to she to come away she be too much excite to remember then the few word of english she have pick up when live with the white woman express she meaning by gesture with a clearness peculiar to the indian she drag rather than lead susan from the hut they have just reach the edge of the forest when the wild yell of the indian sound in they ear have go with susan a little way into the forest she guide leave she for nearly four hour she lay there half dead with cold and terror not daring to move from she place of concealment she see the flame of the dwelling where so many lonely hour have be pass rise above the tree and hear the shrill whoop of the retire indian nero who be lie by she side suddenly rise and give a low growl silently a dark figure come glide among the tree directly to the spot where she lay she give herself up for lose but it be the indian woman who come to she and drop at she foot a bag of money the remains of she late husband 's savings the grateful creature know where it be keep and while the indian be busy examine the rifle and other object more interesting to they have carry it off unobserved wave she arm around to show that all be now quiet she point in the direction of wilton 's house and be again lose among the tree day be just break when susan reach the squatter 's cabin have hear the sad story wilton and two of he son start immediately for the spot nothing be to be see save a heap of ash the party have apparently consist of only three or four indian but a powerful tribe be in the neighborhood they see it would be too hazardous to follow they from this time susan live with the wilton she be as a daughter to the old man and a sister to he son who often say that as far as they be concern the indian have never do a kindlier action than in burn down susan cooper 's hut deaf smith the celebrated texan spy about two year after the texan revolution a difficulty occur between the new government and a portion of the people which threaten the most serious consequence -- even the bloodshed and horror of civil war briefly the cause be this : the constitution have fix the city of austin as the permanent capital where the public archive be to be keep with the reservation however of a power in the president to order they temporary removal in case of danger from the inroad of a foreign enemy or the force of a sudden insurrection conceive that the exceptional emergency have arrive as the camanch frequently commit ravages within sight of the capital itself houston who then reside at washington on the brazo dispatch a order command he subordinate functionary to send the state record to the latter place which he declare to be _ pro tempore _ the seat of government it be impossible to describe the stormy excitement which the promulgation of this fiat raise in austin the keeper of hotel boarding-house grocery and faro-bank be thunderstruck -- madden to frenzy for the measure would be a death-blow to they prosperity in business and accordingly they determine at once to take the necessary step to avert the danger by oppose the execution of houston 's mandate they call a mass meeting of the citizen and farmer of the circumjacent country who be all more or less interested in the question and after many fiery speech against the assert tyranny of the administration it be unanimously resolve to prevent the removal of the archive by open and armed resistance to that end they organize a company of four hundred man one moiety of whom relieve the other at regular period of duty should keep constant guard around the state-house until the peril pass by the commander of this force be one colonel morton who have achieve considerable renown in the war for independence and have still more recently display desperate bravery in two desperate duel in both of which he have cut he antagonist nearly to piece with the bowie-knife indeed from the notoriety of he character for revenge as well as courage it be think that president houston would renounce he purpose touch the archive so soon as he should learn who be the leader of the opposition morton on he part whose vanity fully equal he personal prowess encourage and justify the prevailing opinion by he boastful threat he swear that if the president do succeed in remove the record by the march of a overpowering force he would then himself hunt he down like a wolf and shoot he with as little ceremony or stab he in he bed or waylay he in he walk of recreation he even write the hero of san jacinto to that effect the latter reply in a note of laconic brevity : if the people of austin do not send the archive i shall certainly come and take they and if colonel morton can kill I he be welcome to my ear-cap on the reception of this answer the guard be double around the state-house choose sentinel be station along the road lead to the capital the military parade the street from morning till night

luxuriant jetty hair with a severe iron-like countenance that seem never to have know a smile and eye of intense vivid black wild and rolling and pierce as the point of a dagger he strange advent inspire a thrill of involuntary fear and many present unconsciously grasp the handle of they side-arm who be you that thus presume to intrude among gentleman without invitation demand colonel morton ferociously essay to cow down the stranger with he eye the latter return he stare with compound interest and lay he long bony finger on he lip as a sign -- but of what the spectator could not imagine who be you speak or i will cut a answer out of you heart shout morton almost distract with rage by the cool sneering gaze of the other who now remove he finger from he lip and lay it on the hilt of he monstrous knife the fiery colonel then draw he dagger and be in the act of advance upon the stranger when several catch he and hold he back remonstrate let he alone morton for god 's sake do you not perceive that he be crazy at the moment judge webb a man of shrewd intellect and courteous manners step forward and address the intruder in a most respectful manner : my good friend i presume you have make a mistake in the house this be a private meeting where none but member be admit the stranger do not appear to comprehend the word but he could not fail to understand the mild and deprecatory manner he rigid feature relax and move to a table in the center of the hall where there be material and implement for write he seize a pen and trace one line : i be deaf he then hold it up before the spectator as a sort of natural apology for he own want of politeness judge webb take the paper and write a question : dear sir will you be so oblige as to inform we what be you business with the present meeting the other respond by deliver a letter inscribe on the back to the citizen of austin they break the seal and read it aloud it be from houston and show the usual terse brevity of he style : fellow citizen : -- though in error and deceive by the art of traitor i will give you three day more to decide whether you will surrender the public archive at the end of that time you will please let I know you decision sam houston after the read the deaf man wait a few seconds as if for a reply and then turn and be about to leave the hall when colonel morton interpose and sternly beckon he back to the table the stranger obey and morton write : you be brave enough to insult I by you threatening look ten minute ago be you brave enough now to give I satisfaction the stranger pen he reply : i be at you service morton write again : who will be you second the stranger rejoin : i be too generous to seek a advantage and too brave to fear any on part of other therefore i never need the aid of a second morton pen : name you term the stranger trace without a moment 's hesitation : time sunset this evening place the left bank of the colorado opposite austin weapon rifle and distance a hundred yard do not fail to be in time he then take three step across the floor and disappear through the window as he have enter what exclaim judge webb be it possible colonel morton that you intend to fight that man he be a mute if not a positive maniac such a meeting i fear will sadly tarnish the luster of you laurel you be mistaken reply morton with a smile that mute be a hero whose fame stand in the record of a dozen battle and at least half as many bloody duel besides he be the favorite emissary and bosom friend of houston if i have the good fortune to kill he i think it will tempt the president to retract he vow against venture any more on the field of honor you know the man then who be he who be he ask twenty voice together deaf smith answer morton coolly why no that can not be deaf smith be slay at san jacinto remark judge webb there again you honor be mistake say morton the story of smith 's death be a mere fiction get up by houston to save the life of he favorite from the swear vengeance of certain texan on whose conduct he have act as a spy i fathom the artifice twelve month since if what you say be true you be a madman yourself exclaim webb deaf smith be be never know to miss he mark he have often bring down raven in they most rapid flight and kill camanch and mexican at a distance of of two hundred and fifty yard say no more answer colonel morton in tone of deep determination the thing be already settle i have already agree to meet he there can be no disgrace in fall before such a shot and if i succeed my triumph will confer the greater glory such be the general habit of thought and feeling prevalent throughout texa at that period toward evening a vast crowd assemble at the place appoint to witness the hostile meeting and so great be the popular recklessness as to affair of the sort that numerous and considerable sum be wager on the result at length the red orb of the summer sun touch the curved rim of the western horizon cover it all with crimson and gold and fill the air with a flood of burn glory and then the two mortal antagonist arm with long ponderous rifle take they station back to back and at a preconcerted signal -- the wave of a white handkerchief -- walk slowly and steadily off in opposite direction count they step until each have measure fifty they both complete the give number about the same instant and then they wheel each to aim and fire when he choose as the distance be great both pause for some seconds -- long enough for the beholder to flash they eye from one to the other and mark the striking contrast betwixt they the face of colonel morton be calm and smile but the smile it bear have a most murderous meaning on the contrary the countenance of deaf smith be stern and passionless as ever a side view of he feature might have be mistake for a profile do in cast iron the one too be dress in the richest cloth the other in smoke-tinted leather but that make no difference in texa then for the heir of heroic courage be all consider peer -- the class of inferior embrace none but coward presently two rifle explode with simultaneous roar colonel morton give a prodigious bind upward and drop to the earth a corpse deaf smith stand erect and immediately begin to reload he rifle and then have finish he brief task he hasten away into the adjacent forest three day afterward general houston accompany by deaf smith and ten other man appear in austin and without further opposition remove the state papers the history of the hero of the foregoing anecdote be one of the most extraordinary ever know in the west he make he advent in texa at a early period and continue to reside there until he death which happen some two year ago but although he have many warm personal friend no one could ever ascertain either the land of he birth or a single gleam of he previous biography when he be question on the subject he lay he finger on he lip and if press more urgently he brow writhe and he dark eye seem to shoot spark of livid fire he could write with astonishing correctness and facility consider he situation and although deny the exquisite pleasure and priceless advantage of the sense of hearing nature have give he ample compensation by a eye quick and far-seeing as a eagle 's and a smell keen and incredible as that of a raven he could discover object move mile away in the far-off prairie when other could perceive nothing but earth and sky and the ranger use to declare that he could catch the scent of a mexican or indian at as great a distance as a buzzard could distinguish the odor of a dead carcass it be these quality which fit he so well for a spy in which capacity he render invaluable service to houston 's army during the war of independence he always go alone and generally obtain the information desire he habit in private life be equally singular he could never be persuade to sleep under the roof of a house or even to use a tent-cloth wrap in he blanket he love to lie out in the open air under the blue canopy of pure ether and count the star or gaze with a yearning look at the melancholy moon when not employ as a spy or guide he subsist by hunting be often absent on solitary excursion for week and even month together in the wilderness he be a genuine son of nature a grow up child of the wood and prairie which he worship with a sort of pagan adoration exclude by he infirmity from cordial fellowship with he kind he make the inanimate thing of the earth he friend and enter by the heart 's own adoption into brotherhood with the luminary of heaven wherever there be land or water barren rock or tangled brake of wild wave cane there be deaf smith 's home and there he be happy but in the street of great city in all the great thoroughfare of man wherever there be flattery or fawn base cunning or craven fear there be deaf smith a alien and a exile strange soul he have depart on the long journey away among those high bright star which be he night-lamp and he have either solve or cease to ponder the deep mystery of the magic word life he be dead therefore let he error rest in oblivion and he virtue be remember with hope escape from a shark while she be lie in the harbor at havana it be very hot on board the royal consort about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of July there be not the slightest movement in the air the ray of the sun seem to burn down into the water silence take hold of the animated creation it be too hot to talk whistle or sing to bark to crow or to bray every thing creep under cover but sambo and cuffee two fine-looking black who sit sun themselves on the quay and think he berry pleasant weather and glisten like a new bristol bottle sambo and cuffee as we have say be sit on the quay enjoy the

bold but inexperienced stranger that the water be fill with shark and that it be dangerous to swim in they the word be scarcely utter and even if they be hear have not time to produce they effect when cuffee respond to the exclamation of he sable colleague with -- oh madre de dios see see de tiburon de shark -- ah san salvador ah pobre joven matar todo comer he eat he all down berry soon this second cry have be draw from the kind-hearted negro by see at a distance in the water a smooth-shooting streak which a inexperienced eye would not have notice but which sambo and cuffee know full well it be the wake of a shark at a distance of a mile or two the shark have perceive he prey and with the rapidity of sound he have shoot across the intervene space scarcely disturb the surface with a ripple cuffee 's practice eye alone have see a flash of he tail at the distance of a mile and a half and raise he voice to the utmost of he strength he have endeavor to apprise the incautious swimmer of he danger brook hear the shout and turn he eye in the direction in which the negro point and well skilled in all the appearance of the water under which he could see almost as well as in the open air he perceive the sharp forehead of the fearful animal rush toward he head on with a rapidity which bid defiance to flight -lrb- illustration : escape from a shark -rrb- in a moment the dreadful monster have shoot across the entire space that separate he from brook and have stop as if its vitality have be instantly arrest at the distance of about twelve foot from we swimmer brook have draw himself up in the most pugnacious attitude possible and be tread water with great activity the shark probably unused to any sign of make battle remain for one moment quiet and then like a flash of lightning shot sidelong off and come round in the rear brook however be as wide awake as he enemy the plashing of the oar of sambo and cuffee warn the sagacious monster of gather foe whirling himself

and leg pass into the horrid maw of the dreadful monster and be sever in a moment -- muscle sinew and bone in the next moment sambo and cuffee be at he side and lift he into the boat convulse with pain and faint with loss of blood brook be take on board bandage and styptic be apply and in due season the youth recover the place of he lose limb be supply by a wooden one and industry temperance probity and zeal supply the place of a regiment of leg when employ to prop up a lazy and dissipate frame adventure with pirate from fortune 's adventure in china early in the morning the whole fleet be in motion start all together for the sake of mutual protection the wind and tide be both fair and we proceed along the coast with great rapidity and be soon out of sight of the min and its beautiful and romantic scenery the plan of mutual protection soon seem to be abandon and the vessel soon separate into three and fours each get on as well and as fast as it could about four o'clock in the afternoon and when we be some fifty or sixty mile from the min the captain and the pilot come hurriedly down to my cabin and inform I that they see a number of jan-dous right ahead lie in wait for we i ridicule the idea and tell they that they imagine every junk they see to be a pirate but they still maintain that they be so and i therefore consider it prudent to be prepare for the worst i get out of bed ill and feverish as i be and carefully examine my fire-arm clear the nipple of my gun and pistol and put on fresh cap i also ram down a ball upon the top of each charge of shot in my gun put a pistol in each side-pocket and patiently await for the result by the aid of a small pocket-telescope i could see as the nearest junk approach that she deck be crowd with man i then have no longer any doubt regard she intention the pilot a intelligent old man now come up to I and say that he think resistance would be of no use i might manage to beat off one junk or even two but i have no chance with five of they be at that time in no mood to take advice or be dictate by any one i order he off to look after he own duty i know perfectly well that if we be take by the pirate i have not the slightest chance of escape for the first thing they would do would be to knock I on the head and throw I overboard as they would deem it dangerous to themselves be i to get away at the same time i must confess i have little hope of be able to beat off such a number and devoutly wish myself anywhere rather than where i be the scene around I be a strange one the captain pilot and one or two native passenger be take up the board of the cabin floor and put they money and other valuable out of sight among the ballast the common sailor too have they copper cash or tsien to hide and the whole place be in a state of bustle and confusion when all they more valuable property be hide they begin to make some preparation for defense basket of small stone be bring up from the hold and empty out on the most convenient part of the deck and be intend to be use instead of fire-arm when the pirate come to close quarter this be a common mode of defense in various part of china and be effectual enough when the enemy have only similar weapon to bring against they but on the coast of fokien where we be now all the pirate junk carry gun and consequently a whole deck-load of stone could be of little use against they i be surround by several of the crew who might well be call job 's comforter some suggest one thing and some another and many propose that we should bring the junk round and run back to the min the nearest pirate be now within two or three hundred yard of we and put she helm down give we a broadside from she gun all be now dismay and consternation on board we junk and every man run below except two who be at the helm i expect every moment that these also would leave they post and then we should have be a easy prey to the pirate my gun be nearer you than those of the jan-dous say i to the two man and if you move from the helm depend upon it i will shoot you the poor fellow look very uncomfortable but i suppose think they have better stand the fire of the pirate than mine and keep at they post large board heap of old clothes mat and thing of that sort which be at hand be throw up to protect we from the shot and as we have every stitch of sail set and a fair wind we be go through the water at the rate of seven or eight mile a hour the shot from the pirate fall considerably short of we i be therefore enable to form a opinion of the range and power of they gun which be of some use to I assistance from we cowardly crew be quite out of the question for there be not a man among they brave enough to use the stone which he have bring on deck and which perhaps might have be of some little use when the pirate come nearer the fair wind and all the press of sail which we have crowd on the junk prove of no use to we again the nearest pirate fire on we the shot this time fall just under we stern i still remain quiet as i have determine not to fire a single shot until i be quite certain my gun would take effect the third broadside which follow this come whiz over we head and through the sail without however wound either the man at the helm or myself the pirate now seem quite sure of they prize and come down upon we hoot and yell like demon at the same time load they gun and evidently determine not to spare they shot this be a moment of intense interest the plan which i have form from the first be now about to be put to proof and if the pirate be not the coward which i believe they to be nothing could save we from fall into they hand they fearful yell seem to be ring in my ear even now after this lapse of time and when i be on the other side of the globe the nearest junk be now within thirty yard of ours they gun be load and i know that the next discharge would completely rake we deck now say i to we helmsman keep you eye fix on I and the moment you see I fall flat on the deck you must do the same or you will be shoot i know that the pirate who be now on we stern could not bring he gun to bear upon we without put he helm down and bring he gangway at right angle with we stern as he gun be fire from the gangway i therefore keep a sharp eye upon the helmsman and the moment i see he put the helm down i order we steersman to fall flat on they face behind some wood and at the same moment do so myself we have scarcely do so when bang bang go they gun and the shot come whiz close over we splinter the wood about we in all direction fortunately none of we be strike now mandarin now they be quite close enough cry out my companion who do not wish to have another broadside like the last i be of the same opinion raise myself above the high stern of we junk and while the pirate be not more than twenty yard from we hoot and yell i rake they deck fore and aft with shot and ball from my double-barreled gun have a thunderbolt fall among they they could not have be more surprised doubtless many be wound and probably some kill at all event the whole of the crew not fewer than forty or fifty man who a moment before crowd the deck disappear in a marvellous manner shelter themselves behind the bulwark or lie flat on they face they be so completely take by surprise that they junk be leave without a helmsman she sail flap in the wind and as we be still carry all sail and keep on she right course they be soon leave a considerable way astern another be now bear down upon we as boldly as he companion have do and commence firing in the same manner have be so successful with the first i determine to follow the same plan with this one and to pay no attention to he firing until he should come to close quarter the plot now begin to thicken for the first junk have gather way again and be follow in we wake although keep at a respectful distance and three other although still further distant be make for the scene of action as fast as they could in the meantime the second be almost alongside and continue give we a broadside now and then with he gun watch they helm as before we sheltered ourselves as well as we could at the same time my poor fellow who be steer keep beg and pray that i would fire into we pursuer as soon as possible or we should be all kill as soon as we come within twenty or thirty yard of we i give they the contents of both barrel rake they deck as before this time the helmsman fall and doubtless several be wound in a minute or two i could see nothing but board and shield which be hold up by the pirate to protect themselves from my firing they junk go up into the wind for want of a helmsman and be soon leave some distance behind we while i be watch this vessel we man call out to I that there be another close on we lee-bow which i have not observe on account of we mainsail luckily however it prove to be a ning-po wood-junk like ourselves which the pirate have take a short time before but which although man by these rascal could do we no harm have no gun the poor ning-po crew whom i could plainly see on board seem to be very much down-hearted and frightened i be afterward inform that when a junk be capture all the principal people such as the captain pilot and passenger be take out of she and a number of the pirate go on board and take she into some of they den among the island and keep she there until a heavy ransom be pay both for the junk and the people sometimes when a ransom can not be obtain the mast and spar and everything else which be of any value be take out of she and she be set on fire the two other piratical junk which have be follow in we wake for some time when they see what have happen would not venture any nearer and at last much to my satisfaction the whole set of they bear away a sea fowling adventure one pleasant afternoon in summer frank costello jump into he little boat and pull she out of the narrow creek where she lay moor creep along the iron-bound shore until he reach the entrance of one of those deep sea-cave so common upon the western coast of ireland to the gloomy recess of these natural cavern million of sea-fowl resort during the breed season and it be among the feathered tribe then congregate in the puffin cave that frank mean on that evening to deal death and destruction glide with lightly-dipping oar into the yawning chasm he step nimbly from he boat and make the painter fast to a project rock he light a torch and arm only with a stout cudgel penetrate into the innermost recess of the cavern there he find a vast quantity of bird and egg and soon become so engross with he sport that he pay no attention to the lapse of time until the hollow sound of rush water behind he make he aware that the tide which be ebb when he enter the cave have turn and be now rise rapidly he first impulse be to return to the spot where he have make he boat fast but how be he horrify on perceive that the rock to which it have be secure be now completely cover with water he might however still have reach it by swim but unfortunately the painter by which it be attach to the rock not have sufficient scope the boat on the rising of the tide be draw stern down to a level with the water and frank as he behold she slowly fill and disappear beneath the wave feel as if the last link between the living world and himself have be break to go forward be impossible and he well know that there be no way of retreat from the cave which in a few hour would be fill by the advance tide he heart die within he as the thought of the horrid fate which await he flash across he mind he be not a man who fear to face death by flood or field on the stormy sea and the dizzy cliff he have dare it a thousand time with perfect unconcern but to meet the grim tyrant there alone to struggle hopelessly with he for life in that dreary tomb be more than he fortitude could bear he shriek aloud in the agony of despair -- the torch fall from he tremble hand into the dark water that gurgle at he foot and flash for a moment upon they inky surface expire with a hissing sound that fall like a death-warning upon he ear the wind which have be scarcely feel during the day begin to rise with the flow of the tide and now drive the tumultuous wave with hoarse and hideous clamor into the cavern every moment increase the violence of the gale that howl and bellow as it sweep around the echo roof of that rock-ribbed prison while the hoarse dash of the approach wave and the shrill scream of the sea-bird that fill the cavern form a concert of terrible dissonance well suit for the requiem of the hapless wretch who have be enclose in that live grave but the love of life which make we cling to it in the most hopeless extremity be strong in frank costello 's breast he firmness and presence of mind gradually return and he resolve not to perish without a struggle he remember that at the farther extremity of the cavern the rock rise like a flight of rude stair slope from the floor to the roof he have often clamber up those rugged step and he know that by means of they he could place himself at a elevation above the reach of the highest tide but the hope thus suggest be quickly damp when he reflect that a deep fissure which run perpendicularly through the rock form a chasm ten foot in width in the floor of the cavern between he and he place of refuge the tide however which be now rise rapidly compel he to retire every instant further into the cavern and he feel that the only chance he have leave he for life be to endeavor to cross the chasm he be young active and possess of uncommon courage and he have frequently by torch-light leap across the abyss in the presence of he companion few of whom dare to follow he example but now alone and in utter darkness how be he to attempt such a perilous feat the conviction that death be inevitable if he remain where he be decide he collect a handful of loose pebble from one of the numerous channel in the floor he proceed cautiously over the slippery rock throw at every step a pebble before he to ascertain the security of he footing at length he hear the stone as it fall from he finger descend with a hollow clatter noise that continue for several seconds he know he be stand on the brink of the chasm one quick and earnest prayer he breathe to the invisible power whose hand could protect he in that dread moment -- then retire a single pace and screw every nerve and muscle in he body to the utmost tension he make a step in advance and throw himself forward into the dark and fearful void who can tell the whirlwind of thought that rush through he brain in the brief moment that he hang above that yawn gulf should he have miscalculate he distance or choose a place where the cleft be widest -- should he footing fail or he strength be unequal to carry he over what a death be he dash down that horrible abyss -- crash from rock to rock until he lay at the bottom a mutilate corpse the agony of year be crowd into one moment -- in the next he foot strike against the firm rock on the opposite side of the chasm and he be save at least he feel that he have for the moment escape the imminent peril in which he be place and as he clamber joyfully up the rugged slope at the end of the cave he think little of the danger he have still to encounter all through that long night he sit on the narrow ledge of a rock while the angry wave thunder beneath and cast they cold spray every instant over he with the ebbing of the tide the sea recede from the cavern but frank hesitated to attempt cross the chasm again he limb have become stiff and benumbed and he long abstinence have so weakened he power that he shrink from the dangerous enterprise while give way to the most desponding reflection a stentorian hilloa ring and echo through the cavern and never have the human voice sound so sweetly in he ear he reply to it with a thrilling shout of joy and in a few minute several person with torch appear advance a plank be speedily thrust across the fissure and frank costello once more find himself amid a group of he friend who be warmly congratulating he upon he miraculous escape they tell he that from he not have return home the precede night it be generally conclude that he have be drown and a party of he neighbor proceed in a boat early in the morning in search of he body on reach puffin hole they discover he boat fasten to a rock and full of water as she have remain on the ebbing of the tide this circumstance induce they to examine the cavern narrowly and the happy result of they search be already know adventure with a cobra di capello i might have sleep some four or five hour and a dreamless and satisfying sleep it be but certain it be -- let scholiast say what they will and skeptic throw doubt by handfull on the assertion of metaphysician -- that before i awake and in my dreamless slumber i have a visible perception of peril -- a consciousness of the hover presence of death how to describe my feeling i know not but as we have all read and hear that if the eye of a watcher be steadily fix on the countenance of a sleeper for a certain length of time the slumberer will be sure to start up -- waken by the mysterious magnetism of a recondite principle of clairvoyance so it be that with shut eye and drowsed-up sens a inward ability be confer upon I to detect the living from the presence of danger near I -- to see though sleep-blind the formless shape of a mysterious horror crouch beside I and as if the peril that be my nightmate be of a nature to be quicken into fatal activity by any motion on my part i feel in my very stupor the critical necessity of lie quite still so that when i at last awake and feel that as i lay with my face toward the roof there be a thick heavy cold creep thing upon my chest i stir not nor utter a word of panic danger and fear may occasionally dull the sense and paralyse the faculty but they more frequently sharpen both and ere i could wink my eye i be broad awake and aware that coil and coil itself up into a circle of twist a enormous serpent be on my breast when i tell you that the whole of my chest and even the pit of my stomach be cover with the cold scaly proportion of the reptile you will own that it must have be one of considerable size what my thought be -- so make up of abhorrence dread and the expectation -- nay assurance of speedy death that must follow any movement on my part -- i can never hope to tell in language sufficiently distinct and vivid to convey they full force it be evident the loathsome creature have at length settle itself to sleep and i feel thankful that attract by my breath it have not approach the upper part of my throat it become quite still and its weighty pressure -- its first clammy chillness become gradually -lrb- so it seem to I -rrb- of a burning heat -- and the odious indescribable odor which exhale from its body and pervade the whole air -- so overwhelmed I that it be only by a severe struggle i preserved myself from shriek as it be a cold sweat burst from every pore i could hear the beating of my heart -- and i feel to my increase dismay that the palsy of terror have begin to agitate my limb it will wake think i and then all be over at this juncture something -- it might have be a wall-lizard or a large beetle -- fall from the ceiling upon my left arm which lay stretch at my side the snake uncoil its head raise itself with a low hiss and then for the first time i see it -- see the hood the terrible crest glisten in the moonshine it be a cobra di capello shade my eye to exclude the dreadful spectacle i lay almost faint until again all be quiet have its fiery glance encounter mine all would have be over but apparently it be once more asleep and presently i hear the lascar move about undoing the fastening of the tent and strike a light a thought suddenly strike I and with a impulse i could then ascribe to nothing short of desperation though its effect be so providential i utter in a loud but sepulchral tone kulassus lascar sahib be the instantaneous response and my heart beat quicker at the success of my attempt i lay still again for the reptile evidently rouse make a movement and its head as i suppose fall on my naked arm oh god the agony of that moment when suppress tremor almost give way to madness i debate with myself whether i should again endeavor to attract the attention of the kulassus or remain perfectly quiet or whether it would not be better than either to start up at once and shake the disgustful burden from I but the latter suggestion be at once abandon because of the assurance i feel that it would prove fatal impede by the heavy coil of the creature weak and nerveless from excitement i could not escape its fang again therefore i speak with the hollow but distinct accent which arise from the throat when the speaker be afraid to move a muscle : -- kulassus chiragh -- lascar a lanthorn latah own sahib i be bring it sir there be then a sound of clank metal -- light advance flash across the roof of the veranda -- and at the noise of come step lo one after one its terrible coil unwind the grisly monster glide away from my body and the last sound that strike my sense of hearing be the -- ya illahi samp oh god a snake -- of the lascar for i faint away for the first time in my life -lrb- illustration -rrb- combat of wild animal we be conduct to a gallery which command a view of a narrow court or area beneath inclose by wall and palisade this be the arena in which the spectacle be to take place unfortunately the space allot to spectator be so narrow by the great number of european lady who be present that we could only find indifferent standing room where in addition to this inconvenience the glare of the sun be very oppressively feel but the drama which begin to be act in we sight in the deep space below be such that every discomfort be forget in behold it we there behold six mighty buffalo not of the tame species but the sturdy offspring of the arni-buffalo of the hill country at least four foot and a half high from the ground to the withers with enormous widely-spread horn several foot long there they stand on they short clumsy hoof and snort violently blow out they angry breath from they protruded muzzle as if they be already aware of the nearly approach danger what terribly powerful brute what vast strength in they broad and brawny neck it would have be a noble sight have not they eye the while express such entire stupidity a rattle of stick and the cry of several kind of bestial voice be hear -- to which the buffalo reply with a deep bellow on a sudden from a open side door there dart forth a huge tiger certainly from ten to eleven foot in length and four in height without much hesitation he spring with a single long bind right amid the buffalo one of which wind he body out of the reach of the formidable horn he seize by the neck with both claw and tooth at once the weight of the tiger almost overthrow the buffalo a hideous combat now take place groan and bellow the buffalo drag he powerful assailant up and down the arena while the other with they heavy pointed horn deal the tiger fearful gash to liberate they fellow beast a deep stillness reign among the public all the spectator await with eager suspense the issue of this contest between the tiger and the buffalo as well as the fate of some unfortunate ass which latter to increase the sport be make perforce witness of the sanguinary action at first look down upon it from they pole with inexpressible horror and afterward when they support be shake by the butting of the buffalo fall to the ground as if dead and with outstretched limb lay expect they fate with the greatest resignation -- without make a single effort to save themselves two other tiger of somewhat less stature be now with great difficulty drive in while the main struggle be still go forward but no effort could induce they to attempt a attack of any kind they shrink down like cat crouch as closely as possible to the wall of the inclosure whenever the buffalo who still continue however to butt at they enemy with the utmost desperation approach they the great tiger have at last receive a push in the rib which lift he from he seat he come tumble down and crawl like a craven into a corner whither he be pursue by the buffalo madden by the pain of he lacerated neck -- and there have to endure many thrust with he horn at each of which he only draw up he mouth with a grimace of pain without make the smallest motion to ward off the attack the spectacle be by no means end here other combatant be drive in and fight with more or less energy perilous incident on a canadian river a young man and he sister have keep this ferry several year during which they have perform many act of heroic benevolence and have rescue number of they fellow creature from a watery grave one of these have so much of perilous adventure in it that i shall make no apology for give some account of it the more especially as i be myself one of the tremble and anxious spectator of the whole scene a raft of timber on its way down the river to the nearest port be dash to piece by the violence of the rapid there be the usual number of man upon it all of whom except two be fortunate enough to get upon a few log which keep together and be comparatively safe while they two poor comrade be helplessly contend with the tumble wave almost within reach of they but without they be able to afford they the slightest assistance after a minute or two and when one more would have be they last a long oar or sweep belong to the wretched raft come float by they instantly seize it and hold on till they be carry down more than a mile loudly call for help as they go along but what aid could we render they no craft none at least which be on the bank of the river could live in such a boil torrent as that for it be during one of the high spring freshet but the ferryman be of a different opinion and could not brook the thought of they die before he eye without he make a single effort to save they how could i stand idly look on he say to I afterward with a tough ash oar in my hand and a tight little craft at my foot and hear they cry for help and see they drown he determine at all risk to try to rescue they from the fate which seem to we inevitable he could not however go alone and there be not another man on that side of the river within half a mile of he he sister know this and courageously like another grace darling propose at once to accompany he in he perilous adventure from be so often on the water with she brother she know well how to handle a oar often indeed without he she have paddle a passenger across the ferry in she little canoe he accept she proposal and we have the satisfaction of see the light punt put off from the shore opposite to that from which we be idly and uselessly look on and go gallantly over the surge torrent toward the sink man we fear however that it would not be in time to save they as they cry for help grow fainter and fainter till each one we think would have be they last we see that the oar with the drown man cling to it be float rapidly down the middle of the stream which in this particular locality be more than a quarter of a mile in breadth and would inevitably in two or three minute more be in the white water among the breaker when they fate must be seal and the boat if it follow dash to piece among the rock this be the principal point of danger and they have to run down within a most fearful proximity of it to cross the course down which the drown man be drift and as they do so to seize hold of they without lose they own headway for there be not time for that they succeed in shooting athwart the current rapid as it be just below the man with breathless and painful anxiety we see they execute this dangerous manoeuver we see the ferryman lean over the side of he boat for a moment as it pass they while he sister back water with she oar they be save some one say close behind I in a whisper so deep and earnest that i start and turn to look at the speaker when another who hear he exclaim no no they be go they be lose the boat have leave they and sure enough it have but in a instant afterward just as we think they be about to be drive into the fatal breaker they turn to we inexpressible delight as if draw by some invisible power -lrb- the rope the ferryman have attach to the oar be indeed invisible to we -rrb- and follow the boat the ferryman and he sister have yet to pull a fearful distance for the time they have to do it in to get out of that part of the current lead to the breaker : and they accomplish it the man have the bow oar and we could see the tough ash bend like a willow-wand as he stretch out to keep the head of the boat partially up the stream he sister too keep she own and the little punt shot out rapidly into the comparatively quiet stream beyond the influence of the fearful current which be rapidly drive they upon the breaker when this be accomplish we fear for the noble-hearted brother and sister be at a end and we take a long breath it be indeed a relief to do so still we continue to watch they further proceedings with the deepest interest the moment they get into a less rapid current which they know lead into comparatively still water they cease rowing and allow the punt to float down with it the young ferryman now draw up the sweep alongside and succeed in get the two unfortunate man into he boat while he be do this he sister go aft and use she oar as a rudder to steer the boat at the foot of the current which they soon afterward reach there be no further danger but we watch they still and we see they row ashore on they own side of the river one of the poor fellow be so much exhaust that the ferryman have to carry he on he back to the nearest house where he soon recover twelve month after this take place i have the satisfaction of present to this worthy ferryman in the presence of above five hundred man a beautiful silver medallion send out to I by the royal humane society -- to which i have transmit a account of the occurrence nor be the heroine of my story forget a similar medallion be give to he for he sister she could not with propriety be present herself as it be the annual muster-day of the militia in that locality memoirs of a church missionary in canada a whale chase down go the boat with a splash each boat 's crew spring over the rail and in a instant the larboard starboard and waist-boat be man there be great rivalry in get the start the waist-boat get off in pretty good time and away go all three dash the water high over they bow nothing could be more exciting than the chase the larboard boat command by the mate and the waist-boat by the second mate be head and head give way my lad give way shout p -- we headsman we gain on they give way a long steady stroke that be the way to tell it ay ay cry tabor we boat-steerer what do you say boy shall we lick 'em pull pull like vengeance echo the crew and we dance over the wave scarcely seem to touch they the chase be now truly soul-stirring sometimes the larboard then the starboard then the waist-boat take the lead it be a severe trial of skill and muscle after we have run two mile at this rate the whale turn fluke go dead to windward now for it my lad cry p -- we 'll have they the next rise now pile it on a long steady pull that be it that be the way those whale belong to we do not give out half a hour more and they be we whale the other boat veer off at either side of we and continue the chase with renew ardor in about half a hour we lay on we oar to look round for the whale there she blow right ahead shout tabor fairly dance with delight there she blow -- there she blow oh lord boy spring cry p -- spring it be what d'ye say now chummy shall we take those whale to this general appeal every man reply by put he weight on he oar and exert he utmost strength the boat fly through the water with incredible swiftness scarcely rise to the wave a large bull whale lay about a quarter of a mile ahead of we lazily roll in the trough of the sea the larboard and starboard boat be far to leeward of we tug hard to get a chance at the other whale which be now blow in every direction give way give way my hearty cry p -- put he weight against the aft oar do you love gin a bottle of gin to the best man oh pile it on while you have breath pile it on on with the beef chummy smash every oar double 'em up or break 'em every devil 's imp of you pull no talking lay back to it now or never on dash the boat cleave its way through the rough sea as if the briny element be blue smoke the whale however turn fluke before we could reach he when he appear again above the surface of the water it be evident that he have mill while down by which manoeuver he gain on we nearly a mile the chase be now almost hopeless as he be make to windward rapidly a heavy black cloud be on the horizon portend a approach squall and the barque be fast fading from sight still we be not to be baffle by discourage circumstance of this kind and we brace we sinew for a grand and final effort never give up my lad say the headsman in a cheer voice mark my word we 'll have the whale yet only think he be ours and there be no mistake about it he will be ours now for a hard steady pull give way give way sir give way all there she blow oh pull my lively lad only a mile off there she blow the wind have by this time increase almost to a gale and the heavy black cloud be scatter over we far and wide part of the squall have pass off to leeward and entirely conceal the barque we situation be rather unpleasant : in a rough sea the other boat out of sight and each moment the wind increase we continue to strain every muscle till we be hard upon the whale tabor spring to the bow and stand by with the harpoon softly softly my lad say the headsman ay ay sir hush-h-h softly now be you time tabor tabor let fly the harpoon and bury the iron give he another stern all thunder p -- stern all and as we rapidly back from the whale he fling he tremendous fluke high in the air cover we with a cloud of spray he then sound make the line whiz as it pass through the chock when he rise to the surface again we haul up and the second mate stand ready in the bow to dispatch he with lance spout blood say tabor he be a dead whale he will not need much lance it be true enough for before the officer could get within dart of he he commence he die struggle the sea be crimson with he blood by the time we have reach he he be belly up we lay upon we oar a moment to witness he last throe and when he turn he head toward the sun a loud simultaneous cheer burst from every lip leopard hunting and adventure with buffalo and lion mr cumming have publish a volume contain a record of he hunting exploit in africa in the year 1848 the follow interesting account of adventure be from he work on the morning say mr cumming i ride into camp after unsuccessfully follow the spoor of a herd of elephant for two day in a westerly course have partaken of some refreshment i saddle up two steed and ride down the bank of ngotwanus with the bushman to seek for any game i might find after ride about a mile along the river 's green bank i come suddenly upon a old male leopard lie under the shade of a thorn grove and panting from the great heat although i be within sixty yard of he he have not hear the horse 's tread i think he be a lioness and dismount take a rest in my saddle on the old gray and send a bullet into he he spring to he foot and run half way down the river 's bank and stand to look about he when i send a second bullet into he person and he disappear over the bank the ground be very dangerous i do not disturb he by follow then but i at once send ruyter back to camp for the dog presently he return with wolf and boxer very much do up with the sun i ride forward and on look over the bank the leopard start up and sneak off alongside of the tall reed and be instantly out of sight i fire a random shot from the saddle to encourage the dog and shout to they they however stand look stupidly around and would not take up he scent at all i lead they over he spoor again and again but to no purpose the dog seem quite stupid and yet they be wolf and boxer my two best at length i give it up as a lose affair and be ride down the river 's bank when i hear wolf give tongue behind I and gallop back find he at bay with the leopard immediately beneath where i have fire at he he be very severely wound and have slip down into the river 's bed and double back whereby he have throw out both the dog and myself as i approach he fly out upon wolf and knock he over and then run up the bed of the river take shelter in a thick bush : wolf however follow he and at this moment my other dog come up have hear the shot and bay he fiercely he spring out upon they and then cross the river 's bed take shelter beneath some large tangled root on the opposite bank as he cross the river i put a third bullet into he firing from the saddle and as soon as he come to bay i give he a fourth which finish he this leopard be a very fine old male in the conflict the unfortunate alert be wound as usual get he face tear open he be still go upon three leg with all he breast lay bare by the first water-buck in the evening i direct my hottentot to watch a fine pool in the river and do they best while i ride to a distant pool several mile up the ngotwanus report as very good for game to lie all night and watch : my totty however fear tao disobey I on reach the water i be bind for i find it very promising and have fasten my two horse to a tree beneath the river 's bank i prepare a place of concealment close by and lay down for the night the river 's bank on each side be clothe with grove of shady thorn tree after i have lie some time squadron of buffalo be hear come on until the shady grove on the east bank of the water immediately above I be alive with they after some time the leader venture down the river 's bank to drink and this be the signal for a general rush into the large pool of water : they come on like a regiment of cavalry at a gallop make a mighty din and obscure the air with a dense cloud of dust at length i send a ball into one of they when the most tremendous rush follow up the bank where they all stand still listen attentively i know that the buffalo be severely wound but do not hear he fall some time after i fire at a second as they stand on the bank above I this buffalo be also hard hit but do not then fall a little after i fire at a third on the same spot he run forty yard and fall groan fearfully : this at once bring on a number of the other to butt they die comrade accord to they benevolent custom i then creep in toward they and firing my fourth shot a second buffalo run forward a few yard and fall groan as the last she comrade come up serve she in the same manner a second time i creep in and firing a fifth shot a third buffalo run forward and fall close to she die comrade : in a few minute all the other buffalo make off and the sound of tooth tear at the flesh be hear immediately i fancy it be the hyaena and fire a shot to scare they from the flesh all be still and be anxious to inspect the head of the buffalo i go boldly forward take the native who accompany I along with I we be within about five yard of the nearest buffalo when i observe a yellow mass lie alongside of he and at the same instant a lion give a deep growl -- i think it be all over with I the native shout tao and spring away instantly commence blow shrilly through a charmed piece of bone which he wear on he necklace i retreat to the native and we then kneel down the lion continue he meal tear away at the buffalo and growl at he wife and family who i find next day by the spoor have accompany he know that he would not molest I if i leave he alone i propose to the native to go to we hole and lie down but he would not hear of it and entreat I to fire at the lion i fire three different shot where i think i see he but without any effect he would not so much as for a moment cease munch my buffalo i then proceed to lie down and be soon asleep the native keep watch over we destiny some time after midnight other lion be hear come on from other airt and my old friend commence roar so loudly that the native thought it proper to wake I the first old lion now want to drink and hold right away for the two unfortunate steed roar terribly i feel rather alarm for they safety but trust that the lion have have flesh enough for one night i lay still and listen with a attentive ear in a few minute to my utter horror i hear he spring upon one of the steed with a angry growl and dash he to the earth the steed give a slight groan and all be still i listen to hear the sound of tooth but all continue still soon after this tao be once more hear to be munch the buffalo in a few minute he come forward and stand on the bank close above we and roar most terribly walk up and down as if meditate some mischief i now think it high time to make a fire and quickly collect some dry reed and little stick in half a minute we have a cheerful blaze the lion which have not yet get we wind come forward at once to find out what the deuse be up but not see to he entire satisfaction from the top of the bank he be proceed to descend by a game-path into the river-bed within a few yard of we i happen at the very moment to go to this spot to fetch more wood and be entirely conceal from the lion 's view above by the intervene high reed we actually meet face to face the first notice i get be he sudden spring to one side accompany by repeat angry growl while i involuntarily make a convulsive spring backward at the same time give a fearful shriek such as i never before remember utter i fancy just as he growl he be come upon I we now heap on more wood and keep up a very strong fire until the day dawn the lion feast beside we all the time notwithstanding the remonstrance of the little native who with a true bechuana spirit lament the loss of so much good flesh keep continually shout and pelt they with flame brand the next morning when it be clear i arise and inspect the buffalo the three that have fall be fine old cow and two of they be partly consume by the lion the ground all around be pack flat with they spoor one particular spoor be nearly as large as that of a borele i then proceed to inspect the steed : the sand around they be also cover with the lion 's spoor he have spring upon the old gray but have do he no further injury than scratch he back through the skin : perhaps the lion have be scare by the rheim or on discover he spare condition have prefer the buffalo hunting the white rhinoceros lion buffalo and giraffe upon the 9th say mr cum it rain unceasingly throughout the day convert the rich soil on which we be encamp into one mass of soft sticky clay in the forenoon fear the rain would continue so as to render the valley -lrb- through which we must pass to gain the firmer ground -rrb- impassible i order my man to prepare to march and leave the tent with its contents stand the point which i wish to gain be distant only about five hundred yard when the ox be inspan however and we attempt to move we find my tackle which be old so rotten from the effect of the rain that something give way at every strain owe to this and to the softness of the valley we labor on till sundown and only succeed in bring one wagon to its destination the other two remain fast in the mud in the middle of the valley next morning luckily the weather clear up when my man bring over the tent and in the afternoon the other two wagon we follow up the bank of the river for several day with the usual allowance of sport on the 16th we come suddenly upon a immense old bull muchocho rolling in mud he spring to he foot immediately he see I and charge up the bank so frightened we horse that before i could get my rifle from my after-rider he be past we i then give he chase and after a hard gallop of about a mile spring from my horse and give he a good shot behind the shoulder at this moment a cow rhinoceros of the same species with she calf charge out of some wait-a-bit thorn cover and stand right in my path observe that she carry a unusually long horn i turn my attention from the bull to she and after a very long and severe chase drop she at the sixth shot i carry one of my rifle which give I much trouble that not be the tool require for this sort of work where quick loading be indispensable after breakfast i send man to cut off the head of this rhinoceros and proceed with ruyter to take up the spoor of the bull wound in the morning we find that he be very severely hit and have follow the spoor for about a mile through very dense thorn cover he suddenly rustle out of the bush close ahead of we accompany by a whole host of rhinoceros bird i mount my horse and give he chase and in a few minute he have receive four severe shot i manage to turn he course toward camp when i cease firing as he seem to be nearly do up and ruyter and i ride slowly behind occasionally shout to guide he course presently however chukuroo cease take any notice of we and hold leisurely on for the river into a shallow part of which he walk and after pant there and turn about for a quarter of a hour he fall over and expire this be a remarkably fine old bull and from he dentition it be not improbable that a hundred summer have see he roam a peaceful denizen of the forest and open glade along the fair bank of the secluded mariqua during we march on the 19th we have to cross a range of very rocky hill cover with large loose stone and all hand be require to be actively employ for about a hour in clear they out of the way to permit the wagon to pass the work go on fast and furious and the quantity of stone clear be immense at length we reach the spot where we be oblige to bid adieu to the mariqua and hold a westerly course across the country for sicheley at sundown we halt under a lofty mountain the highest in the district call lynchie a cheny or the monkey 's mountain next day at a early hour i ride out with ruyter to hunt my camp be entirely without flesh and we have be ration upon very tough old rhinoceros for several day past it be a cloudy morning and soon after start it come on to rain heavily i however hold on skirt a fine well-wooded range of mountain and after ride several mile i shoot a zebra have cover the carcass well over with branch to protect it from the vulture i return to camp and inspanning my wagon take it up on the march we continue trek on until sundown when we start a immense herd of buffalo into which i stalk and shoot a huge old bull we march this evening be through the most beautiful country i have ever see in africa we skirt a endless range of well-wooded stony mountain lie on we leave while to we right the country at first sloped gently off and then stretch away into a level green forest -lrb- occasionally intersperse with open glade -rrb- boundless as the ocean this green forest be however relieve in one direction by a chain of excessively bold detach well-wooded rocky pyramidal mountain which stand forth in grand relief in advance the picture be bound by forest and mountain one bold acclivity in shape of a dome standing prominent among its fellow it be a lovely evening : the sky overcast and gloomy throw a interesting wild mysterious coloring over the landscape i gaze forth upon the romantic scene before I with intense delight and feel melancholy and sorrowful at pass so fleetingly through it and could not help shout out as i march along where be the coward who would not dare to die for such a land in the morning we hold for a fountain some mile ahead in a gorge in the mountain as we approach the fountain and be pass close under a steep rocky hillside well wood to its summit i unexpectedly behold a lion steal up the rocky face and halt behind a tree he stand overhaul we for some minute i resolve to give he battle and seize my rifle march against he follow by carey carry a spare gun and by three man lead my dog now reduce to eight when we get close in to the base of the mountain we find ourselves envelop in dense jungle which extend half-way to its summit and entirely obscure from we eye object which be quite apparent from the wagon i slip my dog however which after snuff about take right up the steep face on the spoor of the lion for there be a troop of they -- a lion and three lioness the people at the wagon see the chase in perfection when the lion observe the dog come on they take right up and three of they cross over the sky ridge the dog however turn one rattle old lioness which come rumble down through the cover close past I i run to meet she and she come to bay in a open spot near the base of the mountain whither i quickly follow and come up within thirty yard bowl she over with my first shot which break she back my second enter she shoulder and fear that she might hurt any of the dog as she still evince sign of life i finish she with a third in the breast the belly of all the four lion be much distend by some game they have be gorge no doubt a buffalo as a large herd start out of the jungle immediately under the spot where the noble beast be first disturbed shower of rain fall every hour throughout the day so i employ my man in make feldt-schoen or in other word african brogue for I these shoe be worthy of a sportsman be light yet strong and be entirely compose of the skin of game of my shoot the sole be make of either buffalo or cameleopard the front part perhaps of koodoo or hartebeest or bushbuck and the back of the shoe of lion or hyaena or sable antelope while the rheimpy or thread with which the whole be sew consist of a thin strip of the skin of a steinbok on the forenoon of this day i ride forth to hunt accompany by ruyter we hold west skirt the wooded stony mountain the native have here many year before wage successful war with elephant four of whose skull i find presently i come across two sassayby one of which i knock over but while i be load he regain he leg and make off we cross a level stretch of forest hold a northerly course for a opposite range of green well-wooded hill and valley here i come upon a troop of six fine old bull buffalo into which i stalk and wound one princely fellow very severely behind the shoulder bring blood from he mouth he however make off with he comrade and the ground be very rough we fail to overtake he they hold for ngotwanus after follow the spoor for a couple of mile we drop it as it lead right away from camp return from this chase we have a adventure with another old bull buffalo which show the extreme danger of hunting buffalo without dog we start he in a green hollow among the hill and he course incline for camp i give he chase he cross the level broad strath and make for the opposite densely-wooded range of mountain along the base of these we follow he sometimes in view sometimes on the spoor keep the old fellow at a pace which make he pant at length finding himself much distressed he have recourse to a singular stratagem double round some thick bush which obscure he from we view he find himself beside a small pool of rain-water just deep enough to cover he body into this he walk and face about lay gently down and await we on-coming with nothing but he old gray face and massive horn above the water and these conceal from view by the overhang herbage -lrb- illustration : charge of the buffalo -rrb- we attention be entirely engross with the spoor and thus we ride boldly on until within a few foot of he when spring to he foot he make a desperate charge after ruyter utter a low stifled roar peculiar to buffalo -lrb- somewhat similar to the growl of a lion -rrb- and hurl horse and rider to the earth with fearful violence he horn lay the poor horse 's haunch open to the bone make the most fearful rugged wound in a instant ruyter regain he foot and run for he life which the buffalo observe give chase but most fortunately come down with a tremendous somersault in the mud he foot slip from under he thus the bushman escape certain destruction the buffalo rise much discomfit and the wounded horse first catch he eye he go a second time after he but he get out of the way at this moment i manage to send one of my patent pacificating pill into he shoulder when he instantly quit the field of action and seek shelter in a dense cover on the mountain side whither i deem it imprudent to follow he a leopard hunt the dense jungle of bengal be the place of the leopard 's resort and the havoc which it commit among the cattle be prodigious it be dread far and near on this account by the native and they scrupulously avoid they spotted enemy know well that when he appetite be whet with hunger he be not over scrupulous whether he victim be beast or man on one occasion the monster make a dash upon a herd of beef and succeed in carry off a large ox and loud be the lament of the poor hindoo that one of the sacred herd have thus unceremoniously be assail and slaughter before they eye a party of the bengal native infantry consist of a officer and five other have be inform of the circumstance follow in the direction of the leopard 's den determine if possible to punish he for this and the many other depredation he have commit have come to a intervene ravine they be about to cross it when they see the object of they search on the opposite side there he be lie in he lair heedless of danger and luxuriously feast on the carcass of he captive it be the monster 's last meal however the party approach with stealthy step as near as they could without cross the defile take you aim fire cry the captain in hindostanee we suppose they do so and four ball pierce the leopard three in the neck and one in a more dangerous place through the brain startle by this unpleasant salute the animal rise gaze with glaring eye on its enemy at the same time paw the earth in its pain fury the sepoy be astonish that he do not roll lifeless at they foot but instead of this before they have time to reload the creature after utter a terrific cry spring across the ravine and seize one of its assailant it must have be in some degree weaken by its wound but its strength be yet great for the man seem to have no power of resistance to its attack the leopard have a hold of the sepoy in its mouth dart off in the direction of a jungle close at hand the other soldier follow up as fast as they could but not daring to fire lest they should injure they luckless comrade sometimes they lose sight of the leopard and its bleeding burden but the blood mark on the grass or on the sand enable they to regain the trail and to carry on the pursuit the animal at length come to a small river it hesitate for a little on the brink and then leap in still tenaciously retain its prey the stoppage thus occasion enable the pursuer to gain ground and just after the leopard have emerge from the river and be shake its skin free from the watery drop one of the party seize the auspicious moment and fire the beast drop its prey at once howl furiously and then fall dead to they great surprise and joy the soldier find that they comrade be still in life though he have faint from fear and from weakness occasion by the loss of blood he gradually recover and under the stimulating influence of a cup of brandy be able to proceed home with he comrade it be many week however before he be fit for service and he will retain till he die day the dental mark receive from the leopard by way of token what it would like to have do with he have there be none but themselves two on the desert wide the soldier return some time after and skin the animal carry home its spotted cover for a trophy and now here it be with the mark of the musket-ball upon it remembrance of the strange story we have now recount life in californium every man both honest and dishonest in californium have he own horse -- as a very good-looking active one can be purchase tame to carry the saddle and rider from the indian for four or five dollar so that every one i may add of both sex ride in californium no one walk far but the hunter and he be carry in canoe a long way up the river before he strike into the forest after the animal he be in pursuit of this last class of man be the most wild daring yet friendly and honest of the lower class of the white population of californium well : as the robber as well as the honest man be equally mount sometimes a very interesting steeple chase ensue -- ground rough not be previously choose occasionally leap over pool of water large stone and fall tree the indian who use the lasso generally keep the lead to strive to throw the noose over either the man or horse they be pursue it be make of thong of bullock-hide twist into a small rope about thirty or forty foot long with a noose form by a run knot at the end of it one end of the lasso be fasten to the back of the saddle : the entire length of it be keep in a coil on the right hand and after two or three swing of it over they head they will throw it with such accuracy that the smallest object will come within the noose thus then if a equestrian traveler do not keep a good look-out as he be pass by a bush or thicket one of these lasso may be throw out the noose fall over he head will be jerk tight round he body and in the twinkling of a eye he will be drag off he horse and away into the bush to be strip of everything he have by all the account i have hear and from what i have see the robber of californium be the most active in the world : the end of the dangerous lasso be firmly fasten to the saddle enable the rider as soon as he victim either man or animal be noosed to wheel round he horse and dash off like a arab drag whatever he have fast after he there be one method of avert the fall of the lasso noose over the body of a man either on foot or horseback if he hold as he always ought either sword or gun in he right hand when he see the lasso come let he instantly raise either and he arm in a horizontal position and if the noose do fall true it can not run farther down be stop by sword gun or extend arm then fling it off quick or it may be jerk tight round the neck i have know this subterfuge save many a man from robber and perhaps murderer i once hunt for three month in company with a hunter well know in californium in idea he be wild and imaginative in the extreme but in he act of daring & c the most cool and philosophic fellow i ever know a commercianto or merchant at san francisco on whose veracity i know from experience i can depend tell I the follow story of this man which will at once illustrate he general character this hunter be some month before i have fall in with he make the best of he way down the valley of the tule lake from the interior with a heavy pack of fur on he back he never-erring rifle in he hand and he two dog by he side he be join at the northermost end of the valley by the merchant i have speak of who be arm only with sword and pistol they have scarcely clear the valley when a party of robber gallop out before they there be four whites fully arm and two indian with the lasso coil up in they right hand ready for a throw the hunter tell the merchant who be on horseback to dismount instantly and to cover fortunately for they there be a good deal of thicket and trunk of large tree that have fall be strew about in a very desirable manner behind these log the merchant and the hunter quickly take up they position and as they be in the act of do so two or three shot be fire after they without effect the hunter coolly untie the pack of fur from he back and lay they beside he it be my opinion merchant say he that they varmint there want either you saddle-bag or my pack but i reckon they 'll get neither so he take up he rifle fire and the foremost indian lasso in hand roll off he horse another discharge from the rifle and the second indian fall while in the act of throw he lasso at the head and shoulder of the hunter as he raise himself from behind the log to fire now say the hunter as he reload lay on he back to avoid the shot of the robber that be what i call the best of the scrimmage to get they brown thief with they lasso out of the way first see they rascally whites now jump over the log to charge we in we cover they be fast advance when the rifle again speak out and the foremost fall they still come on to within about thirty yard when another fall and the remain two make a desperate charge up close to the log the hunter from long practice be dexterous in reload he gun now merchant say he be the time for you pop-gun -lrb- mean the pistol -rrb- and do not be at all narvous keep a steady hand and drop either man or horse a man of they sha not escape the two remain robber be now up with the log and fire each a pistol-shot at the hunter which he escape by dodge behind a tree close to from which he fire with effect as only one robber be leave he wheel round he horse with the intention of gallop off when the pistol-bullet of the merchant shoot the horse from under he well do merchant say the hunter you have stop that fellow 's galop as soon as the robber could disentangle himself from the fall horse he take to he heel and run down a sloping ground as fast as he could the hunter draw he tomahawk from he belt and give chase after he as he be more of a equestrian than a pedestrian the nimbleness of the hunter soon shorten the distance between they and the last of the robber fall thus perish this dangerous gang of six by the single hand of this brave hunter and as the commercianto inform I he act as coolly and deliberately as if he be shoot tame bullock for the market the affair be rather advantageous to the hunter for on search the saddle-bag and pocket of the robber he pull forth some doubloon and a few dollar with other valuable they have no doubt a short time previously take from some traveler the saddle-bag arm and accouterment of the four white man be pack up make fast on the saddle of the two horse and the hunter mount a third the merchant mount another he horse be shoot and thus they leave the scene of action the body of the robber to the wolf who be howl about they and enter san francisco in triumph a storm among the iceberg to prevent the ship separate during the fog it be necessary to keep fast to the heavy piece of ice which we have between they as a fender and with a reduce amount of sail on they we make some way through the pack : as we advance in this novel mode to the south-west we find the ice become more open and the westerly swell increase as the wind veer to the northwest at midnight we find it impossible any longer to hold on by the floe piece all we hawser break in succession we make sail on the ship and keep company during the thick fog by firing gun and by means of the usual signal : under the shelter of a berg of nearly a mile in diameter we dodge about during the whole day wait for clear weather that we might select the best lead through the disperse pack but at nine pm the wind suddenly freshen to a violent gale from the northward compelling we to reduce we sail to a close-reefed main-topsail and storm-staysail : the sea quickly rise to a fearful height break over the loftiest berg we be unable any longer to hold we ground but be drive into the heavy pack under we lee soon after midnight we ship be involve in a ocean of roll fragment of ice hard as float rock of granite which be dash against they by the wave with so much violence that they mast quiver as if they would fall at every successive blow and the destruction of the ship seem inevitable from the tremendous shock they receive by backing and fill the sail we endeavor to avoid collision with the larger mass but this be not always possible : in the early part of the storm the rudder of the erebus be so much damage as to be no longer of any use and about the same time i be inform by signal that the terror 's be completely destroy and nearly tear away from the stern-post we have hope that as we drift deeper into the pack we should get beyond the reach of the tempest but in this we be mistaken hour pass away after hour without the least mitigation of the awful circumstance in which we be place indeed there seem to be but little probability of we ship hold together much longer so frequent and violent be the shock they sustain the loud crash noise of the strain and work of the timber and deck as she be drive against some of the heavier piece which all the activity and exertion of we people could not prevent be sufficient to fill the stoutest heart that be not support by trust in he who control all event with dismay at two pm the storm gain its height when the barometer stand at 2840 inch and after that time begin to rise although we have be force many mile deeper into the pack we could not perceive that the swell have at all subside we ship still roll and groan amid the heavy fragment of crush berg over which the ocean roll its mountainous wave throw huge mass one upon another and then again bury they deep beneath its foam water dash and grind they together with fearful violence the awful grandeur of such a scene can neither be imagine nor describe for less can the feeling of those who witness it be understand each of we secure we hold wait the issue with resignation to the will of he who alone could preserve we and bring we safely through this extreme danger watch with breathless anxiety the effect of each succeed collision and the vibration of the totter mast expect every moment to see they give way without we have the power to make a effort to save they although the force of the wind have somewhat diminish by four o'clock yet the squall come on with unabated violence lay the ship over on she broadside and threaten to blow the storm-sail to piece fortunately they be quite new or they never could have withstand such terrific gust at this time the terror be so close to we that when she rise to the top of one wave the erebus be on the top of that next to leeward of she the deep chasm between they fill with heavy rolling mass and as the ship descend into the hollow between the wave the main-topsail yard of each could be see just level with the crest of the intervene wave from the deck of the other : from this some idea may be form of the height of the wave as well as of the perilous situation of we ship the night now begin to draw on and cast its gloomy mantle over the appalling scene render we condition if possible more hopeless and helpless than before but at midnight the snow which have be fall thickly for several hour clear away as the wind suddenly shift to the westward and the swell begin to subside and although the shock we ship still sustain be such that must have destroy any ordinary vessel in less than five minute yet they be feeble compare to those to which we have be expose and we mind become more at ease for they ultimate safety during the darkness of night and the thick weather we have be carry through a chain of berg which be see in the morning considerably to windward and which serve to keep off the heavy pressure of the pack so that we find the ice much more open and i be enable to make my way in one of we boat to the terror about whose condition i be most anxious -- for i be aware that she damages be of a much more serious nature than those of the erebus notwithstanding the skillful and seaman-like manner in which she have be manage and by which she maintain she appoint station throughout the gale i find that she rudder be completely break to piece and the fastening to the stern-post so much strained and twisted that it would be difficult to get the spare rudder with which we be fortunately provide fit so as to be useful and could only be do if at all under very favorable circumstance the other damages she have sustain be of less consequence and it be as great a satisfaction as it have ever since be a source of astonishment to we to find that after so many hour of constant and violent thump both the vessel be nearly as tight as they be before the gale we can only ascribe this to the admirable manner in which they have be fortify for the service and to we have they hold so stow as to form a solid mass throughout fall of the rossberg the summer of 1806 have be very rainy and on the first and second of September it rain incessantly new crevice be observe in the flank of the mountain a sort of crack noise be hear internally stone start out of the ground detach fragment of rock roll down the mountain at two o'clock in the afternoon on the 2d of September a large rock become loose and in fall raise a cloud of black dust toward the lower part of the mountain the ground seem press down from above and when a stick or a spade be drive in it move of itself a man who have be digging in he garden run away from fright at these extraordinary appearance soon a fissure larger than all the other be observe insensibly it increase : spring of water cease all at once to flow the pine tree of the forest absolutely reel the bird fly away scream a few minute before five o'clock the symptom of some mighty catastrophe become still stronger the whole surface of the mountain seem to glide down but so slowly as to afford time to the inhabitant to go away a old man who have often predict some such disaster be quietly smoke he pipe when tell by a young man run by that the mountain be in the act of fall he rise and look out but come into he house again say he have time to fill another pipe the young man continue to fly be throw down several time and escape with difficulty look back he see the house carry off all at once another inhabitant be alarm take two of he child and run away with they call to he wife to follow with the third but she go in for another who still remain -lrb- marianne aged five -rrb- just then francisca ulrich they servant be cross the room with this marianne whom she hold by the hand and see she mistress at that instant as francisca afterward say the house appear to be tear from its foundation -lrb- it be of wood -rrb- and spin round and round like a teetotum i be sometimes on my head and sometimes on my foot in total darkness and violently separate from the child when the motion stop she find herself jam in on all side with she head downward much bruise and in extreme pain she suppose she be bury alive at a great depth with much difficulty she disengage she right hand and wipe the blood from she eye presently she hear the faint moan of marianne and call she by she name the child answer that she be on she back among stone and bush which hold she fast but that she hand be free and that she see the light and then something green she ask whether people would not come soon to take they out francisca answer that it be the day of judgment and that no one be leave to help they but that they would be release by death and be happy in heaven they pray together at last francisca 's ear be strike by the sound of a bell which she know to be that of stenenberg then seven o'clock strike in another village and she begin to hope there be still live being and endeavor to comfort the child the poor little girl be at first clamorous for she supper but she cry soon become fainter and at last quite die away francisca still with she head downward and surround with damp earth experience a sense of cold in she foot almost insupportable after prodigious effort she succeed in disengage she leg and think this save she life many hour have pass in this situation when she again hear the voice of marianne who have be asleep and now renew she lamentation in the meantime the unfortunate father who with much difficulty have save himself and two child wander about till daylight when he come among the ruin to look for the rest of he family he soon discover he wife by a foot which appear above the ground she be dead with a child in she arm he cry and the noise he make in digging be hear by marianne who call out she be extricate with a broken thigh and say that francisca be not far off a farther search lead to she release also but in such a state that she life be despair of she be blind for some day and remain subject to convulsive fit of terror it appear that the house or themselves at least have be carry down about one thousand five hundred foot from where it stand before in another place a child two year old be find unhurt lie on he straw

it be fill up and a prodigious wave pass completely over the island of schwanau seventy foot above the usual level of the water overwhelm the opposite shore and as it return sweep away into the lake many house with they inhabitant the chapel of olton build of wood be find half a league from the place it have previously occupy and many large block of stone completely change they position simond 's switzerland the rifleman of chippewa at the time of the french and indian war the american army be encamp on the plain of chippewa colonel st clair the commander be a bold and meritorious officer but there be mix with he bravery a large share of rashness or indiscretion he rashness in this case consist in encamp on a open plain beside a thick wood from which a indian scout could easily pick off he outpost without be expose in the least to the fire of the sentinel five night have pass and every night he have be surprise by the disappearance of a sentry who stand at a lonely post in the vicinity of the forest these repeat disaster have strike such a dread into the breast of the remain soldier that no one would volunteer to take the post and the commander know it would be throw away they life let it remain unoccupied several night at length a rifleman of the virginium corps volunteer he service he be tell the danger of the duty but he laugh at the fear of he comrade say he would return safe to drink the health of he commander in the morning the guard march up soon after and he shoulder he rifle and fall in he arrive at he bound and bid he fellow-sentinel good-night assume the duty of he post the night be dark from the thick cloud that overspread the firmament no star shone on the sentinel as he pace he lonely path and naught be hear but the mournful hoot of the owl as she raise she nightly wail from the withered branch of the venerable oak at length a low rustling among the bush on the right catch he ear he gaze long toward the spot whence the sound seem to proceed but see nothing save the impenetrable gloom of the thick forest which surround the encampment then as he march onward he hear the joyful cry of all be well after which he seat himself upon a stump and fall into a reverie while he thus sit a savage enter the open space behind and after buckle he tunic with numerous fold tight around he body draw over he head the skin of a wild boar with the natural appendage of those animal thus accoutr he walk past the soldier who see the object approach quickly stand upon he guard but a well-known grunt ease he fear and he suffer it to pass it be too dark for any one to discover the cheat the beast as it appear to be quietly seek the thicket to the leave it be nearly out of sight when through a sudden break in the cloud the moon shine bright upon it the soldier then perceive the ornamented moccasin of a indian and quick as think prepared to fire but fear lest he might be mistaken and thus needlessly alarm the camp and also suppose if he be right the other savage would be near at hand he refrain and have a perfect knowledge of indian subtlety and craft quickly take off he coat and cap and after hang they on the stump where he have recline secure he rifle and softly grope he way toward the thicket he have barely reach it when the whizzing of a arrow pass he head and tell he of the danger he have escape turn he eye toward a small spot of clear land within the thicket he perceive a dozen of the same _ animal _ sit on they hind leg instead of feed on the acorn which at this season lay plentifully upon the surface of the leaf and listen attentively he hear they converse in the iroquois tongue the substance of they conversation be that if the sentinel should not discover they the next evening as soon as the moon should afford they sufficient light for they operation they would make a attack upon the american camp they then quit they rendezvous and soon they tall form be lose in the gloom of the forest the soldier now return to he post and find the arrow sink deep in the stump it have pass through the breast of he coat he directly return to the encampment and desire the orderly at the marquee to inform the commander of he wish to speak with he have information of importance of communicate he be admit and have be hear the colonel bestow on he the vacant post of lieutenant of the corps and direct he to be ready with a picket-guard to march at eight o'clock in the evening to the spot he have occupy the night before where he be to place he hat and coat upon the stump and then lie in ambush for the intruder accordingly the party proceed and obey the colonel 's order the moon rise but shine dimly through the thick branch of the forest while the new lieutenant be wait the result of he manoeuver a arrow

from england for bombay partly laden with broadcloth be proceed on she voyage with every prospect of a successful issue while thus pursue she way through the atlantic she be unfortunately drive from she course by adverse wind and current more to the southward and westward than be require and it become desirable to reach the island of tristan d'acunha in order to ascertain and rectify the reckon it be while steer to reach this group of island that one morning a passenger on board the blendenhall who chance to be up on deck earlier than usual observe great quantity of seaweed occasionally float alongside this excite some alarm and a man be immediately send aloft to keep a good look-out the weather be then extremely hazy though moderate the weed continue all be on the alert they shorten sail and the boatswain pipe for breakfast in less than ten minute breaker ahead startle every soul and in a moment all be on deck breaker starboard breaker larboard breaker all around be the ominous cry a moment afterward and all be confusion the word be scarcely utter when and before the helm be up the ill-fated ship strike and after a few tremendous shock against the sunken reef she part about midship rope and stay be cut away -- all rush forward as if instinctively and have barely reach the forecastle when the stern and quarter-deck break asunder with a violent crash and sink to rise no more two of the seaman miserably perish -- the rest include officer passenger and crew hold on about the head and bow -- the struggle be for life at this moment the inaccessible island which till then have be vail in thick cloud and mist appear frown above the haze the wreck be more than two mile from the frightful shore the base of the island be still bury in impenetrable gloom in this perilous extremity one be for cut away the anchor which have be get up to the cathead in time of need another be for cut down the foremast the foretop-mast be already by the board the fog totally disappear and the black rocky island stand in all its rugged deformity before they eye suddenly the sun break out in full splendor as if to expose more clearly to the view of the sufferer they dreadful predicament despair be in every bosom -- death array in all its terror seem to hover over the wreck but exertion be require and every thing that human energy could devise be effect the wreck on which all eagerly clung be fortunately drift by the tide and wind between ledge of sunken rock and thunder breaker until after the lapse of several hour it enter the only spot on the island where a landing be possibly practicable -- for all the other part of the coast consist of perpendicular cliff of granite rise from amid the deafening surf to the height of twenty forty and sixty foot as the shore be near a raft be prepare and on this a few paddle for the cove at last the wreck drive right in : rope be instantly throw out and the crew and passenger -lrb- except two who have be crush in the wreck -rrb- include three lady and a female attendant be snatch from the watery grave which a few short hour before have appear inevitable and safely land on the beach evening have now set in and every effort be make to secure whatever could be save from the wreck bale of cloth case of wine a few box of cheese some ham the carcass of a milch cow that have be wash on shore bucket tub butt a seaman 's chest -lrb- contain a tinder-box and needle and thread -rrb- with a number of elegant mahogany turn bed-post and part of a investment for the indium market be get on shore the rain pour down in torrent -- all hand be busily at work to procure shelter from the weather and with the bed-post and broadcloth and part of the foresail as many tent be soon pitch as there be individual on the island drench with the sea and with the rain hungry cold and comfortless thousand of mile from they native land almost beyond expectation of human succor hope nearly annihilate -- the shipwrecked voyager retire to they tent in the morning the wreck have go to piece and plank and spar and whatever have float in be eagerly drag on shore no sooner be the unfortunate ship break up than deem themselves free from the bond of authority many begin to secure whatever come to land : and the captain officer passenger and crew be now reduce to the same level and oblige to take they turn to fetch water and explore the island for food the work of explore be soon over -- there be not a bird nor a quadrup nor a single tree to be see all be barren and desolate the low part be scatter over with stone and sand and a few stunt weed rock fern and other plant the top of the mountain be find to consist of a fragment of original table-land very marshy and full of deep slough intersect with small rill of water pure and pellucid as crystal and a profusion of wild parsley and celery the prospect be one dreary scene of destitution without a single ray of hope to relieve the misery of the desponding crew after some day the dead cow ham and cheese be consume and from one end of the island to the other not a morsel of food could be see even the celery begin to fail a few bottle of wine which for security have be secrete under ground only remain famine now begin to threaten every stone near the sea be examine for shellfish but in vain in this dreadful extremity and while the half-famished seaman be at night squat in sullen dejection around they fire a large lot of sea-bird allure by the flame rush into the midst of they and be greedily lay hold of as fast as they could be seize for several night in succession similar flock come in and by multiply they fire a considerable supply be secure these visit however cease at length and the wretched party be expose again to the most severe privation when they stock of wild fowl have be exhaust for more than two day each begin to fear they be now approach that sad point of necessity when between death and casting lot who should be sacrifice to serve for food for the rest no alternative remain while horror at the bare contemplation of a extremity so repulsive occupy the thought of all the horizon be observe to be suddenly obscure and presently cloud of penguin alight on the island the low grounds be actually cover and before the evening be dark the sand could not be see for the number of egg which like a sheet of snow lay on the surface of the earth the penguin continue on the island four or five day when as if by signal the whole take they flight and be never see again a few be kill but the flesh be so extremely rank and nauseous that it could not be eat the egg be collect and dress in all manner of way and supply abundance of food for upward of three week at the expiration of that period famine once more seem inevitable the third morning begin to dawn upon the unfortunate company after they stock of egg be exhaust they have now be without food for more than forty hour and be faint and deject when as though this desolate rock be really a land of miracle a man come run up to the encampment with the unexpected and joyful tiding that million of sea-cow have come on shore the crew climb over the ledge of rock that flank they tent and the sight of a shoal of manatee immediately beneath they gladden they heart these come in with the flood and be leave in the puddle between the broken rock of the cove this supply continue for two or three week the flesh be mere blubber and quite unfit for food for not a man could retain it on he stomach but the liver be excellent and on this they subsist in the meantime the carpenter with he gang have construct a boat and four of the man have adventure in she for tristan d'acunha in hope of ultimately extricate they fellow-sufferer from they perilous situation unfortunately the boat be lose -- whether carry away by the violence of the current that set in between the island or dash to piece against the breaker be never know for no vestige of the boat or crew be ever see before the manatee however begin to quit the shore a second boat be launch and in this a officer and some seaman make a second attempt and happily succeed in effect a landing after much labor on the island it be to this island that the boat 's crew of the blendenhall have beat they course and its principal inhabitant governor glass show they every mark of attention on learn the situation of the crew on inaccessible island he instantly launch he boat and unawed by consideration of personal danger hasten at the risk of he life to deliver he shipwrecked countryman from the calamity they have so long endure he make repeat trip surmount all difficulty and fortunately succeed in safely land they on he own island after they have be expose for nearly three month to the horror of a situation almost unparalleled in the record suffering of seafaring man after be hospitably treat by glass and he company for three month the survivor obtain a passage to the cape all except a young sailor name white who have form a attachment to one of the servant girl on board and who in all the misery which have be endure have be she constant protector and companion while gratitude on she part prevent she wish to leave he both choose to remain and be forthwith adopt as free citizen of the little community adventure of sergeant champe in he attempt to capture arnold the treason of general arnold the capture of andre and the intelligence receive by washington through he confidential agent in new york that many of he officer and especially a major-general whose name be give be connect with arnold could not fail to arouse the anxiety and vigilance of the commander-in-chief the moment he reach the army then under the order of major-general greene encamp in the vicinity of tappan he send for major lee who be post with the light troops some distance in front lee repair to headquarters and find washington in he marquee alone busily engage in write lee be request to take a seat and a bundle of papers lie on the table be give to he for perusal the purport of these tend to show that arnold be not alone in he base conspiracy but that a major-general whose name be not conceal be also implicate this officer have enjoy without interruption the confidence of the commander-in-chief nor do there exist a single reason in support of the accusation it altogether rest on the intelligence derive from the papers before he major lee be naturally shock at these suspicion and suggest that they be a invention of the enemy washington admit the plausibility of the suggestion but remark that he have the same confidence in arnold a few day before that he now place in the person accuse after some further conversation washington disclose a project which he have maturely revolve in he own mind i have send for you he remark to lee to learn if you have in you corps any individual capable of undertake a delicate and hazardous enterprise whoever come forward on this occasion will lay I under great obligation personally and in behalf of the united state i will reward he amply no time be to be lose he must proceed if possible this night my object be to probe to the bottom the affect suspicion suggest by the papers you have just read -- to seize arnold and by get he to save andre while my emissary be engage in prepare for the seizure of arnold the agency of other can be trace and the timely delivery of arnold to I will possibly put it in my power to restore the amiable and unfortunate andre to he friend my instruction be ready in which you will find express order that arnold be not to be hurt but that he be permit to escape if it can be prevent only by kill he as he public punishment be the only object in view this you can not too forcibly press upon the person who may engage in the enterprise and this fail not to do with my instruction be two letter to be deliver as order and here be some guinea to defray expense lee reply that as the first step to the enterprise be pretended desertion it would be difficult to find a commission officer who would undertake it he know however a sergeant-major of the cavalry name champe who be in all respects qualify for the delicate and adventurous project champe be a native of loudon county in virginium about twenty year of age he have enlist in 1776 be rather above the common size full of bone and muscle with a saturnine countenance grave thoughtful and taciturn of try courage and inflexible perseverance washington be satisfy with this description and exclaim that champe be the very man for the enterprise lee promise to persuade he to undertake it and take leave of the general return to the camp of the light corps which he reach about eight o'clock at night send instantly for the serjeant-major he inform he of the project of the commander-in-chief and urge upon he that by succeed in the capture and safe delivery of arnold he would not only gratify he general in the most acceptable manner but would be hail as the avenger of the reputation of the army stain by a foul and wicked perfidy and what could not but be highly please he would be the instrument of save the life of major andre champe listen with attention to the plan unfold by lee and reply that it meet he approbation even its partial success be likely to lead to great good as it would give relief to washington 's mind and do justice as he hope to suspect innocence champe add that he be not deter by the danger and difficulty to be encounter but by the ignominy of desertion consequent upon he enlist with the enemy it do not comport with he feeling to be even suspect of such a crime lee combate the objection of the sergeant with he usual address and finally subdue he prejudice so far that champe consent to undertake the enterprise the instruction of washington be then read to he and lee particularly caution he to exercise the utmost circumspection in deliver the letter and to take care to withhold from the two individual address under feigned name knowledge of each other he be further urge to bear in constant recollection the solemn injunction so pointedly express in the instruction of forbear to kill arnold in any event it now remain to arrange the mode of champe 's desertion for in order to be receive favorably by the british it be necessary that he should desert under circumstance which should assure they of he sincerity to cross the numerous patrol of horse and foot be no small difficulty which be now increase in consequence of the swarm of irregular who sometimes venture down to the very point of paulus hook with the hope of pick up booty evident as be the difficulty in the way no relief could be afford by major lee lest it might induce a belief that he be privy to the desertion which opinion get to the enemy would peril the life of champe the sergeant be leave to he own resource and management lee agree that in case champe 's departure should be discover before morning he would take care to delay pursuit as long as possible lee place in the hand of the sergeant some gold for he expense and enjoin it upon he to apprise he of he arrival in new york as soon as practicable bid the adventurous virginian farewell champe pull out he watch compare it with that of lee remind he of the importance of hold back pursuit which he be convince would take place during the night and which might be fatal as he would be oblige to adopt a zigzag course in order to avoid the patrol which would consume time it be now nearly eleven the sergeant return to camp and take he cloak valise and orderly-book he draw he horse from the picket and mount set out upon he novel expedition hardly half a hour have elapse when captain carne officer of the day wait on major lee and with considerable emotion tell he that one of the patrol have fall in with a dragoon who on be challenge put spur to he horse and escape though vigorously pursue lee complain of the interruption and pretend to be extremely fatigued answer as if he do not understand what have be say which compel the captain to repeat he remark who can the fellow be that be pursue say lee a countryman probably no reply the captain the patrol sufficiently distinguish he to know that he be a dragoon probably from the army if not certainly one of we own this idea be ridicule by lee as improbable as during the whole campaign but a single dragoon have desert from the legion carne be not convinced much apprehension be feel at that time of the effect of arnold 's example the captain withdraw to examine the squadron of horse whom he have order to assemble in pursuance of established usage on similar occasion he speedily return state that the deserter be know he be no less a person than the sergeant-major who be go off with he horse baggage arm and orderly-book sensibly affect at the suppose baseness of a soldier who be generally esteem carne add that he have order a party to prepare for pursuit and that he have come for write order from the major in order to gain time for champe lee express he belief that the sergeant have not desert but have merely take the liberty to leave camp upon private business or pleasure a example lee say too often set by the officer themselves destructive as it be of discipline oppose as it be to order and disastrous as it might prove to the corps in the course of the service some little delay be thus interpose carne begin to grow impatient at what seem the long-winded and unseasonable discourse it be at length announce that the pursue party be in readiness major lee direct a change in the officer give the command to cornet middleton he object be to add to the delay he know moreover that from the tenderness of he disposition middleton would be reluctant to do any personal injury to champe in the event of a pursuit within ten minute middleton appear to receive he order which be deliver to he make out in the customary form and sign by the major the direction be to pursue as far as could be do with safety sergeant champe who be suspect of desert to the enemy and of have take the road to paulus hook to bring he alive to camp that he might suffer in the presence of the army but to kill he

he son immediately set about put the machinery on board that accomplish they set sail for havana with a fair wind and for several day proceed on they course without any adventure of any kind one morning however a vessel be descry off they starboard quarter which after some hesitation the old man pronounce a pirate there be not much time allow they for doubt for the vessel soon salute they with a very agreeable whizzing of a eighteen pound shot under the stern that mean for we to heave to remark the old man then i guess we would better do it have not we say seth of course accordingly the betsy jenkin be bring up into the wind and she main-boom haul over to windward now boy say the old man as soon as the schooner come to a stand all we can do be to be as cool as possible and to

be help now get you pistol and see that they be surely load and have you knife ready but be sure and hide they so that the pirate shall see no show of resistance in a few moment all the arm which the schooner afford with the exception of one or two old musket be secure about the person of we down easter and they quietly await the come of the schooner one word more boy say the old man just as the pirate come round under the stern now watch every movement i make and be ready to jump the moment i speak as captain spinnet cease speak the pirate luff under the fisherman 's lee-quarter and in a moment more the latter 's deck be grace with the presence of a dozen as savage-looking mortal as eye ever rest upon be you the captain of this vessel demand the leader of the boarder as he approach the old man yes sir what be you cargo machinery for ingine nothing else ask the pirate with a search look at this moment captain spinnet 's eye catch what look like a sail off to the southward and eastward but no sign betray the discovery and while a brilliant idea shoot through he mind he hesitatingly reply : well there be a leetle something else ha and what be it why sir perhaps i have not ought to tell say captain spinnet counterfeit the most extreme perturbation you see 'twa give to I as a sort of trust a ' ' t would not be right for I to give up you can take any thing else you please for i s ` pose i can not help myself you be a honest codger at any rate say the pirate but if you would live ten minute longer just tell I what you have get on board and exactly where it lay the sight

under some of the box just forward of the cabin bulkhead but mr defoe do not suspect that any body would have think of look for it there perhaps so chuckle the pirate while he eye sparkle with delight and then turn to he own vessel he order all but three of he man to jump on board the yankee in a few moment the pirate have take off the hatch and in they haste to get at the silver dollar they forget all else but not so with spinnet he have he wit at work and no sooner have the last of the villain disappear below the hatchway than he turn to he boy now boy for we life seth you clap you knife across the fore throat and peak halyard and you john cut the main be quick now a ' the moment you have do it jump aboard the pirate andrew and sam you cast off the pirate 's grapling a ' then you jump

halyard be cut and the two grapling cast off at the same instant and as the heavy gaff come rattle down we five hero leap on board the pirate the moment the clipper feel at liberty she head swing off and before the astonished buccaneer could gain the deck of the fisherman they own vessel be a cable 's length to leeward sweeping gracefully away before the wind while the three man leave in charge be easily secure halloa there shout captain spinnet as the luckless pirate crowd around the lee gangway of they prize when you find they silver dollar just let we know will you half a dozen pistol shot be all the answer the old man get but they do he no harm and crowd up all sail he make for the vessel he have discover which lay dead to leeward of he and which he make out to be a large ship the clipper cut through the water like a dolphin and in a remarkably short space of time spinnet luff up under the ship 's stern and explain all that have happen the ship prove to be a east indiaman bind for charleston have all tell thirty man on board twenty of whom at once jump into the clipper and offer they service in help to take the pirate before dark captain spinnet be once more within hail distance of he own vessel and raise a trumpet to he mouth he shout : schooner ahoy will you quietly surrender yourselve prisoner if we come on board come and try it return the pirate captain as he brandish he cutlass above he head in a threatening manner which seem to indicate that he would fight to the last but that be he last moment for seth be crouch below the bulwark take deliberate aim along the barrel of a heavy rifle and as the bloody villain be in the act of turn to he man the sharp crack of seth spinnet 's weapon ring its fatal death-peal and the next moment the captain fall back into the arm of he man with a brace of bullet in he heart now shout the old man as he level the long pivot gun and seize a light match i 'll give you just five minute to make you mind up in and if you do not surrender i 'll blow every one of you into the other world the death of they captain and withal the sight of the pivot gun -- its peculiar property they know full well -- bring the pirate to they sens and they throw down they weapon and agree to give themselves up in two day from that time captain spinnet deliver he cargo safely in havana give the pirate into the hand of the civil authority and deliver the clipper up to the government in return for which he receive a sum of money sufficient for a independence during the remainder of he life as well as a very handsome medal from the government kenton the spy a secret expedition have be plan by col bowman of kentucky against a indian town on the little miama simon kenton and two young man name clark and montgomery be employ to proceed in advance and reconnoiter kenton be a native of fauquier county virginium where he be bear the fifteenth of may 1755 he companion be rove backwoodsman denizen of the wood and hunter like himself these adventurer set out in obedience to they order and reach the neighborhood of the indian village without be discover they examine it attentively and walk around the cabin during the night with perfect impunity have they return after reconnoiter the place they would have accomplish the object of they mission and avoid a heavy calamity they fall martyr however to they passion for horseflesh unfortunately during they nightly promenade they stumble upon a pound in which be a number of indian horse the temptation be not to be resist they severally seize a horse and mount but there still remain a number of fine animal and the adventurer cast longing linger look behind it be melancholy -- the idea of forsake such a goodly prize flesh and blood could not resist the temptation get scalp be nothing to the loss of such beautiful specimen of horseflesh they turn back and take several more the horse however seem indispose to change master and so much noise be make in the attempt to secure they that at last the thief be discover the cry ring through the village at once that the long-knife be steal they horse right before the door of they wigwam a great hubbub ensue and indian old and young squaw child and warrior all sally out with loud scream to save they property from the greedy spoiler kenton and he friend see that they have overshoot they mark and that they must ride for they life even in this extremity however they could not reconcile they mind to the surrender of a single horse which they have halter and while two of they ride in front and lead a great number of horse the other bring up the rear and ply he whip from right to left do not permit a single animal to lag behind in this manner they dash through the wood at a furious rate with the hue and cry after they until they course be suddenly stop by a impenetrable swamp here from necessity they pause a few minute and listen attentively hear no sound of pursuit they resume they course and skirt the swamp for some distance in the vain hope of cross it they bent they course in a straight direction to the ohio they ride during the whole night without rest a moment halt a brief space at daylight they continue they journey throughout the day and the whole of the follow night and by this uncommon celerity of movement they succeed in reach the northern bank of the ohio on the morning of the second day cross the river would now insure they safety but this be likely to prove a difficult undertaking and the close pursuit which they have reason to expect render it expedient to lose as little time as possible the wind be high and the river rough and boisterous it be determine that kenton should cross with the horse while clark and montgomery should construct a raft in order to transport they gun baggage and ammunition to the opposite shore the necessary preparation be soon make and kenton after force he horse into the river plunge in himself and swam by they side in a few minute the high wave completely overwhelm he and force he considerably below the horse who stem the current much more successfully than he the horse be leave to themselves turn about and make for the ohio shore where kenton be compel to follow they again he force they into the water and again they return to the same spot until kenton become so exhaust by repeat effort as to be unable to swim what be to be do that the indian would pursue they be certain that the horse would not and could not be make to cross the river in its present state be equally certain should they abandon they horse and cross on the raft or remain with they horse and brave the consequence the latter alternative be adopt unanimously death or captivity might be tolerate but the loss of such a beautiful lot of horse after work so hard for they be not to be think of for a moment should they move up or down the river or remain where they be the latter plan be adopt and a more indiscreet one could hardly have be imagine they suppose that the wind would fall at sunset and the river become sufficiently calm to admit of they passage and as it be think probable that the indian might be upon they before night it be determine to conceal they horse in a neighbor ravine while they should take they station in the adjoining wood the day pass away in tranquility but at night the wind blow harder than ever and the water become so rough that they would hardly have be able to cross on they raft as if totally infatuate they remain where they be until morning thus waste twenty-four hour of most precious time in idleness in the morning the wind abate and the river become calm but it be now too late they horse have become obstinate and intractible and positively and repeatedly refuse to take to the water they master at length determine to do what ought to have be do at first they severally resolve to mount a horse and make the best of they way down the river to louisville but they unconquerable reluctance to lose they horse overcome even this resolution instead of leave the ground instantly they go back upon they own trail in the vain effort to regain possession of the rest of they horse which have break from they in they last effort to drive they into the water they literally fall victim to they love for horseflesh they have scarcely ridden one hundred yard when kenton who have dismount hear a loud halloo he quickly behold three indian and one white man all well mount wish to give the alarm to he companion he raise he rifle take a steady aim at the breast of the foremost indian and draw the trigger he gun have become wet on the raft and flash the enemy be instantly alarmed and dash at he kenton take to he heel and be pursue by four horseman at full speed he instantly direct he step to the thickest part of the wood and have succeed as he think in baffle he pursuer when just as he be enter the wood a indian on horseback gallop up to he with such rapidity as to render flight useless the horseman ride up hold out he hand and call out brother brother in a tone of great affection kenton observe that if he gun would have make fire he would have brother he to he heart 's content but be totally unarmed he call out that he would surrender if they would give he quarter and good treatment promise be cheap with the indian who advance with extend hand and a withering grin upon he countenance which be intend for a smile of courtesy seize kenton 's hand and grasp it with violence kenton not like the manner of he captor raise he gun to knock he down when a indian who have follow he closely through the brushwood spring upon he back and pinion he arm to he side the one who have be grin so amiably then raise he by the hair and shake he until he tooth rattle while the rest of the party come up fall upon kenton with they tongue and ramrod until he think they would scold or beat he to death they be the owner of the horse which he have carry off and now take ample revenge for the loss of they property at every stroke of they ramrod over he head they would exclaim in a tone of strong indignation steal indian hoss hey they attention however be soon direct to montgomery who have hear the noise attend kenton 's capture very gallantly hasten up to he assistance while clark prudently take to he heel montgomery halt within gunshot and appear busy with the pan of he gun as if prepare to fire two indian instantly spring off in pursuit of he while the rest attend to kenton in a few minute kenton hear the crack of two rifle in quick succession follow by a halloo which announce the fate of he friend the indian return wave the bloody scalp of montgomery and with countenance and gesture which menace he with a similar fate they then proceed to secure they prisoner by pinion he with stout stick and fasten he with rope to a tree during the operation they cuff he from time to time with great heartiness and abuse he for a tief -- a hoss steal -- a rascal kenton remain in this painful position throughout the night look forward to certain death and most probably torture as soon as he should reach they town they rage against he display itself the next morning in rather a singular manner among the horse which kenton have take be a wild young colt wholly unbroken and with all he honor of mane and tail undocked upon he kenton be mount without saddle or bridle with he hand tie behind he and he foot fasten under the horse 's belly the country be rough and bushy and kenton have no means of protect he face from the bramble through which it be expect that the colt would dash as soon as the rider be firmly fasten to he back the colt be turn loose with a sudden lash but after curvett and capricole for awhile to the great distress of kenton but to the infinite amusement of the indian he appear to take compassion on he rider and fall into a line with the other horse avoid the bramble entirely and go on very well in this manner he ride through the day at night he be take from the horse and confine as before on the third day they come within a few mile of chillicothe here the party halted and send forward a messenger to prepare for they reception in a short time blackfish one of they chief arrive and regard kenton with a stern countenance thunder out in very good english : you have be steal horse yes sir do captain boone tell you to steal we horse no sir i do it of my own accord blackfish make no reply to this frank confession but brandish a hickory switch he apply it so briskly to kenton 's naked back and shoulder as to bring the blood freely and occasion acute pain thus alternately scold and beat kenton be conduct to the village all the inhabitant man woman and child run out to feast they eye with a sight of the prisoner and all down to the smallest child appear in a paroxysm of rage they whoop they yell they hoot they clap they hand and pour upon he a flood of abuse to which all that he have yet experience be courteous and civil with loud cry they demand that they prisoner should be tie to the stake the hint be instantly comply with but after be well thrash and torment he be release for the purpose of furnish further amusement to he captor -lrb- illustration : death of montgomery -rrb- early in the morning he behold the scalp of montgomery stretch upon a hoop and dry in the air before the door of one of they principal house he be lead out and order to run the gauntlet a row of boy woman and man extend to the distance of a quarter of a mile at the starting-place stand two grim warrior with butcher knife in they hand at the extremity of the line be a indian beat a drum and a few pace beyond the drum be the door of the council-house club switch hoe-handle and tomahawk be brandish along the whole line and as kenton see these formidable preparation the cold sweat stream from he pore the moment for start arrive the great drum at the door of the council-house be strike and kenton spring forward in the race he however avoid the row of he enemy and turn to the east draw the whole party in pursuit of he he double several time with great activity and at length observe a opening he dart through it and press forward to the council-house with a rapidity which leave he pursuer far behind one or two of the indian succeed in throw themselves between he and the goal and from these alone he receive a few blow but be much less injured than he could at first have suppose possible after the race be over a council to decide he fate be hold while he be hand over naked and bind to the care of a guard in the open air the deliberation commence every warrior sit in silence while a large warclub be pass round the circle those who be oppose to burn the prisoner on the spot be to pass the club in silence to the next warrior those in favor of burning be to strike the earth violently with the club before pass it a teller be appoint to count the vote this dignitary report that the opposition have prevail and that it be determine to take the prisoner to a indian town on mad river call waughcotomoco he fate be announce to he by a renegado white man who act as interpreter kenton ask what the indian intend to do with he upon reach waughcotomoco burn you reply the renegado with a ferocious oath after this pleasant assurance the laconic and scowling interpreter walk away the prisoner 's clothes be restore to he and he be permit to remain unbound thanks to the intimation of the interpreter he be aware of the fate in reserve for he and resolve that he would never be carry alive to waughcotomoco they route lay through a unprimed forest abound in thicket and undergrowth during the whole of the march kenton remain abstracted and silent often meditate a effort for the recovery of he liberty and as often shrink from the peril of the attempt at length he be arouse from he reverie by the indian firing off they gun and raise the shrill scalp-halloo the signal be soon answer and the deep roll of a drum be hear far in front announce to the unhappy prisoner that they be approach a indian town where the gauntlet certainly and perhaps the stake await he the idea of a repetition of the dreadful scene he have just encounter overcome he indecision and with a sudden and startling cry he spring into the bush and flee with the speed of a wild deer the pursuit be instant and keen some of he pursuer be on horseback some on foot but he be fly for he life the stake and the hot iron and the burning splinter be before he eye and he soon distance the swiftest hunter in pursuit but fate be against he at every turn think only of the enemy behind he forget that there might be a enemy before and he suddenly find that he have plunge into the center of a fresh party of horseman who have sally from the town at the firing of the gun and happen unfortunately to stumble upon the poor prisoner now make a last effort for freedom he heart sink at once from the ardor of hope to the lowest pit of despair and he be again halter and drive into captivity like a ox to the slaughter on the second day he arrive at waughcotomoco here he be again compel to run the gauntlet in which he be severely hurt immediately after this ceremony he be take to the council-house and all the warrior once more assemble to determine he fate he sit silent and dejected upon the floor of the cabin when the door of the council-house open and simon girty jame girty john ward and a indian come in with a woman as a prisoner together with seven child and seven scalp kenton be immediately remove from the council-house and the deliberation of the assembly be protracted to a very late hour in consequence of the arrival of the last-named party with a fresh drive of prisoner at length he be again summon to attend the council-house be inform that he fate be decide upon enter he be greet with a savage scowl which if he have still cherish a spark of hope would have completely extinguish it simon girty

betrothed of the die volunteer escape from a mexican quicksand by captain mayne reid a few day afterward another adventure befall I and i begin to think i be destine to become a hero among the mountain man a small party of the trader -- myself among the number -- have push forward ahead of the caravan we object be to arrive at santa f a day or two before the wagon in order to have every thing arrange with the governor for they entrance into the capital we take the route by the cimmaron we road for a hundred mile or so lay through a barren desert without game and almost without water the buffalo have all disappear and deer be equally scarce we have to content ourselves on the dry meat which we have bring from the settlement we be in the desert of the artemisia now and then we could see a stray antelope bound away before we but keep far out of range they too seem to be unusually shy on the third day after leave the caravan as we be ride near the cimmaron i think i observe a pronged head disappear behind a swell in the prairie my companion be skeptical and none of they would go with I so wheeling out of trail i start alone one of they -- for gode be behind -- keep charge of my dog as i do not choose to take he with I lest he might alarm the antelope my horse be fresh and willing and whether successful or not i know i could easily overtake the party by camping-time i strike directly toward the spot where i have see the object it appear to be only half a mile or so from the trail it prove more distant -- a common illusion in the crystal atmosphere of these upland region a curiously form ridge traverse the plain from east to west a thicket of cactus cover part of its summit toward the thicket i direct myself i dismounted at the bottom of the slope and lead my horse silently up among the cactus plant tie he to one of they branch i then cautiously creep through the thorny leaf toward the point where i fancied i have see the game to my joy not one antelope but a brace of those beautiful animal be quietly grazing beyond but alas too far off for the carry of my rifle they be fully three hundred yard distant upon a smooth grassy slope there be not even a sage bush to cover I should i attempt to approach they what be to be do i lay for several minute think over the different trick know in hunter craft for take the antelope should i imitate they call should i hoist my handkerchief and try to lure they up i see that they be too shy for at short interval they throw up they graceful head and look inquiringly around they i remember the red blanket on my saddle i could display this upon the cactus-bush perhaps it would attract they i have no alternative and be turn to go back for the blanket when all at once my eye rest upon a clay-colored line run across the prairie beyond where the animal be feed it be a break in the plain a buffalo road or the channel of a _ arroyo _ in either case the very cover i want for the animal be not a hundred yard from it and be get still nearer to it as they feed creep back out of the thicket i run along the side of the slope toward a point where i have notice that the ridge be depress to the prairie level here to my surprise i find myself on the bank of a broad arroyo whose water clear and shallow run slowly over a bed of sand and gypsum the bank be low not over three foot above the surface of the water except where the ridge impinge upon the stream here there be a high bluff and hurry around its base i enter the channel and commence wade upward as i have anticipate i soon come to a bend where the stream after run parallel to the ridge sweep around and canon through it at this place i stop and look cautiously over the bank the antelope have approach within less than rifle range of the arroyo but they be yet far above my position they be still quietly feed and unconscious of danger i again bent down and wade on it be a difficult task proceeding in this way the bed of the creek be soft and yielding and i be compel to tread slowly and silently lest i should alarm the game but i be cheer in my exertion by the prospect of fresh venison for my supper after a weary drag of several hundred yard i come opposite to a small clump of wormwood bush grow out of the bank i may be high enough thought i these will serve for cover i raise my body gradually until i could see through the leaf i be in the right spot i bring my rifle to a level sight for the heart of the buck and fire the animal leap from the ground and fall back lifeless i be about to rush forward and secure my prize when i observe the doe instead of run off as i expect go up to she fall partner and press she taper nose to he body she be not more than twenty yard from I and i could plainly see that she look be one of inquiry and bewilderment all at once she seem to comprehend the fatal truth and throw back she head commence utter the most piteous cry at the same time run in circle around the body i stand waver between two mind my first impulse have be to reload and kill the doe but she plaintive voice enter my heart disarm I of all hostile intention have i dream of witness this painful spectacle i should not have leave the trail but the mischief be now do i have worse than kill she thought i it will be better to despatch she at once actuate by these principle of common but to she fatal humanity i rest the butt of my rifle and reload with a falter hand i again level the piece and fire : my nerve be steady enough to do the work when the smoke float aside i could see the little creature bleeding upon the grass -- she head rest upon the body of she murder mate i shoulder my rifle and be about to move forward when to my astonishment i find that i be catch by the foot i be hold firmly as if my leg have be hold in a vice i make a effort to extricate myself another more violent and equally unsuccessful and with a third i lose my balance and fall back upon the water half suffocate i regain my upright position but only to find that i be hold as fast as ever again i struggle to free my limb i could neither move they backward nor forward -- to the right nor the left and i become sensible that i be gradually go down then the fearful truth flash upon I -- i be sink in a quicksand a feeling of horror come over I i renew my effort with the energy of desperation i lean to one side then to the other almost wrenching my knee from they socket my foot remain as fast as ever i could not move they a inch the soft clingy sand already overtop my horse-skin boot wedge they around my ankle so that i be unable to draw they off and i could feel that i be still sink slowly but surely as though some subterraneous monster be leisurely drag I down this very think cause I a fresh thrill of horror and i call aloud for help to whom there be no one within mile of I -- no living thing yes the neigh of my horse answer I from the hill mock I in my despair i bent forward as well as my constrain position would permit and with frenzied finger commence tear up the sand i could barely reach the surface and the little hollow i be able to make fill up almost as soon as it have be form a thought occur to I my rifle might support I place horizontally i look for it it be not to be see it have sink beneath the sand could i throw my body flat and prevent myself from sink deeper no the water be two foot in depth i should drown at once this last hope leave I as soon as form i could think of no plan to save myself i could make no further effort a strange stupor seize upon I my very thought become paralyzed i know that i be go mad for a moment i be mad after a interval my sens return i make a effort to rouse my mind from its paralysis in order that i might meet death which i now believe to be certain as a man should i stand erect my eye have sink to the prairie level and rest upon the still bleeding victim of my cruelty my heart smite I at the sight be i suffer a retribution of god with humble and penitent thought i turn my face to heaven almost dread that some sign of omnipotent anger would scowl upon I from above but no the sun be shine as bright as ever and the blue canopy of the world be without a cloud i gaze upward with earnestness know only to the heart of man in position of peril like mine as i continue to look up a object attract my attention against the sky i distinguish the outline of a large bird i know it to be the obscene bird of the plain the buzzard vulture whence have it come who know far beyond the reach of human eye it have see or scented the slaughter antelope and on broad silent wing be now descend to the feast of death presently another and another and many other mottle the blue field of the heaven curve and wheeling silently earthward then the foremost swoop down upon the bank and after gaze around for a moment flap off toward its prey in a few seconds the prairie be black with filthy bird who clamber over the dead antelope and beat they wing against each other while they tear out the eye of the quarry with they fetid beak and now come gaunt wolf sneak and hungry steal out of the cactus thicket and lope coward-like over the green swell of the prairie these after a battle drive away the vulture and tear up the prey all the while growl and snap vengefully at each other thank heaven i shall at least be save from this i be soon relieve from the sight my eye have sink below the level of the bank i have look my last on the fair green earth i could now see only the clayey wall that contain the river and the water that run unheeding past I once more i fix my gaze upon the sky and with prayerful heart endeavor to resign myself to my fate in spite of my endeavor to be calm the memory of earthly pleasure and friend and home come over I cause I at interval to break into wild paroxysm and make fresh though fruitless struggle and i be attract by the neighing of my horse a thought enter my mind fill I with fresh hope perhaps my horse -- i lose not a moment i raise my voice to its highest pitch and call the animal by name i know that he would come at my call i have tie he but slightly the cactus limb would snap off i call again repeat word that be well know to he i listen with a bound heart for a moment there be silence then i hear the quick sound of he hoof as though the animal be rear and struggle to free himself then i could distinguish the stroke of he heel in a measure and regular gallop nearer come the sound nearer and clearer until the gallant brute bound out on the bank above I there he halt and fling back he toss mane utter a shrill neigh he be bewildered and look upon every side snort loudly i know that have once see I he would not stop until he have press he nose against my cheek -- for this be he usual custom hold out my hand i again utter the magic word now look downward he perceive I and stretch himself spring out into the channel the next moment i hold he by the bridle there be no time to be lose i be still go down and my arm-pit be fast near the surface of the quicksand i catch the lariat and pass it under the saddle-girths fasten it in a tight firm knot i then loop the trail end make it secure around my body i have leave enough of the rope between the bit-ring and the girth to enable I to check and guide the animal in case the drag upon my body should be too painful all this while the dumb brute seem to comprehend what i be about he know too the nature of the ground on which he stand for during the operation he keep lift he foot alternately to prevent himself from sink my arrangement be at length complete and with a feeling of terrible anxiety i give my horse the signal to move forward instead of go off with a start the intelligent animal step away slowly as though he understand my situation the lariat tighten i feel my body move and the next moment experience a wild delight a feeling i can not describe as i find myself drag out of the sand i spring to my foot with a shout of joy i rush up to my steed and throw my arm around he neck kiss he with as much delight as i would have kiss a beautiful girl he answer my embrace with a low whimper that tell I that i be understand i look for my rifle fortunately it have not sink deeply and i soon find it my boot be behind I but i staid not to look for they be smite with a wholesome dread of the place where i have leave they i be not long in retreat from the arroyo and mount i gallop back to the trail it be sundown before i reach the camp where i be meet by the inquiry of my companion i answer all they question by relate my adventure and for that night i be again the hero of the camp-fire chase by a rhinoceros on the 22d say mr cumming order my man to move on toward a fountain in the center of the plain i ride forth with ruyter and hold east through a grove of lofty and wide-spreading mimosa most of which be more or less damage by the gigantic strength of a troop of elephant which have pass there about twelve month before have proceed about two mile with large herd of game on every side i observe a crusty-looking old bull borl or black rhinoceros cock he ear one hundred yard in advance he have not observe we and soon after he walk slowly toward we and stand broadside to eat some wait-a-bit thorn within fifty yard of I i fire from my saddle and send a bullet in behind he shoulder upon which he rush forward about one hundred yard in tremendous consternation blow like a grampus and then stand look about he presently he make off i follow but find it hard to come up with he when i overtake he i see the blood run freely from he wound -lrb- illustration : escape from the rhinoceros -rrb- the chase lead through a large herd of blue wildebeest zebra and springbok which gaze at we in utter amazement at length i fire my second barrel but my horse be fidgety and i miss i continue ride alongside of he expect in my ignorance that at length he would come to bay which rhinocerose never do when suddenly he fall flat on he broadside on the ground but recover he foot resume he course as if nothing have happen become at last annoyed at the length of the chase as i wish to keep my horse fresh for the elephant and be indifferent whether i get the rhinoceros or not as i observe that he horn be completely wear down with age and the violence of he disposition i determine to bring matter to a crisis so spur my horse i dash ahead and ride right in he path upon this the hideous monster instantly charge I in the most resolute manner blow loudly through he nostril and although i quickly wheel about to my leave he follow I at such a furious pace for several hundred yard with he horrid horny snout within a few yard of my horse 's tail that my little bushman who be look on in great alarm think he master 's destruction inevitable it be certainly a very near thing my horse be extremely afraid and exert he utmost energy on the occasion the rhinoceros however wheel about and continue he former course and i be perfectly satisfy with the interview which i have already enjoy with he have no desire to cultivate he acquaintance any further and accordingly make for camp burning

jb jone the hunter have be out and be overtake by night and be lose in the darkness ere long a change come over the scene about two-third of the distance around the verge of the horizon a faint light appear resemble the scene when a dense curtain of cloud hang overhead and the ray of the morning sun steal under the edge of the thick vapor but the star could be see and the only appearance of cloud be immediately above the circle of light in a very few minute the terrible truth flash upon the mind of glenn the dim light along the horizon be change to a approach flame column of smoke could be see roll upward while the fire beneath impart a lurid glare to they the wind blow more fiercely and the fire approach from almost every quarter with the swiftness of a race-horse the darkened vault above become gradually illuminate with a crimson reflection and the young man shudder with the horrid apprehension of be burnt alive it be madness to proceed in a direction that must inevitably hasten they fate the fire extend in one unbroken line from leave to right and in front of they and they now turn in a course which seem to place the greatest distance between they and the furious element ever and anon a frightened deer or elk leap past and the hound no longer notice they but remain close to the horse the flame come on with awful rapidity the light increase in brilliance and object be distinguishable far over the prairie a red glare could be see on the side of the deer as they bound over the tall dry grass which be soon to be no longer a refuge for they the young man hear a low continued roar that increase every moment in loudness and look in the direction whence they suppose it proceed they observe a immense dark move mass the nature of which they could not divine but it threaten to annihilate every thing that oppose it while gaze at this additional source of danger the horse blind by the surround light plunge into a deep ditch that the rain have wash in the rich soil neither man nor horse fortunately be injure and after several ineffectual effort to extricate themselves they here resolve to await the come of the fire ringwood and jowler whine fearfully on the verge of the ditch for a instant and then spring in and crouch tremble at the foot of they master the next instant the dark thunder mass pass overhead be nothing less than a immense herd of buffalo drive forward by the flame the horse bow they head as if a thunderbolt be pass the fire and the heaven be hide from view and the roar above resemble the rush of mighty water when the last animal have spring over the chasm glenn thank the propitious accident that thus providentially prevent he from be crush to atom and utter a prayer to heaven that he might by a like means be rescue from the fiery ordeal that await he it now occur to he that the accumulation of weed and grass in the chasm which save they from injury when fall in would prove fatal when the flame arrive and after grope some distance along the trench he find the depth diminish but the fire be not three hundred pace distant he heart sink within he but when on the eve of return to he former position with a resolution to remove as much of the combustible matter as possible a gleam of joy spread over he feature as cast a glance in a contrary direction from that they have recently pursue he behold the identical mound he have ascend before dark and from which he unsteady and erratic ride in the night have fortunately prevent a distant separation they now lead they horse forth and mount without delay whip forward for life or death could the summit of the mound be attain they be in safety -- for there the soil be not encumber with decayed vegetation -- and they spur they animal to the top of they speed it be a noble sight to see the majestic white steed fly toward the mound with the velocity of the wind while the diminutive pony miraculously follow in the wake like a inseparable shadow the career flame be not far behind and when the horse gain the summit and glenn look back the fire have reach the base fortunately that portion of the plain over which the scathing element have spend its fury be the direction the party should pursue in retrace they way homeward the light dry grass have be soon consume and the earth now wear a blacken appearance and be as smooth as if vegetation have never cover the surface as the party ride briskly along -lrb- and the pony now keep in advance -rrb- the horse ' hoof rattle as loudly on the baked ground as if it be a plank floor the reflection of the fire in the distance still throw a lurid glare over the extended heath as the smoke gradually ascend object could be discern at a great distance and occasionally a half-roasted deer or elk be see plunge about drive to madness by its torture and frequently they find the dead body of smaller animal that could find no safety in flight the captain 's story at the close of the war with great britain in the year 1815 i take command of the brig gange own by ebenezer sage esq then a wealthy and respectable merchant at middleton i sail from new york on the 20th of August bind for turk 's island for a cargo of salt and on the 5th of September i arrive at my destine port it be the season for hurricane in that region it be think most safe for we to go around into a small harbor on the south side of the island in order to reach this harbor we have to go through a narrow crooked channel with rock and dangerous reef on every side but with a skillful pilot we make we way through safely and come to anchor on the next day we commence take in we cargo of salt on the 9th of September a day that i shall ever remember my pilot come to I somewhat agitate and say that there be strong indication of a approach hurricane and advise I to make all possible preparation to encounter it we therefore quit take in salt and make every thing about the ship snug as possible at twelve o'clock midnight the gale commence as the pilot have anticipate and continue to increase until six in the morning at which time it become most terrific every blast grow more and more violent until we cable all part and we be leave to the mercy of the gale it blow directly from the land we get the ship before the wind as the only course we could pursue in do this we be well aware of the dangerous channel we have to pass and my only hope be that we might get to sea clear of the land but this hope soon vanish in about twenty minute after we start the ship strike a rock which knock off she rudder and set she leak badly the rudder be go we of course have no control of the vessel she come around side to the wind and at this moment she mainmast be blow over the side we at once cut away the rigging that attach it to the hull and it float off and the foremast still stand the ship swing off again a little before the wind all hand be soon set to pump but we find that in spite of all we exertion the water rapidly increase in the hold the appearance of the element at this time almost baffle description so violent be they commotion that no one could stand without grasp something for support not a word could be hear that be utter i have to communicate every order by means of sign while i stand on the quarter-deck holding on to the cabin door in this situation i endeavored calmly to reflect here we be as we suppose on the open ocean -- in a tempest of unparalleled violence -- with no rudder -- one mast go -- boat all lose -- and the ship settle under we from the weight of water in the hold the sky be black almost as midnight above we and the wave beneath and around and over we -- for they dash at quick interval like so many fury across the devoted ship -- seem ready to drown we ere we sink into they dread abyss the voice of the gale as it howl through the rig mingle with the creaking of timber and the roar of water as they strike the vessel be a awful wail as it appear to I over body devote to almost instant death destruction seem inevitable it would not to all human calculation be protracted even a hour we be sink down down -- inch follow inch of the fate vessel in rapid succession -- down remedilessly to we grave in the madden sea amid the monster of its great deep i descend to the cabin and attempt calmly to surrender myself to he who make I my thought -- oh how they fly at once to my wife and child at home i attempt to pray and for the first time since i have leave my pious mother i _ do _ pray -- for my family first -- and oh how fervently in close my supplication i besought for myself pardon and forgiveness through he who be ever ready to hear the penitent the water have now get on to the cabin floor i therefore place myself on the stair lead on deck shortly after this the wind shift and in a few minute the ship strike with a tremendous crash i rush on deck and at once see rock fifty foot high and perpendicular but a few foot from the after part of the ship which now soon fill with water and roll over toward the land at its fore part and at the only point where we could by any possibility have be save the rock descend gradually and the foremast lean over they not a moment be to be lose we crawl up the rigging and swing ourselves on to the rock make we way up the precipice on we hand and foot and reach the summit at once seek in hole in the rock shelter from the tempest which still continue so violent that no one could stand upon he foot we escape happen about ten o'clock in the morning at five in the afternoon the gale have so moderate that we could stand we then crawl out from we hide place and assemble together find that all be safe except my brother who be mate of the ship and he we suppose be lose in attempt to get on shore we soon as be very natural approach the precipice to learn the fate of the ship nothing be to be see of she but plank timber spar sail and rig all in one confused broken mass and wash up against the rock it be truly to we a most deplorable spectacle we have no resource in the vessel not a thing of value be leave as night be approach we now walk along before the wind toward the south part of the island and there find by the side of a huge pile of rock a hole or sort of cave about eight foot square and five foot high here we all crawl in wet and cold but with heart grateful to god for we wonderful preservation as we be packed very close to each other the natural warmth of we body soon relieve we considerably from the sensation of wetness and cold and we pass the night as comfortably as we varied misery would allow morning come and we leave we cave the gale have much abate and we could see some distance we find that we be on a small desolate island about a mile long half a mile wide and about ten mile from the place we leave the day before it be cover mostly with huge rock with here and there a small patch of soil overrun with prickly pear and inhabit by no living animal except lizard and small poisonous snake we have be now over twenty-four hour without food or water of the latter article on search around we find a little in the hollow on the rock but it be about half salt have be make so by the spray which the gale have throw from the ocean quite over the island and the more we drink of it the more thirsty we become as to food we be soon convince that this be out of the question toward night we find a cask near the beach standing on one end with one head out which hold about two gallon of water that have rain in this be not salt but smell badly we however scoop out with we hand about one half of it and leave what remain for the next day we get some relief from this and then we return to we former resting-place for the night when we crawl out on the follow morning we find that the weather have become fine and clear we could see vessel pass at a short distance from we but have no means of make any signal nor any for leave the shore this be the third day of we distress and privation some of we begin to suffer much from hunger other suffer more from thirst we however cheer each other with the faint hope that some thing would appear for we relief we wander about as we have do the day before seek for water but find none we have nothing to dig with but we hand these we use but in vain no water appear toward night we go to the cask and drink what remain there we then return again to we cave for the night all much exhaust and low-spirited despair begin to shade every countenance very little be say and we pass the night well as we could press by hunger and parch by thirst morning come and again we all leave we shelter the weather continue fine and clear the man again separate in search of water but be myself very feeble i take my seat on some rock near the cave at a point from whence i could see every thing move on the water and with a linger hope that something would appear for we deliverance about ten o'clock a object loom up in the distance i think it be a boat but could not at once tell it approach and soon i see it distinctly it _ be _ a boat with one sail and be steer directly for a low beach not far from where i be seat my feeling at this moment be so overcome that i lose all power of utterance i could not at first rise from the rock my strength however shortly return a little and i get up and make all the noise i could some of the man near at hand hear I and come up i at once pointed to the boat which be now near the shore they shout to they companion and we be all soon at the beach near where the boat be land a black man get out of the boat and come to I with a letter -- but before read it i besought he for water to my surprise he have none but instead of it have a bottle of rum and a small bag of biscuit i tell he to bring these on shore and take they i give each of my crew a swallow of the rum and a biscuit this have the effect of moisten a little we parched mouth and tongue i then open the letter it be from my warm and faithful friend mr tucker of turk 's island and it read as follow omit my name : to captain -- or any other unfortunate person or person who may be find on any of the neighbor island come as many as can safely and should any be leave i will find means to convey those that remain the two man who come in the boat hesitate about take all of we at once as we be nine in number and with themselves might overload the boat we could not however bear the thought of leave any behind we therefore all get aboard shove off and make sail we have a fair wind and a smooth sea and at six o'clock arrive safely at the harbor we have leave many person run to the beach to meet we as we land and among the rest be we deliverer mr tucker the next morning my friend and deliverer give I a brief history of what have take place with himself and he fellow-inhabitant on the island during the gale many of they house be level to the ground and some be blow into the sea they cistern they only dependence for water be mostly destroy even the cannon mount on a small battery be dismount and most of the inhabitant be in great distress every vessel and boat that float about the island be blow to sea or destroy out of the twenty vessel that be at the island on which mr tucker live when the gale come on only six be hear ever from after five out of these six be wreck on adjacent island and every soul on board three of these perish the gale be say by the oldest inhabitant to be the most violent ever know in that region we remain on the island ten or twelve day and then take passage in a ship bind for new york reach that city safely on the last of November a tussle with a wildcat in 1781 lexington ky be only a cluster of cabin one of which near the spot where the courthouse now stand be

disengage she from he side she long sharp tooth be fasten between he rib and he effort serve but to enrage she the more see he blood flow very copiously from the numerous wound in he side he become seriously alarmed and not know what else to do he throw himself upon the edge of the table and press she against the sharp corner with the whole weight of he body the cat now begin to utter the most wild and discordant cry and mckinley at the same time lift up he voice in concert the two together send forth note so doleful as to alarm the whole town woman who be generally the first to hear and spread news be now the first to come to mckinley 's assistance but so strange and unearthly be the harmony within the schoolhouse that they hesitate long before venture to enter at length the boldest of they rush in and see poor mckinley bend ever the corner of the table she at first suppose that he be labor under a severe fit of the colic but quickly perceive the cat which be now in the agony of death she scream out why good heaven mr mckinley what be the matter i have catch a cat madam he gravely reply turn round while the sweat stream from he face under the mingled operation of fright

every onset they be drive back the ammunition for the defense of the fort be deposit in the blockhouse and there have not be time to remove it before the indian approach on the afternoon of the second day of the siege the powder of the fort be nearly exhaust and no alternative remain but for some one to pass through the enemy 's fire to the blockhouse in order to obtain a supply when sila zane make the proposition to the man ask if any one would undertake the hazardous enterprise all at first be silent after look at one another for some time a young man step forward and say he would undertake the errand immediately half a dozen offer they service in the dangerous enterprise while they be dispute as to who should go elizabeth sister of the zane come forward and declare that she would go for

terrific scene which take place on the 14th of August 1851 at the house of don diego garcium a old nobleman who reside in the vicinity of that capital : the night be dark and tempestuous the rain pour down in torrent and induce the night-watch who have be reinforce since the recent augmentation of crime in the environs of the capital to keep close to they quarter the road be completely desert and at long interval only the shadow of a human figure flit past the huge portal of don diego 's mansion in anxious haste toward its habitation juan munoz the don 's old valet have be send to this city by he master and be now make the best of he way home he errand to the capital have be to procure some medicine which he master have be order to take he be at the time violently afflict by the gout juan as we have say be pick he way as best he could through the deluged street and road when just as he come in sight of the mansion he hear the voice of a number of man behind he and suppose they to be a party of he fellow-servant who have be send in search of he since he have be much later than he expect to be he draw back into a open recess to await they approach he discover that he be deceive in he expectation the man be stranger to he or at least he do not know they voice but while pass he he plainly hear the name of he master pronounce by one of they number and step forward he ask if they wish to see don diego that night the man seem perfectly stupefy by he sudden apparition but they soon recover from they surprise and after ascertain that he be alone he be politely ask to go before they and show the way scarcely have he proceed a dozen yard when a violent blow on the head lay he prostrate a knife be then twice thrust into he breast and the lifeless body be hurl into the middle of the road it be close upon midnight when the wife of don diego while tend she sick husband be startle by a noise from the adjoining room she immediately ring the bell and be answer by the major domo the only servant who have not retire to rest be determine to await the return of juan as he enter the door lead to the ante-chamber be also quickly open and on the threshold appear five mask man who be evidently unprepared to find more than one inmate in the sick chamber quick as think the major-domo attempt to reach the bell-rope that by a violent alarm he might awake the sleeper and obtain they aid but quicker even than he be the leader of the mask band who seize a pistol from he belt and with unerring aim discharge it at the devoted servant there be a faint cry : the old servant stretch out he hand for support and then with a heavy groan fall to the floor where death close he eye this unexpected catastrophe seem to spur on the robber to instant work while one man be post at each door the three other insist upon be inform by don diego where he keep he money and valuable but the sick old man have sink into so complete a lethargy by the dreadful event which have pass under he eye that he be unable to answer they as rapidity of movement be however render peremptory to insure the safety of the band the chief address the donna for the same purpose in answer to which she evince but little reluctance and bid they to follow she the robber at once declare they readiness and after pass along the corridor enter the dining saloon where the donna point out a large box which she say contain the plate here another difficulty arise the box which in reality contain the plate be securely lock and the key nowhere to be find anxious to get at the rich booty the leader with a angry imprecation put the muzzle of he heavy horse-pistol to the lock a sharp report follow and the lid thus unceremoniously open offer no further obstacle to the rapacity of the invader donna ignazium take advantage of the joyful excitement of the band and leave the room to descend into the lower story of the mansion where she hurry summons at the chamber door of the servant be readily respond to by they as they have already be awake by the double report in they master 's apartment the tempest which have rage so fearfully have meanwhile cease the torrent of rain be follow by a clear night the fury of the element appear as though in momentary rest they would gather strength for a fresh outbreak -- nature 's wrath have give place to the wrath of man the inanimate body of juan munoz have be discover by a patrolling body of soldiery who carry it to the guard-house the stab be find to be of minor consequence and the blow on the head although it have cause a very severe wound have occasion only a temporary loss of consciousness it must be bear in mind that two hour have nearly elapse between the assault upon munoz and the entrance into the house by the robber which time have probably be spend by they in various effort to gain access strong restorative judiciously apply soon bring back animation and shortly afterward munoz could give a confused narrative of what have befall he the officer on duty at once see through the scheme and give order to proceed to the mansion of don diego which they reach at the precise moment when donna ignazium with a armed body of she own servant be lead they to the dining saloon the summons of the officer at the front door be follow by a dead silence on the part of the robber : but when they hear the measure tramp of the soldiery on the stair-case they seek for means of instant flight this however have be provide for a portion of the military have surround the house while the other reinforce by the servant approach the only chance then leave to the brigand be to cut they way through or sell they life as dearly as possible in a instant the huge oaken door of the saloon be close and bar the light be extinguish the window open and everything make ready for the last desperate chance fortune favor they for the soldiery not anticipate a leap of they enemy from the high window withdraw they sentinel from there in order to make they guard the side and rear outlet of the mansion two of the bold ruffian have already make they descent by means of tablecloth tie together when the alarm be give the soldier rush to the spot -- a third robber be cling to the frail chance for life and be rapidly descend but a well-directed shot bereft he of strength and after a few frantic effort to retain he hold he fall heavily to the ground he two comrade make a firm stand : but vain be they boldness against the number of assailant and in a few moment they fall grievously wound into the hand of the victor two more only remain of this desperate band and the fact of they be shield by strong bolt massive wall render they no insignificant enemy ladder be place against the window but the true aim of the keen-eyed brigand make four successive shot tell with appalling effect since each of they lay low one of they assailant at last a attack upon the door be resolve upon and soon the heavy blow of the ponderous axe resound from the massive panel one door give way : there be a stunning crash follow by report of fire-arm cry of agony and the dull sound of fall victim again the number be successful but in this instance the victim know no mercy and when at last the tumult cease the mutilate corpse of the two brigand could hardly be recognize from three of they late assailant the man who have be shoot while descend from the window be find to be quite dead the ball have enter he heart the two survivor be subsequently identify as ramon gomez and pietro vaga better know as the hunchback two of the most notorious highwayman and burglar for whose apprehension a large reward have be offer shipwreck of the monticello jv brown esq editor of the lake superior journal who be on board the monticello give the follow graphic account of the disaster : it become we painful duty to record the most perilous shipwreck that have ever occur on lake superior and have be a passenger on board the monticello at the time we be enable to give all the particulars in relation to the loss of the vessel and the hardship of the passenger and crew we go on board the ontonagon on the afternoon of the 22d September 1851 on she return from fond du lac she leave the river at half-past five o'clock bind for the sault with about one hundred person twenty ton of copper from the minnesota mine and a few barrel of fish from la pointe and in come out of the harbor one of the wheel strike a float log very heavily and it be suppose to have loosen the packing box around one of the shaft -- she lay on the bar a few minute on she way out but the sea at that time be light and we can not think it possible that she spring a leak from the effect of the slight pound on the light sand -lrb- illustration : loss of the monticello -rrb- we have be out about half a hour when the fireman discover the water rise around the floor of the engine they communicate the fact to capt wilson and it be make know to the passenger but the leak be not think to be serious and create but very little alarm the pump be put into operation and on examination the captain and engineer seem confident that the pump would keep she clear till we could run down to eagle harbor a distance of sixty mile but it be soon discover that the water be fast gain on the pump and preparation be make immediately for raise water by means of barrel and bucket the wind be blow at first from the westward but soon change to the northwest -- it be fresh but fair and aid by sail and all the steam that it be prudent to carry she come on at a rapid rate still keep on she course in hope to make the harbor the passenger and crew work steadily at the pump but the water continue gradually to gain on they the most of the copper and all the other freight be throw overboard with a hearty good will -- the wealth of the mine seeming of but little consequence at such a time every possible means be employ to raise water and every passenger assist to the utmost of he strength and ability to keep the sink vessel afloat two pump three barrel and a half dozen pail be constantly in motion and still the water gain steadily but surely on they effort we have now be out about three hour the wind and wave constantly increase when it be find there be little hope of reach eagle harbor the water have rise nearly to the fire and be fast gain ground notwithstanding all the exertion of those on board after remain on she course a few minute longer the boat be head toward the land and new effort be put forth to encourage all on board to assist at the pump and barrel by this time there be three foot of water or more in the hold and she move and roll heavily through the sea the wood have to be shift from one side of the vessel to the other to keep she in trim one fire after the other be roll into the water and it become evident to the most hopeful that they would be extinguish entirely and it be still think the wind would take she in under the land even if the steam should fail it be not long before the fire be report out -- the engine work lazily for a short time the clicking of the valve become faint and less frequent and finally like the die struggle of a strong man it cease altogether wearied with incessant exertion at the pump many give out and retire to the cabin seem to prefer rest to escape from the watery grave into which they be fast sink some be even force into the hold to fill barrel and pail and new effort be put forth to induce the suffering crew and passenger to hold out a hour longer with the assurance that we could reach land in that time with this hope and that influence which strong mind always exert under such circumstance many take hold again of the pump with a kind of desperate exertion and for a time they even gain on the water there be another circumstance which encourage they to work the boat be careen on one side by the sail one of the fire be partially out of water and a fire be kindle again by means of dry wood oil and the most combustible matter the boat afford this not only assist we progress toward the land but it stimulate the passenger to new exertion the fire be in this way kindle and extinguish several time and all feel that they owe much to the irregular exertion of the engine for they preservation especially as the wind for some time die away so as to scarcely fill the sail for two long hour the water-logged vessel drift in before sounding could be have in this region it be well know that the coast be rocky and dangerous for landing and the night be too dark to enable the pilot to distinguish one place from another a heavy sea roll in upon the shore and it seem like madness to attempt a landing under such circumstance accordingly captain wilson decide to come to anchor and endeavor to keep the vessel afloat till daylight and as soon as we come into six fathom water the anchor be let go and she swing round heavily in the furious wave that threaten speedily to complete the work of destruction several insane attempt have be thwart for cut away the boat which have they succeed we doubt not would have prove certain destruction to nine-tenth of all on board for if the boat have not be swamp at once they would undoubtedly have be dash to piece on the rock-bound shore leave other to swim ashore as best they might the pump and bail be continue with the last energy of a noble crew -- two or three hour more would bring the light of another day and it be understand that a attempt would be make to land as soon as it be daylight the time wear tediously away and the passenger and crew be too much exhaust to keep down the water and still they labor to do so with what strength they have leave some time before daylight the wind change to the north and commence blow hard directly upon the shore and the sea increase rapidly oftentimes wash into the hatchway where the man be at work bailing and it become evident to all that the vessel could be keep afloat only for a short time longer at five o'clock it be light enough to see that it be a bold rocky shore against which the wave dash high and furiously but it be too late to choose a place for landing and the captain order the anchor raise she bow swing around to the east and in fifteen minute she strike heavily on the solid rock about three hundred yard from the shore the man keep at work pump and bail till she strike when the wave at once sweep in upon she deck and fill the hold the largest of the two yawl happen to be on the lee side and it be soon lower away and with a line long enough to reach the land the first and second mate messr lucas and barney wt westbrook and one of the crew start for the shore the line be make fast to a tree and they commence the far more difficult and dangerous task of return the little boat seem to be engulph by every breaker that it meet on its way and none but strong and true hand could have save the boat in this emergency and no one unaccustomed to the danger of the sea can imagine the nerve necessary to manage a boat under such circumstance the smaller boat after much difficulty and delay be get around under the lee and bail out but it swamp the first trip ashore and be not use afterward by constant and untiring exertion the passenger and crew be all land at half-past eight o'clock and after secure the shatter boat as best they could on the steep side of the rocky shore they gather around the fire to look upon the miserable plight of one another all be drench with the water in come ashore cold and hungry wear out by the fatigue of the night and morning they lop down around the fire the sorriest look gathering that it have ever be we misfortune to witness all have be so anxious in see the passenger and crew land safely that they have not think about provide for we future want and nothing in the shape of provision or baggage have be bring ashore after they have look around they for a few moment the boat be again man and the wreck be again explore for provision and a few pound of hard bread part of a quarter of fresh beef and some boil beef be bring in which be as one remark a poor show for a lunch for so many sharp appetite after have eat this mouthful we propose to start with as many as possible for eagle river which be judge to be about thirty-five mile distant and a party of twenty-two in number set out it be noon when we start with we clothes still wet and heavy and little or nothing to eat we work we way slowly through the cedar swamp over log and under log up ravine and down ravine a crooked trackless toilsome way till the middle of the afternoon when we meet two of we fellow passenger on they way back to the wreck they have be on some distance further but wear out with the hardship of they journey and hunger they have turn back dishearten and advise we to do the same but we decide to go on and on we go through the worst cedar swamp in the world till the thick wood begin to grow dark with the shades of evening and till a number of the party become completely exhaust with fatigue and hunger we then conclude to encamp for the night although we could not have travel in all the afternoon over five mile or about a mile a hour without a axe a few stick be collect and two or three poor fire be kindle all the bit of hard bread and fresh beef in all a scanty meal for one person 's supper be produce and ration out to the twenty-two person every one eat as sparingly as possible and as we be without tent we lay down on the cold ground in we wet clothes before the fire and doze and shiver with cold till daylight as soon as we could see to travel we proceed on we toilsome way and after walk about a mile we come to the trail that lead from lake superior to portage lake and see two or three indian push out through the surf a bark canoe which they soon jump into and paddle away before the wind we try to induce they to return in hope to procure something from they to satisfy we craving hunger but they scarcely deign to look back some of we party have be from this trail to eagle river and it be some consolation to meet with a land mark that be know we now commence walk along the beach which be compose of large pebble cover in many place with log and tree that have wash or tumble in from off the overhang bank make it as tiresome walking as can well be imagine frequently in order to keep the beach we be oblige to walk within reach of the dash of the wave and be drench with the cold flood about two mile east of the portage trail we discover near the edge of the bank which be some ten foot above the lake the remains of a human be the clothes of a man in a good state of preservation half cover the bleaching bone the sad sickening unburied relic of some poor shipwrecked brother who have here end he voyage o'er life 's stormy main he have evidently choose this spot where he could die look off upon the lake from whence no succor come and where he could be easily discover by the passer by a description be take by one of we party of he clothes and the few article find on they and we learn on inquire at eagle river that they be undoubtedly the remains of a mr mathew who get lose from the algonquin mine a few week previous a brother of the deceased repair to the spot as soon as possible and bring down the remains for burial at eagle harbor the morning have not far advance when a number of we party begin to lag behind exhaust from the effect of hunger and weakness and it be evident that some would have to be leave behind while some of the other might possibly reach eagle river that day and send assistance we confidently expect to find some provision in a warehouse at gratiot river twelve mile from eagle river and all have hope to reach there before night a few of we party push forward as fast as possible to procure food and fire for those behind but great be we disappointment not to find a particle of provision at that place we kindle a fire and rest for a few minute till a number of we party come up the larger number be still far behind it now become more important than ever that some one should reach eagle river and seven of we number determine to make the trial we have now twelve mile further to go and in we miserable condition we travel but slowly but the trail grow better as we proceed and we come in sight of eagle river about four o'clock in the afternoon and under the circumstance a more pleasant invite village we do not recollect ever to have see before four or five of we party come through the same evening and a few other of another party come in the next day with similar hardship on the Tuesday follow capt mckay with the schooner algonquin proceed to the wreck and bring off the captain crew and remain passenger and all that could be save of valuable property a jungle recollection the hot season of 1849 be peculiarly oppressive and the irksome garrison duty at cherootabad in the south of indium have for many month be unusually severe the colonel of my regiment the brigadier and the general have successively accede to my application for three week ' leave and that welcome fact have be duly notify in order it be not long before i find myself on the coimbatore road snugly pack gun and all in a country bullock cart lie at full length on a mattress with a thick layer of straw spread under it all my preparation have be make beforehand relay of bullock be post for I at convenient interval and i arrive at goodaloor a distance of a hundred and ten mile in rather more than forty eight hour goodaloor be a quiet little village about eleven mile from coimbatore -- but do not suppose i be go to spend my precious three week there all load and pony saddle let we start : the two white cow and they calf the mattress and blanket roll up and carry on a cooly 's head shikaree horsekeeper and a village man with the three gun while i myself bring up the rear over a few ploughed field and past that large banian tree the jungle begin in a small clump of low jungle on the sloping bank of a broad sandy watercourse the casual passer-by would not have perceive a snug and tolerably strong little hut -- the white end of the small branch that be lay over it and the mixture of foliage alone reveal the fact to the observant eye of a practice woodman no praise could be too strong to bestow on the faithful shikaree have i choose the spot myself after a week ' survey of the country it could not have be more happily select to the deeply-rooted stump of a young tree on the opposite bank one of the white cow have be make fast by a double cord pass twice around she horn nothing remain to be do : the little door be fasten behind I the prickly acacia bough be pile up against it on the outside and my people be anxious to be off the poor cow too listen with dismay to the retreat footstep of the party and have already make some furious plunge to free herself and rejoin the rest of the kine who have be drive off nothing loth toward home watch she : how intently she stare along the path by which the people have desert she be it not for the occasional stamp of she fore leg or the impatient side-toss of the head to keep off the swarm fly she might be carve out of marble and now a fearful and anxious gaze up the bed of the nullah and into the thick fringe of mimoso one ear prick and the other back alternately show that _ instinct _ have already whisper the warning of impend danger another plunge to get loose and a search gaze up the path see she side heave now come what we want -- that deep low it echo again among the hill : another and another poor wretch you be hasten you doom far or near the tiger hear you -- under the rock or thicket where he have lie since morning sheltered from the scorching sun he ear flutter as if they be tickled every time he hear that music he huge green eye heretofore half close be now wide open and alas poor cow gaze truly enough in thy direction but he have not stir yet and nobody can say in what direction giant death will yet stalk forth the moon be up -- all nature still the cow again on she leg be restless and evidently frightened oh reader even if you have the soul of a shikaree i despair of be able to convey in word a tithe of the sensation of that solitary vigil : a night like that be to be enjoy but seldom -- a red-letter day in one 's existence where be the man who have never experience the poetic influence of a moonlight scene fancy then such a one as here describe a crescent of low hill -- craggy steep and thickly wood -- around you on three side and above they again at twenty mile ' distance the clear blue outline of the neilgherry hill in you front the silver sand bed of the dry watercourse divide the thick and somber jungle with a stream of light till you lose it in the deep shadow at the foot of the hill -- all quiet all still all bath in the light of the moon yourself the only man for mile to come a solitary watcher -- you only companion the poor cow who full of fear and suspicious at every leaf-fall remind you that a terrible struggle be about to take place within a few foot of you bed and that there will be noise and confusion when you must be cool and collect you little kennel would not be strong enough to resist a determine charge and you be alone if three good gun be not true friend oh that i could express sound on paper as music be write in note no reader you must do as i have do -- you must be place in a similar situation to hear and enjoy the terrible roar of a hungry tiger -- not from afar off and listen for but close at hand and unexpected it be like a electric shock -- a moment ago i be doze off and the cow long since lay down appear asleep that one roar have not die away among the hill when she have scramble on she leg and stand with elevated head stiffen limb tail raise and breath suspend stare full of terror in the direction of the sound as for the biped with less noise and even more alacrity he have grasp he sam nock whose polished barrel just rest on the lower ledge of the little peep-hole perhaps he eye be as round as saucer and heart beating fast and strong now for the struggle -- pray heaven that i be cool and calm and do not fire in a hurry for one shot will either lose or secure my well-earned prize there he be again evidently in that rugged stony watercourse which run parallel and about two hundred yard behind the hut but what be that yes lightning : two flash in quick succession and a cold stream of air be rustling through the half-withered leaf of my ambush take a look to the rear through a accidental opening among the leave it be plain that a storm or as it would be call at sea a squall be brew a arch of black cloud be approach from the westward and the rain descend give it the appearance of a huge black comb the tooth reach to the earth the moon half obscure show a white mist as far as the rain have reach then be hear in the puff of air the hissing of the distant but approach downpour : more lightning -- then some large heavy drop plash on the roof and it be rain cat and dog how the scene be change half a hour ago solemn and still and wild as nature rest unpolluted undefaced unmarked by man -- sleep in the light of the moon all be tranquillity the civilized man lose he idiosyncrasy in its contemplation -- forget nation pursuit creed -- he feel that he be nature 's child and adore the god of nature but the beautiful be now exchange for the sublime when that scene appear light up suddenly and awfully by lightning which now momentarily exchange a sheet of intensely dazzling blue light with a darkness horrible to endure -- a light which show the many stream of water which now appear like ribbon over the smooth slab of rod that lay on the slope of the hill and give a microscopic accuracy of outline to every object exchange as suddenly for a darkness which for the moment might be suppose the darkness of extinction -- of utter annihilation -- while the crash of thunder over head roll over the echo of the hill i be the lord thy god the storm be at length over the nullah run dry again damp and sleepy with arm fold and eye sometimes open but often shut i keep a indifferent watch when the cow struggle on she leg and a groan bring I to my sens there they be it be no dream a large tiger hold she just behind the ear shake she like a fight dog by the doubtful light of the watery moon do i calmly and noiselessly run out the muzzle of my rifle i see he without quit he grip of the cow 's neck leap over she back more than once she sink to the earth and he lift she up again at the first opportunity i pull trigger the left hand miss i try the right -- it go off -- bang whether a hang fire be a excuse or not the tiger relinquish he hold and be off with a bind the cow stagger and struggle and in few seconds fall and with a heavy groan cease to move the tiger have kill the cow within a few foot of I and escape scathless night after night do i watch for he return i have almost despaired of see he again when one night about eleven o'clock my ear catch the echo among the rock and then the distant roar -- nearer -- nearer -- nearer and -- oh joy -- answer tiger and tigress -- above all hope -- come to recompense I for hundred of night watching -- to balance a long account of weary night in the silent jungle in platform on tree in hut of leaf and bramble and in damp pit on the water 's edge -- all bootless come -- come -- nearer and nearer music nor word dear reader can stand I in any stead to convey the sound to you the first note like the trumpet of a peacock and the rest the deepest tone thunder stone and gravel rattle just behind the hut on the path by which we come and go and a heavy step pass and descend the slope into the nullah i hear the sand crunch under he weight before i dare to look a little peep oh heaven loom in the moonlight there he stand long sleek as satin and lash he tail -- he stand stationary smell the slaughter cow no longer the cautious creep tiger i feel how awful a brute he be to offend i remember how he have worry a strong cow in half a minute and that with he weight alone my poor rickety little citadel would fall to piece as if the excitement of the moment be insufficient the monster gaze down the dry watercourse catch sight of he companion who advance up the bed of the nullah stand irresolutely about twenty yard off the bully who be evidently the male after smell at the head come round the carcass make a sort of complaisant purr -- hum a kind of animal song and to it he go tooth and nail as he stand with he two fore foot on the haunch while he tug and tear out a beef-steak i once more grasp old sam nock and run the muzzle out of the little port the white linen band mark a line behind he shoulder and rather low but from the continued motion of he body it be some moment before eye and finger agree to pull trigger -- bang a shower of sand rattle on the dry leaf and a roar of rage and pain satisfied I even before the white smoke which hang in the still air have clear away to show the huge monster writhe and plunge where he have fall either direct by the fire or by some slight noise make in the agitation of the moment he see I and with a hideous yell scramble up : the roar thunder of he voice fill the valley and the echo among the hill answer it with the hooting of tribe of monkey who scare out of sleep seek the highest branch at the sound of the well-known voice of the tyrant of the jungle i immediately perceive to my great joy that he hind quarter be paralyzed and useless and that all danger be out of the question he sink down again on he elbow and as he rest he now powerless limb i see the blood well out of a wound in the loin as it shine in the moonlight and trickle off he sleek-painted hide like globule of quicksilver as i look into he countenance i see all the devil alive there the will remain -- the power only have go it be a sight never to be forget with head raise to the full stretch of he neck he glare at I with a expression of such malignity that it almost make one quail i thought of the native superstition of singe off the whisker of the newly kill tiger to lay he spirit and no longer wonder at it with ear back and mouth bleeding he growl and roar in fitful uncertainty as if he be try but unable to measure the extent of the force that have lay he low motionless myself provocation cease and without further attempt to get on he leg he continue to gaze on I when i slowly lowered my head to the sight and again pull trigger this time true to the mark the ball enter just above the breastbone and the smoke clear off with he death-groan there he lay foot to foot with he victim of last night motionless -- dead my first impulse be to tear down the door behind and get a thorough view of he proportion but remember that he companion the tigress have vanish only a short time ago close to the scene of action i think it as well to remain where i be so enlarge the window with my hand i take a long look and then jovially attack the coffee without reference to noise and fall back on the mattress to sleep or to think the night 's work over at last i have get he : he skin will be peg out to-morrow dry before the tent door when my people come in the morning they find I seat on the dead tiger coolie be send for to carry the beast and i give the pony he rein all the way back to the tent fraser 's magazine -lrb- illustration : attack on boonesborough -rrb- attack of boonsborough on the tenth of march 1778 daniel boone have be take prisoner by the indian be conduct to detroit when governor hamilton himself offer one hundred pound sterling for he ransom but so great be the affection of the indian for they prisoner that it be positively refuse boone 's anxiety on account of he wife and child be incessant and the more intolerable as he dare not excite the suspicion of he captor by any indication of a wish to return home the indian be now prepare for a violent attack upon the settlement in kentucky early in June four hundred and fifty of the choicest warrior be ready to march against boonesborough paint and arm in a fearful manner alarm at these preparation he determine to make he escape he hunt and shoot with the indian as usual until the morning of the sixteenth of June when take a early start he leave

east dixfield oxford county I who actually catch in he mouth a ball discharge from a musket he be at the battle of bridgewater in the war of 1812 and while bite off the end of a cartridge for the purpose of load he gun be strike by a ball which enter on the left side of he face knock out eight of he tooth cut off the end of he tongue and pass into he throat he raise it go to the hospital staid out the remainder of he enlistment and return home with the bullet in he pocket the new orlean picayune one of whose editor be a eye-witness of the most of the leading battle in mexico copy the foregoing paragraph and append to it the follow relation : we can relate a incident even more strange than this at the siege of monterey in 1846 and while general worth 's troops be advance to storm the small fort know as la soldada a man name water a excellent soldier belong to ben mcculloch 's ranger catch a large grape-shot directly in he mouth it be fully the size of a hen 's egg be rough uneven in shape and in its course completely carry out the four upper tooth of the ranger and part of the jaw cut off the four lower tooth as with a chisel split he tongue in twain carry away he palate go through the back of he head and strike a tendon glance down and lodge under the skin on the shoulder-blade where it be extract by a surgeon and safely place in the pocket of water for future reference no man think the wound ranger could live he could swallow neither food nor water we see he two night afterward in a room in the bishop 's palace which have be convert into a hospital sit bolt upright among the wound and the die -- for the nature of he terrible hurt be such that he could not lie down without suffocate he face be swollen to more than twice its ordinary size -- he be speechless of course -- he want be only make know by means of a broken slate and pencil and he be slowly apply a wet sponge to he mouth endeavor to extract moisture which might quench the fever and intolerable thirst under which he be suffer by he side lay young thoma of maryland a member of the same company who be mortally wound the morning after and who be now die wound man strike that afternoon in worth 's advance upon the grand plaza be constantly be bring in the surgeon be amputate and dress the hurt of the cripple soldier by a pale and sickly candle-light and the groan of those in grievous pain add a new horror to the scene which be at best frightful we recollect perfectly well a poor fellow strike in both leg by a grape-shot while advance up one of the street he be beg lustily after one of he limb have be amputate that the other might be spare he on which to hobble through the world poor thoma as gallant a spirit as ever live finally breathe he last we bring water a fresh cup of water with which to moisten he wound and then leave the room to catch a hour 's sleep but the recollection of that terrible night will not soon be efface from my memory the above incident occur on the night of the 23d and morning of the 24th of September 1846 during the early part of the month of February follow while pass into the old st charle in this city we be accost with a strange voice by a fine-looking man who seem extremely glad to see we although he have a most singular and unaccountable mode of express himself we recollect the eye as one we have be familiar with but the lower feature of the face although in no way disfigure for the life of we we could not make out why do not you know I in a mumble half-indistinct and force manner say the man still shake we hand vigorously i be water and water it be in reality look as well and as healthy as ever without show the least outward sign that he have ever catch a grape-shot in he mouth a luxuriant growth of mustach completely cover he upper lip and conceal any scar the iron missile might have make a imperial on he under lip hide any appearance of a wound at that point and with the exception of he speech there be nothing to show that he have ever receive the slightest injury about the face he tongue which be terribly shatter be still partially benumb render articulation both difficult and tiresome but he assure we he be every day gain more and more the use of it and in he own word he be soon to be just as good as new it be needless to say that we be glad to see he -- to meet one we have never expect to encounter again in such excellent plight any one who could have see he sit in that apartment of the bishop 's palace he face swollen and with a gravity of countenance which would have be ludicrous even to the cause of laughter have it not be for he own precarious situation and the heart-rending scene around would have be equally as much astonished and rejoice as we be on again so unexpectedly behold he a correspondent of the inquirer have send we the follow which be quite as remarkable as either of the foregoing : very extraordinary incident have be publish lately of shot have be catch in the mouth of soldier in the course of battle in the war of 1812 and in the mexican war but a incident perhaps more remarkable for the coolness of the individual on the occasion occur at the battle of fort drane fight in August 1837 under the command of the late col bk pierce this be one of the most signal and desperate engagement of that bloody war the seminole under they renowned chief osceolum have take a very commanding position in a extensive sugar field near the stockade strengthen on the east side by a dense hammock three desperate onset be make during the battle and the enemy be finally drive from the field to the protection of the hammock during the hottest of the battle a soldier belong to the detachment under the command of lieut pickell whose position be a little in advance of the two wing of the name of jackson have just fire receive a shot from a tall indian not twenty yard distant which break through the outer part of he pantaloons and lodge in he right-hand pocket feel the slight sting of the half-spent ball he thrust he hand in he pocket draw out the bullet and drop it into the barrel of he musket upon the charge of powder he have just before put in then with the unerring aim of a true marksman level he piece and as quick as lightning he adversary be measure upon the ground the wound be fatal -- the warrior survive the shot but a few minute the above be one of the many incident that occur in the recent war with the florida indian which for peril and brave feat on the part of the american soldier and officer have scarcely ever be equal the above incident be state as it actually occur a family attack by indian on the night of the eleventh of April 1787 the house of a widow in bourbon county kentucky become the scene of a deplorable adventure she occupy what be call a double cabin in a lonely part of the county one room be tenant by the old lady herself together with two grown son and a widow daughter with a infant the other room be occupy by two unmarried daughter from sixteen to twenty year of age together with a little girl the hour be eleven o'clock at night and the family have retire to rest some symptom of a alarming nature have engage the attention of the young man for a hour before anything of a decide character take place at length hasty step be hear in the yard and quickly afterward several loud knock at the door accompany by the usual exclamation who keep house in very good english the young man suppose from the language that some benighted traveler be at the door hastily arise and be advance to withdraw the bar that secure it when he mother who have long live upon the frontier and have probably detect the indian tone in the demand for admission instantly spring out of bed and order she son not to admit they declare that they be indian she instantly awaken she other son and the young man seize they gun which be always charge prepared to repel the enemy the indian find it impossible to enter under they assume character begin to thunder at the door with great violence but a single shot from a loop-hole oblige they to shift the attack to some less expose point and unfortunately they discover the door of the other cabin which contain the three daughter the rifle of the brother could not be bring to bear on this point and by means of several rail take from the yard fence the door be force from its hinge and the girl be at the mercy of the savage one be instantly secure but the eldest defend herself desperately with a knife she have be use at the loom and stab one of the indian to the heart before she be tomahawk in the meantime the little girl who have be overlook by the enemy in they eagerness to secure the other run out into the yard and might have effect she escape have she take advantage of the darkness and flee but instead of look to she own safety the terrify little creature run round the house wring she hand and cry that she sister be kill -lrb- illustration : the indian kill the widow 's daughter -rrb- just then the child utter a loud scream follow by a few faint moan and all be silent presently the crackling of flame be hear accompany by a triumphant yell from the indian announce that they have set fire to that division of the house which have be occupy by the daughter and of which they hold undisputed possession the fire be quickly communicate to the

of a steep mountain and eat we dinner under a tree that distil upon the rock a fragrant gum mount again at two o'clock in half a hour we reach the summit whence we look down a giddy descent upon the swift but wind zab here it become necessary to leave we animal and work we way down the almost precipitous road while the mule slide scramble and tumble after we as best they might as i be push on a little in advance of the party i be meet in a narrow turn of the path by a old bearded man with a dagger in he girdle who reach out he hand toward I i be uncertain at first how to understand it but he only object be to press my hand to he lip with a fervent ' _ salam aleikum _ ' -lrb- peace be with you -rrb- to which i respond accord to usual form ' _ aleikum salam _ ' -lrb- with you be peace -rrb-

spring ` they then go they way and we see they no more ' but i shall not easily forget the satisfaction which they show in recognize we as fellow believer here in the land of the infidel and the kindness with which they go out of they way to offer we a ` cup of cold water in the name of a disciple ' that night they spend on the bank of the river zab the next day after traverse a wild pass hem in by perpendicular rock more than a thousand foot in hight they reach the village of bizeh in a valley of the mountain and secure a house-top for the night : about the middle of the night mr marsh be wake by a slight noise and lift he head see a party of five or six armed man creep stealthily toward we roof which on the side toward the hill on which they be be only four or five foot from the ground the foremost man stop short for a moment at mr marsh 's movement and turn to he follower call out ` khawaja ' -lrb- the gentleman -rrb- then see that we old guard be asleep at the step stone he climb upon the roof at another corner and stand for a moment with he long gun at he side mr marsh raise himself upon he arm and demand in arabic ` what do you want ' the man probably do not understand the language : at any rate he make no answer but turn to the old man and converse earnestly with he in a low tone the other man gather near they as if to listen and take part but they all finally go away without do any mischief the next morning the sentinel who have keep watch over they baggage attempt to dissuade they from go the direct road as the people of the next village have hear of they come and be determine to kill they however they keep on and in the course of two or three hour they guide be stop by a company of six armed man : the place be admirably choose for the purpose the narrow path along the cliff by which we have come here widen into a little platform large enough for we mule to stand upon together in front of we a ledge of broken rock jut from the mountain and run down cross we path and leave only a very small passage in front of this path stand we challenger six worse-looking man whether in form dress or feature it would be difficult to imagine each man wear around he high conical feel hat a turban of handkerchief of every hue and texture in he hand a long gun with short and narrow breech and in he belt the universal kurdish curved and two-edged dagger the leader of the gang be a man of middle age with black eye and a grisly untrimmed beard and with half he front tooth knock out after some discussion the robber consent to allow they to pass on the payment of fifty piastre -lrb- two dollar and a half -rrb- which they agree to do provide they be conduct to the house of the agha the robber object to this and provoke by the delay level they gun at the party at this juncture the chief muleteer advance the necessary money and they be spare these transaction from the time we be stop occupy about a hour we now pass with we ragged regiment straggle around we now with they long gun under we ear and now cut off the long bend of we crooked and little used path in about ten minute from the pass we be hail by another party post upon a hillside and a discussion of many minute ensue between they and we escort in which we kurdish muleteer take a active part the result be that we move on with a addition of two man to we guard we soon begin to perceive that we be go toward the agha rather as prisoner than as guest the castle -lrb- if it may be dignified by the name -rrb- which be now in sight be of no promising appearance it be a rude rectangular building with a small white tower at one corner on which the workman be still engage it be situate on the side of a hill which form the head of a valley opening into the ravine we have just leave the small window and the roof be crowd with man woman and child gaze at we singular cavalcade as we draw near some woman who be bathing in a brook rise and gaze at we with irrepressible curiosity we stop at the door of the castle here the assault begin the man of we guard fly like savage dog at we servant : khudhr and ablahad seize the arm which be gird about they slash furiously with they dagger to cut the strap of they gun and pistol the turban be tear from they head and appropriate among the rabble similar violence be about to be show we when these operation be suddenly interrupt by the appearance from the castle of melul agha he be a man taller by several inch than any of he tribe and with a expression of face which be that of one accustomed to be obey he be dress in a more elegant style than could have be expect in these mountain wear upon he head a turban of gray silk and a long rifle sling from he shoulder with a melo-dramatic wave of he hand which be at once obey he motion he noisy tribe to desist and approach we point out a tree a few hundred foot up the hill to which we might retire as we move alone toward this spot a grim suspicion of he intention cross we mind might it not be for convenience in dispatch we that we have be remove we seat ourselves quietly in the shade and watch the proceedings the property of the muleteer and donkey-driver have be unloaded and place by itself one of we load have be throw from the mule and the other be now bring near we take from the animal and lay under a neighbor tree mr marsh now go down toward the castle to assist khudhr in bring the rest of we property toward the tree this do khudhr return to the crowd to learn what he could of they intention he soon come back to we in evident terror and say with a significant motion of he hand that they be intend to kill we after send the servant a second time he come back with the announcement that the agha would examine they baggage take what he please and send they on to another agha but would not allow they to return to mosul this examination be soon make and the party be plunder of one thousand piaster -lrb- forty-four dollar -rrb- besides razor knife and a quantity of clothing the whole affair be conduct with a politeness of manner which be highly creditable to the agha and calculate to put we very much at we ease he show himself in every thing -- as mild a mannered man as ever scuttle ship or cut a throat for instance in search we trunk he eye be catch by a small sealed parcel which i suppose to contain jewelry i immediately tell he through a servant that it be not mine but have be give to I in america to be deliver in europe he immediately put it down and proceed with the search during these operation several woman some from curiosity other from pity have gather around we among the latter class be one who from she dress beauty and demeanor could be no other than the wife of the agha she be dress in a fade but once magnificent robe and trowser of silk and wear upon she head a massive and elaborately-carved ornament of silver she move among the fierce and blood-thirsty savage with a air of mingled scorn and anxiety reproach they with the shame of the transaction and plead earnestly that we life and property be spare she warn they also that we injury would inevitably be visit upon they head have finish he search the agha with the old man of the tribe gather on a ledge of rock just behind we and consult long and earnestly we sit down and dine with what appetite we could muster after the robber have come to they decision a second search of the baggage take place which mr bacon thus describe : the pressure of greater and more important danger have make I quite resign to such petty loss as these and i watch with much amusement the appropriation of unusual article a black silk cravat which have see much service in new haven drawing-room be twist about the suspicious-looking head of a uncommonly dirty boy a pair of heavy riding-boot be transfer to the shoulder of a youth who bear the ` gallows mark ' upon he feature with unmistakable distinctness a satin vest of mr marsh 's be circulate through the crowd on the person of a dirty child who boast no other wealth but a ragged shirt and a green pomegranate i look at the youngster with a smile of congratulation but he turn upon he heel and strut gravely away he new garment trail on the ground at every step have lighten we baggage considerably at this haul they proceed to search we person it have be we first movement on be place by ourselves to transfer we watch together with a locket -- all priceless memorial of distant or depart friend -- from the waistcoat to the pantaloons fob a pocket compass attach to my watchguard be care for likewise the little note-book in which i be accustom to place the map of each day 's journey we know not how soon we might be wander in the mountain on foot and without a guide dr bacon have with he two english sovereign and we be uncertain what to do with they if we should openly give they to the robber we dread the effect of the _ aurus sacra fame _ if discover in a secret place we might be strip in the search for more the attempt to conceal they in the earth might be perilous they be finally place in the waistcoat fob from which the watch have be take with the hope that the clumsy kurd might overlook it they begin with I the agha with a irresistible smile and bow of apology pass he hand about my waist feeling for a money belt then over my dress finding that one of my breeches ' pocket be full he motion I to empty it and seem satisfied when i draw out a handkerchief and a pair of glove dr bacon be then search even more superficially but as the hand pass over the waistcoat pocket something jingle i hold my breath as dr b put in he hand and draw out a seal which he have buy at mosul as a antique upon mr marsh the agha find a gold pencil case which please he wonderfully on be tell of its use he scrawl with the pencil on the beyur-haldeh a autograph for which i have a peculiar value the mystery of this be that he restore the pencil with a grin of self-righteousness to mr marsh after wait some time in suspense the traveler be suffer to leave in charge of a kurdish guard : it soon become evident that we be not on the road to oroomiah whither we be go be a matter of painful mystery at the distance of more than a mile as we pass a village a single christian a man of akkre come out in a crowd of curious villager to offer he sympathy as each of we pass he he bow with he head to the ground and with the strongest expression of regard urge we to remain with he there as he would guarantee we safety it be not for we however to say and we press forward but khudhr soon bring we the intelligence which he have obtain here that we be be lead to the village of a mullah a very holy man under whose protection we might feel entirely secure he add that toward oroomiah it would be quite impossible to go we only escape be toward mosul the mullah receive they kindly entertain they a day in he house where all the diseased person in the neighborhood be bring for they to cure and start with they early on the morning of the 30th of may to accompany they on they way back to mosul on reach a village toward noon a scene take place which be of so much interest that we give mr bacon 's account of it in full : we be assist from we horse by a remarkably ill-looking set of man whom we suppose to have come out to see we from curiosity a unprepossessing young gentleman with a scar that divide he nose and he upper lip and a silver-mounted dagger take a seat near the mullah and a violent discussion immediately commence of the drift of which we be happily ignorant soon another party of villager appear head by another young man who be quite the counterpart of the first even to the scar in he lip but he dagger-hilt and sheath be of solid silver set with precious stone and the long ringlet which hang upon he shoulder be still more daintily curl the arrival of this reinforcement renew the violence of the discussion between the mullah on one side and the young man on the other it plainly related to we and the fierce look of the kurd as they walk to and fro with they hand on they dagger would have alarm we have we not have full confidence in the power and good will of we friend the controversy have a good deal subside when the approach of still another party renew it once more the agha himself be come he be a man of fifty year with a once gray beard dye a bright red and with he lower eyebrow stain a livid blue-black he greet we with a ferocious smile and enter at once into earnest conversation with mullah mustafa the conversation be interrupt now and then by one of he amiable son leap from he seat and speak violently to the great apparent satisfaction of the crowd we soon learn the nature of these discussion from khudr who have be a attentive and agitate listener to the whole the respectable old gentleman it seem have send he first son to murder we place the second at a convenient distance to assist he the latter surprised that the business lag come up to see to it and the agha himself find that business lag come finally to attend to it himself the mullah urge the danger of injure person of consequence ` the sword of the frank be long ' say he but this argument be without effect mustafa then appeal to he not to disgrace he hospitality these man be under he own protection and he would not see they wrong this argument also fail he now urge that we be man of influence at mosul and be go direct to constantinople that by secure we influence against he colleague and rival melul agha he might secure a perpetual supremacy in the district of sherwan this plea gain the case the eye of the old savage glisten with diabolical satisfaction as he think of the villainous trick he be about to play upon he rival he draw from he bosom a letter and hand it to the mullah who read it and hand it to we servant it be write by melul agha to khan abdul we present host direct he to take the rest of we property and murder we without fail this letter have be write on the blank page of another letter send to melul agha by mustafa agha of ziba who reside at akkre it be the last scoundrel who have send letter in advance of we into the mountain invite they to murder we -- and this all for the sake of make a little impression on the government at mosul after these hair-breadth escape from murder the party return in safety to mosul a battle with snake since the exhibition in london of the two hindoo snake-charmer -- the first we believe who ever visit europe -- everything relate to serpent seem to have acquire additional interest many fact regard the nature and habit of the various species have be publish afford much information and still greater astonishment waterton in he wanderings in south america and the antille in 1812-24 relate some story of so marvellous a character that come from a less authentic source they truth might be reasonably doubt while in the region of mibrus hill mr waterton long seek in vain for a serpent of large size and finally offer a reward to the negro if they would find he one a few day afterward one of the native follow by he little dog come to he with the information that a snake of respectable dimension have be discover a short distance up the hill and arm with a eight foot lance and accompany by two negro with cutlass and the dog he at once start to take a look at it mr waterton state that he be barefoot with a old hat check shirt and trousers on and a pair of brace to keep they up he snakeship be point out as lie at the root of a large tree which have be tear up by a whirlwind but the remainder of the story shall be give in the traveler 's own word : i advance up to the place slow and cautious the snake be well conceal but at last i make he out it be a coulacanara not poisonous but large enough to have crush any of we to death on measure he afterward he be something more than fourteen foot long this species of snake be very rare and much thicker in proportion to its length than any other snake in the forest a coulacanara of fourteen foot in length be as thick as a common boa of twenty-four foot after skin this snake i could easily get my head into he mouth as the singular formation of the jaw admit of wonderful extension on ascertain the size of the serpent i retire slowly the way i come and promise four dollar to the negro who have show it to I and one dollar to the other who have join we aware that the day be on the decline and that the approach of night would be detrimental to the dissection a thought strike I that i could take he alive i imagine that if i could strike he with the lance behind the head and pin he to the ground i might succeed in capture he when i tell this to the negro they beg and entreat I to let they go for a gun and bring more force as they be sure the snake would kill some of we take however a cutlass from one of the negro and then range both of the sable slave behind I i tell they to follow I and that i would cut they down if they offer to fly when we have get up to the place the serpent have not stir : but i could see nothing of he head and judge by the fold of he body that it must be at the farthest side of the den a species of woodbine form a complete mantle over the branch of the fall tree almost impervious to the rain or the ray of the sun probably he have resort to this sequestered place for a length of time as it bear mark of a ancient settlement i now take my knife determine to cut away the woodbine and break the twig in the gentlest manner possible till i could get a view of he head one negro stand guard close behind I with a cutlass the cutlass which i have take from the first negro be on the ground close beside I in case of need after work in dead silence for a quarter of a hour with one knee all the time on the ground i have clear away enough to see he head it appear come out between the first and second coil of he body and be flat on the ground this be the very position i wish it to be in i rise in silence and retreat very slowly make a sign to the negro to do the same the dog be sit at a distance in mute observance i could now read in the face of the negro that they consider this a very unpleasant affair and they make another vain attempt to persuade I to let they go for a gun i smile in a good-natured manner and make a feint to cut they down with the weapon i have in my hand this be all the answer i make to they request and they look very uneasy it must be observe that we be about twenty yard from the snake 's den i now range the negro behind I and tell he who stand next to I to lay hold of the lance the moment i strike the snake and that the other must attend my movement it now only remain to take they cutlass from they for i be sure that if i do not disarm they they would be tempt to strike the snake in time of danger and thus forever spoil he skin on take they cutlass from they if i might judge from they physiognomy they seem to consider it as a most intolerable act of tyranny probably nothing keep they from bolt but the consolation that i be betwixt they and the snake indeed my own heart in spite of all i could do beat quicker than usual we go slowly on in silence without move we arm or head in order to prevent all alarm as much as possible lest the snake should glide off or attack we in self-defence i carry the lance perpendicularly before I with the point about a foot from the ground the snake have not move and on get up to he i strike he with the lance on the near side just behind the neck and pin he to the ground that moment the negro next to I seize the lance and hold it firm in its place while i dash head foremost into the den to grapple with the snake and to get hold of he tail before he could do any mischief on pin he to the ground with the lance he give a tremendous loud hiss and the little dog run away howling as he go we have a sharp fray in the den the rotten stick fly on all side and each party struggle for superiority i call out to the second negro to throw himself upon I as i find i be not heavy enough he do so and the additional weight be of great service i have now get a firm hold of he tail and after a violent struggle or two he give in find himself overpower this be the moment to secure he so while the first negro continue to hold the lance firm to the ground and the other be help I i contrived to unloosen my brace and with they tie the snake 's mouth the snake now find himself in a unpleasant predicament try to better himself and set resolutely to work but we overpower he we contrived to make he twist himself round the shaft of the lance and then prepare to convey he out of the forest i stand at he head and hold it firm under my arm one negro support the belly and the other the tail in this order we begin to move slowly toward home and reach it after rest ten time for the snake be too heavy for we to support without stop to recruit we strength as we proceed onward with he he fight hard for freedom but it be all in vain we untie the mouth of the bag keep he down by main force and then cut he throat the week follow a curious conflict take place near the spot where i have capture the large snake in the morning i have be follow a species of paroquet and the day be rainy i have take a umbrella to keep the gun dry and have leave it under a tree : in the afternoon i take daddy quashus -lrb- the negro -rrb- with I to look for it while he be search about curiosity lead I toward the place of the late scene of action there be a path where timber have formerly be drag along here i observe a young coulacanara ten foot long slowly move onward and i see he be thick enough to break my arm in case he get twist around it there be not a moment to be lose i lay hold of he tail with the left hand one knee be on the ground and with the right hand i take off my hat and hold it as i would hold a shield for defense the snake instantly turn and come on at I with he head about a yard from the ground as if to ask I what business i have to take such liberty with he tail i let he come hissing and open-mouthed within two foot of my face and then with all the force that i be master of drive my fist shield by my hat full in he jaw he be stunned and confound by the blow and ere he could recover himself i have seize he throat with both hand in such a position that he could not bite I i then allow he to coil himself around my body and march off with he as my lawful prize he press I hard but not alarmingly so estill 's defeat in the spring of 1782 a party of twenty-five wyandot secretly approach

as a boy ten year old be rowing he father over to they home on grand island the father be so much intoxicate as not to be able to assist any more than to steer the canoe the wind which be very strong off shore so frustrated the effort of he tiny arm that the canoe in spite of he get into the current and finally into the rapid within a very few rod of the fall on go the frail shell careering and plunge as the mad water choose still the gallant little oarsman maintain he struggle with the rage billow and actually get the canoe by he persevere manoeuvring so close to iris island as to have she drive by a providential wave in between the little island call the sister here the father and he dauntless boy be in still greater danger for a instant for there be a fall between the two island over

final leap a skater chase by a wolf a thrilling incident in american country life be vividly sketch in evening at donaldson manor in the winter of 1844 the relater go out one evening to skate on the kennebec in maine by moonlight and have ascend that river nearly two mile turn into a little stream to explore its course fir and hemlock of a century 's growth he say meet overhead and form a archway radiant with frostwork all be dark within but i be young and fearless and as i peered into a unbroken forest that rear itself on the border of the stream i laugh with very joyousness my wild hurrah ring through the silent wood and i stand listen to the echo that reverberate again and again until all be hushed suddenly a sound arise -- it seem to I to come from beneath the ice it sound low and tremulous at first until it end in a low wild yell i be appal never before have such a noise meet my ear i think it more than mortal so fierce and amid such a unbroken solitude it seem as though from the tread of some brute animal and the blood rush back to my forehead with a bind that make my skin burn and i feel relieved that i have to contend with thing earthly and not spiritual my energy return and i look around I for some means of escape as i turn my head to the shore i could see two dark object dash through the underbrush at a pace nearly double in speed to my own by this rapidity and the short yell they occasionally give i know at once that these be the much-dreaded gray wolf i have never meet with these animal but from the description give of they i have very little pleasure in make they acquaintance they untamable fierceness and the enduring strength which seem part of they nature render they object of dread to every benighted traveler there be no time for think so i bent my head and dash madly forward nature turn I toward home the light flake of snow spin from the iron skate and i be some distance from my pursuer when they fierce howl tell I i be they fugitive i do not look back i do not feel afraid or sorry or even glad one thought of home the bright face wait my return -- of they tear if they should never see I again and then every energy of body and mind be exert for escape i be perfectly at home on the ice many be the day that i have spend on my good skate never think that at one time they would be my only means of safety every half minute a alternate yelp from my ferocious follower tell I too certain that they be in close pursuit nearer and nearer they come i hear they foot patter on the ice nearer still until i could feel they breath and hear they sniffle scent every nerve and muscle in my frame be stretch to the utmost tension the tree along the shore seem to dance in the uncertain light and my brain turn with my own breathless speed yet still they seem to hiss forth they breath with a sound truly horrible when a involuntary motion on my part turn I out of my course the wolf close behind unable to stop and as unable to turn on the smooth ice slip and fall still go on far ahead they tongue be loll out they white tusk glare from they bloody mouth they dark shaggy breast be fleece with foam and as they pass I they eye glare and they howl with fury the thought flash on my mind that by these means i could avoid they viz : by turn aside whenever they come too near for they by the formation of they foot be unable to run on the ice except in a straight line at one time by delay my turn too long my sanguinary antagonist come so near that they throw the white foam over my dress as they spring to seize I and they tooth clash together like the spring of a fox-trap have my skate fail for one instant have i trip on a stick or catch my foot in a fissure in the ice the story i be now tell would never have be tell i think over all the chance i know where they would take hold of I if i fall i think how long it would be before i die and then there would be a search for the body that would already have its tomb for oh how fast man 's mind trace out all the dread color of death 's picture only those who have be so near the grim original can tell but i soon come opposite the house and my hound -- i know they deep voice -- rouse by the noise bay furiously from the kennel i hear they chain rattle how i wish they would break they and then i would have protector that would be peer to the fiercest denizen of the forest the wolf take the hint convey by the dog stop in they mad career and after a moment 's consideration turn and flee i watch they until they dusky form disappear over a neighbor hill then take off my skate i wend my way to the house with feeling which may be better imagine than describe but even yet i never see a broad sheet of ice in the moonshine without thinking of the sniffle breath and those fearful thing that follow I closely down the frozen kennebec we flag on the rocky mountain we find the follow incident of place the american flag on the highest point of the rocky mountain in col fremont 's narrative : we manage to get we mule up to a little bench about a hundred foot above the lake where there be a patch of good grass and turn they loose to graze during we rough ride to this place they have exhibit a wonderful surefootedness part of the defile be fill with angular sharp fragment of rock three or four and eight or ten foot cube and among these they have work they way leap from one narrow point to another rarely make a false step and give we no occasion to dismount have divest ourselves of every unnecessary encumbrance we commence the ascent this time like experienced traveler we do not press ourselves but climb leisurely sit down so soon as we find breath begin to fail at interval we ready place where a number of spring gush from the rock and about 1800 foot above the lake come to the snow line from this point we progress be uninterrupted climb hitherto i have wear a pair of thick moccasin with sole of _ parfleche _ but here i put on a light thin pair which i have bring for the purpose as now the use of we toe become necessary to a further advance i availed myself of a sort of comb of the mountain which stand against the wall like a buttress and which the wind and the solar radiation join to the steepness of the smooth rock have keep almost entirely free from snow up this i make my way rapidly we cautious method of advance at the outset have spare my strength and with the exception of a slight disposition to headache i feel no remains of yesterday 's illness in a few minute we reach a point where the buttress be overhang and there be no other way of surmount the difficulty than by pass around one side of it which be the face of a vertical precipice of several hundred foot put hand and foot in the crevice between the block i succeed in get over it and when i reach the top find my companion in a small valley below descend to they we continue climb and in a short time reach the crest i spring upon the summit and another step would have precipitate I into a immense snow field five hundred foot below to the edge of this field be a sheer icy precipice and then with a gradual fall the field slope off for about a mile until it strike the foot of another lower ridge i stand on a narrow crest about three foot in width with a inclination of about 20  n 51  e as soon as i have gratify the first feeling of curiosity i descend and each man ascend in he turn for i would only allow one at a time to mount the unstable and precarious slab which it seem a breath would hurl into the abyss below we mount the barometer in the snow of the summit and fix a ramrod in a crevice unfurl the national flag to wave in the breeze where flag never wave before -lrb- illustration : we flag on the rocky mountain -rrb- during we morning 's ascent we have meet no sign of animal life except a small sparrow-like bird a stillness the most profound and a terrible solitude force themselves constantly on the mind as the great feature of the place here on the summit where the stillness be absolute unbroken by any sound and solitude complete we think ourselves beyond the region of animated life but while we be sit on the rock a solitary bee -lrb- _ bromus the humble-bee _ -rrb- come wing he flight from the eastern valley and light on the knee of one of the man it be a strange place the icy rock and the highest peak of the rocky mountain for a lover of warm sunshine and flower and we please ourselves with the idea that he be the first of he species to cross the mountain barrier -- a solitary pioneer to foretell the advance of civilization i believe that a moment 's thought would have make we let he continue he way unharmed but we carry out the law of this country where all animated nature seem at war and seize he immediately put he in at least a fit place -- in the leaf of a large book among the flower we have collect on we way run the canon col fremont in he narrative give the follow account of a perilous adventure of himself and party in attempt to run a canon on the river platte they have previously pass three cataract : we rembarked at nine o'clock and in about twenty minute reach the next canon landing on a rocky shore at its commencement we ascend the ridge to reconnoiter portage be out of the question so far as we could see the jagged rock point out the course of the canon on a wind line of seven or eight mile it be simply a narrow dark chasm in the rock and here the perpendicular face be much higher than in the previous pass be at this end two to three hundred and further down as we afterward ascertain five hundred foot in vertical height we previous success have make we bold and we determine again to run the canon every thing be secure as firmly as possible and have divest ourselves of the greater part of we clothing we push into the stream to save we chronometer from accident mr preuss take it and attempt to proceed along the shore on the mass of rock which in place be pile up on either side but after he have walk about five minute every thing like shore disappear and the vertical wall come squarely down into the water he therefore wait until we come up a ugly pass lay before we we have make fast to the stern of the boat a strong rope about fifty foot long and three of the man clamber along among the rock and with this rope let she slowly through the pass in several place high rock lay scatter about in the channel and in the narrow it require all we strength and skill to avoid stave the boat on the sharp point in one of these the boat prove a little too broad and stick fast for a instant while the water fly over we fortunately it be but for a instant as we united strength force she immediately through the water sweep overboard only a sextant and a pair of saddle-bag i catch the sextant as it pass by I but the saddle-bag become the prey of the whirlpool we reach the place where mr preuss be stand take he on board and with the aid of the boat put the man with the rope on the succeed pile of rock we find this passage much worse than the previous one and we position be rather a bad one to go back be impossible before we the cataract be a sheet of foam and shut up in the chasm by the rock which in some place seem almost to meet overhead the roar of the water be deafen we push off again but after make a little distance the force of the current become too great for the man on shore and two of they let go the rope lajeunesse the third man hang on and be jerk headforemost into the river from a rock about twelve foot high and down the boat shot like a arrow bazil follow we in the rapid current and exert all he strength to keep in mid channel -- he head only see occasionally like a black spot in the white foam how far we go i do not exactly know but we succeed in turn the boat into a eddy below _ ` cre dieu _ say bazil lajeunesse as he arrive immediately after we _ je croi bien que j' be nage un demus mile _ he have owe he life to he skill as a swimmer and i determine to take he and two other on board and trust to skill and fortune to reach the other end in safety we place ourselves on we knee with the short paddle in we hand the most skillful boatman be at the bow and again we commence we rapid descent we clear rock after rock and shot past fall after fall we little boat seem to play with the cataract we become flush with success and familiar with danger and yield to the excitement of the occasion break forth into a canadian boat-song singing or rather shout we dash along and be i believe in the midst of the chorus when the boat strike a conceal rock immediately at the foot of a fall which whirl she over in a instant three of my man could not swim and my first feeling be to assist they and save some of we effect but a sharp concussion or two convinced I that i have not yet save myself a few stroke bring I into a eddy and i land on a pile of rock on the left side look around i see that mr preuss have gain the shore on the same side about twenty yard below and a little climbing and swimming soon bring he to my side on the opposite side against the wall lay the boat bottom up and lambert be in the act of save descoteaux whom he have grasp by the hair and who could not swim for a hundred yard below the current be cover with float book and box bale and blanket and scatter article of clothing and so strong and boil be the stream that even we heavy instrument which be all in case keep on the surface and the sextant circle and the long black box of the telescope be in view at once for a moment i feel somewhat dishearten all we book -- almost every record of the journey -- we journal and register of astronomical and barometrical observation -- have be lose in a moment but it be no time to indulge in regret and i immediately set about endeavor to save something from the wreck make ourselves understand as well as possible by sign -lrb- for nothing could be hear in the roar of the water -rrb- we commence we operation of every thing on board the only article that have be save be my double-barreled gun which descoteaux have catch and cling to with drown tenacity the man continue down the river on the left bank mr preuss and myself descend on the side we be on and lajeunesse with a paddle in he hand jump on the boat alone and continue down the canon she be now light and clear every bad place with much less difficulty in a short time he be join by lambert and the search be continue for about a mile and a half which be as far as the boat could proceed in the pass here the wall be about five hundred foot high and the fragment of rock from above have choke the river into a hollow pass but one or two foot above the surface through this and the interstice of the rock the water find its way favor beyond we expectation all we register have be recover with the exception of one of my journal which contain the note and incident of travel and topographical description a number of scatter astronomical observation principally meridian altitude of the sun and we barometrical register west of laramie fortunately we other journal contain duplicate of the most important barometrical observation in addition to these we save the circle and these with a few blanket constitute every thing that have be rescue from the water the rescue a young girl have be capture at she father 's hut when all the male of the household be absent hunting wolf she be seize by the indian and bear swiftly away to the encampment of a war party of the osage she be then place in a land canoe and hurry rapidly forward toward they village among the party she recognize one whose life she have be instrumental in save when a prisoner he recognize she and promise to assist she escape at this point the follow narrative commence : at a late and solemn hour the indian who have be the captive the night before suddenly cease he snore which have be hear without intermission for a great length of time and when mary instinctively cast she eye toward he she be surprise to see he gently and slowly raise he head he enjoin silence by place he hand upon he mouth after carefully disengage himself from he comrade he creep quietly away and soon vanish entirely from sight on the northern side of the spreading beech mary expect he would soon return and assist she to escape although she be aware of the hardship and peril that would attend she flight yet the thought of again meet she friend be enough to nerve she for the undertaking and she wait with anxious impatience the come of she rescuer but he come not she could attribute no other design in he conduct but that of effect she escape and yet he neither come for she nor beckon she away she have repose confidence in he promise for she know that the indian savage as he be rarely forfeit he word but when gratitude inspire a pledge she could not believe that he would use deceit the fire be now burn quite low and its wane light scarce cast a beam upon the branch overhead it be evidently not far from morning and every hope of present escape entirely flee from she bosom but just as she be yield to despair she see the indian return in a stealthy pace bear some dark object in he arm he glide to she side and motion to she to leave the snow-canoe and also to take with she all she robe with which she have be envelop she do he bidding and then he carefully deposit the burden he bear in the place she have just occupy a portion of the object become unwrapped mary discover it to be a huge mass of snow resemble in some respects a human form and the indian 's stratagem be at once apparent to she relinquish herself to he guidance she be lead noiselessly through the bush about a hundred pace distant from the fire to a large fall tree that have yield to some furious storm when she conductor pause he point to a spot where a curve cause the huge trunk to rise about a foot from the surface of the snow under which be a round hole cut through the drift snow down to the earth and in which be deposit several buffalo robe and so arrange that a person could repose within without come in contact with the frozen element around mary look down and then at she companion to ascertain he intention he speak to she in a low tone enough of which she comprehend to understand that he desire she to descend into the pit without delay she obey and when he have carefully fold the robe and diver fur about she body he step a few pace to one side and gently lift up a round lid of snow-crust place it over the aperture it have be so smoothly cut and fit with such precision when replace that no one would have be able to discover that a incision have be make he then bid mary a dud by in bad english and set off on a run in a northern direction for the purpose of join the whites with the first light of morning the war-party spring to they foot and hastily despatch a slight repast they set out on they journey with renew animation and increase rapidity before start the chief call to mary and again offer some food but no reply be return or motion discover under the robe which he imagine envelop she he suppose she be sleep and direct the party to select the most even route when they emerge in the prairie that she might as much as possible enjoy she repose the indian who have plan and execute the escape of mary with the well-devised cunning for which the race be proverbial have tell he companion that he would rise before day and pursue the same direction in advance of they and endeavor to kill a deer for they next night 's meal thus he absence create no suspicion and the party continue they precipitate retreat but about noon after cast many glance back at the supposed form of the captive recline peacefully in the snow-canoe the chief with much excitement betray by he look which seem to be mingle with a apprehension that she be dead abruptly order the party to halt he spring to the canoe and convulsively tear away the skin discover only the roll of snow he at first compress he lip in momentary rage and then burst into a fit of irrepressible laughter but the rest rave and stamp and utter direful imprecation and threat of vengeance immediately they be aware of the treachery of the absent indian and resolve with one voice that he blood should be a atonement for the act the snow be quickly throw out and the war-party adjust they weapon with the expectation of encounter the whites and then whirling about they retrace they step far more swiftly than they have be advance just as the night be set in they come in sight of the grove where they have encamp they slacken they pace and look eagerly forward seem to think it not improbable that the whites have arrive in the vicinity and might be lie in ambush await they return in search of the maid they then abandon the canoe after have conceal it under some low bush and enter the grove in a stoop and watchful posture ere long the chief attain the immediate neighbor of the spreading tree and with a arrow draw to its head creep within a few pace of the spot where he have lie the precede night he party be mostly a few foot in the rear while a few be approach in the same manner from the opposite direction hearing no sound whatever he rise up slowly and with a ugh of disappointment stride carelessly across the silent and untenanted place of encampment vexation and anger be express by the savage in be thus disappointed they hope to wreak they vengeance on the whites and resolve to recapture the maiden where they expect to find they the scene be silent and desolate and they now saunter about under the tree in the partial light of the moon that struggle through the mat branch threaten in the most horrid manner the one who have thus baffle they some strike they tomahawk into the trunk of tree while other brandish they knife and utter direful threat the young chief stand in silence with he arm fold on he breast a small ray of light that fall upon he face exhibit a meditative brow and feature express both firmness and determination he have say that the captive should be regain and he follower ever and anon regard he thoughtful attitude with the confidence that he decision would hasten the accomplishment of they desire long he remain thus motionless and dignified and no one dare to address he the young chief call one of the oldest of the party who be stand a few pace distant absorb in think to he side and after a short conference the old savage prostrated himself on the snow and endeavor like a hound to scent the track of he recreant brother at first he meet with no success but when make a wide circuit round the premise still apply he nose to the ground occasionally and minutely examine the bush he pause abruptly and announce to the party that he have find the precise direction take by the maid and she deliverer instantly they all cluster round he evince the most intense interest some smell the surface of the snow and other examine the bush small twig not larger than pin be pick up and closely scrutinize they well know that anyone pass through the frozen and cluster bush must inevitably sever some of the twig and bud they progress be slow but unerr the course they pursue be the direction take by mary and she rescuer it be not long before they arrive within a few foot of the place of the maiden 's concealment but now they be at fault there be no bush immediately around the fall tree they pause the chief in the van with they bow and arrow and tomahawk in readiness for instant use they know that the maiden could not return to she friend on foot or the treacherous savage be able to bear she far on he shoulder they think that one or both must be conceal somewhere in the neighborhood and the fall tree be it hollow be the place most likely to be select for that purpose after scan the fall trunk a few minute in silence and discover nothing to realize they hope they utter a terrific yell and commence strike they tomahawk in the wood and rip up the bark in quest of some hiding-place but they search be in vain the fall trunk be sound and solid throughout and the young chief sit down on it within three pace of mary other in pass about frequently tread on the very verge of the conceal pit mary be awaken by the yell but know not that the sound come from she enemy the indian have tell she that he would soon return and she heart now flutter with the hope that she father and she friend be at hand yet she prudently determine not to rush from she concealment until she be better assure of the fact she do not think that the savage would ever suspect that she be hide under the snow but yet she think it very strange that she father do not come to she at once several minute have elapse since she have be startle by the sound in the immediate vicinity she hear the tramp of man almost directly over she head and the stroke against the fall trunk she be several time on the eve of rise up but be as often withhold by some mysterious impulse she endeavor to reflect calmly but still she could not by any mode of conjecture realize the probability of she foe have return and trace she thither yet a undefinable fear still possess she and she endeavor with patience to await the pleasure of she friend but when the chief seat himself in she vicinity and fall into one of he fit of abstraction and the whole party become comparatively still and hush the poor girl 's suspense be almost insufferable she know that human being be all around she and yet she situation be truly pitiable and lonely she feel assure that if the war-party have return in pursuit of she the means which enable they to trace they victim to the fall trunk would likewise have suffice to indicate she hiding place then why should they hesitate the yell that awaken she be not hear distinctly and under the circumstance she could not believe that she be surround by savage on the other hand if they be she friend why do they not relieve she now a sudden but alas erroneous thought occur to she she be persuade that they be she friend but that the friendly indian be not with they -- he have perhaps direct they where she could be find and then return to he home might not she friend at that moment be anxiously search for she would not one word suffice to dispel they solicitude and restore the lose one to they arm she resolve to speak bow down she head slightly so that she precise location might not instantly be ascertain she utter in a soft voice the word father the chief spring from he seat and the party be instantly in commotion some of the savage look above among the twine branch and some shoot they arrow in the snow but fortunately not in the direction of mary while other run about in every direction examine all the large tree in the vicinity the chief be amaze and utterly confound he draw not forth a arrow nor brandish a tomahawk while he thus stand and the rest of the party be move hurriedly about a few pace distant mary again repeat the word father as suddenly as if by enchantment every savage be paralyzed each stand as devoid of animation as a statue for many moment a intense silence reign as if naught exist there but the cheerless forest tree slowly at length the tomahawk be return to the belt and the arrow to the quiver no longer be a desire to spill blood manifest the dusky child of the forest attribute to the mysterious sound a supernatural agency they believe it be a voice from the perennial hunting grounds humbly they bow they head and whisper devotions to the great spirit the young chief alone stand erect he gaze at the round moon above he and sigh burst from he breast and burning tear run down he stain cheek impatiently by a motion of the hand he direct the savage to leave he and when they withdraw he resume he seat on the fall trunk and recline he brow upon he hand one of the long feather that deck he head wave forward after he have be seat thus a few minute and when he eye rest upon it he start up wildly and tear it away trample it under he foot at that instant the same father be again hear the young chief fall upon he knee and while he pant convulsively say in english father mother i be you poor william -- you love I much -- where be you oh tell I -- i will come to you -- i want to see you he then fall prostrate and groan piteously father oh where be you whose voice be that say mary break through the slight incrustation that obscure she and leap from she covert the young chief spring from the earth -- gaze a moment at the maid -- speak rapidly and loudly in the language of he tribe to he party who be now at the place of encampment seat by the fire they have kindle -- and then seize he tomahawk be in the act of hurl it at mary when the yell of the war-party and the ringing discharge of fire-arm arrest he steel when brandish in the air the white man have arrive the young chief seize mary by she long flow hair -- again prepare to strike the fatal blow -- when she turn she face upward and he again hesitate discharge in quick succession and nearer than before still ring in he ear mary strive not to escape nor do the indian strike the whites be hear rush through the bush -- the chief seize the tremble girl in he arm -- a bullet whiz by he head -- but unmindful of danger he vanish among the dark bush with he burden she be go she be go exclaimed roughgrove look aghast at the vacate pit under the fall trunk but we will have she yet say boone as he hear glenn discharge a pistol a few pace apart in the bush the report be follow by a yell not from the chief but sneak and the next moment the rifle of the latter be likewise hear still the indian be not dispatch for the instant afterward he tomahawk which have be hurl without effect come sailing over the bush and penetrate a tree hard by some fifteen or twenty foot above the earth where it enter the wood with such a force that it remain firmly fix now succeed a struggle -- a violent blow be hear -- the fall of the indian and all be still a minute afterward sneak emerge from the thicket bearing mary in he arm and follow by glenn be she dead oh she be dead cry roughgrove snatch she from the arm of sneak she have only fainted exclaimed glenn examine the body of the girl and finding no wound she be recover say boone feeling she pulse god be praise exclaimed roughgrove when return animation be manifest oh i know you will not kill I for pity 's sake spare I say mary it be you father my poor child say roughgrove press the girl to he heart it be it be cry the happy girl cling rapturously to the old man 's neck and then seize the hand of the rest she seem to be half wild with delight shipwreck of the medusa on the 17th of June 1816 the medusa french frigate command by captain chaumarey and accompany by three smaller vessel sail from the island of aix for the coast of africa in order to take possession of some colony on the 1st of July they enter the tropics and there with a childish disregard to danger and know that she be surround by all the unseen peril of the ocean she crew perform the ceremony usual to the occasion while the vessel be run headlong on destruction the captain preside over the disgraceful scene of merriment leave the ship to the command of a m richefort who have pass the ten precede year of he life in a english prison -- a few person on board remonstrate in vain though it be ascertain that they be on the bank of arguise she continue she course and heave the lead without slacken the sail every thing denote shallow water but m richefort persist in say that they be in one hundred fathom at that very moment only six fathom be find and the vessel strike three time be in about sixteen foot water and the tide full flood at ebb-tide there remain but twelve foot water and after some bungling maneuver all hope of get the ship off be abandon when the frigate strike she have on board six boat of various capacity all of which could not contain the crew and passenger and a raft be construct a dreadful scene ensue all scramble out of the wreck without order or precaution the first who reach the boat refuse to admit any of they fellow-sufferer into they though there be ample room for more some apprehend that a plot have be form to abandon they in the vessel fly to arm no one assist he companion and captain chaumarey steal out of a port-hole into he own boat leave a great part of the crew to shift for themselves at length they put off to sea intend to steer for the sandy coast of the desert there to land and thence to proceed with a caravan to the island of st loui the raft have be construct without foresight or intelligence it be about sixty-five foot long and twenty-five broad but the only part which could be depend upon be the middle and that be so small that fifteen person could not lie down upon it those who stand on the floor be in constant danger of slip through between the plank the sea flow in on all its side when one hundred and fifty passenger who be destine to be its burden be on board they stand like a solid parallelogram without a possibility of move and they be up to they waist in water the desperate squadron have only proceed three league when a faulty if not treacherous maneuver break the tow-line which fasten the captain 's boat to the raft and this become the signal to all to let loose they cable the weather be calm the coast be know to be but twelve or fifteen league distant and the land be in fact discover by the boat on the very same evening on which they abandon the raft they be not therefore drive to this measure by any new peril and the cry of _ nous les abandonons _ which resound throughout the line be the yell of a spontaneous and instinctive impulse of cowardice perfidy and cruelty and the impulse be as unanimous as it be diabolical the raft be leave to the mercy of the wave one after another the boat disappear and despair become general not one of the promise article no provision except a very few cask of wine and some spoil biscuit sufficient for one single meal be find a small pocket compass which chance have discover they last guide in a trackless ocean fall between the beam into the sea as the crew have take no nourishment since morning some wine and biscuit be distribute and this day the first of thirteen on the raft be the last on which they taste any solid food -- except such as human nature shudder at the only thing which keep they alive be the hope of revenge on those who have treacherously betray they the first night be stormy and the wave which have free access commit dreadful ravages and threaten worse when day appear twelve miserable wretch be find crushed to death between the opening of the raft and several more be miss but the number could not be ascertain as several soldier have take the billet of the dead in order to obtain two or even three ration the second night be still more dreadful and many be wash off although the crew have so crowd together that some be smother by the mere pressure to soothe they last moment the soldier drink immoderately and one who affect to rest himself upon the side but be treacherously cut the rope be throw into the sea another whom m correard have snatch from the wave turn traitor a second time as soon as he recover he sens but he too be kill at length the revolt who be chiefly soldier throw themselves upon they knee and abjectly implored mercy at midnight however they rebel again those who have no arm fight with they tooth and thus many severe wound be inflict one be most wantonly and dreadfully bite above the heel while he companion be beat he upon the head with they carbine before throw he into the sea the raft be strew with dead body after innumerable instance of treachery and cruelty and from sixty to sixty-five perish that night the force and courage of the strongest begin to yield to they misfortune and even the most resolute labor under mental derangement in the conflict the revolt have throw two cask of wine and all the remain water into the sea and it become necessary to diminish each man 's share a day of comparative tranquillity succeed the survivor erect they mast again which have be wantonly cut down in the battle of the night and endeavor to catch some fish but in vain they be reduce to feed on the dead body of they companion a third night follow break by the plaintive cry of wretch expose to every kind of suffer ten or twelve of whom die of want and awfully foretell the fate of the remainder the follow day be fine some fly fish be catch in the raft which mix up with human flesh afford one scanty meal -lrb- illustration -rrb- a new insurrection to destroy the raft break out on the fourth night this too be mark by perfidy and end in blood most of the rebel be throw into the sea the fifth morning muster but thirty man alive and these sick and wound with the skin of they lower extremity corrode by the salt water two soldier be detect drink the wine of the only remain cask they be instantly throw into the sea one boy die and there remain only twenty-seven of whom fifteen only seem likely to live a council of war precede by the most horrid despair be hold as the weak consume a part of the common store they determine to throw they into the sea this sentence be put into immediate execution and all the arm on board which now fill they mind with horror be with the exception of a single sabre commit to the deep distress and misery increase with a accelerate ratio and even after the desperate means of destroy they companion and eat the most nauseous aliment the survive fifteen could not hope for more than a few day ' existence a butterfly light on they sail the ninth day and though it be hold to be a messenger of good yet many a greedy eye be cast upon it three day more pass over in inexpressible anguish when they construct a smaller and more manageable raft in the hope of direct it to the shore but on trial it be find insufficient on the seventeenth day a brig be see which after exciting the vicissitude of hope and fear prove to be the argus send out in quest of the medusa the inhabitant of the raft be all receive on board and be again very nearly perish by a fire which break out in the night the six boat which have so cruelly cast they adrift reach the coast of africa in safety and after many danger among the moor the survivor arrive at st loui after this a vessel be dispatch to the wreck of the medusa to carry away the money and provision after beat about for eight day she be force to return she again put to sea but after be away five day again come back ten day more be lose in repair she and she do not reach the spot till fifty-two day after the vessel have be lose and dreadful to relate three miserable sufferer be find on board sixty man have be abandon there by they magnanimous countryman all these have be carry off except seventeen some of whom be drunk and other refuse to leave the vessel they remain at peace as long as they provision last twelve embark on board a raft for sahara and be never more hear of another put to sea on a hen-coop and sink immediately four remain behind one of whom exhaust with hunger and fatigue perish the other three live in separate corner of the wreck and never meet but to run at each other with draw _ knife _ they be put on board the vessel with all that could be save from the wreck of the medusa the vessel be no sooner see return to st loui than every heart beat high with joy in the hope of recover some property the man and officer of the medusa jump on board and ask if any thing have be save yes be the reply but it be all ours now and the naked frenchman whose calamity have find pity from the moor of the desert be now deliberately plunder by they own countryman a fair be hold in the town which last eight day the clothes furniture and necessary article of life belong to the man and officer of the medusa be publicly sell before they face such of the french as be able proceed to the camp at daceard and the sick remain at st loui the french governor have promise they clothes and provision but send none and during five month they owe they existence to stranger -- to the british hunting the moose the habit of the moose in he manner of defense and attack be similar to those of the stag and may be illustrate by the follow anecdote from the random sketch of a kentuckian : who ever see bravo without love he he sloe-black eye he glossy skin fleck here and there with blue he wide-spread thigh clean shoulder broad back and low-drooping chest bespeak he the true stag-hound and none who ever see he bound form or hear he deep-toned bay as the swift-footed stag fly before he would dispute he title list gentle reader and i will tell you a adventure which will make you love he all the more a bright frosty morning in November 1838 tempt I to visit the forest hunting-grounds on this occasion i be follow by a fine-looking hound which have be present to I a few day before by a fellow-sportsman i be anxious to test he quality and know that a mean dog will not often hunt well with a good one i have tie up the eager bravo and be attend by the strange dog alone a brisk canter of half a hour bring I to the wild forest hill slacken the rein i slowly wind my way up a brushy slope some three hundred yard in length i have ascend about half way when the hound begin to exhibit sign of uneasiness and at the same instant a stag spring out from some underbrush near by and rush like a whirlwind up the slope a word and the hound be crouch at my foot and my trained cherokee with ear erect and flash eye watch the course of the affrighted animal on the very summit of the ridge full one hundred and fifty yard every limb stand out in bold relief against the clear blue sky the stag pause and look proudly down upon

and a smooth sea we weigh from we station in company with the saldanha frigate of thirty-eight gun captain packenham with a crew of three hundred man on a cruise as be intend of twenty day -- the saldanha take a westerly course while we stand in the opposite direction we have scarcely get out of the lock and clear the head however when we plunge at once into all the misery of a gale of wind blow from the west during the three follow day it continue to increase in violence when the island of coll and tiree become visible to we as the wind have now chop round more to the north and continue unabated in violence the danger of get involve among the numerous small island and rugged headland on the northwest coast of inverness-shire become evident it be therefore deem expedient to wear the ship round and make a port with all expedition with this view and favor by the wind a course be shape for lochswilly and away we scud under close-reefed foresail and main-topsail follow by a tremendous sea which threaten every moment to overwhelm we and accompany by pierce shower of hail and a gale which blow with incredible fury the same course be steer until next day about noon when land be see on the lee-bow the weather be thick some time elapse before it could be distinctly make out and it be then ascertain to be the island of north arran on the coast of donegal westward of lochswilly the ship be therefore haul up some point and we yet entertain hope of reach a anchorage before nightfall when the weather gradually thicken and the sea now that we be upon the wind break over we in all direction its violence be such that in a few minute several of we port be stove in at which the water pour in in great abundance until it be actually breast high on the lee-side of the main deck fortunately but little get below and the ship be relieve by take in the foresail but a dreadful addition be now make to the precariousness of we situation by the cry of land a-head which be see from the forecastle and must have be very near not a moment be now lose in wear the ship round on the other tack and make what little sail could be carry to weather the land we have already pass this soon prove however to be a forlorn prospect for it be find that we should run we distance by ten o'clock all the horror of shipwreck now stare we in the face aggravate tenfold by the darkness of the night and the tremendous force of the wind which now blow a hurricane mountain be insignificant when speaking of the sea that keep pace with it its violence be awful beyond description and it frequently break over all the poor little ship that shiver and groan but behave admirably the force of the sea may be guess from the fact of the sheet-anchor nearly a ton and a half in weight be actually lift on board to say nothing of the forechain-plate ' board break both gangway tear away quarter-galleries stove in & c in short on get into port the vessel be find to be loosen through all she frame and leak at every seam as far as depend on she good quality however i feel assure at the time we be safe for i have see enough of the talbot to be convince we be in one of the finest sea-boat that ever swim but what could all the skill of the ship-builder avail in a situation like ours with a night full fifteen hour long before we and know that we be fast drive on the land anxiety and dread be on every face and every mind feel the terror of uncertainty and suspense at length about twelve o'clock the dreadful truth be disclose to we judge of my sensation when i see the frown rock of arran scarcely half a mile distant on we lee-bow to we inexpressible relief and not less to we surprise we fairly weather all and be congratulating each other on we escape when on look forward i imagine i saw breaker at no great distance on we lee and this suspicion be soon confirm when the moon which shine at interval suddenly break out from behind a cloud and present to we a most terrific spectacle at not more than a quarter of a mile 's distance on we lee-beam appear a range of tremendous breaker among which it seem as if every sea would throw we they height it may be guess be prodigious when they could be clearly distinguish from the foam water of the surround ocean it be a scene seldom to be witness and never forget lord have mercy upon we be now on the lip of every one -- destruction seem inevitable captain swaine whose coolness i have never see surpass issue he order clearly and collectedly when it be propose as a last resource to drop the anchor cut away the mast and trust to the chance of ride out the gale this scheme be actually determine on and every thing be in readiness but happily be defer until a experiment be try aloft in addition to the close-reefed main-topsail and foresail the fore-topsail and trysail be now set and the result be almost magical with a few plunge we clear not only the reef but a huge rock upon which i could with ease have toss a biscuit and in a few minute we be inexpressibly rejoice to see both far astern we have now miraculously escape all but certain destruction a second time but much be yet to be fear we have still to pass cape jeller and the moment drag on in gloomy apprehension and anxious suspense the ship carry sail most wonderfully and we continue to go along at the rate of seven knot ship very heavy sea and labor much -- all with much solicitude look out for daylight the dawn at length appear and to we great joy we see the land several mile astern have pass the cape and many other hidden danger during the darkness matter on the morning of the 5th assume a very different aspect from that which we have experience for the last two day the wind gradually subside and with it the sea and a favorable breeze now spring up we be enable to make a good offing fortunately no accident of consequence occur although several of we people be severely bruise by fall poor fellow they certainly suffer enough not a dry stitch not a dry hammock have they have since we sail happily however they misfortune be soon forget in a dry shirt and a can of grog the most melancholy part of the narrative be still to be tell on come up to we anchorage we observe a unusual degree of curiosity and bustle in the fort crowd of people be congregate on both side run to and fro examine we through spyglass in short a extraordinary commotion be apparent the meaning of all this be but too soon make know to we by a boat come alongside from which we learn that the unfortunate saldanha have go to piece and every man perish we own destruction have likewise be reckon inevitable from the time of the discovery of the unhappy fate of we consort five day beforehand and hence the astonishment at we unexpected return from all that could be learn concern the dreadful catastrophe i be incline to believe that the saldanha have be drive on the rock about the time we doom appear so certain in another quarter she light

drink about half a pint of whiskey be give he by the people which almost instantly kill he poor packenham 's body be recognize amid the other and like these strip quite naked by the inhuman wretch who flock to the wreck as to a blessing it be even suspect that he come on shore alive but be strip and leave to perish nothing could equal the audacity of the plunderer although a party of the lanark militia be do duty around the wreck but this be a ungracious and revolting subject which no one of proper feeling would wish to dwell upon still less be i incline to describe the heart-rending scene

swarm of wasp fly suddenly out buzz and hum fiercely and in a moment they begin to settle on the move object the horse commence switch he tail to drive they away prick up he ear and snort with terror the man on the path lay quite still until they have thus move on a few yard and then he raise he head a little and watch they with he keen black eye the wasp drive off for a moment become only the more irritated and return with vigor and wonderful pertinacity to the attack -- begin to sting the poor animal furiously in all the tender part they assail the wretched master in he turn dart they venomed barb into he face and hand and drive he nearly frantic the horse plunge furiously and jack diver lose he stirrup and he presence of mind together twist he hand into the horse 's mane to keep he seat let the rein fall on he neck at last with a rear and a bind into the air the madden animal dart off at a gallop but the faster he go the closer stick the persevere wasp jack diver shut he eye

make a desperate resistance and do all that be possible for man to do who be in they situation but they be finally overpower with the loss of one hundred a eighty-six man the freshet the freshet at bangor I in the spring of 1846 be thus describe in forest life and forest tree : the first injury to the city be from the break away of a small section of the jam which come down and press against the ice on we bank by this twenty house in one immediate neighborhood on the west bank of the river alone be at once inundate but without loss of life this occur in the daytime and present a scene of magnificent interest the effect of this small concussion upon the ice near the city be terrific the water rise instantly to such a height as to sweep the building and lumber from the end of the wharf and to throw up the ice in huge sheet and pyramid this shock be resist by the great covered bridge on the penobscot which be about one thousand foot in length and this give time to save much property but meanwhile another auxiliary to the fearful work have be prepare by the break up of the ice in the kenduskeag river this river flow through the heart of the city divide it into two equal portion the whole flat on the margin of the river be cover with store and public building and be the place of merchandise for the city the kenduskeag run nearly at right angle with the penobscot at the point where they unite the penobscot skirt the city on the eastern side and on the bank of this river be the principal wharf for the deposit of lumber i must mention another circumstance to give you a just idea of we situation there be a narrow spot in the river about a mile below the city at high head in which be a shoal and from which the greatest danger of a jam always arise and it be this that cause the principal inundation the next incident occur at midnight when the bell be ring to announce the give way of the ice it be a fearful sound and scene the street be throng with man woman and child who rush abroad to witness the approach of the icy avalanche at length it come rush on with a power that a thousand locomotive in a body could not vie with but it be vail from the eye by the darkness of a hazy night and the ear only could trace its progress by the sound of crash building lumber and whatever it encounter in its pathway except the glimpse that could be catch of it by the light of hundred of torch and lantern that throw they glare upon the misty atmosphere the jam pass on and a portion of it press through the weakest portion of the great bridge and thus join the ice below the bridge press it down to the narrow at high head the destruction meanwhile be in progress on the kenduskeag which pour down its tributary ice sweeping mill bridge shop and other building with mass of log and lumber to add to the common wreck at that moment the anxiety and suspense be fearful whether the jam would force its way through the narrow or there stop and pour back a flood of water upon the city for it be from the rise of the water consequent upon such a jam that the great destruction be to be apprehend but the suspense be soon over a cry be hear from the dense mass of citizen who crowd the street on the flat the river be flow back and so sudden be the revulsion that it require the utmost speed to escape the rise water it seem but a moment before the entire flat be deluge and many man do not escape from they store before the water be up to they waist have you witness the scene occur as it do in the midst of a dark and hazy night and have you hear the rush of the water and the crash of the ruin and see the multitude retreat in a mass from the return flood illumine only by the glare of torch and lantern and listen to the shout and cry that escape from they to give the alarm to those beyond you would not be surprise at my be remind of the host of pharaoh as they flee and send up they cry from the red sea as it return upon they in its strength the closing scene of this dreadful disaster occur on Sunday evening begin at about seven o'clock the alarm be again ring through the street that the jam have give way the citizen again rush abroad to witness what they know must be one of the most sublime and awful scene of nature and also to learn the full extent of they calamity few however be able to catch a sight of the break up of the jam which for magnitude it be certain have not occur on this river for more than one hundred year the whole river be like a boiling cauldron with mass of ice upheave as by a volcano but soon the darkness shroud the scene in part the ear however could hear the roaring of the water and the crash of building bridge and lumber and the eye could trace the mammoth ice-jam of four mile long which pass on majestically but with lightning rapidity bear the contents of both river on its bosom the noble covered bridge of the penobscot two bridge of the kenduskeag and the two long range of saw-mill besides other mill house shop log and lumber enough to build up a considerable village the new market float over the lower bridge across the kenduskeag a part of which remain and most happily land at a point of the wharf where it sink and form the nucleus of a sort of boom which stop the mass of float lumber in the kenduskeag and protect thousand of dollar ' worth of lumber on the wharf below the panther 's den the occupant of a few log cabin in the vicinity of the bayou manlatte a tributary of the noble bay of pensacolum situate in the western part of the then territory of florida have be for some week annoy by the mysterious disappearance of the cattle and goat which constitute almost the only wealth of these rude countryman and the belated herdsman be frequently startle by the terrible half human cry of the dreaded panther and the next morning some one of the squatter would find himself minus of a number of cloven foot about this time i happen into the settlement on a hunting excursion in company with another son of nimrod and learn the state of affair resolve if possible to rid the clearing of its pest and bind new laurel on we brow the night before we arrival a heifer have be kill within a few rod of the cabin and the carcass drag off toward the swamp some two mile distant leave a broad trail to mark the destroyer 's path this be point out to we ned and myself resolve to execute we enterprise without delay -- this be to beard the lion in he den have carefully charge we rifle and pistol and see that we bowy be as keen as razor we set out on the trail which soon bring we to the edge of the bayou manlatte swamp -- which cover a surface of some thousand of acre be a dense muddy hammock of tetus bay magnolia cane grape vine & c a perpetual twilight reign beneath the dense foliage support by the rank soil and we heart beat a few more pulsation to the minute as we leave the scorching glare of the noon day sun and plunge into the gloomy fastness of the bear and alligator to these latter gentleman whose clumsy form be sprawl through the mud on every side we give no further heed other than to keep without the range of the deadly sweep of they powerful tail with which they bring they unsuspecting prey within reach of they saw-like jaw the bear we do not happen to meet or we should most assuredly have give they some of the ball design for the panther well we follow the trail half a mile into the swamp when on a elevated spot we suddenly encounter the half-devoured body of the unfortunate heifer apparently just desert by the captor we cautiously advance a few pace further over a pavement of bone clean scrape and meatless and enter a open space when a sight meet my eye which certainly make I wish myself safe at home or in fact anywhere else but where i be about twenty-five foot from we we see instead of one a old she-panther and two cub nearly grow while directly over they on the blast and slope trunk of a immense gum-tree crouch the old he one of all lash he side fiercely with he tail and snort and spit like a enraged cat a example which be imitate by the three below here be a dilemma on the particularly sharp horn of which we find ourselves most uncomfortably situate to retreat would induce a immediate attack the consequence of a advance would be ditto so we stand _ en tableau _ for a brief second we gun cock and aim ned draw a bead on the dam while i do the same on the sire it seem madness to fire we be not long uncertain as to we course for the old fellow suddenly bound from the trunk upon I with a deafening roar i fire as he spring and the report of my piece be re-echoed by that of ned 's i spring aside drop my rifle and draw my long and heavy knife it be well i do so for the mortally-wounded beast alight on the very spot i have leave he turn and spring upon I i avoid the blow of its powerful paw and grapple with he i roll on the turf wind my right arm tight around he neck and hug close to he body to avoid he tooth and claw while i deal rapid thrust with my knife i be very powerful but never be in a situation where i feel more sensibly the need of exert all my muscle the contest be soon decide -- my knife pass through the brute 's heart -- and pant from the dreadful close and breathless all the champion rise and it be full time that i should do so for ned have put a ball through the head of the dam be now manfully battle with she two cub the poor fellow be sore press streaming with blood from numberless scratch and almost in a state of nature for the sharp claw of the cub have literally undressed he by piecemeal he savage assailant also bear upon they bloody hide numerous token of he prowess in wield he bowie they system of attack seem to be to spring suddenly upon he striking with they paw and as they do so in most instance simultaneously it be impossible for he to defend himself strong and active as he be and have no assistance be at hand they would undoubtedly have gain the victory it be a brave sight though to see the tall strong hunter meet they attack undauntedly stand with he left arm raise to defend he head and throat and dart he knife into they tough body as he throw they from he but to meet the next moment they renew effort for he destruction all this i catch at one glance as i rush to he rescue ned shout i mad and reckless with excitement take the one on you left and we throw ourselves upon they i meet my antagonist in he onward leap and make a desperate blow at he my wrist strike he paw and the knife fly far from my hand there be nothing else for I but to seize he by the loose skin of the neck with both hand and hold on like grim death keep he at arm 's length while he paw beat a tattoo to a double quick time on my breast and body strip my garment into ribbon in a most workmanlike manner and ornament my sensitive skin with a variety of line and character do in red -- a process which i do not care to prolong however beyond a period when i could soonest put a stop to the operation as i be debate how to attain so desirable a end the remembrance of the small rifle pistol in my belt and which till now in the hurry of the conflict i have forget suddenly flash upon my mind and disengage one hand i draw it forth cock it with my thumb and the next moment the panther 's brain be spatter in my face i turn to look for ned and find he try to free himself from the dead body of the panther whose tooth be fasten in they death grip to the small remnant of he hunting coat which hang around he neck i separate the strip of cloth with my recover knife and we sink pant to the ground while we heart go up in thankfulness for deliverance from so imminent danger to life and limb after rest awhile we wash the blood -- we blood -- from we body and decorate they with what be leave somewhat after the fashion of the indian who wear only a breech clout we take the scalp of the four panther and start on we homeward march we success be speedily know in the clearing and in the evening a barbecue be have in oar honor to furnish which a relation of the unfortunate heifer meet with a fate scarcely less terrible this exploit add not little to we reputation among the hunter folk adventure with elephant on the 27th as day dawn say mr cumming i leave my shooting-hole and proceed to inspect the spoor of my wounded rhinoceros after follow it for some distance i come to a abrupt hillock and fancy that from the summit a good view might be obtain of the surrounding country i leave my follower to seek the spoor while i ascended i do not raise my eye from the ground until i have reach the highest pinnacle of rock i then look east and to my inexpressible gratification behold a troup of nine or ten elephant quietly browse within a quarter of a mile of I i allow myself only one glance at they and then rush down to warn my follower to be silent a council of war be hastily hold the result of which be my order isaac to ride hard to camp with instruction to return as quickly as possible accompany by kleinboy and to bring I my dog the large dutch rifle and a fresh horse i once more ascend the hillock to feast my eye upon the enchanting sight before I and draw out my spy-glass narrowly watch the motion of the elephant the herd consist entirely of female several of which be follow by small calf presently on reconnoiter the surrounding country i discover a second herd consist of five bull elephant which be quietly feed about a mile to the northward the cow be feed toward a rocky ridge that stretch away from the base of the hillock on which i stand burning with impatience to commence the attack i resolve to try the stalk system with these and to hunt the troop of bull with dog and horse have thus decide i direct the guide to watch the elephant from the summit of the hillock and with a beating heart i approach they the ground and wind favor I i soon gain the rocky ridge toward which they be feed they be now within one hundred yard and i resolve to enjoy the pleasure of watch they movement for a little before i fire they continue to feed slowly toward I break the branch from the tree with they trunk and eat the leaf and tender shoot i soon select the finest in the herd and keep my eye on she in particular at length two of the troup have walk slowly past at about sixty yard and the one which i have select be feed with two other on a thorny tree before I my hand be now as steady as the rock on which it rest so take a deliberate aim i let fly at she head a little behind the eye she get it hard and sharp just where i aim but it do not seem to affect she much utter a loud cry she wheel about when i give she the second ball close behind the shoulder all the elephant utter a strange rumble noise and make off in a line to the northward at a brisk ambling pace they huge fan-like ear flap in the ratio of they speed i do not wait to load but run back to the hillock to obtain a view on gain its summit the guide point out the elephant : they be stand in a grove of shady tree but the wound one be some distance behind with another elephant doubtless its particular friend who be endeavor to assist it these elephant have probably never before hear the report of a gun and have neither see nor smell I they be unaware of the presence of man and do not seem inclined to go any further presently my man heave in sight bring the dog and when these come up i wait some time before commence the attack that the dog and horse might recover they wind we then ride slowly toward the elephant and have advance within two hundred yard of they when the ground be open they observe we and make off in a easterly direction but the wound one immediately drop astern and the next moment be surround by the dog which bark angrily seem to engross all she attention have place myself between she and the retreat troop i dismount to fire within forty yard of she in open ground colesberg be extremely afraid of the elephant and give I much trouble jerk my arm when i try to fire at length i let fly but on endeavor to regain my saddle colesberg decline to allow I to mount and when i try to lead he and run for it he only back toward the wounded elephant at this moment i hear another elephant close behind and look about i beheld the friend with uplifted trunk charge down upon I at top speed shrilly trumpet and follow a old black pointer name schwart that be perfectly deaf and trot along before the enraged elephant quite unaware of what be behind he i feel certain that she would have either I or my horse i however determine not to relinquish my steed but to hold on by the bridle my man who of course keep at a safe distance stand aghast with they mouth open and for a few seconds my position be certainly not a enviable one fortunately however the dog take off the attention of the elephant and just as they be upon I i manage to spring into the saddle where i be safe as i turn my back to mount the elephant be so very near that i really expect to feel one of they trunk lay hold of I i ride up to kleinboy for my double-barreled two-grooved rifle : he and isaac be pale and almost speechless with fright return to the charge i be soon once more alongside and firing from the saddle i send another brace of bullet into the wounded elephant colesberg be extremely unsteady and destroy the correctness of my aim -lrb- illustration : charge of the elephant -rrb- the friend now seem resolve to do some mischief and charge I furiously pursue I to a distance of several hundred yard i therefore deem it proper to give she a gentle hint to act less officiously and accordingly have load i approach within thirty yard and give it she sharp right and leave behind the shoulder upon which she at once make off with droop trunk evidently with a mortal wound i never recur to this day 's elephant shooting without regret my folly in content myself with secure only one elephant the first be now die and could not leave the ground and the second be also mortally wound and i have only to follow and finish she but i foolishly allow she to escape while i amuse myself with the first which keep walk backward and standing by every tree she pass two more shot finish she : on receive they she toss she trunk up and down two or three time and fall on she broadside against a thorny tree which yield like grass before she enormous weight she utter a deep hoarse cry and expire this be a very handsome old cow elephant and be decidedly the best in the troop she be in excellent condition and carry a pair of long and perfect tusk i be in high spirit at my success and feel so perfectly satisfy with have kill one that although it be still early in the day and my horse be fresh i allow the troop of five bull to remain unmolested foolishly trust to fall in with they next day the shark sentinel with my companion one beautiful afternoon ramble over the rocky cliff at the back of the island -lrb- new providence wus -rrb- we come to a spot where the stillness and the clear transparency of the water invite we to bathe it be not deep as we stand above on the promontory we could see the bottom in every part under the headland which form the opposite side of the cove there be a cavern to which as the shore be steep there be no access but by swimming and we resolve to explore it we soon reach its mouth and be enchant with its romantic grandeur and wild beauty it extend we find a long way back and have several natural bath into all of which we successively throw ourselves each as they recede further from the mouth of the cavern be colder than the last the tide it be evident have free ingress and renew the water every twelve hour here we thoughtlessly amuse ourselves for some time at length the decline sun warn we that it be time to take we departure from the cave when at no great distance from we we see the back or dorsal fin of a monstrous shark above the surface of the water and he whole length visible beneath it we look at he and at each other in dismay hope that he would soon take he departure and go in search of other prey but the rogue swam to and fro just like a frigate blockade a enemy 's port the sentinel parade before we about ten or fifteen yard in front of the cave tack and tack wait only to serve one if not both of we as we should have serve a shrimp or a oyster we have no intention however in this as in other instance of throw ourselves on the mercy of the court in vain do we look for relief from other quarter the promontory above we be inaccessible the tide be rise and the sun touch the clear blue edge of the horizon i be the leader pretend to a little knowledge in ichthyology and tell my companion that fish could hear as well as see and that therefore the less we say the better and the sooner we retreat out of he sight the sooner he would take himself off this be we only chance and that a poor one for the flow of the water would soon have enable he to enter the cave and help himself as he seem perfectly acquaint with the _ locale _ and know that we have no mode of retreat but by the way we come we draw back out of sight and i do not know when i ever pass a more unpleasant quarter of a hour a suit in chancery or even a spring lounge at newgate would have be almost a luxury to what i feel when the shades of night begin to darken the mouth of we cave and this infernal monster continue to parade like a water-bailiff before its door at last not see the shark 's fin above the water i make a sign to charle that cost what it might we must swim for it for we have notice to quit by the tide and if we do not depart should soon have a execution in the house we have be careful not to utter a word and silently press each other by the hand we slip into the water and recommend ourselves to providence strike out manfully i must own i never feel more assure of destruction not even when i once swim through the blood of a poor sailor -- while the shark be eat he -- for the shark then have something to occupy they but this one have nothing else to do but to look after we -- we have the benefit of he undivided attention my sensation be indescribably horrible i may occasionally write or talk of the circumstance with levity but whenever i recall it to mind i tremble at the bare recollection of the dreadful fate that seem inevitable my companion be not so expert a swimmer as i be so that i distanced he many foot when i hear he utter a faint cry i turn round convinced that the shark have seize he but it be not so my have leave he so far behind have increase he terror and induce he to draw my attention i return to he hold he up and encourage he without this he would certainly have sink he revive with my help and we reach the sandy beach in safety have elude we enemy who when he neither saw nor hear we have as i conclude he would quit the spot once more on terra firma we lay gasp for some minute before we speak what my companion thought be i do not know mine be replete with gratitude to god and renew vow of amendment and i have every reason to think that although charle have not so much room for reform as myself that he feeling be perfectly in unison with my own we never repeat this amusement though we frequently talk of we escape and laugh at we terror yet on these occasion we conversation always take a serious turn and upon the whole i be convince that this adventure do we both a vast deal of good -lrb- illustration : hunting the tiger -rrb- hunting the tiger a gentleman in the civil service of the british east indium company relate the following : when a tiger spring on a elephant the latter be generally able to shake he off under he foot and then woe be to he the elephant either kneel on he and crush he at once or give he a kick which break half he rib and send he fly perhaps twenty pace the elephant however be often dreadfully tear and a large old tiger cling too fast to be thus deal with in this case it often happen that the elephant himself fall from pain or from the hope of roll on he enemy and the people on he back be in very considerable danger both from friend and foe the scratch of a tiger be sometimes venomous as that of a cat be say to be but this do not often happen and in general person wound by he tooth or claw if not kill outright recover easily enough i be at jaffna at the northern extremity of the island of ceylon in the beginning of the year 1819 : when one morning my servant call I a hour or two before my usual time with ` master master people send for master 's dog -- tiger in the town ' now my dog chance to be some very degenerate specimen of a fine species call the _ poligar _ dog which i should designate as a sort of wiry-haired grayhound without scent i keep they to hunt jackal but tiger be very different thing : by the way there be no real tiger in ceylon but leopard and panther be always call so and by ourselves as well as by the native this turn out to be a panther my gun chance not to be put together and while my servant be do it the collector and two medical man who have recently arrive come to my door the former arm with a fowling-piece and the latter with remarkably blunt hog-spear they insist upon set off without wait for my gun a proceeding not much to my taste the tiger -lrb- i must continue to call he so -rrb- have take refuge in a hut the roof of which as those of ceylon hut in general spread to the ground like a umbrella the only aperture into it be a small door about four foot high the collector want to get the tiger out at once i begged to wait for my gun but no -- the fowling-piece -lrb- load with ball of course -rrb- and the two hog-spear be quite enough i get a hedge-stake and await my fate from very shame at this moment to my great delight there arrive from the fort a english officer two artillery-man and a malay captain and a pretty figure we should have cut without they as the event will show i be now quite ready to attack and my gun come a minute afterward the whole scene which follow take place within a enclosure about twenty foot square form on three side by a strong fence of palmyra leave and on the fourth by the hut at the door of this the two artillery-men plant themselves and the malay captain get on the top to frighten the tiger out by worry it -- a easy operation as the hut there be cover with cocoa-nut leave one of the artillery-men want to go in to the tiger but we would not suffer it at last the beast spring this man receive he on he bayonet which he thrust apparently down he throat firing he piece at the same moment the bayonet break off short leave less than three inch on the musket the rest remain in the animal but be invisible to we : the shot probably go through he cheek for it certainly do not seriously injure he as he instantly rise upon he leg with a loud roar and place he paw upon the soldier 's breast at this moment the animal appear to I to about reach the center of the man 's face but i have scarcely time to observe this when the tiger stoop he head seize the soldier 's arm in he mouth turn he half round staggering throw he over on he back and fall upon he we dread now be that if we fire upon the tiger we might kill the man : for a moment there be a pause when he comrade attack the beast exactly in the same manner as the gallant fellow himself have do he strike he bayonet into he head the tiger rise at he -- he fire and this time the ball take effect and in the head the animal stagger backward and we all pour in we fire he still kick and writhe when the gentleman with the hog-spear advance and fix he while the native finish he by beat he on the head with hedge-stake the brave artillery-man be after all but slightly hurt : he claim the skin which be very cheerfully give to he there be however a cry among the native that the head should be cut off : it be and in so do the knife come directly across the bayonet the animal measure scarcely less than four foot from the root of the tail to the muzzle there be no tradition of a tiger have be in jaffna before indeed this one must have either come a distance of almost twenty mile or have swam across a arm of the sea nearly two in breadth for jaffna stand on a peninsula on which there be no jungle of any magnitude indian devil there be a animal in the deep recess of the forest of maine evidently belong to the feline race which on account of its ferocity be significantly call indian devil -- in the indian language the lunk soo a terror to the indian and the only animal in new england of which they stand in dread you may speak of the moose the bear and the wolf even and the red man be ready for the chase and the encounter but name the object of he dread and he will significantly shake he head while he exclaim he all one debil a individual by the name of smith meet with the follow adventure in a encounter with one of these animal on the arromucto while on he way to join a crew engage in timber-making in the wood he have nearly reach the place of encampment when he come suddenly upon one of these ferocious animal there be no chance for retreat neither have he time for reflection on the best method of defense or escape as he have no arm or other weapon of defense he first impulse in this truly fearful position unfortunately perhaps be to spring into a small tree near by but he have scarcely ascend he length when the desperate creature probably render still more fierce by the prompting of hunger spring upon and seize he by the heel smith however after have he foot badly bite disengage it from the shoe which be firmly clinch in the creature 's tooth and let he drop the moment he be disengage smith spring for a more secure position and the animal at the same time leap to another large tree about ten foot distant up which he ascend to a elevation equal to that of he victim from which he throw himself upon he firmly fix he tooth in the calf of he leg hang suspend thus until the flesh insufficient to sustain the weight give way he drop again to the ground carry a portion of flesh in he mouth have greedily devour this morsel he bound again up the opposite tree and from thence upon smith in this manner renew he attack and tear away the flesh in mouthful from he leg during this agonizing operation smith contrived to cut a limb from the tree to which he manage to bind he jack-knife with which he could now assail he enemy at every leap he succeed thus in wound he so badly that at length he attack be discontinue and he finally disappear in the dense forest during the encounter smith have exert he voice to the utmost to alarm the crew who he hope might be within hail he be hear and in a short time several of the crew reach the place but not in time to save he from the dreadful encounter the sight be truly appalling he garment be not only rent from he but the flesh literally tear from he leg expose even the bone and sinew it be with the greatest difficulty he make the descent of the tree exhaust through loss of blood and overcome by fright and exertion he sink upon the ground and immediately faint but the application of snow restore he to consciousness prepare a litter from pole and bough they convey he to the camp wash and dress he wound as well as circumstance would allow and as soon as possible remove he to the settlement where medical aid be secure after a protracted period of confinement he gradually recover from he wound though still carry terrible scar and sustain irreparable injury such desperate encounter be however of rare occurrence though collision less sanguinary be not infrequent bear fight a sanguinary encounter with bear take place in the vicinity of tara-height on the madawaska river a few year since : a trap have be set by one of the man name jacob harrison who be out in search of a yoke of ox on the evening in question see a young bear fast in the trap and three other close at hand in a very angry mood a fact which render it necessary for he to make track immediately on arrive at the farm he give the alarm and seize a old dragoon sabre he be follow to the scene of action by mr jame burke arm with a gun and the other man with a axe they proceed direct to the trap supply with a rope intend to take the young bear alive it be a short time after dark object could not be distinctly see but on approach close to the scene of action a crash among the leaf and dry branch with sundry other indication warn they of the proximity of the old animal when within a few step of the spot a dark mass be see on the ground -- a growl be hear -- and the confine beast make a furious leap on jacob who be in advance catch he by the leg the infuriate animal inflict a severe wound on he knee upon which he draw he sword and defend himself with great coolness upon receive several wound from the sabre the cub commence to growl and cry in a frightful and peculiar manner when the old she-bear attract to the spot rush on the adventurous harrison and attack he from behind with great ferocity jacob turn upon the new foe and wield he trusty weapon with such energy and success that in a short time he deprive she of one of she fore paw by a lucky stroke and completely disabled she eventually by a desperate cut across the neck which divide the tendon and sever the spinal vertebra have complete he conquest he have ample time to dispatch the imprison cub at leisure during the time this stir and dangerous scene we have relate be enact war be go on in equally bloody and vigorous style at a short distance mr burke have discharge he gun at the other old bear only slightly wound he the enraged bruin spring at he with a furious howl he be meet with a blow from the butt-end of the fowling-piece at the first stroke the stock fly in piece and the next the heavy barrel be hurl a distance of twenty foot among the underwood by a side blow from the dexterous paw of the bear mr burke then retreat a few foot and place he back against a large hemlock follow the while closely by the bear but be acquaint with the nature of the animal and he mode of attack he draw a large hunting knife from he belt and place he arm by he side coolly await the onset the maddened brute approach growl and gnash he tooth and with a savage spring encircle the body of the hunter and the tree in he iron gripe the next moment the flash blade of the _ couteau chasse _ tear he abdomen and he smoking entrails roll upon the ground at this exciting crisis of the struggle the other man accompany by the dog come up in time to witness the triumphal close of the conflict two old bear and a cub be the fruit of this dangerous adventure -- all extremely fat -- the largest of which it be compute would weigh upward of two hundred and fifty pound we have seldom hear of a more dangerous encounter with bear and we be happy to say that mr burke receive no injury mr jacob harrison although torn severely and have three rib broken recover under the care of a indian doctor of the algonquin tribe the miner of bois-monzil on Tuesday February 22 1831 a violent detonation be suddenly hear in the coal mine of bois-monzil belong to m robinot the water from the old work rush impetuously along the new gallery the water the water such be the cry that resound from the affrighted workman throughout the mine only ten miner out of twenty-six be able to reach the entrance one of they bring off in he arm a boy eleven year old whom he thus save from sudden death another impel by the air and the water to a considerable distance could scarcely credit he escape from such imminent danger a third rush forward with he sack full of coal on he shoulder which in he fright he have never think of throw down the disastrous news that sixteen workman have perish in the mine of m robinot be soon circulate in the town of st etienne it be regard as one of those fatal and deplorable event unfortunately too common in that neighborhood and on the ensue Thursday it be no longer talk of politics and the state of party in pari exclusively occupy the public attention the engineer of the mine however and some of they pupil who on the first alarm have hasten to the spot still remain there continue they indefatigable endeavor to discover the miner who be miss nothing that mechanical science manual labor and perseverance prompt by humanity could perform be leave undo thirty hour have already elapse since the fatal accident when two workman announce the discovery of a jacket and some provision belong to the miner the engineer immediately essay to penetrate into the gallery where these object have be find which they accomplish with much difficulty by crawl on they hand and foot in vain they repeatedly call aloud no voice save the echo of they own answer from those narrow and gloomy vault it then occur to they to strike with they pickax against the roof of the mine still the same uncheering silence listen yes the sound be answer by similar blow every heart beat every pulse quicken every breath be contract yet perhaps it be but a illusion of they wish -- or perhaps some deceitful echo they again strike the vaulted roof there be no longer any doubt the same number of stroke be return no word can paint the varied feeling that pervade every heart it be -lrb- to use the expression of a person present -rrb- a veritable delirium of joy of fear and of hope without lose a instant the engineer order a hole to be bore in the direction of the gallery where the miner be presume to be at the same time they direct on another point the formation of a inclined well for the purpose of communicate with they two of the engineer 's pupil be now dispatch to the mayor of st etienne to procure a couple of fire pump which they conduct back to the mine accompany by two fireman in the ardor of youthful humanity these young man imagine that the deliverance of the miner be but the affair of a few hour and wish to prepare a agreeable surprise for the friend of the suppose victim they give strict injunction at the mayoralty to keep the object of they expedition a profound secret notwithstanding the untiring effort make to place these pump in the mine it be find impossible either they be upon a plane too much inclined to admit of they playing with facility or the water be too muddy to be receive up the pipe they be therefore abandon in the meantime the attempt make to reach the miner by sound or by the inclined well seem to present insurmountable difficulty the distance to they be unknown the sound of they blow on the roof far from offer a certain criterion or at least a probable one seem each time to excite fresh doubt in short the rock which it be necessary to pierce be equally hard and thick and the gunpowder unceasingly use to perforate it make but a hopeless progress the consequent anxiety that reign in the mine may be easily conceive each of the party in he turn offer he suggestion sometimes of hope sometimes of apprehension and the whole feel oppress by that vague suspense which be perhaps more painful to support than the direst certainty the stroke of the unfortunate miner continue to reply to theirs which add to they agitation from the fear of not be able to afford they effectual help they almost think that in such a painful moment they situation be more distressing than those they seek to save as the latter be at any rate sustain by hope while most of the party be thus perplex by a crowd of disquieting idea produce by the distressing nature of the event itself and by they protracted stay in a mine where the few solitary lamp scarcely render darkness visible the workman continue they labor with redoubled ardor some of they be hew to piece block of the rock which fall slowly and with much difficulty other be actively employ in bore the hole before name while some of the engineer ' apprentice seek to discover new gallery either by creep on all fours or by penetrate through perilous and narrow crevice and cleft of the rock in the midst of they corporeal and mental labor they attention be suddenly excite from another painful source the wife of the hapless miner have hear that all hope be not extinct they hasten to the spot with heart-rending cry and through tear alternately of despair and hope they exclaim be they _ all _ there where be the

workman all agree that the only prospect of success consist in exhaust the water which be already sensibly diminish by the working of the steam-pump the other pump produce little or no effect notwithstanding the vigorous effort employ to render they serviceable it be then propose remedy the failure of these pump by _ une chaine a bras _ viz by form a line and pass bucket from one to the

mass march under the order of a chief and stimulate by _ l'esprit de corps _ it be truly admirable to see with what address and rapidity the three or four hundred man who have hasten to bois-monzil

maintain themselves in a rapid descent in a stoop posture to avoid strike they head against the roof of the vault and most of the time up to the middle in the water which be drip from every side some idea may then be form of they painful situation they be relieve from this laborious duty by the _ garde nationale _ of st etienne whose zeal and enthusiasm exceed all praise but a more precious reinforcement be at hand the workman from the adjacent mine now arrive in great number from they skill and experience every thing might be expect if they fail there be no further hope the _ chaine a bras _ be again renew by company of the national guard relieved every two hour who at respective distance hold the light and under whose order they act it be a cheer spectacle to behold citizen of all rank engage in one of the noblest office of humanity under the direction of poor collier the immense advantage of the organization of the national guard be never more strikingly exemplify than on this occasion without they there would have be no means or possibility of unite together a entire population of lead the people from a distance of more than three mile night and day so as to insure a regular and continued service all would have be trouble and confusion with they on the contrary every thing be ready and in motion at the voice of a single chief and the whole be conduct with such precision and regularity as have never on similar occasion be witness before the road from st etienne to bois-monzil exhibit a scene of the most animated kind in the midst of the motley and move multitude the national guard be see hurry to and fro chasseur grenadier cavalry and artillery-man all clothe in they rich new costume as on a field day some of the crowd be sing _ a la parisienne _

and in short the _ tout ensemble _ render the approach of bois-monzil like a bivouac on the eve of a expected battle happily however the object of these brave man be to preserve life and not to destroy it on Saturday the _ chaine a bras _ be discontinue as the engineer have bring the pump effectually to work suddenly a cry of joy be echo from mouth to mouth they be save they be save six of they be free from they subterraneous prison shout a person at the entrance of the mine the rumor be instantly repeat along the crowd and a horseman set off at full speed for st etienne with the
