he think that a black or dull thing would cool more quickly than a white or bright one that make he think that a black thing would take in heat more quickly than a white one he want to find out if this be true or not there be no-body who know so there be no-body to ask but franklin think that he would ask the sunshine maybe the sunshine would tell he whether a black thing would heat more quickly than a white thing but how could he ask the sunshine there be snow on the ground franklin spread a white cloth on the snow then he spread a black cloth on the snow near the white one when he come to look at they he see that the snow under the black cloth melt away much sooner than that under the white cloth that be the way that the sunshine tell he that black would take in heat more quickly than white after he have find this out many people get white hat to wear in the summer time a white hat be cooler than a black one some time when there be snow on the ground you can take a white and a black cloth and ask the sunshine the same question franklin and the kite when franklin want to know whether the ant could talk or not he ask the ant and they tell he when he want to know some-thing else he ask the sunshine about it as you have read in another story that be the way that franklin come to know so many thing he know how to ask question of every-thing once he ask the light-ning a question and the light-ning give he a answer before the time of franklin people do not know what light-ning be they do not know what make the thunder franklin think much about it at last he prove what it be he ask the lightning a question and make it tell what it be to tell you this story i shall have to use one big word maybe it be too big for some of my little friend that will read this book let we divide it into part then you will not be afraid of it the big word be e-lec-tric-i-ty those of you who live in town have see the street light by e-lec-tric-i-ty but in franklin 's

little spark he get from e-lec-tric-i-ty be small flash of lightning he think that the little crack sound of these spark be a kind of baby thunder so he think that he would try to catch a little bit of lightning perhaps he could put it into one of the little bottle use to hold e-lec-tric-i-ty then if it behave like e-lec-tric-i-ty he would know what it be but catch lightning be not easy how do you think he do it first he make a kite it be not a kite just like a boy 's kite he want a kite that would fly when it rain rain would spoil a paper kite in a minute so franklin use a silk hand-ker-chief to cover he kite instead of paper -lrb- illustration : franklin 's discovery -rrb- he put a little sharp-pointed wire at the top of he kite this be a kind of lightning rod to draw the lightning into the kite he kite string be a common hemp string to this he tie a key because lightning will follow metal the end of the string that he hold in he hand be a silk ribbon which be tie to the hemp string of the kite e-lec-tric-ity will not follow silk one night when there be a storm come he go out with he son they stand under a cow shed and he send he kite up in the air -lrb- illustration -rrb- after a while he hold he knuckle to the key a tiny spark flash between the key and he knuckle it be a little flash of lightning then he take he little bottle fix to hold e-lec-tric-i-ty he fill it with the e-lec-tric-i-ty that come from the key he carry home a bottle of lightning so he find out what make it thunder and lighten after that he use to bring the lightning into he house on rod and wire he make the lightning ring bell and do many other strange thing franklin 's whistle when franklin be a old man he write a cu-ri-ous letter in that letter he tell a story

ship some go in one way some another they do not shoot they fight with sword and pike or short spear soon they drive the pirate to one side of the ship then they could hear the pirate jump over into the water in a few minute the pirate have all go but the american could not stay long they must burn the ship before the pirate on the shore should find out what they be do they have bring a lot of kin-dling on the ketch they build fire in all part of the ship the fire run so fast that some of the man have trouble to get off the ship when the american get back on the ketch they could not untie the rope that hold the ketch to the ship the big ship be burst into flame the ketch would soon take fire they take sword and hack the big rope in two then they push hard to get away from the fire the ketch begin to move the sailor take the large oar and row they be soon safe from the fire all this they have do without any noise but now that they have get away they look back the fire be shoot up toward the sky the man stop rowing and they give three cheer they be so glad that they could not help it by this time the pirate on shore have wake up they begin to fire great cannon ball at the little ketch one of the ball go through she sail ah how the sailor row the whole sky be now light up by the fire the pirate ' cannon be thunder the cannon ball be splash the water all round the ketch
