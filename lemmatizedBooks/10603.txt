frontier of indium \* -rrb- with kelly to chitral chapter i introductory would you like to go up to gilgit rather i be down in the military office at simlum hunting for a book and some map when i be ask the above question no idea of gilgit have before enter my head but with the question come the answer and i have since wonder why i never before thought of apply for the billet this be at the end of June 1894 and on the 24th August i be cross the burzil pass into the gilgit district as day break on the 31st August i drop down several thousand foot from doyen to ramghat in the indus valley and it suddenly strike I i must have come down too low and get into dante 's inferno as i pass under the crossbeam of the suspension bridge i look to find the motto all hope relinquish ye who enter here it be not there but instead there be a sentry on the bridge who on be question assure I that though there be not much to choose in the matter of temperature between the two place i be still on the surface of the earth he seem a authority on the subject so i feel happier and accept the cup of tea offer I by the commander of the guard two hour later i be in bunjus where i find i be to stay and two day after that a officer on he way down to kashmir pass through and almost the first question he ask I be why on earth i have come up to gilgit gilgit 's play out say he well i have be ask that question several time on my march up so i may as well explain that there be officially two chief cause which send man up to gilgit -- one be debt and the other the intelligence branch these i say be the official reason but the real reason be the chance of a frontier row in simlum they call they military expedition this account for the last part of that young officer 's speech there seem no chance of a row to he so he be go to other field and wonder at my come up at first the result seem to bear he out as within two month he be on the war-path in waziristan while i be still kick my heel at bunjus but luck change later and i laugh last well to continue my official reason for come to gilgit be the intelligence branch i be order up to chitral early in November for some survey work and thus obtain the knowledge of the route and country that be to stand I in such good stead later on i finish my work in chitral in ten day start back for gilgit on the 1st December arrive there on the 19th i spend christmas in gilgit and start on the 2nd January 1895 for hunza where i expect to remain for the rest of the winter news of the murder of nizam-ul-mulk mehter of chitral reach gilgit on the 7th January and dr robertson political agent at gilgit at once make preparation for a visit to chitral captain townshend who be at gupi with gough of the 2nd gurkha receive order to march with two hundred

these levy be splendid man hardy thick-set mountaineer incapable of fatigue and as a distinguishing badge each man be provide with a strip of red cloth which they wear in they cap but which we afterwards find by practical experience at nisa gol be inadequate -lrb- illustration : nizam-ul-mulk mehter of chitral -rrb- as news from chitral have cease for some day captain stewart assistant british agent in gilgit determine to call up the 32nd pioneer who be work on the chila road so as to be ready for a advance in case any forward movement be necessary in consequence of this order colonel kelly march into gilgit on the 20th march with two hundred man borradaile follow on the 22nd with a like party on the 21st we hear from mastuj that ross 's party of 14th sikh have be cut up ross himself and some forty-six sepoy be kill jone and fourteen man alone manage to cut they way back he and nine of the survivor be wound there be no news of edwarde and fowler this news upset the apple-cart and telegram begin to fly around with the result that colonel kelly be put in command of the troops in the gilgit district with full civil power on he line of operation this telegram arrive on the evening of the 22nd the day before colonel kelly have offer I the position of staff officer to the force and i naturally jump at the chance dew of the guide who be on the sick-list be sufficiently well to take over my work so there be no difficulty on that score and as i have long have my kit ready for any emergency i merely bundle my remain possession into box which i lock up and leave to look after themselves till my return here i may as well describe what the force consist of first there be four hundred man of the 32nd pioneer command by borradaile colonel kelly have take command of the column bar these two we be all subaltern peterson be the senior and command the second detachment as we be march to ghizr in two party then there be bethune the adjutant and cobbe and browning-smith the doctor -- these be all 32nd pioneer captain de visme 10th bombay infantry come along with we as far as gupi where he relieve stewart ra who of course be in command of the two gun of no 1 kashmir mountain battery stewart be a irishman and the most bloodthirsty individual i have come across he use to complain bitterly because the chitrali would not give we a fight every day then there be luard the agency surgeon we use to chaff he considerably during the march to gupi as he turn up in a norfolk jacket and a celluloid collar i think he have send he kit on to gupi at any rate after that place he dress in khaki uniform like the rest of we these be all who start from gilgit so i 'll introduce the other as we pick they up chapter ii the march begin colonel kelly assume command on the 22nd march and the next morning the first detachment of two hundred pioneer under borradaile march off the local bible commonly know as the gazetteer state that it never rain in gilgit this be so it naturally start to rain on the morning of the 23rd and keep it up for two day we be march without tent so the first night the man have to run up they waterproof sheet into shelter colonel kelly luard and myself start about 2 pm to catch up the troops who have start about 9 be luard have a beast of a pull pony and as he double bridle have not get a curb chain it be about as much use as a headache so i suggest he should let the pony rip and promise to bury he remains if he come a cropper he take my advice and rip you could not see he pony 's heel for dust as he disappear across the plain we find he all right in camp when we get there the man be already in camp and pretty comfortable in spite of the rain colonel kelly have a small tent and the rest of we turn into convenient cow-shed we be not trouble with much baggage bedding greatcoat and a change of clothing the man have poshteen -lrb- sheepskin coat -rrb- and everybody pleased themselves in the matter of boot most of we prefer chuply -- a native kind of sandal with a leather sock a very good article in snow as you can put on any number of sock without stop the circulation of blood in you foot officer and man be all provide with goggles and very necessary they be we have a very jolly mess the force be so small the 32nd pioneer kindly ask the remain officer to mess with they every man of course provide he own plate knife fork and spoon the cooking pot be collect for the general good we have breakfast before start the hour for march be 7 be as a rule the pioneer have some most excellent bacon good egg and bacon will carry a man through a long day most successfully i remember that when that bacon give out there be more mourning than over all the first-born of egypt mutton we never run out of like the poor it be always with we we get into camp as a rule some time in the afternoon and then indulge in tea and chupatty whisky be precious and keep for dinner which take place at dusk sometimes when we get into camp late dinner and tea be merge into one however it make no odds we be always ready to eat when anything eatable come along the mess provide some camp table and most of we manage to bring a camp stool so we be in the height of luxury after dinner a pipe or two and then we turn in we generally manage to get some grass to put under we blanket but if we do not i do not think it make much difference we be all young and use to sleep out on the hillside after game frequently above the snow line so it be no new experience if it rain or be cold we generally manage to get into a hut these be remarkably strongly build good stone wall and thick flat wooden roof with a mud cover a hole in the middle of the floor for the fire and a hole in the roof for the smoke -- at least that be what we suppose be the idea but the smoke generally prefer to remain inside there be also other discomfort of a minor nature for instance the cow and goat use to take it as a personal matter if you object to they share the room with you they be big enough however to catch and turn out but there be other occupant of a more agile nature army of they whom it be hopeless to try and eject we suffer so much from they please attention that we generally prefer to sleep outside weather permit we second march be to a village call suigal in the punyal district govern by raja akbar khan a jolly old chap who come out to meet we on the road he live in a castle on the left bank of the river which be here cross by one of the highest and longest rope bridge in the country in spite of he size he be a very good polo player as be all he family some of whom be shut up in the chitral fort with dr robertson he now offer he service and those of he people to government which colonel kelly accept and the old man retire very pleased to rejoin we later on at suigal we manage to get all the troops under shelter as it be still rain and it be now the second day that they have be wet through the next day the rain have luckily stop and towards noon the sun come out and everybody be dampen spirit cheer up we march that day to hoopar parus make a double march instead of halt at gurkuch parus mean a cliff -- and the camping ground be a horrid little place shut in by high cliff close to the bed of the river there be no village near it be a desolate place at the best of time and when there be any wind blow it be like camping in a draught-pipe from hoopar parus we march to gupi gupi be a fort build by the kashmir troops last year on the most scientific principle the only drawback be that it be command on all side and would be perfectly untenable if attack by three man and a boy arm with accurate long-range rifle here we pick up stewart who be turn catherine wheel at the thought of take he beloved gun into action he express a desire to try a few shell on the neighbouring village to practice he man in range but as there be objection to this plan the idea be allow to drop at gupi we make a raid on the store in the officer ' quarter and pretty well clear they out de visme who take command have to get a fresh supply up from gilgit -lrb- illustration : a parus on the road to gupi -rrb- we have a merry dinner that night provide i think by stewart who use to get up at interval and dance a jig at the idea of see he gun the next morning -- they be come on with the second detachment under peterson from gupis i send my pony back to gilgit as it be useless take it any farther as we doubt be able to take animal over the pass which eventually prove to be impossible from gupis onwards we have to be content with the usual hill track of these country good enough for a country pony but still nothing to be proud of here we discard we government mule and take coolie transport instead the march from gupi to dahimal be a long try one up and down all the way cobbe who be on rearguard do not get in till long after dark the village of dahimal lie on the opposite bank of the river so we do not cross but bivouac on the right bank where there be some scrub jungle that provide we with wood the pioneer have bring four duck they be carry in a basket along with the mess-stores browning-smith who run the mess get quite pally with these duck and as soon as they be let out of they basket he use to call they and off they would waddle after he in search of a convenient puddle i forget when those duck be eat but i do not remember they at ghizr and be sure they do not cross the pass we next march be a short one to pingal only about nine mile here we be meet by mihrbhan shah the hakim or governor of the upper part of the valley mihrbhan shah be a bit of a authority in the murder line have be employ by the late lament nizam-ul-mulk as chief murderer mihrbhan shah be particularly proud of one of he little job which he flatter himself he accomplish in a very neat and artistic manner i forget the detail but it result in the death of five man i ask he in to afternoon tea shah mirza act as interpreter we have a long chat from which i gain some very useful detail about the state of the party in chitral who be likely to help and who be not also a description of the road to killum drasan which i do not know this latter information seem so important that i report it that night to colonel kelly and it be then and there decide to march _ viâ _ killum drasan instead of by the usual road through bunus i do not think i have mention shah mirza before so i will introduce he now as he be one of we most useful ally and be now one of my greatest friend he belong to the punyal family and be wazir or governor of saus and gor he live at damot a village in the saus valley opposite bunjus and it be during my stay there that i first get to know he he have a interesting history and among other adventure have travel through the pamir and chitral in disguise he be we chief interpreter and he or one of he follower of whom he have five always keep near we he follower be enlist levy and one of they have formerly be my shikaree in fact he only leave I as he be call out as a levy it be the custom of the country for the headman of district to come and pay they respects to any sahib who may travel through they country and the proper etiquette be to supply you visitor with tea and sweetmeat -- biscuit will do just as well and they like plenty of sugar they then pay you the most barefaced compliment and make the startling assertion that you be they father and mother upon which you reply that all you have be at they disposal if they have any petition -- and they generally have -- they insinuate it gently in the general conversation so you have to be look out for trap of this sort when you have suffer sufficient evil for the day you mildly suggest that they be probably fatigue and would like to rest they take the hint and the remainder of the biscuit and depart we use to have lot of these visit which go by the name of political tea mihrbhan shah prove very useful to we i fancy he know he would get small mercy if he fall into the hand of the opposition and therefore do all he could to place we force between they and himself both at pingal and we next halt place cheshus he manage to billet all we small force in the village and no doubt we man be very thankful as we be get pretty high up and the night be decidedly cold although it be a friendly district we have regular picket and sentry and a british officer on duty to see everything be correct chapter iii the shandur pass shortly after leave pingal the character of the country change considerably and instead of a continual alternation of cliff and river bed the valley become more open and level we be in fact near the upper end of the valley beyond cheshus the road lead up a bluff and down the other side on to the bed of the pandur lake this lake have at the beginning of 1894 be a sheet of water some four and a half mile long but the dam at its end have give way in July it have drain off rapidly and when i have cross it in November of the same year the mud of its bed be only just become firm and be crack and fissure in every direction it be now cover with a sheet of snow through which the river twine dark and muddy we have now reach the snow line and we green goggles be take into use the march of we column churn the snow and mud into a greasy slime and the go be very tiring however we come in sight of the ghizr post by 2 pm and gough of the 2nd gurkha who be in command come out to meet we from he we learn that none of he messenger that have be send to mastuj with letter have return and it be now some ten day since the last communication have reach he so it become evident that the enemy be between laspur and mastuj we know that they have not cross the pass or we should have see they before this so we be pretty hopeful of a fight soon after cross the pass and we be not disappoint at ghizr we also find oldham a sapper subaltern who have precede we by a few day he have with he a party of kashmir sapper and miner who be now arm with snider carbine the post which consist of a block of isolate house have be fortify and surround with a thorn zareba and be only sufficiently large for the garrison of kashmir troops then hold it so we man be billet in the neighbouring house one of which we turn into a mess and quarter for ourselves we halt on the 30th march in order to allow the second detachment of the pioneer and the gun to come up as from here colonel kelly intend to march in one column here also we pick up the hunza and nagar levy numbering a hundred man under they own leader they be post in the village of teru some four mile up the valley and from there could give timely warning if any hostile force cross the pass wazir humayun lead the hunza crowd and wazir taifu the nagar i get to know humayun very well indeed and a right good sort he be he have formerly live for some five year in chitral when raja safdar alus khan of hunza have make thing too hot for he but when safdar alus flee when we take the country in 1891-92 he be reinstate wazir taifu i do not get to know so well as the nagar levy be leave behind at mastuj when we go on from there to chitral the second detachment under peterson and the gun with stewart get into camp some time after midday on the 31st march in the meantime every available coolie and pony have be collect and we calculate on be able to start the next morning with ten day ' ration for the whole force by 6 be on the 1st April the troops have fall in and be ready to start and a nice handy little lot we have four hundred pioneer two mountain gun forty kashmir sapper and a hundred levy then the coolie be tell to load up and the trouble begin it now appear that some hundred coolie and pony from yasin have bolt during the night we have put too much faith in mihrbhan shah 's influence and all those villager who be not directly under he government have go those hundred coolie mean the transport of we supplies and without they we should only have the food actually carry in the man 's haversack we have cut down we baggage to the vanish point and the man be carry all they could and we do not dare leave we reserve ammunition behind the column have just move off when this state of thing become known and be report to I colonel kelly be at the head of the column so i snatch the nearest pony tumble its load on to the ground and go scramble through the snow after the troops of course there be nothing to be do except halt the column until the coolie could be collar and bring back so stewart who have a battery pony with he be send off down the road after the abscond coolie they must have start the evening before as he only catch a few of they up fifteen mile back and have great difficulty in bring they along with he we meet he as we be return to ghizr at seven o'clock that evening stewart have scarcely go ten minute before some fifty coolie be find hide in a village they be soon drive out and make to lift they load this give we some six day ' ration and with it we move off we great object be to get across the pass and open communication with mastuj after that we could see about get on to chitral we transport consist of country pony and coolie and i remain behind to see the last off and rearguard moving before i start myself about two mile from ghizr post there be a steep ascent where the road twist and curl among a mass of débris fall from the cliff above and in one place the pony have to be help through a narrow passage between two fall boulder about midday i catch up the tail of the troops who be already past the village of teru the highest inhabit spot in the valley there be only a few house and these be scatter about in clump a few hundred yard apart pass on i catch up the battery and reach the lead infantry when suddenly the word to halt be pass down the long line we be now on a narrow plain and the snow on either hand of the track which the troops be follow in single file be over my waist as i soon find whenever i leave the path in order to reach more quickly the head of the column on arrive there i find the track have suddenly end and before we be the level expanse of snow-covered valley attempt be be make to get the gun mule of the battery through this but at every step they sink up to they girth even then not find firm foothold trial be then make of the ground at the side of the valley but the snow be find equally deep and soft there and after spend a hour or so in futile attempt to get forward it become evident to all that no animal could possibly pass over the snowfield in its present condition we have only go some eight mile out of the thirteen to langar and it be already three o'clock there be nothing therefore for it but to return and the word to retire be reluctantly pass along the line and each man turn where he stand move slowly back towards ghizr but though laden or unladen animal could not cross the pass we see no reason to suppose that man could not and therefore at teru which we reach by four o'clock a halt be make and two hundred pioneer with borradaile and cobbe and the sapper under oldham be detail to remain there with the hunza levy and to try and force they way across the pass the next day borradaile be to receive all the coolie transport which he be to send back as soon as he get across the pass in order that we might follow with the remainder of the troops he order be to entrench himself at laspur which be the first village across the pass and if possible open communication with mastuj the gun be immediately send back to ghizr and we set to work to sort out the kit of borradaile 's party from the remainder the unavoidable confusion at first be something dreadful first of all the kit have to be unloaded then those of borradaile 's party separate and put on one side the remain kit be then load on the pony and send off as fast as the pony could be load up back to ghizr the ammunition have to be divide and as much as possible give over in the way of supplies all this time we have to have a ring of sentry round to stop the coolie from bolt but as soon as we have get the pony off the coolie be collect and sit down in the snow under a guard borradaile 's party be then tell off into the different house and the coolie likewise still under guard the ammunition and supplies stack and the job be do by this time it be about seven o'clock get dark and also begin to snow all of we officer and man be cover with slush and mud from head to foot and drip wet smith who be go with borradaile 's party have however manage to get a fire go in one of the house and have get some tea ready bless he we have a cup all round and wish borradaile and he party good luck the remainder of we plunge out into the darkness and snow and splash back to ghizr the man who have start some time before we be comfortably in they former quarter when we reach ghizr on the way we meet stewart who have just return from he coolie hunt and be seat on a rock like rachel mourning for she child only in he case he be murmur not because the gun be not but because they be back in ghizr he gun be go over that pass even if he have to carry they himself you may bet you boot on that and begad i 'll set the gunner to cut a road and d'ye think now the snow would bear the mule at night when it be freeze at all we get back to the hut we have leave in the morning by 830 pm and there be a general demand for something hot we servant luckily have be send back straight so it be not long before we have something to eat that be we first meal since 530 be and it be now about 9 pm we have march some sixteen mile through snow and be on foot for some fifteen hour and here we be back in the same place we have start from since midday we have be pretty well wet through and the wind and cold have peel the skin off we face till it hang in flake still we be lucky in have a roof over we head as it have now start to snow in earnest after dinner we be not long before turn in we be up early the next morning but stewart and gough be up still earlier and be make sledge and try experiment with load they come in flush with success swearing that they have drag the whole ammunition of the gun by themselves across half a mile of snow and that they would have the gun over the pass in no time unluckily the snow be still fall and as borradaile have all the available coolie transport we be force to wait till he could send it back by noon he send in a letter by one of the levy say he have be unable to start as heavy snow be still fall but would try the next day shah mirza now come up to I and say that there be a mullah in the village who have a infallible charm for stop the snow and a present of a few rupee would no doubt set it in motion i promptly inquire how it be the mullah be not carry a load but be tell he be too old to help in that way but would be only too delighted to overcome the element so i give the mirza to understand that if the mullah would stop the snow-storm the sirkar would make he the mullah a great man in the meantime i would give he a couple of rupee on account shah mirza go off joyfully evidently have implicit faith in the mullah shortly after this gough come up say that the kashmir troops in the post have volunteer to make a road through the snow and if he could take fifty of they with four day ' ration to teru a sufficient track might be make to langar we next camping ground just this side of the pass to enable the gun to be carry there without much difficulty colonel kelly 's permission have be obtain we set about collect all the shovel and spade we could find in the village among other i get hold of the mullah 's who become very indignant but i point out to he that as he prayer seem to have no effect on the snow perhaps he shovel would make up for they deficiency we manage by institute a house-to-house visitation to collect some twenty spade of sort and with those supply by the troops we get altogether some forty which be hand over to gough he and stewart and fifty kashmir sepoy start off that day to teru take with they half a dozen sledge that have be make out of ghus box later in the day we have to send out forage party for wood and bhoosa -lrb- chop straw -rrb- as the commissariat report they supply as run out in fact these party have to go out every day during we stay in ghizr early the next morning i get a note from stewart ask that the battery might be send up to teru as there be enough fodder there for the mule and experiment could be make for get the gun along i get the battery off sharp but it be nearly noon before they get to teru the snow have cease fall and the cloud clear off the sun make a blinding glare off the freshly fall snow after breakfast i start off for teru myself to see how borradaile be get along and find he have start i leave my borrow pony at the village and push on catch up the rearguard a short way beyond where we have be force to turn back on the 1st April here i find stewart gough and oldham with the fifty kashmir troops two sapper and miner and rearguard of the pioneer stagger along under the gun and ammunition in a track that have be beat out by the troops march in front for some reason or other the sledge do not seem to act partly i think because the track be make by man march in single file be too narrow and uneven at anyrate when i arrive the gun wheel carriage and ammunition have be tell off to different squad about four man carry the load at a time and be relieve by a fresh lot every fifty yard or so even thus the rate of progression be fearfully slow about one mile a hour and the man be continually sink up to they waist in snow add to this there be a bitter wind and a blinding glare while the man be streaming with perspiration i know my own face feel as if it have be dip in boiling water and during the next few day the whole skin come off in flake i may as well here describe the tribulation of the advanced party preface my remark by say that they be found on report and hearsay and therefore i beg any slight inaccuracy may be forgive I when i turn back to return to ghizr the party carry the gun be just arrive at a stream call the shamalkhand which flow from a high pass of the same name which be often use as a summer route to mastuj but at that time of year be impassable from this stream to langar the camping ground on the eastern side of the shandur pass be some four mile the valley be open and fairly level but cover with thick dwarf willow on the bank of the stream flow down the center which confines the road to the western side of the valley the main body of the party i could see about one and a half mile ahead they have already cross the stream that be about 4 pm and the rearguard do not get into camp till 11 pm and even then the gun have to be leave about a mile from camp at langar there be only one little wretched hut about six foot square which be use as a shelter by the officer and one or two sick man the remainder huddle round fire in the snow luckily as i have already say there be a plentiful supply of wood to be have for the cut many of the man i hear be too tired to cook they food but simply lay down exhaust near the fire the officer get something to eat about midnight very little sleep be there for either officer or man that night most of they pass it huddle up round the fire or stamp up and down to keep warm early the next morning the pioneer and levy start to cross the pass while the remainder bring the gun into camp which work i believe take the best part of the day on leave the camping ground the track lead sharply to the right follow the course of the shandur stream which be now merely a rush brook the ascent be fairly precipitous for about a mile and be follow by a very gradual ascent -- so gradual in fact that it be difficult to say when the top of the pass be actually reach this slope constitute the pass and be some five mile long and twelve thousand three hundred and twenty foot above the sea absolutely bare of tree and with two fair-sized lake upon its surface it be easy to imagine the deadly cold wind that sweep across it the lake be now freeze over and the valley be one even sheet of spotless snow lie dazzling under the sun it be this combination of sun and snow which cause so much discomfort and snow blindness i have before cross this same pass in December on a cloudy day and although the whole of it be cover with freshly fall snow i do not even find it necessary to wear the goggles i have in my pocket ready for use -lrb- illustration : the shandur pass -rrb- the distance from langar on the east to the village of laspur on the west of the pass be not more than ten mile yet borradaile 's party leave langar at daybreak do not reach laspur till seven o'clock at night strange as it may seem the man suffer greatly from thirst and from some mistaken idea of become violently ill if they do so they refuse to eat the snow through which they be flounder towards evening as they reach the western end of the pass three man evidently a outpost of the enemy be see to bolt from behind some rock and make good they escape in spite of a attempt by the levy to catch they the descent from the pass to the village of laspur be some two mile long and down a steep and rather narrow ravine the hunza levy cover the spur on each side while the pioneer descend down the center so sudden and unexpected be they arrival that the inhabitant be catch in the village and naturally express they extreme delight at this unexpected visit -- so polite of they be not it they also say that they would be glad to help we in any way we desire they be take at they word and send back next day to bring on the gun while that night they be politely request to clear out of some of they house which be quickly put into a state of defense and occupy by we troops supplies be also require of the village the next day be spend by the detachment in complete the defence and collect supplies and coolie towards evening a report be bring in that the enemy have collect to the number of about a hundred some three mile away so borradaile take out some of the man to reconnoitre some man be see in the distance but these the levy declare to be only villager and as it be get dusk the party return to camp only then learn that a levy have be take prisoner the man have go some distance ahead of he fellow and have be capture by two man who jump out on he from behind a rock that evening the gun be bring in by the kashmir troops and the coolie amid cheer from the pioneer nothing i think can be say too highly in praise of this splendid achievement here be some two hundred and fifty man hindu and mussulman who work shoulder to shoulder have bring two mountain gun with they carriage and supply of ammunition across some twenty mile of deep soft snow across a pass some twelve thousand three hundred and twenty foot high at the beginning of April the worst time of the year it must also be remember that these man be carry also they own rifle greatcoat and eighty round of ammunition and wear heavy sheepskin coat they have sleep for two night in the snow and struggle from dawn till dark sinking at every step up to they waist and suffer acutely from a blinding glare and a bitter wind so much for the rank and file but in they officer they have have splendid example to follow especially stewart and gough if one may select when all do so nobly both these officer take they turn with the man stewart with he gunner and gough with he gurkha in carry the gun and both with utter unselfishness and with complete disregard for they own personal comfort give they snow glass to sepoy who not have any be suffer from the glare experience on the first day it be by these small act that officer can endear themselves to they man who know that they officer have they welfare at heart will follow wherever they may lead thus be the shandur pass first cross and a position establish from whence the force could work down to mastuj and thence to chitral i may here mention that so little do the chitrali imagine that we could cross the pass that letter be find in laspur state that the british force be lie in ghizr the man unable to move from frostbite and the officer from snow blindness also that since then fresh snow have fall and no force would now be able to cross for several week in fact the chitrali look upon the game as entirely in they own hand the surprise of we arrival be therefore all the more complete have bring the gun and borradaile 's party safely across the pass i return and relate colonel kelly 's and my own experience after leave the gun be drag through the snow to langar on the 3rd April i walk back to teru on the way i see the mullah 's shovel stick up in the snow with one half of the blade snap off alas poor mullah at teru i find the battery mule and driver these be order back to ghizr as they could be more easily feed there and would be protect by the garrison of the post i eventually get back to ghizr before dark and report event and just my luck get a bad go of fever the next day great scott i do feel a worm i be shiver with ague and my face be like a furnace i have not a bit of skin on it either and it be painful to eat or laugh from the crack state of my lip i manage to struggle through some necessary official letter but as a staff officer that day i be not much use colonel kelly determine to start himself the next morning with the nagar levy and shah mirza as we have manage to collect half a dozen coolie to carry we kit i go with colonel kelly the remainder of the pioneer come on as soon as the coolie from borradaile 's party arrive we be expect they the next day the 5th April i turn in early that night after have cover my raw face with some vinolium powder that colonel kelly happen to have i have not before know that these powder be suppose to be of any use i have a vague sort of idea that they be use for sprinkle baby but be unaware of the reason of this strange rite however i will now give the vinolium company what i believe be call a unsolicited testimonial i stick to that powder till i get to mastuj by which time my face have become human again colonel kelly have a beard so he do not suffer so much the next morning i feel much better have no fever and thanks to the vinolium my face be much less painful we get the levy and we kit off early and about noon colonel kelly and i start on some borrow pony which we ride as far as we could and then send back have catch up the levy we tramp forward along the track make by the first column occasionally find desert sledge and bit of broken spade the snow be now somewhat firmer than when the first party have cross owe to the top of the snow thaw slightly in the sun every day and be freeze hard again every night all the same the slightest divergence from the track plunge we up to we waist in snow the only one of we party who could walk on the snow without difficulty be my bull-terrier bill a spotted dog of doubtful ancestry he have be give to I as a bull-terrier when he be only a little white rat of a thing and i have raise he at bunjus on tinned milk he be a most uncanny dog -lrb- the joke be unintentional -rrb- and it be commonly believe in the force that he father be a tom cat poor bill before he get to laspur he be so snow blind that until we get to mastuj i have to open he eye for he every morning and bathe they with hot water before he could see and he be hardly well again a month later we get into camp that night before dusk pretty well fagged and wet and as soon as the coolie come in with we kit we scrape a hole in the snow and pitch the colonel 's small tent in camp we find a few man who have be place in charge of some ammunition that have be leave behind for want of transport this guard be mostly suffer a bit from snow blindness but be otherwise all right as they have run up shelter and have plenty of wood and they bedding when i get at my kit i take out a bottle of quinine and dose we servant and orderly all round so that they should not have any excuse for get fever and then take some myself for the same reason we then lay out we bedding in the tent while the servant go into the hut and turn in immediately after dinner and have a very comfortable night we be up before dawn the next morning and as we have sleep in we clothes it be not long before we have have breakfast and strike camp by 6 be we be climb the ascent to the pass there be a wind whistle straight in we face and i have no idea anything could be so cold it simply go clean through you and i quite expect to hear my rib sing like a aeolian harp when we get on to the pass the sun rise and the wind drop quite suddenly and presently we have take off we greatcoat on account of the heat after go about a hour i begin to suffer from mountain sickness a curious and distinctly unpleasant sensation very much like have a rope tie tightly round one 's chest and back and the shortness of breath necessitate a halt every hundred yard or so colonel kelly do not suffer from it at all but trudge along without a halt the whole way that be the only time i have ever suffer from mountain sickness and i have cross the shandur both before and since as also other pass without feel any inconvenience by noon we have almost reach the highest point of the pass and be skirt the larger lake when we meet the coolie of borradaile 's party return with a escort of some of the kashmir troops they all seem pretty lively in spite of the poor time they have be have but as they be use to cross the shandur at all time of the year i daresay we sympathy be a good deal waste we be soon descend into the laspur valley and we have hardly drop three hundred foot before all sense of sickness leave I and i feel as fit as possible a short way out of the village we be meet by a patrol which borradaile have send out to meet we and by two o'clock we be in camp where we find oldham in command borradaile have go on a reconnaissance down the valley the previous day news have be bring in that the enemy be assemble in the valley and a small party have go out as i have already relate on the morning of the 6th April borradaile accordingly determine on another reconnaissance this time take the gun with he they be carry by laspurus villager who no doubt think the game very poor fun gough go with the party oldham remain in command of the post which be garrison with the maim the halt and the blind -- in other word with man suffer from frostbite and snow blindness of whom there be some twenty-six of the former and thirty of the latter those man of the kashmir troops who be fit to march be send back across the pass as escort to the coolie when the reconnoitr party have go some three mile down the valley they come across the old camp fire of the enemy at rahman two mile farther on they leave the snow behind much to everybody 's delight and by one o'clock enter the village of gasht some eleven mile from laspur and about half-way to mastuj the levy crowning a small knoll in the middle of the valley at the lower end of the village from here they report they could see the enemy some three mile farther down the valley who be evidently engage in building sangar and entrench themselves a short council of war be hold as to the advisability of attack they but consider that the force consist of only a little over a hundred man and some fifty levy besides the two gun and also the time of day it be decide to return to camp which be reach by dark the day 's work be highly creditable to all concern the march to gasht and back have be some twenty-two mile and information have be obtain of the position in which we might expect opposition from the enemy on get into camp borradaile 's party find colonel kelly and myself wait they arrival eager to hear they news chapter iv from laspur to gasht that night we have beef for dinner this may appear a trivial fact but it mean a great and bless change from the eternal mutton we have be live on none of we have taste beef for quite six month except in its condensed or tinned state which do not count gilgit be a dependency of kashmir whose ruling family be hindu strongly object to cow-killing and therefore the law run that no cow be to be slaughter hence none of we since cross the bridge at kohallum have taste fresh beef but now we be in chitral territory and a mussulman country so we be free to kill cow but do so unostentatiously as nearly all we force be hindu the dark deed be accomplish thus : on the house be search on the arrival of the first party at laspur a innocent little calf be find in one of the house and quick as think then and there despatch i will not reveal the murderer 's name because i do not know it all trace be remove and for the next few day we enjoy hot roast beef we be a merry party but what a set of ruffian we look stewart and gough be both suffer from snow blindness owe to they generous action in give they goggles to sepoy and pass most of they spare time with they head over a basin of hot water dab they ache eye none of we have much skin on we face and what little remain be of a patchwork description none of we have shave for day -- we could not have stand the torture and we clothes too be show sign of wear and tear we all now sleep in we clothes partly for the sake of warmth and also to be in readiness in case of emergency there we be sit or lie on we bedding which be spread on the floor round the room the latter divide like all chitralus house into loose stall by low partition a small fire burning in the center of the room from which a thick pillar of smoke rise and hang like a cloud from the roof through a hole in which part of it escape we sword and revolver be hang on the wall or from peg in the beam the whole scene dimly light by one or two candle it might look very picturesque but i always consider the best hotel be good enough for I as there be not space enough in the stall for all of we colonel kelly and i as the last comer sleep in a little room off the main one here be evidently the winter store of fodder for the cattle as it be half full of bhoosa -lrb- chop straw -rrb- this we spread evenly over the floor to the depth of some two foot and then lay we blanket on top there be just room enough for we to lie out straight the colonel take one side and i the other and a softer or more luxurious bed could hardly be imagine we have to be careful though not to drop match about and to put out we pipe before go to sleep a halt have be order for the follow day to give the man suffer from snow blindness and frostbite a chance to recover so we turn in with the blissful consciousness of not have to turn out at dawn and sleep like the dead the next day April 7 be spend in hurry forward all arrangement for a advance on the morrow we also send round messenger to all the villager to come in and make they submission on pain of have they village burn and see that we now have the upper hand at any rate in they valley the inhabitant come in without much hesitation and also bring in a certain amount of supplies consequently by night we have sufficient local coolie to carry all we baggage supplies ammunition and most important of all the two gun about noon on this day raja akbar khan of punyal whom i have before mention as meet we on the march from shoroh to suigal come into camp with fifty levy bring in a convoy of ninety baltus coolie with supplies we be get along famously now so colonel kelly decide to advance the next day without wait for peterson 's detachment as we first object be to open communication with mastuj we have a political tea that afternoon : all the leader of the levy old raja akbar khan humayun taifu the nagar wazir shah mirza and one or two princeling who have come up to see some fight all squat round we little room on the straw swig sweet tea and munch biscuit quite a friendly gathering in fact so much tea be consume that the mess president swear he would send in a bill we always get we earliest and most reliable information from the levy as most of they have blood relation among the chitrali they also know just where to look for hidden grain and supplies of all sort as a rule there be generally a cache under or near the fireplace in the main room but i have also see the levy find they in the most unlikely place and very queer odds and end they sometimes pull out of these under-ground storeroom on the morning of April 8th the column be form up and ready to start by 9 be poor gough be be leave behind at laspur in command of the garrison which consist of some twenty-five kashmir troops and the nagar and punyal levy in all about a hundred the levy be to come on as soon as the second party arrive we force therefore consist of two hundred pioneer two gun forty kashmir sapper and fifty hunza levy we order of march be as follow : first of all go the levy then with a interval of some five hundred yard come the advance guard of a half company of pioneer the main body consist of kashmir sappers gun one company of pioneer ammunition hospital baggage and rearguard of half company pioneer both advance and rear-guard be command by british officer it be a lovely fine morning and we be all in the best of spirit and look forward to leave behind the detestable snow and therewith we chief source of discomfort poor old gough look awfully dismal at be leave behind but it be the fortune of war at gurkuch at gupi at ghizr there be only one cry from officer and man -- british and native -- for heaven 's sake take we on with you the native always add that they would never be able to face they womenfolk again if there have be fight and they not in it the britisher express he disgust at what he call he bally luck in more forcible term but it mean the same thing and we be all the same color under the skin off we go through the village and across the stream by a rickety bridge then down the left bank for about a mile when we come to a small hamlet -- i forget its name -- and here i fall out and pay a visit to the house of mahomed rafus the hakim of the laspur district this hoary-headed old rascal have be play fast and loose for a long time but have at last cast in he lot openly with the enemy he have a long list of offence to answer for and be believe to be one of the actual murderer of hayward about 1872 hayward be globe-trotting up yasin way when these ruffian rush he camp seize he and carry he into a wood with the intention of kill he he ask they to defer the performance until daylight as he should like to look on the world once more this they agree to and soon after dawn make he kneel down and hack off he head such be the story poor hayward 's body be bring into gilgit and he lie in a orchard close to the british agency i can quite imagine hayward or any man who have any appreciation of the grandeur of nature in she wilder mood wish to see the sun rise once again over these tumble mass of snow peak and bare cliff the startling sensation of the immensity of these hill in comparison with man 's minuteness strike home with almost the stunning effect of a sudden blow it be say that the calm pluck of hayward touch even he murderer callous as they be to bloodsh it make a sensational picture : a solitary figure in the foreground standing alone on the edge of a pine wood high up in the lonely grandeur of the everlasting hill the first flush of dawn redden the snow on peak after peak change the pure white to pink the cold blue to purple the tumbled sea of mountain summit gradually grow in distinctness the soft mist rise from the valley and the group of wild figure stand within the shade of the pine hayward take one long look on all this loveliness and turn towards he executioner -- man say that even they hesitate mahomed rafus who be suppose to have actually kill hayward be now hakim of laspur and as i have say have join the enemy when i have travel through laspur in November last the old ruffian have come to pay he respects and accompany I part of the way to mastuj and while do so have stop at a house to give some order and have inform I that this be one of he house on pass it now i think a visit might be useful so get shah mirza and he levy i get permission to search the house it have evidently only recently be occupy for on burst in the door we find the cooking pot in the fireplace and fresh meat hanging in one of the room after a short search we find the grain store with several mound of grain which be afterwards take into laspur there be nothing much more that we could find in we hasty search but i pick up a empty spectacle-case astonish at find it in such a place as mahomed rafus never wear spectacles in he life i show it to colonel kelly who promptly annex it as he be in want of one have mislay he own shah mirza also collar a fowl which no doubt form he next meal i catch up the column before they have go much more than a mile just as they be cross a stream after that we have some level march into the village of rahman and by this time the snow be only lie in patch here we make a short halt from rahman there be a path across the hill to chitral by means of a nullah call the goland gol of which mention will be make hereafter but at this time of year it be impossible to use this path owe to the snow during the halt the headman of the village come up to make he salaam and also tell I that a man of ghizr have pass through that morning escape from the enemy he be report to be one of gough 's messenger capture when take letter to moberly at mastuj i tell the headman that he have better show he goodwill by bring in the man which he promise to do and send he in that night to we camp at gasht we learn little from he except that the enemy be go to fight we between gasht and mastuj and that the latter place be all right this man have no idea of number and when ask the strength of the enemy reply invariably that there be very many man but seem equally uncertain if there be five hundred or five thousand collect in the sangar before we and yet he have be a prisoner in they camp for some fifteen day i find the best way of get information out of the prisoner be to set shah mirza or humayun on the job they use to squat down over the fire with the prisoner and engage they in conversation gradually get what they know out of they by simple-look question of course i could not do this as i do not know they language and the presence of a british officer put they on they guard at once between rahman and mastuj the country be pretty much the same a narrow valley run between high stony hill they top cover with snow and they foot with boulder then the bed of the valley more or less rocky and the river wind from side to side and below the main level of the valley at depths vary from fifty to two hundred foot the side nearly always sheer cliff at interval be nullah down which run stream of snow water from the hill to the river or fan of alluvial deposit bring down by flood in previous year on the flank of one such fan we find the village of gasht which we reach by 330 pm the levy have already occupy the knoll at the lower end of the village from whence the enemy have before be see so after fix on a camping ground and give the necessary order the officer all go forward to have a look from the top of the knoll there be a extended view of the valley and i be able to point out the position of mastuj which be hide by some rise ground and also the general direction of the road about three mile ahead we could distinctly see a sangar fill with man on the left bank of the river that sangar be as far as we could judge on the right flank of the enemy 's line a few man could also be see climb a steep stone shoot on the right bank of the river so evidently the enemy be go to try the effect of a stone avalanche as we go underneath a good deal of discussion go on as to whether the enemy 's main defense be on the left bank in which case we should have to attack across the river or on the right bank in which case the present visible sangar be a flanking bastion at last someone suggest tea so the meeting break up colonel kelly and i stay behind i ask colonel kelly for permission to take some of the levy and have a cast forward i take the hunza man and my shikaree faquir as he could translate my order to the levy off we trot and by the time the other officer be have tea i be well up the hillside it be impossible to be rush as the ground be pretty bad so i extend my man -- when it come to snipe one man be a smaller target than two -- and we skirmish up and forward so as to bring we well above the enemy 's line in half a hour we be high enough to see all the valley below and the enemy 's position be spread out like a map i send the levy on about a hundred yard and then make they line a ridge while i sit myself comfortably down and sketch the whole show with my glass i could count the man in each sangar they be evidently cook they evening meal as thin column of smoke rise from each sangar in the still evening air i could also make out the path lead up the cliff from the river and see man go down to fetch water i sit and watch long after i have get all the information i want as i might perhaps get some useful tip that i have overlook it be very peaceful sit there but presently the sun drop behind the hill and it get too chilly for comfort a whistle to the levy and a wave of the hand bring they back and we scramble down the hill again and be back in camp before dark here i hear that the punyal levy have be send for from laspur to come along at once as soon as i have explain the enemy 's position to colonel kelly order be issue for the attack next day they be short and simple on the arrival of the punyal levy they be to start with a guide we have procure to turn out the man above the stone shoot on the right bank of the river i with the hunza levy be to start at 6 be and work through the hill to the right rear of the enemy 's position the main body would start at 9 be and attack in front the baggage to remain in camp under a guard command by sergt reeve commissariat then we have dinner and go to bed chapter v chokalwat at 5 be the next morning my orderly gammer sing gurung wake I it be still dark and i dress as quickly as possible so as not to disturb the other who be snore peacefully around I dress consist of put on my coat putty and some canvas shoe with rope sole i know the ground i should be go over would be pretty bad and with rope sole you can skip about rock like a young lamb whereas shooting boot would send you fly over the cliff by the time i have have some poached egg and a cup of tea the hunza levy be wait outside so i get into my sword and trappings and go as i pass out colonel kelly wish I good luck and i say _ au revoir _ till twelve o'clock the other snore peacefully gammer sing and the fifty hunza levy be ready and i have put some chupatty into my haversack overnight so off we go by the time we be clear of the village it be get light so keep close to the edge of the hill we strike up a side nullah take a slant across it and then begin the climb by this time it be broad daylight we keep climb and gradually work round the face of the hill to the right until we strike the snow line and i calculate we be pretty well as high as any sangar the enemy might have on the hill my idea be to get above they and i do not want my party sweep into space by a stone avalanche still to make matter secure i detach ten man to go higher up still and i have five minute ' halt to give they a start it be now about 730 be and i want to push on so as to be well on the right rear of the enemy by nine o'clock once there we could time we attack at we leisure event however work out somewhat differently the ground now get very bad and presently we come to a stone shoot which extend high up above we while end in a cliff a little below this we cross carefully one man go at a time each step set the whole slide in motion and bring stone bound down from above the best way be to take it at a rush we get safely across that and the ground get worse and worse and finally we be bring to a halt i send man to find a path above and below the remainder sit down under cover while i examine the ground in front with my glass it be eight o'clock now and i be congratulating myself in have get so far as another half-mile would bring we on to a spur which run down on the right flank of the enemy 's line as i be look at this spur i notice that there be a nice grassy slope just about level with we and below that the cliff go almost sheer down into the river once on that slope we could pretty well play skittle with the sangar below as we could even now see clearly into they unfortunately the ground between look frightful a series of ridge like the tooth of a saw the northern face be cover with snow which make the go particularly treacherous i have hardly notice this when there be a puff of smoke and a report and i see to my disgust that on the edge of my nice grassy slope be a few cluster of innocent-looking rock which i now see to be sangars evidently occupy just at this moment a man run across the slope and begin wave he coat to someone below and more man show themselves among the rock the levy be still look for a path and humayun want to return the enemy 's fire but as the levy be arm only with carbine and i have not hear the whistle of the enemy 's shot i judge it would be a waste of ammunition to get the distance i tell gammer sing who have he martini to try a shot at the man wave he choga with he sight at eight hundred yard i see the bullet kick the dust to the right of the man who jump for a rock so i know carbine be no good at that distance a path be now find a little lower down so i order a advance and on we go we appearance be the signal for the enemy to open fire but as only one or two bullet sing over we i know they could not have many rifle we work on steadily forward to about five hundred yard when shot begin to drop among we so under cover of a ridge i divide the man into two group and send the first group forward under cover of the fire of the second until the first group reach the next ridge when they cover the advance of the second group the ground be shocking bad and what make it more annoying be that as we be attack towards the north and the snow lay on the northern slope we have to test we way every step and keep in single file just when we advance be most expose i have to have a man in place to help I along i do not mind bad ground when after mahkor as you can take you own time but i strongly object to take the place of the mahkor we advance never stop but by ten o'clock we have only go some two hundred yard and i could see we force cross the river on to the plain below the enemy in we front now begin to get excite and we see several of they run back and make signal to those below there be now only one ridge between we and the enemy and we make for it as we rise the enemy 's fire become pretty warm but we be soon under cover again and as we advanced man gain the ridge they begin firing and yell as hard as they could go i think something be up so make a rush a slip and a scramble and i could see over the ridge as the rear party come scramble along i soon see the cause of the yell about a hundred yard in front of we be the grassy ridge and across this the last of the enemy be bolt and in a few minute have disappear amid the most appalling yell from the levy that be the last we party saw of they for we now find we path again block up by a precipice and again i have to send man above and below to find a practicable way i then call for a return of casualty and find we have escape scot free -lrb- i expect the enemy have too -rrb- so thus end we bloodless battle while a path be be look for humayun and i sit down in a quiet corner and share chupatty and watch the fight below which be just begin first we see the advance guard get on to the plain and extend and presently they be join by the main body and the whole form up for attack then the firing line extend and the advance commence presently we see the sangar open fire answer by volley from we man then come a larger puff of smoke and a murmur from the man round I as a shell pitch across the river and burst over a sangar it be as pretty a sight as one could wish for and i feel as if i should have be in a stall at drury lane i could have stop and watch the show with pleasure it be quite a treat to see how steadily the 32nd pioneer work across the plain but just then the man below shout that they have find a path while i could see those above work they way on to the grassy slope these latter now shout that there be no enemy leave on the hill so we choose the lower road and gradually work we way down join the grassy spur lower down -- only it be not grassy here at all but chiefly precipice we get down somehow chiefly on all fours but by the time we have reach the sangar the enemy have bolt and they be occupy by we man it have take we nearly a hour to get down here i come across colonel kelly and after shake hand i look at my watch and find it be just twelve so i have make a good shot at the time of we meeting when we part in the morning now i will give you a account of the attack carry out by the main body it be the official account so i can back its correctness the action at chokalwat on the 9th April be thus describe : on the morning of the ninth April i advance to the attack of the enemy in the early morning lieutenant beynon with the hunza levy ascend the high hill on the left bank of the river to turn the right of the position and attack in rear the punyal levy be send up the hill on the right bank to turn out the man above the stone shoot i advance in the follow manner : -- half coy 32nd pioneer advance guard kashmir sapper and miner -- half company 32nd pioneer | two gun 1st kashmir mountain | = main body battery carry by coolie | one company 32nd pioneer -- the baggage under escort of the rearguard remain in gasht till order forward after the action a advance be make to the river where the bridge have be break but sufficiently repair by the sapper and miner for the passage of the infantry the gun ford the river and the force ascend to the fan face the right sangar of the enemy 's position the configuration of the ground be as follow : the road from the river after leave gasht bring we on to a alluvial fan the ascent to which be short and steep it be cover with boulder and intersect with nullah the road lead across this fan and then along the foot of steep shale slope and shoot within five hundred yard of the line of sangar crowning the opposite side of the river bank and totally devoid of any sort or description of cover for some two mile it could also be sweep by avalanche of stone set in motion by a few man place on the height above for that purpose the enemy 's position consist of a line of sangar block the road from the river up to the alluvial fan on which they be place the right of the position be protect by a snow glacier which descend into the river bed and furthermore by sangar which extend into the snow line up the spur of the hill the course of the action be as follow : the advanced guard form up at about eight hundred yard from the position and the main body in rear the 32nd pioneer then advance to the attack one section ` c ' company extend -lrb- left of line -rrb- one section ` c ' company extend in support two section ` c ' company ` a ' company in reserve the gun now take up position on the right and open on ` a ' sangar at a range of eight hundred and twenty-five yard as the action progress the support section of ` c ' company advance and reinforce the remain half of ` c ' company advance and leave sufficient space for the gun take up they position in the firing line on the extreme right volley firing at first be open at eight hundred yard but the firing line advance one hundred and fifty to two hundred yard as the action progress at a later stage one section of ` a ' company be push up to fill a gap on the right of the gun in action in the center of the line the enemy after receive some well-directed volley and correctly play shell be see to vacate ` a ' sangar by two and three until it be finally empty during we advance to the fan shot be hear in the direction of the hill lieutenant beynon have come into contact with the enemy in they sangar up the hillside who be drive from ridge to ridge when ` a ' sangar be vacate attention be direct on ` b ' sangar and the same course adopt with the same result at the same time those drive down from the hill above stream into the plain and there be then a general flight six shrapnel be fire into the fly enemy at range of a thousand twelve hundred and thirteen hundred and fifty yard -lrb- three round per gun -rrb- a general advance be then make down precipitous bank to the bed of the river cover by the fire of the reserve the river ford and sangar ` a ' and ` b ' occupy the gun be then carry across and the whole line of sangar have be vacate the column be re-formed on the fan the line take in cross enable the enemy to get well on they way to mastuj the advance be then continue to a village a mile and a half farther along the river where a halt be make the casualty consist of one man of the 32nd pioneer severely wound and three kashmir sapper slightly the action commence at 1030 be and last one hour the position be of unusual natural strength and the disposition of the sangar show considerable tactical ability be place on the edge of high cliff on the left bank of the river the enemy be compute at four to five hundred and be arm with martini-henry and snider rifle several dead be find in the sangar and the loss i estimate to have be from fifty to sixty by the time i have join colonel kelly the pioneer have re-form and be advance so i have very little time to take a look at the sangar i see one or two body lie around and the shell seem to have knock spark pretty successfully out of the stone breastwork i also notice the neat little cooking place the enemy have make behind they sangar show that they have be there for some time the advance be carry on without a check for about one and a half mile when we come to a cluster of hut near the termination of the plain the river here make a slight sweep towards the left side of the valley a advance guard be throw out well to the front and under they protection the column halted and the man fall out i have a first-class thirst by this time and gammer sing make several trip to the river before it be quench gammer sing and i always share the same tin mug on the march it be he mug but he always give I first go in return i supply gammer sing with tobacco so it be a fair division of labor here i finish my chupatty and some kind man -- i think it be borradaile -- give I a stick of chocolate my own store have run out but i manage to get it replenish at mastuj good old stewart come up as pleased as punch at have have he first fight say he and d'ye think now that I shell kill many of the beggar sure and they corpse ought to be just thick he be pained to hear that in all probability we should not catch up the enemy again that day i really think nothing less than twelve hour ' hard fighting every day with short interval for refreshment would satisfy he one of the gun when be bring up the cliff have slip off the coolie and fall down to the bottom again break off the foresight but stewart mend it during the halt at the same time the sapper be hard at work pull down a house for material to build a bridge but before it be actually begin we hear that the river could be ford again lower down so the bridge be not build by this time the man be sufficiently rest the whole column have close up and order send back for the baggage to come on off we start the punyal levy work down the right bank the hunza on the leave the main column follow the left bank of the stream by 4 pm we reach the ford and cross to the right bank the water not be much above we knee and almost immediately after we see some man draw up on the spur we be approach they turn out to be the mastuj garrison who on find the besiege force halt have come out to find out the reason if they have only hear we gun and turn out at once they would have cut the line of retreat of we opponent and the whole crew must have be wipe out unfortunately the fort of mastuj be build far down the reverse slope of a fan and although some of the sentry report they hear firing it be think they must be mistake by 5 pm we have get on to the spur and find moberly with part of the garrison all look very fat and fit evidently the siege have not worried they much so far a detachment of the 14th sikh -lrb- the remains of ross 's company -rrb- be leave on the spur to cover the baggage come in while we column trot down to the fort get there by 530 pm here we find jone with he arm in a sling we force bivouac in a garden attach to the fort the tree of which have be lop to deprive the enemy of shelter and the farther wall destroy this we precious soon build up again and within a hour we force be comfortably entrenched and cooking its dinner what a blessing it be to be down again in a decent climate fire be still pleasant at night but in the daytime the bright cool weather be splendid moberly 's servant soon have some tea and chupatty ready and while we be eat they bretherton who have be out clear some village on the other side of the fort come in there be lot of news both to hear and relate and we be hard at it when there come the sound of a volley from the direction in which we be expect the baggage somebody say cuss those nigger why can not they let we have we tea in peace -- it be not stewart -- and there be a general scramble for sword and belt a company of the pioneer be soon double off while the rest of we stroll up the road to see what the row be we meet the baggage come in and hear that the 14th sikh picket have hear some people move in the river bed and have let drive a volley at they -- result unknown as soon as the last of the baggage have pass we follow it and the picket be withdraw later that night we send back a messenger with a account of the day 's fighting and the relief of mastuj to gilgit but the messenger -- a levy -- shortly return have be fire on and return the fire so it be evident that a good many of the enemy be still sneak about we officer sleep in the fort that night four or five of we in a room mastuj be of the ordinary type of country fort square with a tower at each end and one over the gateway curtain between each tower about eighteen to twenty foot high and the tower another fifteen foot higher still the whole place be build of layer of stone and wood plaster together with mud while there be generally a keep or citadel inside which command the rest of the fort and in which be the governor 's and woman 's quarter in mastuj of course we use these as officer ' quarter the whole fort be a horribly dirty and tumble-down old place the roof of the officer ' quarter have to be prop up as it be consider unsafe and i quite believe it the room have the usual hole in the roof for the smoke to get out at but moberly have erect a stove in he room which be a great improvement chapter vi the reconnaissance from mastuj while at mastuj we hear from jone the story of the disaster at koragh -- which i will give ross with jone and about ninety-three sikh leave mastuj on the 7th march with the intention of help edwarde and fowler who be believe to be in danger at reshun and march to buni leave a detachment there of thirty-three sepoy under a native officer he march with jone and sixty man for reshun hope to arrive there that day after leave bunus the road run for some distance along flat ground until the junction of the turikho and yarkhun river be reach at this point the road lead up along the face of a cliff and then down on to a small plain where be a few house and some patch of cultivation this be know as the village of koragh and immediately after the river run between the cliff which draw together and make the mouth of the defile the path which follow the left bank cross the débris fall from the cliff above and then run along the edge of the river at the foot of another and smaller cliff or in summer when the river be full the path run over this smaller cliff ross 's party take the lower road after the second cliff the path lead on to a small plain about two hundred yard wide at its greatest width and perhaps half a mile long and then run up and across the face of a third cliff which drop sheer down into the river this cliff form the end of the trap it would be hard to find a better place for a ambuscade ross 's advance guard be on this plain approach the spur which close the trap when they be fire on ross go forward to reconnoitre the ground and at once see the impossibility of drive the enemy out with he small force and therefore order jone to go back and hold the entrance of the defile to enable they to escape on the first shot be fire the coolie have chuck they load and bolt as likely as not help to man the sangar enclose the party jone take ten man make a attempt to reach the mouth of the defile but find it already occupy by the enemy who have run up stone sangar and by the time he have get within a hundred yard of it eight of he ten man be wound he therefore fall back on the main party who have take refuge in some cave at the foot of the cliff the cave now half full of water owe to the rising of the river can be see in the photograph the party remain in these cave till 9 pm when they make another attempt to cut they way out but be drive back by avalanche of stone they then have to scale the mountainside but be stop by a impossible cliff and one sepoy fall over be kill so they come back to the cave dead tire here they remain the whole of the next day the enemy try a occasional shot from across the river where they have erect sangar but the sikh have in they turn build sangar across the mouth of they cave which sheltered they then the enemy try roll stone over the top of the cliff but this only have the effect of strengthen the sangar so they shut that up during that day ross and jone come to the conclusion that there be nothing to be do but cut they way out everyone must take he chance the rush to be make about 2 be on the morning of the 10th accordingly at the time fix they make they sortie a heavy fire be at once open on they from both side of the river while avalanche of stone be send hurtle down the cliff a number of sepoy be kill or knock senseless by stone but the remainder reach the sangar and clear out the defender at the point of the bayonet here poor ross be kill by a bullet through the head after have so the native say pistoll some four of the enemy the latter after be drive out of the sangar bolt up the hillside and again open fire from among the rock by the time the small band reach the maidan there be only some seventeen man head by jone : of these jone and nine other be wound here the little party form up and try to help any more of they friend who might be struggle through by heavy volley-firing into the sangar on both side of the river after some ten minute of thus wait during which they twice drive off attack of the enemy 's swordsman who try to close with they and lose three more man jone notice a attempt of the enemy to cut the line of retreat and despairing of any more of the detachment escape give the order to retire this be carry out slowly and leisurely till they reach bunus at about 6 be when they join the detachment they have leave behind jone and he party remain in bunus till the 17th the enemy not daring to attack they and they be unable to move have no transport for they wound after ross have leave mastuj moberly remain in command of the fort and on the 10th march be join by captain bretherton of the commissariat who come in with two sepoy from ghizr moberly hear that ross have leave a small party at bunus and though he send messenger to this party he never receive any reply the messenger probably be capture on the 13th hearing that the enemy be occupy the nisa gol a position some six mile from mastuj he reconnoitr up to it and find some sangar which he destroy but no enemy a reinforcement of sixty sepoy come in that day from ghizr the next two day be spend in try to collect coolie for transport and on the 16th in spite of the non-arrival of any coolie he set out to buni with a hundred and fifty sepoy each man carry a sheepskin coat two blanket a hundred and twenty round of ammunition and three day ' cook ration he halt that night at sanoghar where he collect some fifty coolie and learn by signal from mastuj that bretherton be send some fifty yarkhun coolie the next day -- fifty punyal levy also join he that evening start the next morning he reach bunus by 5 pm when he find jone and the remains of the sikh the return journey be begin two hour later at 7 pm and carry on steadily all night a small body of the enemy follow but not daring to attack mastuj be reach between 10 and 11 be the next day 18th march by the 22nd march the enemy have surround the fort and the siege begin nothing of any event happen the enemy content themselves with long-range firing only one man be slightly wound and two pony kill on the 9th of April up we come with we little lot and the siege be raise early the next morning we be up and go through the state of the supplies and available amount of transport transport and supplies be a everlasting source of worry as it generally be with every army great or small we soon get a return of the supplies in mastuj i forget how many day it be but none too much for we force and the mastuj garrison bretherton be send back to bring up supplies from the rear and messenger be send to order in the villager we want they grain to eat and man to carry it the villager begin to come in after a bit and bring a small amount of grain with they stewart be hard at work get pony for he gun in place of the mule leave behind the gun wheel and carriage saddle be send for and shortly arrive the levy be billet in the house which have lately be occupy by the enemy and we soon have picket out round the fort in show the levy the house they be to occupy i examine the enemy 's system of loophole and sangar and find they be very well make indeed in the house which have lately be occupy by mahomed issar they commander-in-chief we find the trunk of a tree which the enemy be convert into a cannon it do not require cannon to bring the wall of mastuj down -- a good strong kick would have be quite sufficient shortly after we have reach chitral moberly report that part of the wall have fall on a sleep sepoy who be luckily save by some beam catch and protect he from be crush by the débris there be no apparent cause for the collapse but the man be suppose to have sneeze the next day a fatigue party be send out to chokalwat to destroy the enemy 's sangar and bury any dead body that might be lie about this party would also act as a cover party to peterson who be expect to arrive that day with peterson come bethune and luard all very sick at have miss a fight this detachment bring the strength of the pioneer up to four hundred rifle the hunza and fifty punyal levy be send to reconnoitre towards nisa gol that day and fifty more punyal up the yarkhun valley to forage the rest of the day be spend in write report make out official return and other necessary nuisance colonel kelly and i be write in a tent pitch on the roof and i have pretty well get through my work by 5 pm and then colonel kelly have out the map and return of supplies etc and borradaile be call there be a small council of war as i have before say colonel kelly have practically settle at pingal to advance by killum drasan but the question be when should we be in a position to do so here come in that everlasting transport and supply question we could now of course cut down we baggage by leave behind warm clothes and poshteen as the weather would be get hotter every day as we descend to lower latitudes but this only mean that the man would have to carry less themselves and try as we would it seem as if we could only raise enough transport for seven day ' supplies five on coolie and two day in the man 's haversack it be seven day ' march to chitral by the direct route and though we intelligence point to the fact that supplies in the chitral fort be probably plentiful it be yet only summer then again we might or we might not get supplies on the road we worry the question up and down and inside out but we could not increase the transport by one coolie borradaile be for go on i say the first man in chitral get a cb just then raja akbar khan and humayun come back so we go out to hear they report old akbar smile a fat smile all over he face and humayun twirl he long moustache -- he have a fine black beard and moustache and a deep bass voice akbar khan curl he beard like a assyrian king and smile good-naturedly at everything they report that they have see the enemy building sangar and that there be many man also cavalry they report be clear enough and from they description i could pretty well place the position of the different sangar as i have be over the ground with harley on my previous visit to chitral to make matter certain i suggest that i should reconnoitre the position next day this be agree to and it be also determine to attack the enemy on the 13th April as it be no use give they time to entrench themselves more than we could help i start off about 9 be on the morning of the 12th April mount on a transport pony i have about fifty hunza and punyal levy under humayun and akbar khan with I these two also have pony akbar khan have manage to get two over the pass with great difficulty it be a lovely morning and we be all very cheerful except gammer sing who want to come along with I but as he have to get my kit sort and put right for the next day 's march i leave he behind but take he rifle and ammunition we drop over the bluff and ford the laspur stream which be hardly over the man 's knee and then keep along the bed of the river with a few scout well up the hill on we leave the mastuj or yarkhun river protect we right after about two mile we come to a small homestead and humayun tell I there be a wounded man inside so in i go and find the poor beggar with he right leg smash by a bullet just above the knee there be a lot of woman and child and two man in the house he brother so i give they a note to luard and tell they to carry the man into mastuj which they do luard set he leg and by this time he be no doubt well and happy shortly after that we climb up from the bed of the river on to a narrow ledge which run along the foot of the hill about two hundred foot above the river here we leave we horse and go scramble along among the fall débris for about half a mile when we come to the foot of a stone slope and i notice we advanced guard have halt on the top and on ask the reason humayun say that the enemy be occupy the next spur so up we go and find the fact true enough but the next spur be some thousand yard away so on we go across that slope and on to the next eventually reach a very nice little place some eight hundred yard from the spur occupy by the enemy from here i could see pretty well the whole of the position occupy by the enemy except the end of the nisa gol nullah where it debouch on to the river i try go up the hill but that only make matter worse so i determine to sketch what i could see from here and then try across the river in order not to be interrupted i send five man well up the hill on to a spur from whence they could see any man who try to sneak up for a shot and spread out the rest in skirmish order to my front humayun and akbar get behind a rock and go to sleep and i get out my telescope and set to work the enemy seem rather interested in we proceedings -- we could see they head bob up and down behind the sangar but after we have settle down they gradually take courage and come outside sit down to watch we this be very nice of they for very soon i have a complete list of the garrison of each sangar and from where i be could see the sort of gun they be arm with -- a few rifle among the lower sangar and nearly all matchlock among the higher and more inaccessible one it be a calm peaceful scene : the enemy sit outside they sangar sun themselves and my man lie down a few watch the rest sleep one or two enjoy a friendly pipe shortly after we see two gallant young spark come ride along the plain on the opposite side of the river evidently have be send by the general to report on we proceedings they pull up opposite we and watch we for a short time and then one slip off he horse which be lead by the other behind a big boulder think they would merely watch we i shout to my man to keep a eye on they and go on sketch presently there be a bang and ping come a bullet over we head the beggar be pot at we at about a thousand yard unpardonable waste of ammunition i put a rock between we and go on sketch everyone else do ditto and presently we friend shut up but after a time find thing slow i suppose he begin again this seem to annoy humayun who ask for the loan of my rifle and he and akbar go dodge down the hill they disappear behind a dip in the ground and presently i see they come out lower down among some bush and gradually they work they way down to the edge of the river about eight hundred yard from we friend who be calmly sit in the open have occasional pot shot at we while he friend have come out and be evidently criticise the performance presently there be a bang from we side of the river and a spurt of dust on the opposite maidan where the bullet strike humayun have over-judge the distance by the time he be ready for another shot we two friend be leg it across the plain as fast as they pony could gallop he get in a couple of shot more but they do not hurt anybody as soon as humayun commence firing the sangar in we front begin hum like a beehive and presently shoot after shot come drop among we the enemy evidently have plenty of ammunition and for some minute thing be quite lively but find we make no response they calm down gradually and peace once more reign supreme i chaff old humayun when he come back on he shooting power and he grin in response i now notice rather a commotion among the garrison of the sangar across the nisa gol nullah the man begin turn out and one or two run towards the higher sangar evidently pass on some news presently i see a crowd of man mostly mount with other on foot carry flag then come a fat man in white with a standard-bearer all to himself all the garrison of the sangar turn out and i count they -- there be over a hundred in each the commander-in-chief ride up the whole length of the nullah and then walk up the spur on which be show sangar no 16 and 17 in the sketch here he sit down and i have no doubt calculate the odds on he win when the action come off after a time he come down the hill and the procession move down along the nullah and out of sight when i have finish my sketch i shut up my telescope and say -- now we 'll go across the river why do you want to cross the river say humayun i want to see the end of the nullah say i they cavalry will get you say he what cavalry say i you have just see two of they say he get out say i you be pull my leg do not go say he i be go say i where the sahib go i follow say he come on ruth say i ` whither thou goest i will go ' i have hear that remark before these hillman have a extraordinarily exaggerated idea of cavalry any young buck on a long-tailed screw be a chevalier bayard to they why you have only to move ten yard to you right or leave in any part of the country and no cavalry could reach you while you could sit and chuck stone at they down we drop again into the river bed leave a few man to signal any movement of the enemy while we be cross we have we pony bring up and ride across the stream the man ford then we scramble up the high slope of the opposite bank and shout for the remainder to follow a short distance up the hill and i could see the end of the nullah with a large sangar cover the road this be what i wish to know so after a careful look have see all i want we start homewards by the opposite bank to that by which we have come cross the river again by a bridge which oldham have be employ the day before in mending and reach mastuj by 1 pm i give in my report to colonel kelly and then get out order for the next day 's march i also suggest that some light scale ladder should be make as i expect we should find they very useful in cross the nisa gol accordingly oldham set he sapper to work and by evening have ten light scale ladder ready each about ten foot long and light enough to be carry by one man a certain amount of supplies and some coolie have be collect the gun have be mount on pony and could now march along faster than when carry by coolie everything be ready for a early advance the next morning so as a little diversion we be photograph by moberly moberly be come out the next day in command of a company of kashmir troops after the expect fight he would return to mastuj to resume command and the kashmir troops would be put under my charge the order for next day be to march at 7 be baggage to remain in mastuj till send for and then to come out under escort of part of the garrison who would escort back any wound we might have luard come out in charge of the field hospital and return with the wound to form a base hospital at mastuj i manage to get a bottle of whiskey out of moberly it belong i believe to fowler but as he be either a prisoner or dead he would not require the whiskey i also replenish my store of chocolate chapter vii the fight at nisa gol next morning 13th April we be all have a good square breakfast by 6 be and punctually at seven o'clock the column move off head by the levy we force consist of -- 400 pioneer 100 kashmir infantry 40 kashmir sapper 2 mountain gun 100 hunza and punyal levy rather less than a single battalion and not much with which to force we way through seventy mile of bad country but still we be determine to get to chitral before the peshawur force it be a perfect morning nice bright sunshine and a jolly fresh feeling in the air sort of day that make you want to take a gun and go shooting in fact just the very day for a fight the levy be across oldham 's bridge in no time but the pioneer have to cross it slowly as it be very jumpy and only four man could be allow on it at a time the gun be send up to a ford some three hundred yard up the stream after cross the main stream there be still a creek to be ford but this be not much above the man 's knee this give the levy time to get ahead and send some scout up the hill to the right in order to give timely warning if the enemy should try on the roll stone dodge but the hill just here do not lend themselves very readily to this mode of warfare when we little army get across the river the advance guard be halt and the column form up and then on we go peterson be in command of the advance guard with order to halt when he reach the edge of the plain to allow the column to close up for the attack on the order to advance he be to hug the hill on he right just before the maidan the road drop down on to the river bed and then run up on to the maidan itself which gradually slope up to the center where it be divide by a deep nullah that i think they call in america a cañon the side of this nullah be in most place perpendicular vary from two hundred and fifty to three hundred foot in depth with a small stream run along the bottom the amount of water depend on the melting of the snow in the hill above there be two place to cross it one the regular road to chitral which zig-zag down the nullah near the mouth and the other a goat track about half-way between the road and the hill both of these have sangar cover they approach on the enemy 's side of the nullah and any attempt to rush they would have lead to great loss of life to the casual observer the plain look perfectly flat but as a matter of fact the slope be rather more pronounced at the foot than at the top near the hill with the result that from the sangar cover the main road the upper end of the plain be partially hide from fire the plain also be really a succession of what may be describe as wave run parallel with the nullah which afford very excellent shelter to any attack force in fact the only obstacle be the nullah but as you may see from the photo this obstacle be no small one and could only be cross by two path as far as we know we object be to find another path and to get to close quarter with the enemy -lrb- illustration : look up the nisa gol nullah -rrb- so much for the ground : now for the fight peterson and the levy get on to the maidan and extend while the main body form up for attack then the order to advance be give and off we go peterson and the levy be in the firing line and extend the levy on the right as the remain company reach the level plain they first form into line and go forward in the regular everyday style the ground be very nice for parade movement a gentle grassy slope with plenty of room the levy however be not keep close enough to the hillside and be gradually push peterson 's company off to the leave where they would have be expose to the fire of the big sangar plus the flanking fire from the sangar up the spur on the left bank of the river colonel kelly accordingly send I off to change they direction more to the right and to close the levy until they be wanted i find humayun 's pony take shelter under a rock so mount it i gallop after peterson give he the order and then close the levy on they right this make a gap into which we of the support company push so now we have two company in the firing line two in support and the kashmir company in reserve in this formation we push on till we come under fire of the sangar and have reach the valley run up into the hill about four hundred yard from the nullah thus again give room for the levy to form line on the right of the pioneer the fun now begin as the enemy start plug away at we from the sangar on the spur but not much at present from the lower one as only the flank of peterson 's company could be see stewart have get he gun into action and be shell sangar no 16 after a time peterson engage the sangar on the maidan and they give he a pretty warm time of it the levy open fire at three hundred yard rather close range to begin a action and it be very amusing watch they they instruction in volley-firing have only just be begin but they have entire faith in its efficiency the section commander use to give the word to load in they own language but the order to fire be fira vollee and they be suppose to fire on the word vollee if any man fire before the order -- and they frequently do -- the section commander use to rush at the culprit and slap he severely on the nearest part of he as the levy be lie down the slap be -- on the usual place after a time the fire from the sangar slacken and as thing seem to be go all right i stop the levy firing and take two of they go forward up to the edge of the nullah to see if there be any sign of a road we follow the edge upward for some two hundred yard and then i tell the two levy to go on until they find a place and then go back the fire from the sangar have recommence as stewart 's attention have be turn towards other so colonel kelly send order to stewart to send in one or two more shell which have the desire effect i now send gammer sing to get a fresh supply of ammunition for the levy which he bring and i then follow colonel kelly down the line to the pioneer in the meantime the gun have change they position and be engage with the lower sangar as be also peterson who i think be under the hottest fire the whole time as he have the attention of two big sangar entirely pay to he the gun also get hit a bit and among other two of the driver be kill they be the owner of the gun pony and remain with the pony under a guard of four kashmir sepoy who have command to shoot any man try to bolt they and they pony of course make a large target but the pony also act as a protection one more of the pioneer company now come into the firing line and these three company devote they entire attention to one sangar whose fire be now very intermittent i now get colonel kelly 's leave to go and look for a path and hail oldham to come and help I work forward therefore in front of the firing line to do which we have to ask borradaile to stop one company firing which he very kindly do we strike the nullah close opposite the empty sangar no 15 and from there follow the edge till we be well within sight of the sangar in the middle of the maidan without have find a place where we could get down but we notice a track which lead up the opposite bank we therefore turn back and retrace we step till we come to a spot which we have examine before but have think impossible where we stand the drop be sheer for some seventy foot but then there come a ledge from which we think we could scramble down on to the bed of the stream and up the opposite side where we have notice the track we therefore hurry back oldham for he sapper and i to report to colonel kelly i likewise ask for the reserve company of kashmir troops to cross over as soon as a path could be make under cover of the fire of the already extend company of the pioneer colonel kelly assented and i send off a note to moberly to bring up he company when i get back to the nullah i find the pioneer extend along the edge and oldham 's sapper already at work -lrb- illustration : reconnaissance sketch of the position at nisa gol -rrb- the levy in the meantime have hear of a path higher up in the hill and be send off to cross as best they could have nothing more to do i sit down where oldham 's man be at work and watch the proceedings the man in no 16 sangar have evidently have enough of it they sangar have be pretty well knock about they ear and when any of the survivor try a shot it call down a volley on he presently they begin to bolt and then the laugh be on we side that sangar be a death-trap to its garrison -- they only line of escape be across some open shaley slope within four hundred yard of we firing line and the levy be now work along the hill and would catch they in the sangar if they do not clear out the result be like rabbit shooting you would see a man jump from the sangar and bolt across the shale slope slip and scramble as he go then there would be a volley and you would see the dust fly all round he -- perhaps he would drop perhaps he would not then there would be another volley and you would see he chuck forward amid a laugh from the sepoy and he would roll over and over till he would fetch up against a rock and lie still sometimes two or three would bolt at once one or two would drop at each volley and go roll limp and shapeless down the slope until they be all down and there would be a wait for the next lot a old sepoy lie near I declare as each man drop that it be he particular rifle whose aim have be so accurate until borradaile call he sharply to order and tell he to attend to business presently a crowd of man appear higher up on the same spur and someone call out that they be levy just then one of they drop on he knee and fire in we direction there be a volley back and the man disappear again oldham have now manage with rope and the scale ladder to get down on to the ledge below so call to moberly to bring along he company i dive down follow by gammer sing and then moberly and one or two man of the sapper follow he and we think the whole company be come go scramble down to the bottom we slide down the rope on to the ladder and from they on to the ledge follow it a bit along the cliff and then down a shale and débris slope to the stream across that and up the other side scramble on all four up the opposite side i hear oldham who be ahead of I shout back that the company be not follow i yell run up a sangar and we can hold on till they come and finish my scramble up to the top then we take a look round to see how thing stand devil a sign of the company come down the rope be there and the pioneer seem to have disappear too then we number we party -- three british officer my orderly and eleven sapper the latter arm with snider carbine only my orderly be the only one with a bayonet there be a low ridge in front of we hide the enemy 's sangar so we line this with the sapper till we could see what the game be we now see the pioneer move down the nullah towards the river while at the same time the levy show on the ridge and take possession of the sangar we be all right i see so i give the order to advance -- keep along the edge of the nullah so as to get at the sangar of course just my luck that as we start to advance the buckle of my chuplie break there be no time to mend it so i shove it into my haversack and go along with one bare foot luckily the ground be not very stony as soon as we top the swell of the ground we see the enemy bolt in two and three from the nearest sangar now about two hundred yard off and presently there come a rush right across we front we open fire try volley at first but the sapper be useless at that never have have any training so independent firing be order during the halt moberly have a narrow shave a bullet pass between he left hand and thigh as he be stand superintend the firing he hand be almost touch he thigh and the bullet raise the skin of the palm just below the little finger the nearest sangar be now pretty well empty and the pioneer from the other side of the nullah be firing obliquely across we front rather too close to be pleasant so we alter we advance half right so as to cut into the line of retreat of the enemy and make for a jumble of stone out in the open by the time we reach it there be a stream of man fly right across we front horse and foot at about five hundred yard so again we open fire moberly and i both take carbine from the man as they be firing wildly the sepoy whose carbine i take invariably manage to jam the cartridge partly he fault and partly the fault of the worn state of the extractor gammer sing be plug in bullet quietly on my right and give I the distance as five hundred yard i know he be pretty correct as i watch he bullet pitch i sing out the distance and we get merrily to work oh if i have only have a company of my regiment i think even stewart would have be satisfied precious soon the rush have pass we and we have to begin put up we sight and of course then the cream of the business be over about this time shah mirza come along and see I with only one chuplie offer I he which i accept as it be a matter of indifference to he whether he go barefooted or not i send he off to bring up the levy who be looting the arm and secure the prisoner from the sangar cobbe now appear with some few pioneer and shortly after a whole company but the enemy be now quite out of sight however a company be send in pursuit colonel kelly come up and we congratulate he and there be a general demand for cigarette moberly i believe be the happy possessor of some as we be group round colonel kelly whit come a bullet over we some idiot up the hill leave he ppc card i presume one of the first question i ask be what have become of the kashmir company and then first hear the follow curious incident it appear that after the first few of we have go down the cliff and the rest be prepare to follow a bullet strike some cake of gun-cotton lie on the ground by the head of the path where they have be place while the sapper be at work the bullet striking these cake ignite they and they blaze up and borradaile fear a explosion order a retirement of those troops nearest it to cover some thirty yard in rear where they be protect by a wave of the ground the enemy see we man bolt as they think rush out of they sangar but be promptly fire into by the pioneer just then the levy on the ridge and we small party show across the nullah threaten they line of retreat this be apparently more than they have bargain for so they begin to bolt as i have say then the pioneer move down the nullah and cross by the goat track peterson 's company have find a box full of snider ammunition in one of the sangar so the kashmir company be send back to look for any more and also to demolish the sangar i take the opportunity to have a look at they too i be surprise at the magnificent way in which they be build partly sink into the ground and make of huge boulder that require many man to move and with head cover construct of log in the most approved fashion evidently make by man who have be properly instruct as i near the largest sangar i see a native clothe in a red dressing-gown sit on the ground with a long native jezail rather surprise at see one of the enemy thus armed i go up to he and as i do so he pick up he gun i have my revolver on he in a second and tell he to drop the gun which he do i then ask he who he be and find he be we long-lost child -- i mean levy -- who have be capture at laspur the enemy have not treat he badly but have take he carbine and he choga hence the dressing-gown in return he have sneak a gun when the enemy be fly i set the kashmir troops to work and then go back meet humayun and he captive on the way humayun i say you levy be over there be he alive say humayun look in a most bloodthirsty way at he prisoner i assure he he be thereupon humayun give a jump catch hold of both my hand and kiss they violently i be afraid he be go to kiss my ruby lip but he do not he and akbar khan then go scuttle across country to the sangar follow by a crowd of he man whoop and yell with joy the gun be now come across the nullah and the column be be form up with the intention of cross the river to sanoghar where it be propose to camp for the night part of the levy and a company of the pioneer be send ahead to clear the village of any evilly disposed person arrangement be make for bring up the sick and wounded and a signal message be flash back to mastuj for the baggage to come out the fight be over by 1230 pm so we have only be about two hour from start to finish we loss be six kill and sixteen wound two of whom die next day three of the battery pony be also kill the path down to the river be so steep and the rickety bridge over it so unsafe that it be determine to camp on the side of the river on which we be especially as we should have to recross the next day a camping ground be soon find picket throw out and the wound bring in a deputation from sanoghar village be now see come across from the opposite bank most of the deputation on arrival seem half naked we think this be a sign of humility on they part but i hear afterwards that the levy have come across they and take they choga in exchange for that of they man in the red dressing-gown this deputation give the usual yarn about be compel to fight against we and how glad they be that we have win we make we usual reply that they could and must show they gladness by provide coolie and supplies all of which would be pay for we also make they send over charpoy -lrb- bed -rrb- for the wound we have take some twelve prisoner who come in useful as transport in fact until we get to chitral every man we catch be turn into a beast of burden and give a load and if he be a adamzada or nobleman he be give the heaviest load that we could find for he oftentimes much to the delight of the poorer coolie as a adamzada be exempt from coolie labor in ordinary time the coolie use to bolt at every opportunity which be only natural and there be not much difficulty in do so as often as not we get into camp after dark when the coolie simply put down he load and walk off but as we supplies diminish we naturally require fewer coolie -- at any rate we manage to get all we baggage into chitral moberly now hand over the company of kashmir troops to my tender charge and depart back to mastuj so now i have the command of the levy and one company add to my numerous other duty so generally i be pretty well on the hop by dark the baggage have come in the dead either bury or burnt accord to they religion and the wound attend to and make as comfortable as we could make they under the circumstance oldham and some fifty levy who have be reconnoitr down the leave bank of the river have return and by nine we get some dinner just as we be turn in the picket on the road over the nullah first let drive a volley and oldham who be on duty take some man and double out to see what be the matter on he return he report the picket have hear someone move in the nullah and as the sentry 's challenge have not be answer they have let drive at it chapter viii the march resume through killum drasan we be up by daylight the next morning have breakfast and be ready to march by 7 be the wound be send back under luard and the escort who have bring out the baggage and we move off in the opposite direction we order of march be always the same each company take it in turn to act as advance or rear guard and every british officer with the exception of colonel kelly and borradaile take he turn on duty when my company of kashmir troops be on rear or advance guard i go with it at other time i go with the levy or colonel kelly whichever seem most useful we march for this day lead for some mile along a flat grassy plain a continuation of the nisa gol maidan then up and over a fairly high spur and gradually down to the river bed opposite the village of awus or avus here we have a halt for the man to drink as it be pretty thirsty work march in these hot valley we pass a village or two on the opposite bank but we side of the river be a desert of rock and stone there be a small bridge at awus so cobbe with fifty man and shah mirza as interpreter be send across to collect supplies from bunus the village in which jone have remain for a week after the koragh affair the main body continue along the right bank parallel with cobbe 's party during we halt two man have come in bring two pony which be much appreciate by colonel kelly and borradaile when we get opposite bunus there be a halt at the head of the column and colonel kelly send I on to find out the reason i forget to mention that when we be encamp at sanoghar a man -- chitralus -- have come in have escape from the enemy he brother be follower of suji-ul-mulk the little boy whom surgeon-major robertson as he then be have make mehter and who be besiege in chitral with we troops the opposition party represent by mahomed issar sher afzul 's foster-brother have therefore on capture this man put he in quod at killum drasan he have manage to escape the day of the fight and join we that evening and we promptly make use of he as a guide this guide now inform we that the road ahead be destroy and would take two day to repair but by turn up a spur on the right we could get past the broken part of the road in consequence of this there be a halt while the levy ascend the spur and reconnoitr the top and very soon we see they signalling back that all be clear send back the news to colonel kelly i remain with the levy who now turn sharp to the right and begin the ascent humayun offer I a pony which i thankfully accept and notice that there be now two or three pony where before there have be none i do not say anything at the time but shortly after there appear a order to say all capture pony be to be give up to the commissariat after the battery have have first pick it be a awful pull up that spur i suppose we go up at least two thousand foot i be all right as i have a pony but it must have be agony for the laden coolie once up the go be easy enough open grassy downs gradually slope down from where we stand to the junction of the yarkhun and turikho valley though the actual side of the tableland drop steeply down to the river by we present divergence we have turn the flank of any position the enemy could take up between mastuj and killum drasan and have also get the higher ground we road from here onwards be down hill i go ahead now with the levy as i want to find out if the fort be hold at drasan we get to the edge of the downs by 2 pm look straight down on the fort which be the other side of the river but from we position we could see right down into the interior the place be evidently desert for as we be watch i see a man go up and try the door but find it close he go away again the village all round seem desert and i could only see two man drive some cattle high up in the hill before i have finish my sketch the advance guard come up and shortly after colonel kelly there be a short halt to let the tail of the column close up and then we commence the descent we be down on the river bank in twenty minute and the levy wade across i on my pony we find the remains of a bridge which have evidently only just be destroy and the material i fancy throw into the river the levy be soon up to the fort and we have the main gate down in a jiffy by use a tree as a battering-ram and then the levy go through the place like professional burglar before i have hardly get into the courtyard they have find the grain store and be looting it i put gammer sing on sentry duty over the entrance and borradaile come up we inspect it and find enough grain to last we some month we now set the levy to work to get beam for repair the bridge at first we could not find any long enough until the levy notice the roof pole of the verandah we have they out and run they down to the river bank opposite to where the pioneer have draw up on the farther bank it take some time to build the bridge and it be pretty rickety when do but it save the man have to ford only one man fall into the river but he be pull out all right the baggage do not arrive at the bridge till dark and most of the coolie wade across as there be not time for they to cross in single file on the bridge the battery also ford but the donkey have to be unladen and the load carry across by hand and the donkey be then drive in and make to swim it be night before the rearguard begin to cross cobbe who be in command not get in till close on nine o'clock a couple of shot be fire after dark and there seem no satisfactory explanation as to why they be fire but nobody be hit the coolie be all put into the courtyard of the fort and a guard on the gate and they soon have fire go round which they huddle as it be impossible to carry away all the grain we have find i get permission to issue a ration to all the coolie who have most of they no supplies of any description and tell the guard who have replace gammer sing to let the coolie in in single file i then send some levy to drive they up like sheep the news soon spread that food be go cheap and they do not require much drive the flour be in a bin about six foot square by four foot high and only a small round hole at the top we soon enlarged that so that a man could get in i furnish he with a wooden shovel evidently mean for the job and give the order for the man to file in as each man come in he receive a shovelful into he skirt tail and then have to march round a box and out of the door it take some two hour to finish the job and even then the flour be not expend while the grain of which there be some in more bin have not be touch i leave the guard over the door and get back in time to get order out for the next day 's march by which time cobbe and the rearguard have come in dinner be ready and it have begin to rain we be camp in front of the fort the man in a field ourselves alongside on a pray place overlook the river the levy be on the right the ammunition and store pile by the quarter-guard the coolie lock up in the fort and the picket all right so we turn in towards morning the rain begin to fall heavily so i pull my bedding under the fort gateway where i find stewart and oldham have already get the best place however i find a spot between two levy and finish the night comfortably enough we have not do a bad day 's work on the whole march from seven in the morning till six at night cover some twenty mile of hilly country make a bridge and occupy one of the chief fort of the country cobbe with the rearguard have have the poorest time but he have have the satisfaction of raiding into bunus we wake up next morning to find a dull gray sky and the rain pour down everything damp and miserable and the cook have a fight with the wood to make it burn we propose march for the day be only a short one we do not start till eight be as we be move off a kashmir sepoy turn up who have be one of edwarde ' party and whose life have be save by a friendly villager who give he some chitralus clothes i tell he to fall in with the company and he come down with we to chitral the remainder of the flour be distribute among the sepoy and we take as much grain as we could find carriage for but it be very little a small convoy of punyal levy join we that day they have be forage up the yarkhun valley and have be send after we by moberly we road lead along the valley through cornfield and orchard which in spite of the rain look very pretty and green the tree be just in they first foliage and the corn about a foot high while all the peach and apricot tree be cover with bloom we do not see a soul on we march but the officer in charge of the rear-guard report that as soon as we leave killum drasan the villager come hurry down the hill in crowd at one place we have a short halt on account of a battery pony which be amusing itself by roll down a slope with a gun on its back it be bring back nothing the worse for its escapade and we resume we march before get into camp we road lead up from the lower valley on to some gentle undulating spur of the main range of hill here there be a cluster of village and every available spot be cultivate on one of these spur we camp where three small village or cluster of house form a triangle the center of which be a cornfield this form a excellent halting-place as the man be billet in the house each give the other mutual protection we form we mess in part of the room of the headman 's house one russool of khusht he be foster-father to the late nizam-ul-mulk but have acknowledge the opposition and join sher afzul -lrb- in the photograph he be sit half hidden behind the mehter 's left arm with he head rather raise -rrb- as we have be great friend during my first visit to chitral -- -lrb- he be awfully fond of whisky -rrb- -- i have no doubt he be please to hear i have be he guest in he own house but i never have a opportunity to thank he as he leave chitral hurriedly just before we arrival the house be the best i have see in chitral a fine stone-paved courtyard surround on three side with room and a verandah a fine old chinar tree near the gateway on the fourth side the principal room be high and larger than usual but of the usual pattern i think we get two company of the pioneer and ourselves into this house alone by three o'clock we have settle down and be get dry the levy be send out forage and bring in several pony as we store decrease and more pony be bring in we have spare pony for ride and we be nearly all mount by the time we reach chitral however we have not be there ten day before the owner begin turn up and we be order to give they back much to we disgust it be quite a treat to be in camp and settle before dark and i have no doubt the coolie be as thankful as we be the only drawback to we food be the flour of which the chupatty be make it be coarse to a degree and seem to consist chiefly of minute speckly piece of husk which use to tickle we throat up in the most unpleasant manner and have a nasty habit of choke the swallower in addition to be highly indigestible we use at last to sift the flour through linen and the residuum be a surprise and revelation we have intend to march the next morning by 7 be with the intention of get to a village call parpish but as it be still pelt with rain the march be defer to give the weather a chance of clear up which it very kindly do about 10 be when we start the kashmir company be on advance guard that day so i go with they two levy lead as usual about a quarter of a mile ahead we strike up country for about two mile till we get to a kotal or saddle from whence we have a splendid view of the surrounding country during a halt colonel kelly come up and i be able to point out to he the different place -- koragh defile where ross 's party have be cut up reshun where edwarde and fowler have hold out for a week and barna a village we reach the next day all these place be on the opposite bank of the river and several thousand foot below we we have by take we present route avoid a very difficult and dangerous part of the country and no doubt much disgust the inhabitant who on the old route would have have all thing they own way by two o'clock we have reach the village of gurka where we be meet by a deputation from whom we demand certain supplies to be bring to we camp on pain of severe punishment if not comply with and by 4 pm we get to the hamlet of lun and as there be a good camping ground good water and firewood colonel kelly decide to halt there here also supplies be demand the amount depend a good deal on the number of house and the knowledge of the locality possess by humayun the lunite pay up smartly enough as we be too close neighbor to allow of any hesitation but the gurka contribution have only partly come in the next morning so that a party of the levy be send back and the gurka villager have the trouble of bring the load along to barna instead of only two mile into lun while the headman be make to carry a box of ammunition all the way to chitral before evening the sun come out and it be very jolly in camp we have some nice short turf to lie on and the night be not too cold for comfort there be good place for the picket and the camp be compact and handy chapter ix near chitral the next morning April 17th we start sharp at 7 be two prisoner have be bring in the night before one of whom have a snider and twenty round of ammunition the other a matchlock they confess that they have fight we at nisa gol and state they be now go home we think differently and request they to carry box of ammunition one of they the owner of the snider object on the ground that he be a mullah but the objection be overrule as frivolous and he accompany we to chitral we always give the ammunition to doubtful character as they be then under the direct supervision of the guard and the load be also more awkward and heavier than skin of flour we drop down the hill now to the river bank i be on rearguard a nuisance at the best of time as any check at the head of the column act on the rearguard in increase ratio to the length of the column so a good deal of time be spend in wonder why the dickens they do not get on in front that be a particularly bad day for halt : the first one be cause by the column have to cross the perpish gol a very similar place to the nisa gol but undefended about two mile farther on the road run across the face of a cliff and have be destroy it take some three hour to repair it and then the baggage could only get along slowly we have some five unladen donkey that be keep at the end of the baggage column in case of need and one of they try to push past another they both roll over the cliff and go down about a hundred foot on to the road below which here make a zigzag the first donkey who come down land on he head and break he silly neck but the second donkey have better luck and land on the first donkey in a sit position he get up sniff contemptuously at he late friend and resume he journey we roll the remains of the elect over the cliff into the river and also resume we course during this march and follow one we frequently see the body of man float down the river or strand in shoal they be probably the sikh kill with ross or perhaps some of edwarde ' party by 430 pm the rearguard have cross the cliff and round the shoulder of a spur descend to a plain bare of vegetation with the exception of the inevitable wormwood we cross this for about a mile and then strike down to the river and see the pioneer and gun draw up on the farther bank and just move off the road on the right hand have be again destroy a few mile beyond the direction of the column have be change and a ford have be find the troops have wade across with the intention of camping that night at the village of barna the rearguard arrive just in time to see the main body move off towards the village the levy have be leave behind to help the baggage across and render invaluable assistance save many a man from drown i find most of the coolie with they load still on the right bank of the river leisurely proceeding to strip before wade across the load have to be carry on they head the water be well above they waist those load that could be divide be carry over piecemeal the coolie return for the second part after take the first across this idea be all very fine in theory but we find that most of the coolie have make the first trip sit down on the bank and proceed to dress leave the remainder of they load to find its way across as best it could luckily sergeant reeve be on the farther bank and i have also cross over we proceed to drive every coolie back into the river until there be not a load leave on the opposite bank rudyard kipling in he story of the taking of the lungtungpen tell how after the scrimmage in the village we halt and form up and liftinant brazenose blushin ' pink in the light of the mornin ' sun 'twa the most ondacent parade i iver tuk a hand in -- four-and-twenty private a ' a officer av the line in review ordher a ' not as much as wud dust a fife between 'em all in the way of clothin ' as i stand on that bank with the evening sun light up the river i thought of liftinant brazenose and also blush true i be clothe myself but instead of twenty-five i have two hundred coolie in the same condition as that bashful officer 's army it take we some three hour before all those load be over during which we have some exciting moment most of the coolie find the stream too strong to stem alone and so they cross in party of a dozen or more hold hand but now and then a man would try by himself generally with the result that half-way across he would get sweep off he foot and go float down the stream vainly endeavor to regain he footing then there would be a rush of two or three of the levy the man would be swing on to he foot and he load fish for one man i thought be bind to be drown he have somehow tie he load on to he head and be wash off he foot he head be keep down below the water while he leg remain wave frantically in the air the load be light float and in this manner he be wash down stream till two levy reach he and swing he right side up bring he splutter ashore i often notice when send a old man back for the remainder of he load that some youngster who have bring he whole load across would volunteer to bring the remainder of the old man 's and of course i be only too glad to let he we find the young man easy to manage and the old man be let down lightly it be the middle-aged man full of strength and he own importance who sometimes try to raise objection but it be get late and no time for fool so we drive we argument home with a gun butt and the man obey the rearguard cross in the dark and by nine o'clock i be able to report to colonel kelly that everybody have arrive in camp just as dinner be ready i do not turn in till late that night as i be on duty and have to go scramble round the picket even at that late hour i see many man still cooking probably prepare food for the next day as we supplies be now reduce to less than three day we march the next morning be order for 10 be in order to allow forage party to go out at daybreak to scoop in anything they could find in the meantime i send some levy forward to the next village to reconnoitre the forage party do not bring in much but in we case every little be of importance and by 10 be we start we front in camp have be protect by a deep nullah it take some time get across this by the time we clear the village we meet we return scout who report have see the enemy in the village of morus and report they strength as some one hundred man on foot and about twenty horseman so we all cheer up at the chance of a fight the road now drop down to the river bed and run along the foot of some cliff three or four hundred foot sheer above the roadway there be about a mile of this and then two mile of narrow path along the face of steep shale slope and cliff face high above the river any force once catch in this place could be cut off to a man the path be so narrow that in many place the gun pony could not have turn round colonel kelly however be not to be catch in this way so the advance guard be order to go right through this part of the road till they reach the maidan on the farther side to hold that and send back word that they have do so the main body halt in the meantime till a clear road be announce half-way through the advance guard find the road broken but it be soon mended and the end of the road under the cliff reach here there be a flattish bit of maidan for about fifty yard before the path ascend and cross the face of slope and cliff the officer in command of the advance guard think this be the maidan mention in he order send back word that he be through the defile and the road clear accordingly the main body advance with a flanking picket on the cliff above i be with colonel kelly at the head of the column when turn a corner we come slap on top of the halted advance guard there be no time to stop now and the advance guard be hurry on to allow the main body to at least get clear of the cliff and on the slope we get at last on to the slope but find the road break in several place which delay the column considerably luckily i know the levy be on ahead but i be glad when we reach the end of the bad track when we be once more on the move i go ahead to join the levy and find out about the report enemy i find the levy on the maidan that we advance guard should have occupy in the first place and with they two man who have come out from the village of mori now only some two mile away these man report that mahomed issar have leave about 7 be for khogazus take all he follow with he and that he would defend a position know as the goland gol just in front of that village i now go ahead with the levy and we sweep through the village till we see clear open country ahead and satisfied ourselves that there be none of the enemy leave i then order the levy to ransack every nook and cranny for supplies and go myself in search of a camping ground that be not a very difficult job and i soon come upon a nice garden and orchard with big shady mulberry tree and a stream flow down the center on one side be the house that mahome issar have occupy and belong to one of sher afzul 's lead man it be a well-built house and inside we find some thirty sack of caraway seed the stuff they put in what be call wholesome cake for child the pioneer native officer tell we that each sack be worth at least one hundred rupee in peshawur but we would gladly have exchange the whole amount for half the amount of flour one of the sack be empty out and the man allow to help themselves each man take away a handful or so as native be very fond of it for cooking purpose especially for curry a little go a long way the whole camp smell of caraway seed and not a unpleasant smell either the house be pull down for firewood everyone be delighted with the camp and it be as picturesque as could be desire the weather be first-class for bivouac the tree be in full leaf and give a delightful shade while the ground be cover with a good sound turf forage party be send out immediately and the villager who have meet we promise to go and induce they friend to return in fact they do collect some ten man each of whom bring a small sack of flour and with that and what the forage party bring in we have enough for ourselves and the coolie for three day by which time we hope to arrive in chitral a good deal of the grain bring in consist of unhusk rice and millet what canary bird be feed on in england -- good enough for the coolie at any rate most of they have be use to it from childhood we try to get the village water-mill go but all the ironwork have be carry away and we have no means of quickly refit they so the unthreshed rice and millet seed be issue as it be and the man have to grind it as best they could with stone we still have some goat and sheep and the man use to get a meat ration whenever there be enough to go round the rearguard be in by 5 pm that day the first time since we have leave mastuj that it have come in before dark thing be look up the bridge at morus have be burn but we hear of another some two mile farther down which if destroy could be more easily mend and as the reputed position take up by the enemy could be turn from the right bank of the river it be determine to repair it consequently early the next morning oldham and he sapper with a cover party of one company of pioneer under bethune and the hunza levy start to repair the bridge and be ready to cross and turn the enemy 's flank should he be find await we a hour later the main body start over a road lead along a high cliff here and there the enemy have evidently make attempt to destroy the road but so ineffectually that the advance guard hardly delay its advance for five minute to repair it and by 10 be we have reach the broken bridge and find oldham and he party hard at work mend it the great difficulty be want of beam to stretch across from pier to pier but attempt be be make to get these from a adjacent village on the opposite bank of the river the bridge would not be ready for some two hour at earliest so colonel kelly send I on to reconnoitre the goland gol which we expect the enemy to hold i kick my pony into a gallop and hurry forward about a quarter of a mile farther on i see one of the road-bearing beam of the destroy bridge which have strand on the opposite bank and send back a note describe where it could be find another quarter of a mile bring I up to the punyal levy who be already reconnoitr the spur where the army be suppose to be but after a careful look through my glass we come to the conclusion that there be no enemy and again advance we reach the goland gol which be a narrow nullah run up into the hill on the left bank of the river the side be impracticable for several mile and down the center of which rush a mountain torrent the road to chitral cross this latter just before it flow into the yarkhun river by means of a bridge this bridge we find destroy but i send half the levy across by ford the stream a hundred yard higher up and make they occupy the ridge on the far side and put the remainder on to repair the bridge i also give my pony and a note to one of the levy whom i send back with a report to colonel kelly who on receive it have work on the other bridge knock off as it be no longer want we hunt for the beam of the goland gol bridge which we find jam in the stream a short way down only one out of the four be smash and soon have they back in they place then we lay a roadway of board from a hut near and fill up the hole with branch and have the bridge ready before the advance guard arrive i send back word and then cross the stream and join the remainder of the levy on the farther side here i find several sangar which cover the approach to the bridge and soon have they down and then go on to the village of khogazus which be about a mile ahead we sweep through that village in the usual manner from end to end find only one man who turn out to be a gilgitus he have be carry into slavery several year previously but have marry and settle down from he we learn that mohamed issar with a following of about one hundred man have arrive the day before about noon shortly after a messenger come in from sher afzul tell he to come into chitral without delay and consequently the whole party have set off about 4 pm all the villager he say have flee up the goland gol to the higher hill but he would try and bring in any he could find he do not think the enemy would try and fight again though there be a place call baitalus just before the opening into the chitral valley where if any opposition be offer it would be make the position could be turn from both flank and pony could go but it be not a good road he profess himself as willing to go and find out if the baitali parus be occupy so i send he off i know the place as one of the worst bit in the whole road between mastuj and chitral but i also know it could be pass by cross the river at khogazus and climb the hill on the right hand and down on to the chitral river above its junction with the yarkhun river this would be convenient if the chitral bridge be destroy as it would take we along the right bank on which stand the fort but i know also of a ford about two mile above the chitral bridge where we could cover we passage as the ground be level and open chapter x we reach the goal i pick out a camping ground even better than we have enjoy at morus and then share some chupatty and chocolate with rajah akbar khan the main body come in by two o'clock and the baggage shortly after forage party be send out and oldham send to report on the bridge in case we decide to cross he report it as practicable so a guard be put on it to keep it so stewart come into camp that day like a bear with a sore head here have he be haul he gun over condemn precipice in pursuit of a invisible enemy call this war it be only a route march for a promenade he prefer the empire theater we try to console he with hope of a fight before chitral but he declare the chitrali have grievously disappointed he and go off to see about fodder for he pony alas poor stewart he do not get he desire as soon as we have settle down in camp colonel kelly tell I to try and find some man who would carry a letter into chitral to warn the garrison of we approach i get hold of shah mirza and ask he if he know anyone who would go first we try the man who have escape from killum drasan but he refuse then shah mirza volunteer to go himself but he be too useful to be spare just as we be wonder who we could get to go humayun and akbar khan turn up evidently excite and escort a man who be bear letter from chitral he hand over a letter address to the officer command troops advance from gilgit inside be a letter from surgeon-major robertson say that sher afzul have flee on the night of the 18th April and the siege of chitral be raise he enclose a return of the kill and wound which he request might be forward to indium then we go through the list and come across poor baird 's name among the kill this be the first we have hear of it the native all declare that it be gurdon who have be kill among the wound we come across surgeon-major robertson severely and captain campbell severely poor old general baj singh and major bicham singh be kill and all together the casualty amount to one hundred and four kill and wound out of three hundred and seventy combatant so the garrison have evidently have a lively time of it then we set to work and pump the messenger dry of all the news he could tell the detail of which be now too well know for I to relate the man have a passport from surgeon-major robertson send he to killa drasan so he be allow to go we also find out from he that there be no enemy between we and chitral at which stewart swear openly my spy return on meet the chitral messenger there be no difficulty now in get a man to go to chitral so we send off one with a note say we should arrive next day by noon the 20th April the news have spread quickly through camp and the native officer come round to hear about it we send back a post to mastuj by some nagar levy who have just bring in a post and then have a good discussion as to the cause that lead to the raising of the siege i do not know if any of the other officer feel it but i know speak for myself that with the departure of any uncertainty about we arrival in chitral in time to save the garrison a good deal of interest also depart i feel inclined to agree with stewart that the enemy have give we a just cause for complaint by not play the game at any rate they might have give we a run for we money in front of chitral and this seem to be the general idea throughout the column consequently we opinion of the chitralus pluck sink considerably we march at 6 be the next morning punctually and by noon the advance guard be in the chitral valley a halt be order to allow the main body to form up as the gun have have a bad time get through the baitali parus and have to be unloaded and carry by hand for some distance after about two mile we come in sight of the chitral bridge which have not be destroy and soon after of the fort with the union jack still float on one of the tower we cross the bridge close up the column on the other side the bugler be send to the front and we march on to the fort with as much swagger as we could put on we find the garrison in front of the main gate and be very glad to shake hand again with all we old friend and congratulate they on they splendid defense we have a short halt and then move on and take up a position cover the fort with we front on a nullah and picket face south we bivouac be in a nice shady garden with plenty of good water and wood when the man have settle down in camp the officer go back to the fort where the garrison give we breakfast or rather lunch there be a great deal to hear and tell and for the first time we begin to realize what a touch-and-go time the garrison have be have there be only one pause in the conversation and good old stewart chip in with d'ye think now there be any chance of another fight after tiffin we go round and see all the sight of interest and generally interview the lion we see harley 's mine the gun tower the enemy 's sangar the hospital and we do not forget poor baird 's grave which be just outside the main gate then we go back to camp and most of we take the opportunity to write home i also take a photograph when everyone be assemble over the homely cup of tea the bottle on the table look like whisky but they only contain treacle make by melt down country goor the extract of sugar-cane it be we substitute for butter or jam luxury we have not see for week whisky be a dream of the past and rum a scarcity in fact there be no difference between what we and the sepoy eat except in the manner of cooking we go to sleep that night with the blissful consciousness that the next day be a halt at any rate and i think we need the rest we have put on we least ragged coat to march in and make as brave a show as possible but we kit generally be in a pretty disreputable state and there be a good deal of work want in the laundry line most of we also have misgiving about we boot i be reduce to choose between boot with large hole in the sole or chuply mend with string the boot i keep for show day as the hole do not show and the chuply for ordinary work most of the other officer be much in the same plight so end the march of colonel kelly 's column to chitral we record on the whole be not bad though of course judge by actual distance we have not do much it be more the difficult nature of the ground and the altitude at which some of it be do that lend interest to the march and i be unfeignedly glad my luck cause I to participate in it the next day the kashmir troops of the garrison come out and camp with we and revel in the fresh air after the poisonous atmosphere of the fort poor chap they be walk skeleton bloodless and as quiet as the ghost they resemble most of they reduce to jersey and garment of any description but still plucky and of good heart they cheer up wonderfully in a few day with good fresh air and sleep and march from chitral quite briskly when they leave the next day i again go round the fort and get some photo which follow one of the british officer of the garrison beneath the gun tower which be set on fire and during the extinguishing of which surgeon-major robertson the british agent be wound by a snider bullet there be also the loophole afterwards make from which a sentry inside the tower could fire at anyone within a few foot then i get harley to show I the site of he sortie and pretty grisly the place look but unfortunately the photograph i take show the mine lie open like a ditch to the foot of the tower be a wrong un but i succeed in get one show the mouth of the mine with the excavate earth then i take one of the sangar from the interior with the little shelter use by the pathan when not amusing themselves with rifle practice the water tower be just visible through the foliage then i take a photo of the fort from the corner by the gun tower look towards the musjid which be show in a photo at the beginning of the book but take in more peaceful time it show the bridge in the distance which the fire of the sikh make too hot for the chitrali who have to cross over the hill in the daytime then i take harley and the two native officer of the 14th sikh subadar gurmuskh singh and jemadar atta singh atta singh put on white glove to grace the occasion but evidently tremble violently during the exposure i get a shot at borradaile sit in a shelter oldham have run up for himself the hawk and spear be loot at sanoghar i think borradaile look very like diogene in he tub i also take some kafir who stroll into camp we use to buy they dagger but they get to ask as much as twenty rupee for a good one after a time every kaffir have a dagger some of they very good one but roughly finish after we have be some day in chitral some of the 3rd brigade under general gatacre arrive follow by general low and the headquarter staff there be a parade of all the troops in chitral with the usual tomasha of salute and inspection we be then form up in a square and general low make a speech in which he say that the honor of raise the siege of chitral belong to colonel kelly 's force whereat we of that force throw out we chest and pat ourselves on the back we also wink the other eye little suji-ul-mulk the mehter elect be present at the review with he follow and personally conduct by the ba resplendent in political uniform we soldier be in khaki the parade be dismiss and head by the pipe of the general 's escort and of the 4th gurkha we march back to we camp a few day afterwards i be order back to gilgit to take up baird 's duty and the pioneer follow shortly after the kashmir troops have go back to sudin on relief and the pioneer have follow there be only one or two of we now leave in gilgit who take part in the march but black or white it be a bond between we which will i hope last we lifetime end of the project gutenberg ebook of with kelly to chitral by william george laurence beynon
