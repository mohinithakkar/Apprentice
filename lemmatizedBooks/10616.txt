have design man for a sociable creature make he not only with a inclination and under a necessity to have fellowship with those of he own kind but furnish he also with language which be to be the great instrument and common tie of society man therefore have by nature he organ so fashion as to be fit to frame articulate sound which we call word but this be not enough to produce language for parrot and several other bird will be teach to make articulate sound distinct enough which yet by no means be capable of language 2 to use these sound as sign of idea besides articulate sound therefore it be further necessary that he should be able to use these sound as sign of internal conception and to make they stand as mark for the idea within he own mind whereby they might be make know to other and the thought of man 's mind be convey from one to another 3 to make they general sign but neither be this sufficient to make word so useful as they ought to be it be not enough for the perfection of language that sound can be make sign of idea unless those sign can be so make use of as to comprehend several particular thing : for the multiplication of word would have perplex they use have every particular thing need of a distinct name to be signify by -lrb- to remedy this inconvenience language have yet a further improvement in the use of general term whereby one word be make to mark a multitude of particular existence : which advantageous use of sound be obtain only by the difference of the idea they be make sign of : those name become general which be make to stand for general idea and those remain particular where the idea they be use for be particular -rrb- 4 to make they signify the absence of positive idea besides these name which stand for idea there be other word which man make use of not to signify any idea but the want or absence of some idea simple or complex or all idea together such as be nihil in latin and in english ignorance and barrenness all which negative or privative word can not be say properly to belong to or signify no idea : for then they would be perfectly insignificant sound but they relate to positive idea and signify they absence 5 word ultimately derive from such as signify sensible idea it may also lead we a little towards the original of all we notion and knowledge if we remark how great a dependence we word have on common sensible idea and how those which be make use of to stand for action and notion quite remove from sense have they rise from thence and from obvious sensible idea be transfer to more abstruse signification and make to stand for idea that come not under the cognizance of we sens vg to imagine apprehend comprehend adhere conceive instil disgust disturbance tranquillity & c be all word take from the operation of sensible thing and apply to certain mode of think spirit in its primary signification be breath angel a messenger : and i doubt not but if we could trace they to they source we should find in all language the name which stand for thing that fall not under we sens to have have they first rise from sensible idea by which we may give some kind of guess what kind of notion they be and whence derive which fill they mind who be the first beginner of language and how nature even in the naming of thing unaware suggest to man the original and principle of all they knowledge : whilst to give name that might make know to other any operation they feel in themselves or any other idea that come not under they sens they be fain to borrow word from ordinary known idea of sensation by that mean to make other the more easily to conceive those operation they experiment in themselves which make no outward sensible appearance and then when they have get know and agree name to signify those internal operation of they own mind they be sufficiently furnished to make know by word all they other idea since they could consist of nothing but either of outward sensible perception or of the inward operation of they mind about they we have as have be prove no idea at all but what originally come either from sensible object without or what we feel within ourselves from the inward workings of we own spirit of which we be conscious to ourselves within 6 distribution of subject to be treat of but to understand better the use and force of language as subservient to instruction and knowledge it will be convenient to consider : first to what it be that name in the use of language be immediately apply secondly since all -lrb- except proper -rrb- name be general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sort and rank of thing it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sort and kind or if you rather like the latin name what the species and genus of thing be wherein they consist and how they come to be make these be -lrb- as they ought -rrb- well look into we shall the better come to find the right use of word the natural advantage and defect of language and the remedy that ought to be use to avoid the inconvenience of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of word : without which it be impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concern knowledge : which be conversant about proposition and those most commonly universal one have greater connexion with word than perhaps be suspect these consideration therefore shall be the matter of the follow chapter chapter ii of the signification of word 1 word be sensible sign necessary for communication of idea man though he have great variety of thought and such from which other as well as himself might receive profit and delight yet they be all within he own breast invisible and hide from other nor can of themselves be make to appear the comfort and advantage of society not be to be have without communication of thought it be necessary that man should find out some external sensible sign whereof those invisible idea which he thought be make up of might be make know to other for this purpose nothing be so fit either for plenty or quickness as those articulate sound which with so much ease and variety he find himself able to make thus we may conceive how word which be by nature so well adapt to that purpose come to be make use of by man as the sign of they idea not by any natural connexion that there be between particular articulate sound and certain idea for then there would be but one language amongst all man but by a voluntary imposition whereby such a word be make arbitrarily the mark of such a idea the use then of word be to be sensible mark of idea and the idea they stand for be they proper and immediate signification 2 word in they immediate signification be the sensible sign of he idea who use they the use man have of these mark be either to record they own thought for the assistance of they own memory or as it be to bring out they idea and lay they before the view of other : word in they primary or immediate signification stand for nothing but the idea in the mind of he that use they how imperfectly soever or carelessly those idea be collect from the thing which they be suppose to represent when a man speak to another it be that he may be understand : and the end of speech be that those sound as mark may make known he idea to the hearer that then which word be the mark of be the idea of the speaker : nor can any one apply they as mark immediately to anything else but the idea that he himself have : for this would be to make they sign of he own conception and yet apply they to other idea which would be to make they sign and not sign of he idea at the same time and so in effect to have no signification at all word be voluntary sign they can not be voluntary sign impose by he on thing he know not that would be to make they sign of nothing sound without signification a man can not make he word the sign either of quality in thing or of conception in the mind of another whereof he have none in he own till he have some idea of he own he can not suppose they to correspond with the conception of another man nor can he use any sign for they : for thus they would be the sign of he know not what which be in truth to be the sign of nothing but when he represent to himself other man 's idea by some of he own if he consent to give they the same name that other man do it be still to he own idea to idea that he have and not to idea that he have not 3 example of this this be so necessary in the use of language that in this respect the know and the ignorant the learn and the unlearned use the word they speak -lrb- with any meaning -rrb- all alike they in every man 's mouth stand for the idea he have and which he would express by they a child have take notice of nothing in the metal he hear call gold but the bright shine yellow color he apply the word gold only to he own idea of that color and nothing else and therefore call the same color in a peacock 's tail gold another that have better observe add to shine yellow great weight : and then the sound gold when he use it stand for a complex idea of a shine yellow and a very weighty substance another add to those quality fusibility : and then the word gold signify to he a body bright yellow fusible and very heavy another add malleability each of these use equally the word gold when they have occasion to express the idea which they have apply it to : but it be evident that each can apply it only to he own idea nor can he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he have not 4 word be often secretly refer first to the idea suppose to be in other man 's mind but though word as they be use by man can properly and immediately signify nothing but the idea that be in the mind of the speaker yet they in they thought give they a secret reference to two other thing first they suppose they word to be mark of the idea in the mind also of other man with whom they communicate for else they should talk in vain and could not be understand if the sound they apply to one idea be such as by the hearer be apply to another which be to speak two language but in this man stand not usually to examine whether the idea they and those they discourse with have in they mind be the same : but think it enough that they use the word as they imagine in the common acceptation of that language in which they suppose that the idea they make it a sign of be precisely the same to which the understanding man of that country apply that name 5 secondly to the reality of thing secondly because man would not be think to talk barely of they own imagination but of thing as really they be therefore they often suppose the word to stand also for the reality of thing but this relate more particularly to substance and they name as perhaps the former do to simple idea and mode we shall speak of these two different way of apply word more at large when we come to treat of the name of mixed mode and substance in particular : though give I leave here to say that it be a pervert the use of word and bring unavoidable obscurity and confusion into they signification whenever we make they stand for anything but those idea we have in we own mind 6 word by use readily excite idea of they object concern word also it be further to be consider : first that they be immediately the sign of man 's idea and by that mean the instrument whereby man communicate they conception and express to one another those thought and imagination they have within they own breast there come by constant use to be such a connexion between certain sound and the idea they stand for that the name hear almost as readily excite certain idea as if the object themselves which be apt to produce they do actually affect the sens which be manifestly so in all obvious sensible quality and in all substance that frequently and familiarly occur to we 7 word be often use without signification and why secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of word be idea in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from we cradle we come to learn certain articulate sound very perfectly and have they readily on we tongue and always at hand in we memory but yet be not always careful to examine or settle they signification perfectly it often happen that man even when they would apply themselves to a attentive consideration do set they thought more on word than thing nay because word be many of they learn before the idea be know for which they stand : therefore some not only child but man speak several word no otherwise than parrot do only because they have learn they and have be accustom to those sound but so far as word be of use and signification so far be there a constant connexion between the sound and the idea and a designation that the one stand for the other without which application of they they be nothing but so much insignificant noise 8 they signification perfectly arbitrary not the consequence of a natural connexion word by long and familiar use as have be say come to excite in man certain idea so constantly and readily that they be apt to suppose a natural connexion between they but that they signify only man 's peculiar idea and that by a perfect arbitrary imposition be evident in that they often fail to excite in other -lrb- even that use the same language -rrb- the same idea we take they to be sign of : and every man have so inviolable a liberty to make word stand for what idea he please that no one have the power to make other have the same idea in they mind that he have when they use the same word that he do and therefore the great augustus himself in the possession of that power which rule the world acknowledge he could not make a new latin word : which be as much as to say that he could not arbitrarily appoint what idea any sound should be a sign of in the mouth and common language of he subject it be true common use by a tacit consent appropriate certain sound to certain idea in all language which so far limit the signification of that sound that unless a man apply it to the same idea he do not speak properly : and let I add that unless a man 's word excite the same idea in the hearer which he make they stand for in speak he do not speak intelligibly but whatever be the consequence of any man 's use of word differently either from they general meaning or the particular sense of the person to whom he address they this be certain they signification in he use of they be limit to he idea and they can be sign of nothing else chapter iii of general term 1 the greatest part of word be general term all thing that exist be particulars it may perhaps be think reasonable that word which ought to be conform to thing should be so too -- i mean in they signification : but yet we find quite the contrary the far greatest part of word that make all language be general term : which have not be the effect of neglect or chance but of reason and necessity 2 that every particular thing should have a name for itself be impossible first it be impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar name for the signification and use of word depend on that connexion which the mind make between its idea and the sound it use as sign of they it be necessary in the application of name to thing that the mind should have distinct idea of the thing and retain also the particular name that belong to every one with its peculiar appropriation to that idea but it be beyond the power of human capacity to frame and retain distinct idea of all the particular thing we meet with : every bird and beast man see every tree and plant that affect the sens could not find a place in the most capacious understanding if it be look on as a instance of a prodigious memory that some general have be able to call every soldier in they army by he proper name we may easily find a reason why man have never attempt to give name to each sheep in they flock or crow that fly over they head much less to call every leaf of plant or grain of sand that come in they way by a peculiar name 3 and would be useless if it be possible secondly if it be possible it would yet be useless because it would not serve to the chief end of language man would in vain heap up name of particular thing that would not serve they to communicate they thought man learn name and use they in talk with other only that they may be understand : which be then only do when by use or consent the sound i make by the organ of speech excite in another man 's mind who hear it the idea i apply it to in mine when i speak it this can not be do by name apply to particular thing whereof i alone have the idea in my mind the name of they could not be significant or intelligible to another who be not acquaint with all those very particular thing which have fall under my notice 4 a distinct name for every particular thing not fit for enlargement of knowledge thirdly but yet grant this also feasible -lrb- which i think be not -rrb- yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge : which though found in particular thing enlarge itself by general view to which thing reduce into sort under general name be properly subservient these with the name belong to they come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use require and therefore in these man have for the most part stop : but yet not so as to hinder themselves from distinguish particular thing by appropriate name where convenience demand it and therefore in they own species which they have most to do with and wherein they have often occasion to mention particular person they make use of proper name and there distinct individual have distinct denomination 5 what thing have proper name and why besides person country also city river mountain and other the like distinction of lace have usually find peculiar name and that for the same reason they be such as man have often as occasion to mark particularly and as it be set before other in they discourse with they and i doubt not but if we have reason to mention particular horse as often as as have reason to mention particular man we should have proper name for the one as familiar as for the other and bucephalus would be a word as much in use as alexander and therefore we see that amongst jockey horse have they proper name to be know and distinguish by as commonly as they servant : because amongst they there be often occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he be out of sight 6 how general word be make the next thing to be consider be -- how general word come to be make for since all thing that exist be only particulars how come we by general term or where find we those general nature they be suppose to stand for word become general by be make the sign of general idea : and idea become general by separate from they the circumstance of time and place and any other idea that may determine they to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they be make capable of represent more individual than one each of which have in it a conformity to that abstract idea be -lrb- as we call it -rrb- of that sort 7 show by the way we enlarge we complex idea from infancy but to deduce this a little more distinctly it will not perhaps be amiss to trace we notion and name from they beginning and observe by what degree we proceed and by what step we enlarge we idea from we first infancy there be nothing more evident than that the idea of the person child converse with -lrb- to instance in they alone -rrb- be like the person themselves only particular the idea of the nurse and the mother be well frame in they mind and like picture of they there represent only those individual the name they first give to they be confine to these individual and the name of nurse and mamma the child use determine themselves to those person afterwards when time and a larger acquaintance have make they observe that there be a great many other thing in the world that in some common agreement of shape and several other quality resemble they father and mother and those person they have be use to they frame a idea which they find those many particulars do partake in and to that they give with other the name man for example and thus they come to have a general name and a general idea wherein they make nothing new but only leave out of the complex idea they have of peter and jame mary and jane that which be peculiar to each and retain only what be common to they all 8 and further enlarge we complex idea by still leave out property contain in they by the same way that they come by the general name and idea of man they easily advance to more general name and notion for observe that several thing that differ from they idea of man and can not therefore be comprehend out under that name have yet certain quality wherein they agree with man by retain only those quality and unite they into one idea they have again another and more general idea to which have give a name they make a term of a more comprehensive extension : which new idea be make not by any new addition but only as before by leave out the shape and some other property signify by the name man and retain only a body with life sense and spontaneous motion comprehend under the name animal 9 general nature be nothing but abstract and partial idea of more complex one that this be the way whereby man first form general idea and general name to they i think be so evident that there need no other proof of it but the consider of a man 's self or other and the ordinary proceedings of they mind in knowledge and he that think general nature or notion be anything else but such abstract and partial idea of more complex one take at first from particular existence will i fear be at a loss where to find they for let any one effect and then tell I wherein do he idea of man differ from that of peter and paul or he idea of horse from that of bucephalus but in the leave out something that be peculiar to each individual and retain so much of those particular complex idea of several particular existence as they be find to agree in of the complex idea signify by the name man and horse leave out but those particulars wherein they differ and retain only those wherein they agree and of those make a new distinct complex idea and give the name animal to it one have a more general term that comprehend with man several other creature leave out of the idea of animal sense and spontaneous motion and the remain complex idea make up of the remain simple one of body life and nourishment become a more general one under the more comprehensive term viven and not to dwell longer upon this particular so evident in itself by the same way the mind proceed to body substance and at last to be thing and such universal term which stand for any of we idea whatsoever to conclude : this whole mystery of genus and species which make such a noise in the school and be with justice so little regard out of they be nothing else but abstract idea more or less comprehensive with name annex to they in all which this be constant and unvariable that every more general term stand for such a idea and be but a part of any of those contain under it 10 why the genus be ordinarily make use of in definition this may show we the reason why in the define of word which be nothing but declare they signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehend it which be not out of necessity but only to save the labor of enumerate the several simple idea which the next general word or genus stand for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not be able to do it but though define by genus and differentium -lrb- i crave leave to use these term of art though originally latin since they most properly suit those notion they be apply to -rrb- i say though define by the genus be the shortest way yet i think it may be doubt whether it be the best this i be sure it be not the only and so not absolutely necessary for definition be nothing but make another understand by word what idea the term define stand for a definition be best make by enumerate those simple idea that be combine in the signification of the term define : and if instead of such a enumeration man have accustom themselves to use the next general term it have not be out of necessity or for greater clearness but for quickness and dispatch sake for i think that to one who desire to know what idea the word man stand for if it should be say that man be a solid extended substance have life sense spontaneous motion and the faculty of reasoning i doubt not but the meaning of the term man would be as well understand and the idea it stand for be at least as clearly make know as when it be define to be a rational animal : which by the several definition of animal viven and corpus resolve itself into those enumerate idea i have in explain the term man follow here the ordinary definition of the school which though perhaps not the most exact yet serve well enough to my present purpose and one may in this instance see what give occasion to the rule that a definition must consist of genus and differentium and it suffice to show we the little necessity there be of such a rule or advantage in the strict observe of it for definition as have be say be only the explain of one word by several other so that the meaning or idea it stand for may be certainly know language be not always so make accord to the rule of logic that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly express by two other experience sufficiently satisfy we to the contrary or else those who have make this rule have do ill that they have give we so few definition conformable to it but of definition more in the next chapter 11 general and universal be creature of the understanding and belong not to the real existence of thing to return to general word : it be plain by what have be say that general and universal belong not to the real existence of thing but be the invention and creature of the understanding make by it for its own use and concern only sign whether word or idea word be general as have be say when use for sign of general idea and so be applicable indifferently to many particular thing and idea be general when they be set up as the representative of many particular thing : but universality belong not to thing themselves which be all of they particular in they existence even those word and idea which in they signification be general when therefore we quit particulars the general that rest be only creature of we own make they general nature be nothing but the capacity they be put into by the understanding of signify or represent many particulars for the signification they have be nothing but a relation that by the mind of man be add to they 12 abstract idea be the essence of genus and species the next thing therefore to be consider be what kind of signification it be that general word have for as it be evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general term but proper name so on the other side it be as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and man would then signify the same and the distinction of number -lrb- as the grammarian call they -rrb- would be superfluous and useless that then which general word signify be a sort of thing and each of they do that by be a sign of a abstract idea in the mind to which idea as thing exist be find to agree so they come to be rank under that name or which be all one be of that sort whereby it be evident that the essence of the sort or if the latin word please better species of thing be nothing else but these abstract idea for the have the essence of any species be that which make anything to be of that species and the conformity to the idea to which the name be annex be that which give a right to that name the have the essence and the have that conformity must need be the same thing : since to be of any species and to have a right to the name of that species be all one as for example to be a man or of the species man and to have right to the name man be the same thing again to be a man or of the species man and have the essence of a man be the same thing now since nothing can be a man or have a right to the name man but what have a conformity to the abstract idea the name man stand for nor anything be a man or have a right to the species man but what have the essence of that species it follow that the abstract idea for which the name stand and the essence of the species be one and the same from whence it be easy to observe that the essence of the sort of thing and consequently the sorting of thing be the workmanship of the understanding that abstract and make those general idea 13 they be the workmanship of the understanding but have they foundation in the similitude of thing i would not here be think to forget much less to deny that nature in the production of thing make several of they alike : there be nothing more obvious especially in the race of animal and all thing propagate by seed but yet i think we may say the sorting of they under name be the workmanship of the understanding take occasion from the similitude it observe amongst they to make abstract general idea and set they up in the mind with name annex to they as pattern or form -lrb- for in that sense the word form have a very proper signification -rrb- to which as particular thing exist be find to agree so they come to be of that species have that denomination or be put into that classis for when we say this be a man that a horse this justice that cruelty this a watch that a jack what do we else but rank thing under different specific name as agree to those abstract idea of which we have make those name the sign and what be the essence of those species set out and mark by name but those abstract idea in the mind which be as it be the bond between particular thing that exist and the name they be to be rank under and when general name have any connexion with particular being these abstract idea be the medium that unite they : so that the essence of species as distinguish and denominate by we neither be nor can be anything but those precise abstract idea we have in we mind and therefore the suppose real essence of substance if different from we abstract idea can not be the essence of the species we rank thing into for two species may be one as rationally as two different essence be the essence of one species : and i demand what be the alteration -lrb- which -rrb- may or may not be make in a horse or lead without make either of they to be of another species in determine the species of thing by we abstract idea this be easy to resolve : but if any one will regulate himself herein by suppose real essence he will i suppose be at a loss : and he will never be able to know when anything precisely cease to be of the species of a horse or lead 14 each distinct abstract idea be a distinct essence nor will any one wonder that i say these essence or abstract idea -lrb- which be the measure of name and the boundary of species -rrb- be the workmanship of the understanding who consider that at least the complex one be often in several man different collection of simple idea and therefore that be covetousness to one man which be not so to another nay even in substance where they abstract idea seem to be take from the thing themselves they be not constantly the same no not in that species which be most familiar to we and with which we have the most intimate acquaintance : it have be more than once doubt whether the foetus bear of a woman be a man even so far as that it have be debate whether it be or be not to be nourished and baptize : which could not be if the abstract idea or essence to which the name man belong be of nature 's making and be not the uncertain and various collection of simple idea which the understanding put together and then abstract it affix a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea be a distinct essence and the name that stand for such distinct idea be the name of thing essentially different thus a circle be as essentially different from a oval as a sheep from a goat and rain be as essentially different from snow as water from earth : that abstract idea which be the essence of one be impossible to be communicate to the other and thus any two abstract idea that in any part vary one from another with two distinct name annex to they constitute two distinct sort or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world 15 several signification of the word essence but since the essence of thing be think by some -lrb- and not without reason -rrb- to be wholly unknown it may not be amiss to consider the several signification of the word essence real essence first essence may be take for the very be of anything whereby it be what it be and thus the real internal but generally -lrb- in substance -rrb- unknown constitution of thing whereon they discoverable quality depend may be call they essence this be the proper original signification of the word as be evident from the formation of it essential in its primary notation signify properly be and in this sense it be still use when we speak of the essence of particular thing without give they any name nominal essence secondly the learning and dispute of the school have be much busy about genus and species the word essence have almost lose its primary signification : and instead of the real constitution of thing have be almost wholly apply to the artificial constitution of genus and species it be true there be ordinarily suppose a real constitution of the sort of thing and it be past doubt there must be some real constitution on which any collection of simple idea co-exist must depend but it be evident that thing be rank under name into sort or species only as they agree to certain abstract idea to which we have annex those name the essence of each genus or sort come to be nothing but that abstract idea which the general or sortal -lrb- if i may have leave so to call it from sort as i do general from genus -rrb- name stand for and this we shall find to be that which the word essence import in its most familiar use these two sort of essence i suppose may not unfitly be term the one the real the other nominal essence 16 constant connexion between the name and nominal essence between the nominal essence and the name there be so near a connexion that the name of any sort of thing can not be attribute to any particular be but what have this essence whereby it answer that abstract idea whereof that name be the sign 17 supposition that species be distinguish by they real essence useless concern the real essence of corporeal substance -lrb- to mention these only -rrb- there be if i mistake not two opinion the one be of those who use the word essence for they know not what suppose a certain number of those essence accord to which all natural thing be make and wherein they do exactly every one of they partake and so become of this or that species the other and more rational opinion be of those who look on all natural thing to have a real but unknown constitution of they insensible part from which flow those sensible quality which serve we to distinguish they one from another accord as we have occasion to rank they into sort under common denomination the former of these opinion which suppose these essence as a certain number of form or mould wherein all natural thing that exist be cast and do equally partake have i imagine very much perplex the knowledge of natural thing the frequent production of monster in all the species of animal and of changeling and other strange issue of human birth carry with they difficulty not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it be as impossible that two thing partake exactly of the same real essence should have different property as that two figure partaking of the same real essence of a circle should have different property but be there no other reason against it yet the supposition of essence that can not be know and the making of they nevertheless to be that which distinguish the species of thing be so wholly useless and unserviceable to any part of we knowledge that that alone be sufficient to make we lay it by and content ourselves with such essence of the sort or species of thing as come within the reach of we knowledge : which when seriously consider will be find as i have say to be nothing else but those abstract complex idea to which we have annex distinct general name 18 real and nominal essence essence be thus distinguish into nominal and real we may further observe that in the species of simple idea and mode they be always the same but in substance always quite different thus a figure include a space between three line be the real as well as nominal essence of a triangle it be not only the abstract idea to which the general name be annex but the very essentia or be of the thing itself that foundation from which all its property flow and to which they be all inseparably annex but it be far otherwise concern that parcel of matter which make the ring on my finger wherein these two essence be apparently different for it be the real constitution of its insensible part on which depend all those property of color weight fusibility fixedness & c which be to be find in it which constitution we know not and so have no particular idea of have no name that be the sign of it but yet it be its color weight fusibility fixedness & c which make it to be gold or give it a right to that name which be therefore its nominal essence since nothing can be call gold but what have a conformity of quality to that abstract complex idea to which that name be annex but this distinction of essence belong particularly to substance we shall when we come to consider they name have a occasion to treat of more fully 19 essence ingenerable and incorruptible that such abstract idea with name to they as we have be speak of be essence may further appear by what we be tell concern essence viz that they be all ingenerable and incorruptible which can not be true of the real constitution of thing which begin and perish with they all thing that exist besides they author be all liable to change especially those thing we be acquaint with and have rank into band under distinct name or ensign thus that which be grass to-day be to-morrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few day after become part of a man : in all which and the like change it be evident they real essence -- i e that constitution whereon the property of these several thing depend -- be destroy and perish with they but essence be take for idea establish in the mind with name annex to they they be suppose to remain steadily the same whatever mutation the particular substance be liable to for whatever become of alexander and bucephalus the idea to which man and horse be annex be suppose nevertheless to remain the same and so the essence of those species be preserved whole and undestroyed whatever change happen to any or all of the individual of those species by this mean the essence of a species rest safe and entire without the existence of so much as one individual of that kind for be there now no circle exist anywhere in the world -lrb- as perhaps that figure exist not anywhere exactly mark out -rrb- yet the idea annex to that name would not cease to be what it be nor cease to be as a pattern to determine which of the particular figure we meet with have or have not a right to the name circle and so to show which of they by have that essence be of that species and though there neither be nor have be in nature such a beast as a unicorn or such a fish as a mermaid yet suppose those name to stand for complex abstract idea that contain no inconsistency in they the essence of a mermaid be as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of a unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what have be say it be evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essence prove they to be only abstract idea and be found on the relation establish between they and certain sound as sign of they and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification 20 recapitulation to conclude this be that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genus and species and they essence amount to no more but this : -- that man make abstract idea and settle they in they mind with name annex to they do thereby enable themselves to consider thing and discourse of they as it be in bundle for the easier and readier improvement and communication of they knowledge which would advance but slowly be they word and thought confine only to particulars chapter iv of the name of simple idea 1 name of simple idea mode and substance have each something peculiar though all word as i have show signify nothing immediately but the idea in the mind of the speaker yet upon a nearer survey we shall find the name of simple idea mixed mode -lrb- under which i comprise relation too -rrb- and natural substance have each of they something peculiar and different from the other for example : -- 2 first name of simple idea and of substance intimate real existence first the name of simple idea and substance with the abstract idea in the mind which they immediately signify intimate also some real existence from which be derive they original pattern but the name of mixed mode terminate in the idea that be in the mind and lead not the thought any further as we shall see more at large in the follow chapter 3 secondly name of simple idea and mode signify always both real and nominal essence secondly the name of simple idea and mode signify always the real as well as nominal essence of they species but the name of natural substance signify rarely if ever anything but barely the nominal essence of those species as we shall show in the chapter that treat of the name of substance in particular 4 thirdly name of simple idea be undefinable thirdly the name of simple idea be not capable of any definition the name of all complex idea be it have not that i know be yet observe by anybody what word be and what be not capable of be define the want whereof be -lrb- as i be apt to think -rrb- not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in man 's discourse whilst some demand definition of term that can not be define and other think they ought not to rest satisfied in a explication make by a more general word and its restriction -lrb- or to speak in term of art by a genus and difference -rrb- when even after such definition make accord to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the meaning of the word than they have before this at least i think that the show what word be and what be not capable of definition and wherein consist a good definition be not wholly besides we present purpose and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature of these sign and we idea as to deserve a more particular consideration 5 if all name be definable it would be a process in infinitum i will not here trouble myself to prove that all term be not definable from that progress in infinitum which it will visibly lead we into if we should allow that all name could be define for if the term of one definition be still to be define by another where at last should we stop but i shall from the nature of we idea and the signification of we word show why some name can and other can not be define and which they be 6 what a definition be i think it be agree that a definition be nothing else but the show the meaning of one word by several other not synonymous term the meaning of word be only the idea they be make to stand for by he that use they the meaning of any term be then show or the word be define when by other word the idea it be make the sign of and annex to in the mind of the speaker be as it be represent or set before the view of another and thus its signification ascertain this be the only use and end of definition and therefore the only measure of what be or be not a good definition 7 simple idea why undefinable this be premise i say that the name of simple idea and those only be incapable of be define the reason whereof be this that the several term of a definition signify several idea they can all together by no means represent a idea which have no composition at all : and therefore a definition which be properly nothing but the show the meaning of one word by several other not signify each the same thing can in the name of simple idea have no place 8 instance : scholastic definition of motion the not observe this difference in we idea and they name have produce that eminent trifling in the school which be so easy to be observe in the definition they give we of some few of these simple idea for as to the greatest part of they even those master of definition be fain to leave they untouched merely by the impossibility they find in it what more exquisite jargon could the wit of man invent than this definition : -- ` the act of a be in power as far forth as in power ' which would puzzle any rational man to whom it be not already know by its famous absurdity to guess what word it could ever be suppose to be the explication of if tully ask a dutchman what beweeginge be should have receive this explication in he own language that it be ` actus enti in potentium quatenus in potentium ' i ask whether any one can imagine he could thereby have understand what the word beweeginge signify or have guess what idea a dutchman ordinarily have in he mind and would signify to another when he use that sound 9 modern definition of motion nor have the modern philosopher who have endeavor to throw off the jargon of the school and speak intelligibly much better succeed in define simple idea whether by explain they cause or any otherwise the atomist who define motion to be ' a passage from one place to another ' what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what be passage other than motion and if they be ask what passage be how would they better define it than by motion for be it not at least as proper and significant to say passage be a motion from one place to another as to say motion be a passage & c this be to translate and not to define when we change two word of the same signification one for another which when one be better understand than the other may serve to discover what idea the unknown stand for but be very far from a definition unless we will say every english word in the dictionary be the definition of the latin word it answer and that motion be a definition of motus nor will ` the successive application of the part of the superficies of one body to those of another ' which the cartesian give we prove a much better definition of motion when well examine 10 definition of light ` the act of perspicuous as far forth as perspicuous ' be another peripatetic definition of a simple idea which though not more absurd than the former of motion yet betray its uselessness and insignificancy more plainly because experience will easily convince any one that it can not make the meaning of the word light -lrb- which it pretend to define -rrb- at all understand by a blind man but the definition of motion appear not at first sight so useless because it escape this way of trial for this simple idea enter by the touch as well as sight it be impossible to show a example of any one who have no other way to get the idea of motion but barely by the definition of that name those who tell we that light be a great number of little globule striking briskly on the bottom of the eye speak more intelligibly than the school : but yet these word never so well understand would make the idea the word light stand for no more known to a man that understand it not before than if one should tell he that light be nothing but a company of little tennis-ball which fairy all day long strike with racket against some man 's forehead whilst they pass by other for grant this explication of the thing to be true yet the idea of the cause of light if we have it never so exact would no more give we the idea of light itself as it be such a particular perception in we than the idea of the figure and motion of a sharp piece of steel would give we the idea of that pain which it be able to cause in we for the cause of any sensation and the sensation itself in all the simple idea of one sense be two idea and two idea so different and distant one from another that no two can be more so and therefore should des cartes 's globule strike never so long on the retina of a man who be blind by a gutta serena he would thereby never have any idea of light or anything approach it though he understand never so well what little globule be and what striking on another body be and therefore the cartesian very well distinguish between that light which be the cause of that sensation in we and the idea which be produce in we by it and be that which be properly light 11 simple idea why undefinable further explain simple idea as have be show be only to be get by those impression object themselves make on we mind by the proper inlet appoint to each sort if they be not receive this way all the word in the world make use of to explain or define any of they name will never be able to produce in we the idea it stand for for word be sound can produce in we no other simple idea than of those very sound nor excite any in we but by that voluntary connexion which be know to be between they and those simple idea which common use have make they the sign of he that think otherwise let he try if any word can give he the taste of a pine apple and make he have the true idea of the relish of that celebrated delicious fruit so far as he be tell it have a resemblance with any taste whereof he have the idea already in he memory imprint there by sensible object not stranger to he palate so far may he approach that resemblance in he mind but this be not give we that idea by a definition but exciting in we other simple idea by they known name which will be still very different from the true taste of that fruit itself in light and color and all other simple idea it be the same thing : for the signification of sound be not natural but only impose and arbitrary and no definition of light or redness be more fitted or able to produce either of those idea in we than the sound light or red by itself for to hope to produce a idea of light or color by a sound however form be to expect that sound should be visible or color audible and to make the ear do the office of all the other sens which be all one as to say that we might taste smell and see by the ear : a sort of philosophy worthy only of sancho panza who have the faculty to see dulcinea by hearsay and therefore he that have not before receive into he mind by the proper inlet the simple idea which any word stand for can never come to know the signification of that word by any other word or sound whatsoever put together accord to any rule of definition the only way be by apply to he sens the proper object and so produce that idea in he for which he have learn the name already a studious blind man who have mightily beat he head about visible object and make use of the explication of he book and friend to understand those name of light and color which often come in he way brag one day that he now understand what scarlet signify upon which he friend demand what scarlet be the blind man answer it be like the sound of a trumpet just such a understanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have who hope to get it only from a definition or other word make use of to explain it 12 the contrary show in complex idea by instance of a statue and rainbow the case be quite otherwise in complex idea which consist of several simple one it be in the power of word stand for the several idea that make that composition to imprint complex idea in the mind which be never there before and so make they name be understand in such collection of idea pass under one name definition or the teach the signification of one word by several other have place and may make we understand the name of thing which never come within the reach of we sens and frame idea suitable to those in other man 's mind when they use those name : provide that none of the term of the definition stand for any such simple idea which he to whom the explication be make have never yet have in he thought thus the word statue may be explain to a blind man by other word when picture can not he sens have give he the idea of figure but not of color which therefore word can not excite in he this gain the prize to the painter against the statuary : each of which contend for the excellency of he art and the statuary bragging that he be to be prefer because it reach further and even those who have lose they eye could yet perceive the excellency of it the painter agree to refer himself to the judgment of a blind man who be bring where there be a statue make by the one and a picture draw by the other he be first lead to the statue in which he trace with he hand all the lineament of the face and body and with great admiration applaud the skill of the workman but be lead to the picture and have he hand lay upon it be tell that now he touch the head and then the forehead eye nose & c as he hand move over the part of the picture on the cloth without find any the least distinction : whereupon he cry out that certainly that must need be a very admirable and divine piece of workmanship which could represent to they all those part where he could neither feel nor perceive anything 13 color indefinable to the born-blind he that should use the word rainbow to one who know all those color but yet have never see that phenomenon would by enumerate the figure largeness position and order of the color so well define that word that it might be perfectly understand but yet that definition how exact and perfect soever would never make a blind man understand it because several of the simple idea that make that complex one be such as he never receive by sensation and experience no word be able to excite they in he mind 14 complex idea definable only when the simple idea of which they consist have be get from experience simple idea as have be show can only be get by experience from those object which be proper to produce in we those perception when by this mean we have we mind store with they and know the name for they then we be in a condition to define and by definition to understand the name of complex idea that be make up of they but when any term stand for a simple idea that a man have never yet have in he mind it be impossible by any word to make know its meaning to he when any term stand for a idea a man be acquaint with but be ignorant that that term be the sign of it then another name of the same idea which he have be accustom to may make he understand its meaning but in no case whatsoever be any name of any simple idea capable of a definition 15 fourthly name of simple idea of less doubtful meaning than those of mixed mode and substance fourthly but though the name of simple idea have not the help of definition to determine they signification yet that hinder not but that they be generally less doubtful and uncertain than those of mixed mode and substance because they stand only for one simple perception man for the most part easily and perfectly agree in they signification and there be little room for mistake and wrangle about they meaning he that know once that whiteness be the name of that color he have observe in snow or milk will not be apt to misapply that word as long as he retain that idea which when he have quite lose he be not apt to mistake the meaning of it but perceive he understand it not there be neither a multiplicity of simple idea to be put together which make the doubtfulness in the name of mixed mode nor a suppose but a unknown real essence with property depend thereon the precise number whereof be also unknown which make the difficulty in the name of substance but on the contrary in simple idea the whole signification of the name be know at once and consist not of part whereof more or less be put in the idea may be vary and so the signification of name be obscure or uncertain 16 simple idea have few ascent in linea praedicamentalus fifthly this further may be observe concern simple simple idea and they name that they have but few ascent in linea praedicamentalus -lrb- as they call it -rrb- from the lowest species to the summum genus the reason whereof be that the lowest species be but one simple idea nothing can be leave out of it that so the difference be take away it may agree with some other thing in one idea common to they both which have one name be the genus of the other two : vg there be nothing that can be leave out of the idea of white and red to make they agree in one common appearance and so have one general name as rationality be leave out of the complex idea of man make it agree with brute in the more general idea and name of animal and therefore when to avoid unpleasant enumeration man would comprehend both white and red and several other such simple idea under one general name they have be fain to do it by a word which denote only the way they get into the mind for when white red and yellow be all comprehend under the genus or name color it signify no more but such idea as be produce in the mind only by the sight and have entrance only through the eye and when they would frame yet a more general term to comprehend both color and sound and the like simple idea they do it by a word that signify all such as come into the mind only by one sense and so the general term quality in its ordinary acceptation comprehend color sound taste smell and tangible quality with distinction from extension number motion pleasure and pain which make impression on the mind and introduce they idea by more sens than one 17 sixthly name of simple idea not arbitrary but perfectly take from the existence of thing sixthly the name of simple idea substance and mixed mode have also this difference : that those of mixed mode stand for idea perfectly arbitrary those of substance be not perfectly so but refer to a pattern though with some latitude and those of simple idea be perfectly take from the existence of thing and be not arbitrary at all which what difference it make in the signification of they name we shall see in the follow chapter simple mode the name of simple mode differ little from those of simple idea chapter v of the name of mixed mode and relation 1 mixed mode stand for abstract idea as other general name the name of mixed mode be general they stand as have be shew for sort or species of thing each of which have its peculiar essence the essence of these species also as have be shew be nothing but the abstract idea in the mind to which the name be annex thus far the name and essence of mixed mode have nothing but what be common to they with other idea : but if we take a little nearer survey of they we shall find that they have something peculiar which perhaps may deserve we attention 2 first the abstract idea they stand for be make by the understand the first particularity i shall observe in they be that the abstract idea or if you please the essence of the several species of mixed mode be make by the understanding wherein they differ from those of simple idea : in which sort the mind have no power to make any one but only receive such as be present to it by the real existence of thing operate upon it 3 secondly make arbitrarily and without pattern in the next place these essence of the species of mixed mode be not only make by the mind but make very arbitrarily make without pattern or reference to any real existence wherein they differ from those of substance which carry with they the supposition of some real be from which they be take and to which they be conformable but in its complex idea of mixed mode the mind take a liberty not to follow the existence of thing exactly it unite and retain certain collection as so many distinct specific idea whilst other that as often occur in nature and be as plainly suggest by outward thing pass neglect without particular name or specification nor do the mind in these of mixed mode as in the complex idea of substance examine they by the real existence of thing or verify they by pattern contain such peculiar composition in nature to know whether he idea of adultery or incest be right will a man seek it anywhere amongst thing exist or be it true because any one have be witness to such a action no : but it suffice here that man have put together such a collection into one complex idea that make the archetype and specific idea whether ever any such action be commit in rerum natura or no 4 how this be do to understand this right we must consider wherein this making of these complex idea consist and that be not in the make any new idea but put together those which the mind have before wherein the mind do these three thing : first it choose a certain number secondly it give they connexion and make they into one idea thirdly it tie they together by a name if we examine how the mind proceed in these and what liberty it take in they we shall easily observe how these essence of the species of mixed mode be the workmanship of the mind and consequently that the species themselves be of man 's make 5 evidently arbitrary in that the idea be often before the existence nobody can doubt but that these idea of mixed mode be make by a voluntary collection of idea put together in the mind independent from any original pattern in nature who will but reflect that this sort of complex idea may be make abstracted and have name give they and so a species be constitute before any one individual of that species ever exist who can doubt but the idea of sacrilege or adultery might be frame in the mind of man and have name give they and so these species of mixed mode be constitute before either of they be ever commit and might be as well discourse of and reason about and as certain truth discover of they whilst yet they have no be but in the understanding as well as now that they have but too frequently a real existence whereby it be plain how much the sort of mixed mode be the creature of the understanding where they have a be as subservient to all the end of real truth and knowledge as when they really exist and we can not doubt but law-maker have often make law about species of action which be only the creature of they own understanding being that have no other existence but in they own mind and i think nobody can deny but that the resurrection be a species of mixed mode in the mind before it really exist 6 instance : murder incest stab to see how arbitrarily these essence of mixed mode be make by the mind we need but take a view of almost any of they a little look into they will satisfy we that it be the mind that combine several scatter independent idea into one complex one and by the common name it give they make they the essence of a certain species without regulate itself by any connexion they have in nature for what greater connexion in nature have the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with kill that this be make a particular species of action signify by the word murder and the other not or what union be there in nature between the idea of the relation of a father with killing than that of a son or neighbor that those be combine into one complex idea and thereby make the essence of the distinct species parricide whilst the other make no distinct species at all but though they have make kill a man 's father or mother a distinct species from kill he son or daughter yet in some other case son and daughter be take in too as well as father and mother : and they be all equally comprehend in the same species as in that of incest thus the mind in mixed mode arbitrarily unite into complex idea such as it find convenient whilst other that have altogether as much union in nature be leave loose and never combine into one idea because they have no need of one name it be evident then that the mind by its free choice give a connexion to a certain number of idea which in nature have no more union with one another than other that it leave out : why else be the part of the weapon the beginning of the wound be make with take notice of to make the distinct species call stab and the figure and matter of the weapon leave out i do not say this be do without reason as we shall see more by and by but this i say that it be do by the free choice of the mind pursue its own end and that therefore these species of mixed mode be the workmanship of the understanding and there be nothing more evident than that for the most part in the frame these idea the mind search not its pattern in nature nor refer the idea it make to the real existence of thing but put such together as may best serve its own purpose without tie itself to a precise imitation of anything that really exist 7 but still subservient to the end of language and not make at random but though these complex idea or essence of mixed mode depend on the mind and be make by it with great liberty yet they be not make at random and jumble together without any reason at all though these complex idea be not always copy from nature yet they be always suit to the end for which abstract idea be make : and though they be combination make of idea that be loose enough and have as little union in themselves as several other to which the mind never give a connexion that combine they into one idea yet they be always make for the convenience of communication which be the chief end of language the use of language be by short sound to signify with ease and dispatch general conception wherein not only abundance of particulars may be contain but also a great variety of independent idea collect into one complex one in the make therefore of the species of mixed mode man have have regard only to such combination as they have occasion to mention one to another those they have combine into distinct complex idea and give name to whilst other that in nature have as near a union be leave loose and unregarded for to go no further than human action themselves if they would make distinct abstract idea of all the variety which might be observe in they the number must be infinite and the memory confound with the plenty as well as overcharge to little purpose it suffice that man make and name so many complex idea of these mixed mode as they find they have occasion to have name for in the ordinary occurrence of they affair if they join to the idea of kill the idea of father or mother and so make a distinct species from kill a man 's son or neighbor it be because of the different heinousness of the crime and the distinct punishment be due to the murder a man 's father and mother different to what ought to be inflict on the murder of a son or neighbor and therefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name which be the end of make that distinct combination but though the idea of mother and daughter be so differently treat in reference to the idea of kill that the one be join with it to make a distinct abstract idea with a name and so a distinct species and the other not yet in respect of carnal knowledge they be both take in under incest : and that still for the same convenience of express under one name and reckoning of one species such unclean mixture as have a peculiar turpitude beyond other and this to avoid circumlocution and tedious description 8 whereof the intranslatable word of diver language be a proof a moderate skill in different language will easily satisfy one of the truth of this it be so obvious to observe great store of word in one language which have not any that answer they in another which plainly show that those of one country by they custom and manner of life have find occasion to make several complex idea and give name to they which other never collect into specific idea this could not have happen if these species be the steady workmanship of nature and not collection make and abstract by the mind in order to name and for the convenience of communication the term of we law which be not empty sound will hardly find word that answer they in the spanish or italian no scanty language much less i think could any one translate they into the caribbee or westoe tongue : and the versura of the roman or corban of the jew have no word in other language to answer they the reason whereof be plain from what have be say nay if we look a little more nearly into this matter and exactly compare different language we shall find that though they have word which in translation and dictionary be suppose to answer one another yet there be scarce one often amongst the name of complex idea especially of mixed mode that stand for the same precise idea which the word do that in dictionary it be render by there be no idea more common and less compounded than the measure of time extension and weight and the latin name hora pe libra be without difficulty render by the english name hour foot and pound : but yet there be nothing more evident than that the idea a roman annex to these latin name be very far different from those which a englishman express by those english one and if either of these should make use of the measure that those of the other language design by they name he would be quite out in he account these be too sensible proof to be doubt and we shall find this much more so in the name of more abstract and compounded idea such as be the greatest part of those which make up moral discourse : whose name when man come curiously to compare with those they be translate into in other language they will find very few of they exactly to correspond in the whole extent of they signification 9 this show species to be make for communication the reason why i take so particular notice of this be that we may not be mistake about genus and species and they essence as if they be thing regularly and constantly make by nature and have a real existence in thing when they appear upon a more wary survey to be nothing else but a artifice of the understanding for the easier signify such collection of idea as it should often have occasion to communicate by one general term under which diver particulars as far forth as they agree to that abstract idea might be comprehend and if the doubtful signification of the word species may make it sound harsh to some that i say the species of mixed mode be ` make by the understanding ' yet i think it can by nobody be deny that it be the mind make those abstract complex idea to which specific name be give and if it be true as it be that the mind make the pattern for sort and name of thing i leave it to be consider who make the boundary of the sort or species since with I species and sort have no other difference than that of a latin and english idiom 10 in mixed mode it be the name that tie the combination of simple idea together and make it a species the near relation that there be between species essence and they general name at least in mixed mode will further appear when we consider that it be the name that seem to preserve those essence and give they they lasting duration for the connexion between the loose part of those complex idea be make by the mind this union which have no particular foundation in nature would cease again be there not something that do as it be hold it together and keep the part from scatter though therefore it be the mind that make the collection it be the name which be as it be the knot that tie they fast together what a vast variety of different idea do the word triumphus hold together and deliver to we as one species have this name be never make or quite lose we might no doubt have have description of what pass in that solemnity : but yet i think that which hold those different part together in the unity of one complex idea be that very word annex to it without which the several part of that would no more be think to make one thing than any other show which have never be make but once have never be unite into one complex idea under one denomination how much therefore in mixed mode the unity necessary to any essence depend on the mind and how much the continuation and fix of that unity depend on the name in common use annex to it i leave to be consider by those who look upon essence and species as real established thing in nature 11 suitable to this we find that man speak of mixed mode seldom imagine or take any other for species of they but such as be set out by name : because they be of man 's make only in order to name no such species be take notice of or suppose to be unless a name be join to it as the sign of man 's have combine into one idea several loose one and by that name give a lasting union to the part which would otherwise cease to have any as soon as the mind lay by that abstract idea and cease actually to think on it but when a name be once annex to it wherein the part of that complex idea have a settle and permanent union then be the essence as it be establish and the species look on as complete for to what purpose should the memory charge itself with such composition unless it be by abstraction to make they general and to what purpose make they general unless it be that they might have general name for the convenience of discourse and communication thus we see that kill a man with a sword or a hatchet be look on as no distinct species of action but if the point of the sword first enter the body it pass for a distinct species where it have a distinct name as in england in whose language it be call stab : but in another country where it have not happen to be specify under a peculiar name it pass not for a distinct species but in the species of corporeal substance though it be the mind that make the nominal essence yet since those idea which be combine in it be suppose to have a union in nature whether the mind join they or not therefore those be look on as distinct species without any operation of the mind either abstract or give a name to that complex idea 12 for the original of we mixed mode we look no further than the mind which also show they to be the workmanship of the understanding conformable also to what have be say concern the essence of the species of mixed mode that they be the creature of the understanding rather than the work of nature conformable i say to this we find that they name lead we thought to the mind and no further when we speak of justice or gratitude we frame to ourselves no imagination of anything exist which we would conceive but we thought terminate in the abstract idea of those virtue and look not further as they do when we speak of a horse or iron whose specific idea we consider not as barely in the mind but as in thing themselves which afford the original pattern of those idea but in mixed mode at least the most considerable part of they which be moral being we consider the original pattern as be in the mind and to those we refer for the distinguish of particular being under name and hence i think it be that these essence of the species of mixed mode be by a more particular name call notion as by a peculiar right appertaining to the understanding 13 they be make by the understanding without pattern show the reason why they be so compounded hence likewise we may learn why the complex idea of mixed mode be commonly more compounded and decompounded than those of natural substance because they be the workmanship of the understanding pursue only its own end and the conveniency of express in short those idea it would make know to another it do with great liberty unite often into one abstract idea thing that in they nature have no coherence and so under one term bundle together a great variety of compound and decompound idea thus the name of procession : what a great mixture of independent idea of person habit taper order motion sound do it contain in that complex one which the mind of man have arbitrarily put together to express by that one name whereas the complex idea of the sort of substance be usually make up of only a small number of simple one and in the species of animal these two viz shape and voice commonly make the whole nominal essence 14 name of mixed mode stand alway for they real essence which be the workmanship of we mind another thing we may observe from what have be say be that the name of mixed mode always signify -lrb- when they have any determine signification -rrb- the real essence of they species for these abstract idea be the workmanship of the mind and not refer to the real existence of thing there be no supposition of anything more signify by that name but barely that complex idea the mind itself have form which be all it would have express by it and be that on which all the property of the species depend and from which alone they all flow : and so in these the real and nominal essence be the same which of what concernment it be to the certain knowledge of general truth we shall see hereafter 15 why they name be usually get before they idea this also may show we the reason why for the most part the name of mixed mode be get before the idea they stand for be perfectly know because there be no species of these ordinarily take notice of but what have name and those species or rather they essence be abstract complex idea make arbitrarily by the mind it be convenient if not necessary to know the name before one endeavor to frame these complex idea : unless a man will fill he head with a company of abstract complex idea which other have no name for he have nothing to do with but to lay by and forget again i confess that in the beginning of language it be necessary to have the idea before one give it the name : and so it be still where make a new complex idea one also by give it a new name make a new word but this concern not language make which have generally pretty well provide for idea which man have frequent occasion to have and communicate and in such i ask whether it be not the ordinary method that child learn the name of mixed mode before they have they idea what one of a thousand ever frame the abstract idea of glory and ambition before he have hear the name of they in simple idea and substance i grant it be otherwise which be such idea as have a real existence and union in nature the idea and name be get one before the other as it happen 16 reason of my be so large on this subject what have be say here of mixed mode be with very little difference applicable also to relation which since every man himself may observe i may spare myself the pain to enlarge on : especially since what i have here say concern word in this third book will possibly be think by some to this be much more than what so slight a subject require i allow it might be bring into a narrower compass but i be willing to stay my reader on a argument that appear to I new and a little out of the way -lrb- i be sure it be one i think not of when i begin to write -rrb- that by search it to the bottom and turn it on every side some part or other might meet with every one 's thought and give occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general miscarriage which though of great consequence be little take notice of when it be consider what a pudder be make about essence and how much all sort of knowledge discourse and conversation be pester and disorder by the careless and confused use and application of word it will perhaps be think worth while thoroughly to lay it open and i shall be pardon if i have dwell long on a argument which i think therefore need to be inculcate because the fault man be usually guilty of in this kind be not only the greatest hindrance of true knowledge but be so well think of as to pass for it man would often see what a small pittance of reason and truth or possibly none at all be mix with those huff opinion they be swell with if they would but look beyond fashionable sound and observe what idea be or be not comprehend under those word with which they be so arm at all point and with which they so confidently lay about they i shall imagine i have do some service to truth peace and learn if by any enlargement on this subject i can make man reflect on they own use of language and give they reason to suspect that since it be frequent for other it may also be possible for they to have sometimes very good and approve word in they mouth and writings with very uncertain little or no signification and therefore it be not unreasonable for they to be wary herein themselves and not to be unwilling to have they examine by other with this design therefore i shall go on with what i have further to say concern this matter chapter vi of the name of substance 1 the common name of substance stand for sort the common name of substance as well as other general term stand for sort : which be nothing else but the be make sign of such complex idea wherein several particular substance do or might agree by virtue of which they be capable of be comprehend in one common conception and signify by one name i say do or might agree : for though there be but one sun exist in the world yet the idea of it be abstract so that more substance -lrb- if there be several -rrb- might each agree in it it be as much a sort as if there be as many sun as there be star they want not they reason who think there be and that each fix star would answer the idea the name sun stand for to one who be place in a due distance : which by the way may show we how much the sort or if you please genus and species of thing -lrb- for those latin term signify to I no more than the english word sort -rrb- depend on such collection of idea as man have make and not on the real nature of thing since it be not impossible but that in propriety of speech that might be a sun to one which be a star to another 2 the essence of each sort of substance be we abstract idea to which the name be annex the measure and boundary of each sort or species whereby it be constitute that particular sort and distinguish from other be that we call its essence which be nothing but that abstract idea to which the name be annex so that everything contain in that idea be essential to that sort this though it be all the essence of natural substance that we know or by which we distinguish they into sort yet i call it by a peculiar name the nominal essence to distinguish it from the real constitution of substance upon which depend this nominal essence and all the property of that sort which therefore as have be say may be call the real essence : vg the nominal essence of gold be that complex idea the word gold stand for let it be for instance a body yellow of a certain weight malleable fusible and fixed but the real essence be the constitution of the insensible part of that body on which those quality and all the other property of gold depend how far these two be different though they be both call essence be obvious at first sight to discover 3 the nominal and real essence different for though perhaps voluntary motion with sense and reason join to a body of a certain shape be the complex idea to which i and other annex the name man and so be the nominal essence of the species so call : yet nobody will say that complex idea be the real essence and source of all those operation which be to be find in any individual of that sort the foundation of all those quality which be the ingredient of we complex idea be something quite different : and have we such a knowledge of that constitution of man from which he faculty of move sensation and reasoning and other power flow and on which he so regular shape depend as it be possible angel have and it be certain he maker have we should have a quite other idea of he essence than what now be contain in we definition of that species be it what it will : and we idea of any individual man would be as far different from what it be now as be he who know all the spring and wheel and other contrivance within of the famous clock at strasburg from that which a gaze countryman have of it who barely see the motion of the hand and hear the clock strike and observe only some of the outward appearance 4 nothing essential to individual that essence in the ordinary use of the word relate to sort and that it be consider in particular being no further than as they be rank into sort appear from hence : that take but away the abstract idea by which we sort individual and rank they under common name and then the thought of anything essential to any of they instantly vanish : we have no notion of the one without the other which plainly show they relation it be necessary for I to be as i be god and nature have make I so : but there be nothing i have be essential to I a accident or disease may very much alter my color or shape a fever or fall may take away my reason or memory or both and a apoplexy leave neither sense nor understand no nor life other creature of my shape may be make with more and better or fewer and worse faculty than i have and other may have reason and sense in a shape and body very different from mine none of these be essential to the one or the other or to any individual whatever till the mind refer it to some sort or species of thing and then presently accord to the abstract idea of that sort something be find essential let any one examine he own thought and he will find that as soon as he suppose or speak of essential the consideration of some species or the complex idea signify by some general name come into he mind and it be in reference to that that this or that quality be say to be essential so that if it be ask whether it be essential to I or any other particular corporeal be to have reason i say no no more than it be essential to this white thing i write on to have word in it but if that particular be be to be count of the sort man and to have the name man give it then reason be essential to it suppose reason to be a part of the complex idea the name man stand for : as it be essential to this thing i write on to contain word if i will give it the name treatise and rank it under that species so that essential and not essential relate only to we abstract idea and the name annex to they which amount to no more than this that whatever particular thing have not in it those quality which be contain in the abstract idea which any general term stand for can not be rank under that species nor be call by that name since that abstract idea be the very essence of that species 5 the only essence perceive by we in individual substance be those quality which entitle they to receive they name thus if the idea of body with some people be bare extension or space then solidity be not essential to body : if other make the idea to which they give the name body to be solidity and extension then solidity be essential to body that therefore and that alone be consider as essential which make a part of the complex idea the name of a sort stand for without which no particular thing can be reckon of that sort nor be entitle to that name should there be find a parcel of matter that have all the other quality that be in iron but want obedience to the loadstone and would neither be draw by it nor receive direction from it would any one question whether it want anything essential it would be absurd to ask whether a thing really exist want anything essential to it or could it be demand whether this make a essential or specific difference or no since we have no other measure of essential or specific but we abstract idea and to talk of specific difference in nature without reference to general idea in name be to talk unintelligibly for i would ask any one what be sufficient to make a essential difference in nature between any two particular being without any regard have to some abstract idea which be look upon as the essence and standard of a species all such pattern and standard be quite lay aside particular being consider barely in themselves will be find to have all they quality equally essential and everything in each individual will be essential to it or which be more nothing at all for though it may be reasonable to ask whether obey the magnet be essential to iron yet i think it be very improper and insignificant to ask whether it be essential to the particular parcel of matter i cut my pen with without consider it under the name iron or as be of a certain species and if as have be say we abstract idea which have name annex to they be the boundary of species nothing can be essential but what be contain in those idea 6 even the real essence of individual substance imply potential sort it be true i have often mention a real essence distinct in substance from those abstract idea of they which i call they nominal essence by this real essence i mean that real constitution of anything which be the foundation of all those property that be combine in and be constantly find to co-exist with the nominal essence that particular constitution which everything have within itself without any relation to anything without it but essence even in this sense relate to a sort and suppose a species for be that real constitution on which the property depend it necessarily suppose a sort of thing property belong only to species and not to individual : v g suppose the nominal essence of gold to be a body of such a peculiar color and weight with malleability and fusibility the real essence be that constitution of the part of matter on which these quality and they union depend and be also the foundation of its solubility in aqua regium and other property accompany that complex idea here be essence and property but all upon supposition of a sort or general abstract idea which be consider as immutable but there be no individual parcel of matter to which any of these quality be so annex as to be essential to it or inseparable from it that which be essential belong to it as a condition whereby it be of this or that sort : but take away the consideration of its be rank under the name of some abstract idea and then there be nothing necessary to it nothing inseparable from it indeed as to the real essence of substance we only suppose they be without precisely know what they be but that which annex they still to the species be the nominal essence of which they be the suppose foundation and cause 7 the nominal essence bound the species to we the next thing to be consider be by which of those essence it be that substance be determine into sort or species and that it be evident be by the nominal essence for it be that alone that the name which be the mark of the sort signify it be impossible therefore that anything should determine the sort of thing which we rank under general name but that idea which that name be design as a mark for which be that as have be show which we call nominal essence why do we say this be a horse and that a mule this be a animal that a herb how come any particular thing to be of this or that sort but because it have that nominal essence or which be all one agree to that abstract idea that name be annex to and i desire any one but to reflect on he own thought when he hear or speak any of those or other name of substance to know what sort of essence they stand for 8 the nature of species as form by we and that the species of thing to we be nothing but the rank they under distinct name accord to the complex idea in we and not accord to precise distinct real essence in they be plain from hence : -- that we find many of the individual that be rank into one sort call by one common name and so receive as be of one species have yet quality depend on they real constitution as far different one from another as from other from which they be account to differ specifically this as it be easy to be observe by all who have to do with natural body so chemist especially be often by sad experience convince of it when they sometimes in vain seek for the same quality in one parcel of sulphur antimony or vitriol which they have find in other for though they be body of the same species have the same nominal essence under the same name yet do they often upon severe way of examination betray quality so different one from another as to frustrate the expectation and labor of very wary chemist but if thing be distinguish into species accord to they real essence it would be as impossible to find different property in any two individual substance of the same species as it be to find different property in two circle or two equilateral triangle that be properly the essence to we which determine every particular to this or that classis or which be the same thing to this or that general name : and what can that be else but that abstract idea to which that name be annex and so have in truth a reference not so much to the being of particular thing as to they general denomination 9 not the real essence or texture of part which we know not nor indeed can we rank and sort thing and consequently -lrb- which be the end of sorting -rrb- denominate they by they real essence because we know they not we faculty carry we no further towards the knowledge and distinction of substance than a collection of those sensible idea which we observe in they which however make with the greatest diligence and exactness we be capable of yet be more remote from the true internal constitution from which those quality flow than as i say a countryman 's idea be from the inward contrivance of that famous clock at strasburg whereof he only see the outward figure and motion there be not so contemptible a plant or animal that do not confound the most enlarged understanding though the familiar use of thing about we take off we wonder yet it cure not we ignorance when we come to examine the stone we tread on or the iron we daily handle we presently find we know not they make and can give no reason of the different quality we find in they it be evident the internal constitution whereon they property depend be unknown to we : for to go no further than the grossest and most obvious we can imagine amongst they what be that texture of part that real essence that make lead and antimony fusible wood and stone not what make lead and iron malleable antimony and stone not and yet how infinitely these come short of the fine contrivance and inconceivable real essence of plant or animal every one know the workmanship of the all-wise and powerful god in the great fabric of the universe and every part thereof further exceed the capacity and comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent man than the best contrivance of the most ingenious man doth the conception of the most ignorant of rational creature therefore we in vain pretend to range thing into sort and dispose they into certain class under name by they real essence that be so far from we discovery or comprehension a blind man may as soon sort thing by they color and he that have lose he smell as well distinguish a lily and a rose by they odour as by those internal constitution which he know not he that think he can distinguish sheep and goat by they real essence that be unknown to he may be please to try he skill in those species call cassiowary and querechinchio and by they internal real essence determine the boundary of those species without know the complex idea of sensible quality that each of those name stand for in the country where those animal be to be find 10 not the substantial form which know not those therefore who have be teach that the several species of substance have they distinct internal substantial form and that it be those form which make the distinction of substance into they true species and genus be lead yet further out of the way by have they mind set upon fruitless inquiry after ` substantial form ' wholly unintelligible and whereof we have scarce so much as any obscure or confused conception in general 11 that the nominal essence be that only whereby we distinguish species of substance further evident from we idea of finite spirit and of god that we ranking and distinguish natural substance into species consist in the nominal essence the mind make and not in the real essence to be find in the thing themselves be further evident from we idea of spirit for the mind get only by reflect on its own operation those simple idea which it attribute to spirit it have or can have no other notion of spirit but by attribute all those operation it find in itself to a sort of being without consideration of matter and even the most advanced notion we have of god be but attribute the same simple idea which we have get from reflection on what we find in ourselves and which we conceive to have more perfection in they than would be in they absence attribute i say those simple idea to he in a unlimited degree thus have get from reflect on ourselves the idea of existence knowledge power and pleasure -- each of which we find it better to have than to want and the more we have of each the better -- join all these together with infinity to each of they we have the complex idea of a eternal omniscient omnipotent infinitely wise and happy be and though we be tell that there be different species of angel yet we know not how to frame distinct specific idea of they : not out of any conceit that the existence of more species than one of spirit be impossible but because have no more simple idea -lrb- nor be able to frame more -rrb- applicable to such being but only those few take from ourselves and from the action of we own mind in think and be delighted and move several part of we body we can no otherwise distinguish in we conception the several species of spirit one from another but by attribute those operation and power we find in ourselves to they in a higher or lower degree and so have no very distinct specific idea of spirit except only of god to whom we attribute both duration and all those other idea with infinity to the other spirit with limitation : nor as i humbly conceive do we between god and they in we idea put any difference by any number of simple idea which we have of one and not of the other but only that of infinity all the particular idea of existence knowledge will power and motion & c be idea derive from the operation of we mind we attribute all of they to all sort of spirit with the difference only of degree to the utmost we can imagine even infinity when we would frame as well as we can a idea of the first be who yet it be certain be infinitely more remote in the real excellency of he nature from the highest and perfectest of all create being than the greatest man nay purest seraph be from the most contemptible part of matter and consequently must infinitely exceed what we narrow understanding can conceive of he 12 of finite spirit there be probably numberless species in a continuous series of gradation it be not impossible to conceive nor repugnant to reason that there may be many species of spirit as much separated and diversified one from another by distinct property whereof we have no idea as the species of sensible thing be distinguish one from another by quality which we know and observe in they that there should be more species of intelligent creature above we than there be of sensible and material below we be probable to I from hence : that in all the visible corporeal world we see no chasm or gap all quite down from we the descent be by easy step and a continued series of thing that in each remove differ very little one from the other there be fish that have wing and be not stranger to the airy region : and there be some bird that be inhabitant of the water whose blood be cold as fish and they flesh so like in taste that the scrupulous be allow they on fish-day there be animal so near of kin both to bird and beast that they be in the middle between both : amphibious animal link the terrestrial and aquatic together seal live at land and sea and porpoise have the warm blood and entrails of a hog not to mention what be confidently report of mermaid or sea-men there be some brute that seem to have as much knowledge and reason as some that be call man : and the animal and vegetable kingdom be so nearly join that if you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other there will scarce be perceive any great difference between they : and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical part of matter we shall find everywhere that the several species be link together and differ but in almost insensible degree and when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the maker we have reason to think that it be suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe and the great design and infinite goodness of the architect that the species of creature should also by gentle degree ascend upward from we toward he infinite perfection as we see they gradually descend from we downward : which if it be probable we have reason then to be persuade that there be far more species of creature above we than there be beneath we be in degree of perfection much more remote from the infinite being of god than we be from the lowest state of be and that which approach nearest to nothing and yet of all those distinct species for the reason abovesaid we have no clear distinct idea 13 the nominal essence that of the species as conceive by we prove from water and ice but to return to the species of corporeal substance if i should ask any one whether ice and water be two distinct species of thing i doubt not but i should be answer in the affirmative : and it can not be deny but he that say they be two distinct species be in the right but if a englishman breed in jamaica who perhaps have never see nor hear of ice come into england in the winter find the water he put in he basin at night in a great part freeze in the morning and not know any peculiar name it have should call it hardened water i ask whether this would be a new species to he different from water and i think it would be answer here it would not be to he a new species no more than congeal jelly when it be cold be a distinct species from the same jelly fluid and warm or than liquid gold in the furnace be a distinct species from hard gold in the hand of a workman and if this be so it be plain that we distinct species be nothing but distinct complex idea with distinct name annex to they it be true every substance that exist have its peculiar constitution whereon depend those sensible quality and power we observe in it but the ranking of thing into species -lrb- which be nothing but sort they under several title -rrb- be do by we accord to the idea that we have of they : which though sufficient to distinguish they by name so that we may be able to discourse of they when we have they not present before we yet if we suppose it to be do by they real internal constitution and that thing exist be distinguish by nature into species by real essence accord as we distinguish they into species by name we shall be liable to great mistake 14 difficulty in the supposition of a certain number of real essence to distinguish substantial being into species accord to the usual supposition that there be certain precise essence or form of thing whereby all the individual exist be by nature distinguish into species these thing be necessary : -- 15 a crude supposition first to be assure that nature in the production of thing always design they to partake of certain regulate established essence which be to be the model of all thing to be produce this in that crude sense it be usually propose would need some better explication before it can fully be assent to 16 monstrous birth secondly it would be necessary to know whether nature always attain that essence it design in the production of thing the irregular and monstrous birth that in diver sort of animal have be observe will always give we reason to doubt of one or both of these 17 be monster really a distinct species thirdly it ought to be determine whether those we call monster be really a distinct species accord to the scholastic notion of the word species since it be certain that everything that exist have its particular constitution and yet we find that some of these monstrous production have few or none of those quality which be suppose to result from and accompany the essence of that species from whence they derive they original and to which by they descent they seem to belong 18 man can have no idea of real essence fourthly the real essence of those thing which we distinguish into species and as so distinguish we name ought to be know ie we ought to have idea of they but since we be ignorant in these four point the suppose real essence of thing stand we not in stead for the distinguishing substance into species 19 we nominal essence of substance not perfect collection of the property that flow from the real essence fifthly the only imaginable help in this case would be that have frame perfect complex idea of the property of thing flow from they different real essence we should thereby distinguish they into species but neither can this be do for be ignorant of the real essence itself it be impossible to know all those property that flow from it and be so annex to it that any one of they be away we may certainly conclude that that essence be not there and so the thing be not of that species we can never know what be the precise number of property depend on the real essence of gold any one of which fail the real essence of gold and consequently gold would not be there unless we know the real essence of gold itself and by that determine that species by the word gold here i must be understand to design a particular piece of matter v g the last guinea that be coin for if it should stand here in its ordinary signification for that complex idea which i or any one else call gold i e for the nominal essence of gold it would be jargon so hard be it to show the various meaning and imperfection of word when we have nothing else but word to do it by 20 hence name independent of real essence by all which it be clear that we distinguish substance into species by name be not at all found on they real essence nor can we pretend to range and determine they exactly into species accord to internal essential difference 21 but stand for such collection of simple idea as we have make the name stand for but since as have be remark we have need of general word though we know not the real essence of thing all we can do be to collect such a number of simple idea as by examination we find to be unite together in thing exist and thereof to make one complex idea which though it be not the real essence of any substance that exist be yet the specific essence to which we name belong and be convertible with it by which we may at least try the truth of these nominal essence for example : there be that say that the essence of body be extension if it be so we can never mistake in put the essence of anything for the thing itself let we then in discourse put extension for body and when we would say that body move let we say that extension move and see how ill it will look he that should say that one extension by impulse move another extension would by the bare expression sufficiently show the absurdity of such a notion the essence of anything in respect of we be the whole complex idea comprehend and mark by that name and in substance besides the several distinct simple idea that make they up the confuse one of substance or of a unknown support and cause of they union be always a part : and therefore the essence of body be not bare extension but a extend solid thing and so to say a extended solid thing move or impel another be all one and as intelligible as to say body move or impel likewise to say that a rational animal be capable of conversation be all one as to say a man but no one will say that rationality be capable of conversation because it make not the whole essence to which we give the name man 22 we abstract idea be to we the measure of the species we make in instance in that of man there be creature in the world that have shape like ours but be hairy and want language and reason there be natural amongst we that have perfectly we shape but want reason and some of they language too there be creature as it be say -lrb- sit fide pene authorem but there appear no contradiction that there should be such -rrb- that with language and reason and a shape in other thing agree with ours have hairy tail other where the male have no beard and other where the female have if it be ask whether these be all man or no all of human species it be plain the question refer only to the nominal essence : for those of they to whom the definition of the word man or the complex idea signify by that name agree be man and the other not but if the inquiry be make concern the suppose real essence and whether the internal constitution and frame of these several creature be specifically different it be wholly impossible for we to answer no part of that go into we specific idea : only we have reason to think that where the faculty or outward frame so much differ the internal constitution be not exactly the same but what difference in the real internal constitution make a specific difference it be in vain to inquire whilst we measure of species be as they be only we abstract idea which we know and not that internal constitution which make no part of they shall the difference of hair only on the skin be a mark of a different internal specific constitution between a changeling and a drill when they agree in shape and want of reason and speech and shall not the want of reason and speech be a sign to we of different real constitution and species between a changeling and a reasonable man and so of the rest if we pretend that distinction of species or sort be fixedly establish by the real frame and secret constitution of thing 23 species in animal not distinguish by generation nor let any one say that the power of propagation in animal by the mixture of male and female and in plant by seed keep the suppose real species distinct and entire for grant this to be true it would help we in the distinction of the species of thing no further than the tribe of animal and vegetable what must we do for the rest but in those too it be not sufficient : for if history lie not woman have conceive by drill and what real species by that measure such a production will be in nature will be a new question : and we have reason to think this be not impossible since mule and jumart the one from the mixture of a ass and a mare the other from the mixture of a bull and a mare be so frequent in the world i once see a creature that be the issue of a cat and a rat and have the plain mark of both about it wherein nature appear to have follow the pattern of neither sort alone but to have jumble they both together to which he that shall add the monstrous production that be so frequently to be meet with in nature will find it hard even in the race of animal to determine by the pedigree of what species every animal 's issue be and be at a loss about the real essence which he think certainly convey by generation and have alone a right to the specific name but further if the species of animal and plant be to be distinguish only by propagation must i go to the indy to see the sire and dam of the one and the plant from which the seed be gather that produce the other to know whether this be a tiger or that tea 24 not by substantial form upon the whole matter it be evident that it be they own collection of sensible quality that man make the essence of they several sort of substance and that they real internal structure be not consider by the greatest part of man in the sort they much less be any substantial form ever think on by any but those who have in this one part of the world learn the language of the school : and yet those ignorant man who pretend not any insight into the real essence nor trouble themselves about substantial form but be content with know thing one from another by they sensible quality be often better acquaint with they difference can more nicely distinguish they from they use and better know what they expect from each than those learn quick-sighted man who look so deep into they and talk so confidently of something more hidden and essential 25 the specific essence that be common make by man but suppose that the real essence of substance be discoverable by those that would severely apply themselves to that inquiry yet we could not reasonably think that the ranking of thing under general name be regulate by those internal real constitution or anything else but they obvious appearance since language in all country have be establish long before science so that they have not be philosopher or logician or such who have trouble themselves about form and essence that have make the general name that be in use amongst the several nation of man : but those more or less comprehensive term have for the most part in all language receive they birth and signification from ignorant and illiterate people who sort and denominate thing by those sensible quality they find in they thereby to signify they when absent to other whether they have a occasion to mention a sort or a particular thing 26 therefore very various and uncertain in the idea of different man since then it be evident that we sort and name substance by they nominal and not by they real essence the next thing to be consider be how and by whom these essence come to be make as to the latter it be evident they be make by the mind and not by nature : for be they nature 's workmanship they could not be so various and different in several man as experience tell we they be for if we will examine it we shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substance in all man the same : no not of that which of all other we be the most intimately acquaint with it could not possibly be that the abstract idea to which the name man be give should be different in several man if it be of nature 's making and that to one it should be animal rationale and to another animal implume bipe lati unguibus he that annex the name man to a complex idea make up of sense and spontaneous motion join to a body of such a shape have thereby one essence of the species man and he that upon further examination add rationality have another essence of the species he call man : by which mean the same individual will be a true man to the one which be not so to the other i think there be scarce any one will allow this upright figure so well know to be the essential difference of the species man and yet how far man determine of the sort of animal rather by they shape than descent be very visible since it have be more than once debate whether several human foetus should be preserve or receive to baptism or no only because of the difference of they outward configuration from the ordinary make of child without know whether they be not as capable of reason as infant cast in another mould : some whereof though of a approve shape be never capable of as much appearance of reason all they life as be to be find in a ape or a elephant and never give any sign of be act by a rational soul whereby it be evident that the outward figure which only be find want and not the faculty of reason which nobody could know would be want in its due season be make essential to the human species the learn divine and lawyer must on such occasion renounce he sacred definition of animal rationale and substitute some other essence of the human species -lrb- monsieur menage furnish we with a example worth the take notice of on this occasion : ` when the abbot of saint martin ' say he ` be bear he have so little of the figure of a man that it bespake he rather a monster it be for some time under deliberation whether he should be baptize or no however he be baptize and declare a man provisionally -lrb- till time should show what he would prove -rrb- nature have mould he so untowardly that he be call all he life the abbot malotru ie ill-shaped he be of caen -lrb- menagiana 278 430 -rrb- this child we see be very near be exclude out of the species of man barely by he shape he escape very narrowly as he be and it be certain a figure a little more oddly turn have cast he and he have be execute as a thing not to be allow to pass for a man and yet there can be no reason give why if the lineament of he face have be a little altered a rational soul could not have be lodge in he why a visage somewhat longer or a nose flatter or a wider mouth could not have consist as well as the rest of he ill figure with such a soul such part as make he disfigure as he be capable to be a dignitary in the church -rrb- 27 nominal essence of particular substance be undetermined by nature and therefore various as man vary wherein then would i gladly know consist the precise and unmovable boundary of that species it be plain if we examine there be no such thing make by nature and establish by she amongst man the real essence of that or any other sort of substance it be evident we know not and therefore be so undetermined in we nominal essence which we make ourselves that if several man be to be ask concern some oddly-shaped foetus as soon as bear whether it be a man or no it be past doubt one should meet with different answer which could not happen if the nominal essence whereby we limit and distinguish the species of substance be not make by man with some liberty but be exactly copy from precise boundary set by nature whereby it distinguish all substance into certain species who would undertake to resolve what species that monster be of which be mention by licetus -lrb- lib i c 3 -rrb- with a man 's head and hog 's body or those other which to the body of man have the head of beast as dog horse & c if any of these creature have live and could have speak it would have increase the difficulty have the upper part to the middle be of human shape and all below swine have it be murder to destroy it or must the bishop have be consult whether it be man enough to be admit to the font or no as i have be tell it happen in france some year since in somewhat a like case so uncertain be the boundary of species of animal to we who have no other measure than the complex idea of we own collect : and so far be we from certainly know what a man be though perhaps it will be judge great ignorance to make any doubt about it and yet i think i may say that the certain boundary of that species be so far from be determine and the precise number of simple idea which make the nominal essence so far from be settle and perfectly know that very material doubt may still arise about it and i imagine none of the definition of the word man which we yet have nor descriptio of that sort of animal be so perfect and exact as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person much less to obtain a general consent and to be that which man would everywhere stick by in the decision of case and determine of life and death baptism or no baptism in production that might happen 28 but not so arbitrary as mixed mode but though these nominal essence of substance be make by the mind they be not yet make so arbitrarily as those of mixed mode to the making of any nominal essence it be necessary first that the idea whereof it consist have such a union as to make but one idea how compounded soever secondly that the particular idea so united be exactly the same neither more nor less for if two abstract complex idea differ either in number or sort of they component part they make two different and not one and the same essence in the first of these the mind in make its complex idea of substance only follow nature and put none together which be not suppose to have a union in nature nobody join the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse nor the color of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold to be the complex idea of any real substance unless he have a mind to fill he head with chimera and he discourse with unintelligible word man observe certain quality always join and exist together therein copy nature and of idea so unite make they complex one of substance for though man may make what complex idea they please and give what name to they they will yet if they will be understand when they speak of thing really exist they must in some degree conform they idea to the thing they would speak of or else man 's language will be like that of babel and every man 's word be intelligible only to himself would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary affair of life if the idea they stand for be not some way answer the common appearance and agreement of substance as they really exist 29 we nominal essence of substance usually consist of a few obvious quality observe in thing secondly though the mind of man in make its complex idea of substance never put any together that do not really or be not suppose to co-exist and so it truly borrow that union from nature : yet the number it combine depend upon the various care industry or fancy of he that make it man generally content themselves with some few sensible obvious quality and often if not always leave out other as material and as firmly unite as those that they take of sensible substance there be two sort : one of organize body which be propagate by seed and in these the shape be that which to we be the lead quality and most characteristical part that determine the species and therefore in vegetable and animal a extended solid substance of such a certain figure usually serve the turn for however some man seem to prize they definition of animal rationale yet should there a creature be find that have language and reason but partake not of the usual shape of a man i believe it would hardly pass for a man how much soever it be animal rationale and if balaam 's ass have all he life discourse as rationally as he do once with he master i doubt yet whether any one would have think he worthy the name man or allow he to be of the same species with himself as in vegetable and animal it be the shape so in most other body not propagate by seed it be the color we most fix on and be most lead by thus where we find the color of gold we be apt to imagine all the other quality comprehend in we complex idea to be there also : and we commonly take these two obvious quality viz shape and color for so presumptive idea of several species that in a good picture we readily say this be a lion and that a rose this be a gold and that a silver goblet only by the different figure and color represent to the eye by the pencil 30 yet imperfect as they thus be they serve for common converse but though this serve well enough for gross and confused conception and inaccurate way of talk and think yet man be far enough from have agree on the precise number of simple idea or quality belong to any sort of thing signify by its name nor be it a wonder since it require much time pain and skill strict inquiry and long examination to find out what and how many those simple idea be which be constantly and inseparably unite in nature and be always to be find together in the same subject most man want either time inclination or industry enough for this even to some tolerable degree content themselves with some few obvious and outward appearance of thing thereby readily to distinguish and sort they for the common affair of life : and so without further examination give they name or take up the name already in use which though in common conversation they pass well enough for the sign of some few obvious quality co-exist be yet far enough from comprehend in a settle signification a precise number of simple idea much less all those which be unite in nature he that shall consider after so much stir about genus and species and such a deal of talk of specific difference how few word we have yet settle definition of may with reason imagine that those form which there have be so much noise make about be only chimera which give we no light into the specific nature of thing and he that shall consider how far the name of substance be from have signification wherein all who use they do agree will have reason to conclude that though the nominal essence of substance be all suppose to be copy from nature yet they be all or most of they very imperfect since the composition of those complex idea be in several man very different : and therefore that these boundary of species be as man and not as nature make they if at least there be in nature any such prefixed bound it be true that many particular substance be so make by nature that they have agreement and likeness one with another and so afford a foundation of be rank into sort but the sorting of thing by we or the making of determinate species be in order to name and comprehend they under general term i can not see how it can be properly say that nature set the boundary of the species of thing : or if it be so we boundary of species be not exactly conformable to those in nature for we have need of general name for present use stay not for a perfect discovery of all those quality which would best show we they most material difference and agreement but we ourselves divide they by certain obvious appearance into species that we may the easier under general name communicate we thought about they for have no other knowledge of any substance but of the simple idea that be unite in it and observe several particular thing to agree with other in several of those simple idea we make that collection we specific idea and give it a general name that in record we thought and in we discourse with other we may in one short word designate all the individual that agree in that complex idea without enumerate the simple idea that make it up and so not waste we time and breath in tedious description : which we see they be fain to do who would discourse of any new sort of thing they have not yet a name for 31 essence of species under the same name very different in different mind but however these species of substance pass well enough in ordinary conversation it be plain that this complex idea wherein they observe several individual to agree be by different man make very differently by some more and other less accurately in some this complex idea contain a greater and in other a smaller number of quality and so be apparently such as the mind make it the yellow shine color make gold to child other add weight malleableness and fusibility and other yet other quality which they find join with that yellow color as constantly as its weight and fusibility for in all these and the like quality one have as good a right to be put into the complex idea of that substance wherein they be all join as another and therefore different man leave out or put in several simple idea which other do not accord to they various examination skill or observation of that subject have different essence of gold which must therefore be of they own and not of nature 's make 32 the more general we idea of substance be the more incomplete and partial they be if the number of simple idea that make the nominal essence of the lowest species or first sorting of individual depend on the mind of man variously collect they it be much more evident that they do so in the more comprehensive class which by the master of logic be call genus these be complex idea designedly imperfect : and it be visible at first sight that several of those quality that be to be find in the thing themselves be purposely leave out of generical idea for as the mind to make general idea comprehend several particulars leave out those of time and place and such other that make they incommunicable to more than one individual so to make other yet more general idea that may comprehend different sort it leave out those quality that distinguish they and put into its new collection only such idea as be common to several sort the same convenience that make man express several parcel of yellow matter come from guinea and peru under one name set they also upon making of one name that may comprehend both gold and silver and some other body of different sort this be do by leave out those quality which be peculiar to each sort and retain a complex idea make up of those that be common to they all to which the name metal be annex there be a genus constitute the essence whereof be that abstract idea contain only malleableness and fusibility with certain degree of weight and fixedness wherein some body of several kind agree leave out the color and other quality peculiar to gold and silver and the other sort comprehend under the name metal whereby it be plain that man follow not exactly the pattern set they by nature when they make they general idea of substance since there be no body to be find which have barely malleableness and fusibility in it without other quality as inseparable as those but man in make they general idea seek more the convenience of language and quick dispatch by short and comprehensive sign than the true and precise nature of thing as they exist have in the frame they abstract idea chiefly pursue that end which be to be furnish with store of general and variously comprehensive name so that in this whole business of genus and species the genus or more comprehensive be but a partial conception of what be in the species and the species but a partial idea of what be to be find in each individual if therefore any one will think that a man and a horse and a animal and a plant & c be distinguish by real essence make by nature he must think nature to be very liberal of these real essence make one for body another for a animal and another for a horse and all these essence liberally bestow upon bucephalus but if we would rightly consider what be do in all these genus and species or sort we should find that there be no new thing make but only more or less comprehensive sign whereby we may be enable to express in a few syllable great number of particular thing as they agree in more or less general conception which we have frame to that purpose in all which we may observe that the more general term be always the name of a less complex idea and that each genus be but a partial conception of the species comprehend under it so that if these abstract general idea be think to be complete it can only be in respect of a certain established relation between they and certain name which be make use of to signify they and not in respect of anything exist as make by nature 33 this all accommodate to the end of the speech this be adjust to the true end of speech which be to be the easiest and shortest way of communicate we notion for thus he that would discourse of thing as they agree in the complex idea of extension and solidity need but use the word body to denote all such he that to these would join other signify by the word life sense and spontaneous motion need but use the word animal to signify all which partake of those idea and he that have make a complex idea of a body with life sense and motion with the faculty of reasoning and a certain shape join to it need but use the short monosyllable man to express all particulars that correspond to that complex idea this be the proper business of genus and species : and this man do without any consideration of real essence or substantial form which come not within the reach of we knowledge when we think of those thing nor within the signification of we word when we discourse with other 34 instance in cassowary be i to talk with any one of a sort of bird i lately see in st jame 's park about three or four foot high with a covering of something between feather and hair of a dark brown color without wing but in the place thereof two or three little branch come down like sprig of spanish broom long great leg with foot only of three claw and without a tail i must make this description of it and so may make other understand I but when i be tell that the name of it be cassuaris i may then use that word to stand in discourse for all my complex idea mention in that description though by that word which be now become a specific name i know no more of the real essence or constitution of that sort of animal than i do before and know probably as much of the nature of that species of bird before i learn the name as many englishman do of swan or heron which be specific name very well know of sort of bird common in england 35 man determine the sort of substance which may be sort variously from what have be say it be evident that man make sort of thing for it be different essence alone that make different species it be plain that they who make those abstract idea which be the nominal essence do thereby make the species or sort should there be a body find have all the other quality of gold except malleableness it would no doubt be make a question whether it be gold or not ie whether it be of that species this could be determine only by that abstract idea to which every one annex the name gold : so that it would be true gold to he and belong to that species who include not malleableness in he nominal essence signify by the sound gold and on the other side it would not be true gold or of that species to he who include malleableness in he specific idea and who i pray be it that make these diverse species even under one and the same name but man that make two different abstract idea consist not exactly of the same collection of quality nor be it a mere supposition to imagine that a body may exist wherein the other obvious quality of gold may be without malleableness since it be certain that gold itself will be sometimes so eager -lrb- as artist call it -rrb- that it will as little endure the hammer as glass itself what we have say of the put in or leave out of malleableness in the complex idea the name gold be by any one annex to may be say of its peculiar weight fixedness and several other the like quality : for whatever be leave out or put in it be still the complex idea to which that name be annex that make the species : and as any particular parcel of matter answer that idea so the name of the sort belong truly to it and it be of that species and thus anything be true gold perfect metal all which determination of the species it be plain depend on the understanding of man make this or that complex idea 36 nature make the similitude of substance this then in short be the case : nature make many particular thing which do agree one with another in many sensible quality and probably too in they internal frame and constitution : but it be not this real essence that distinguish they into species it be man who take occasion from the quality they find unite in they and wherein they observe often several individual to agree range they into sort in order to they name for the convenience of comprehensive sign under which individual accord to they conformity to this or that abstract idea come to be rank as under ensign : so that this be of the blue that the red regiment this be a man that a drill : and in this i think consist the whole business of genus and species 37 the manner of sort particular being the work of fallible man though nature make thing alike i do not deny but nature in the constant production of particular being make they not always new and various but very much alike and of kin one to another : but i think it nevertheless true that the boundary of the species whereby man sort they be make by man since the essence of the species distinguish by different name be as have be prove of man 's making and seldom adequate to the internal nature of the thing they be take from so that we may truly say such a manner of sorting of thing be the workmanship of man 38 each abstract idea with a name to it make a nominal essence one thing i doubt not but will seem very strange in this doctrine which be that from what have be say it will follow that each abstract idea with a name to it make a distinct species but who can help it if truth will have it so for so it must remain till somebody can show we the species of thing limit and distinguish by something else and let we see that general term signify not we abstract idea but something different from they i would fain know why a shock and a hound be not as distinct species as a spaniel and a elephant we have no other idea of the different essence of a elephant and a spaniel than we have of the different essence of a shock and a hound all the essential difference whereby we know and distinguish they one from another consist only in the different collection of simple idea to which we have give those different name 39 how genus and species be related to name how much the making of species and genus be in order to general name and how much general name be necessary if not to the be yet at least to the complete of a species and make it pass for such will appear besides what have be say above concern ice and water in a very familiar example a silent and a striking watch be but one species to those who have but one name for they : but he that have the name watch for one and clock for the other and distinct complex idea to which those name belong to he they be different species it will be say perhaps that the inward contrivance and constitution be different between these two which the watchmaker have a clear idea of and yet it be plain they be but one species to he when he have but one name for they for what be sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species there be some watch that be make with four wheel other with five be this a specific difference to the workman some have string and physics and other none some have the balance loose and other regulate by a spiral spring and other by hog ' bristle be any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman that know each of these and several other different contrivance in the internal constitution of watch it be certain each of these have a real difference from the rest but whether it be a essential a specific difference or no relate only to the complex idea to which the name watch be give : as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stand for and that name do not as a generical name comprehend different species under it they be not essentially nor specifically different but if any one will make minuter division from difference that he know in the internal frame of watch and to such precise complex idea give name that shall prevail they will then be new species to they who have those idea with name to they and can by those difference distinguish watch into these several sort and then watch will be a generical name but yet they would be no distinct species to man ignorant of clock-work and the inward contrivance of watch who have no other idea but the outward shape and bulk with the mark of the hour by the hand for to they all those other name would be but synonymous term for the same idea and signify no more nor no other thing but a watch just thus i think it be in natural thing nobody will doubt that the wheel or spring -lrb- if i may so say -rrb- within be different in a rational man and a changele no more than that there be a difference in the frame between a drill and a changele but whether one or both these difference be essential or specifical be only to be know to we by they agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stand for : for by that alone can it be determine whether one or both or neither of those be a man 40 species of artificial thing less confused than natural from what have be before say we may see the reason why in the species of artificial thing there be generally less confusion and uncertainty than in natural because a artificial thing be a production of man which the artificer design and therefore well know the idea of the name of it be suppose to stand for no other idea nor to import any other essence than what be certainly to be know and easy enough to be apprehend for the idea or essence of the several sort of artificial thing consist for the most part in nothing but the determinate figure of sensible part and sometimes motion depend thereon which the artificer fashion in matter such as he find for he turn it be not beyond the reach of we faculty to attain a certain idea thereof and so settle the signification of the name whereby the species of artificial thing be distinguish with less doubt obscurity and equivocation than we can in thing natural whose difference and operation depend upon contrivance beyond the reach of we discovery 41 artificial thing of distinct species i must be excuse here if i think artificial thing be of distinct species as well as natural : since i find they be as plainly and orderly rank into sort by different abstract idea with general name annex to they as distinct one from another as those of natural substance for why should we not think a watch and pistol as distinct species one from another as a horse and a dog they be express in we mind by distinct idea and to other by distinct appellation 42 substance alone of all we several sort of idea have proper name this be further to be observe concern substance that they alone of all we several sort of idea have particular or proper name whereby one only particular thing be signify because in simple idea mode and relation it seldom happen that man have occasion to mention often this or that particular when it be absent besides the greatest part of mixed mode be action which perish in they birth be not capable of a lasting duration as substance which be the actor and wherein the simple idea that make up the complex idea design by the name have a lasting union 43 difficult to lead another by word into the thought of thing strip of those abstract idea we give they i must beg pardon of my reader for have dwell so long upon this subject and perhaps with some obscurity but i desire it may be consider how difficult it be to lead another by word into the thought of thing strip of those specifical difference we give they : which thing if i name not i say nothing and if i do name they i thereby rank they into some sort or other and suggest to the mind the usual abstract idea of that species and so cross my purpose for to talk of a man and to lay by at the same time the ordinary signification of the name man which be we complex idea usually annex to it and bid the reader consider man as he be in himself and as he be really distinguish from other in he internal constitution or real essence that be by something he know not what look like trifling : and yet thus one must do who would speak of the suppose real essence and species of thing as think to be make by nature if it be but only to make it understand that there be no such thing signify by the general name which substance be call by but because it be difficult by known familiar name to do this give I leave to endeavor by a example to make the different consideration the mind have of specific name and idea a little more clear and to show how the complex idea of mode be refer sometimes to archetype in the mind of other intelligent being or which be the same to the signification annex by other to they receive name and sometimes to no archetype at all give I leave also to show how the mind always refer its idea of substance either to the substance themselves or to the signification of they name as to the archetype and also to make plain the nature of species or sorting of thing as apprehend and make use of by we and of the essence belong to those species : which be perhaps of more moment to discover the extent and certainty of we knowledge than we at first imagine 44 instance of mixed mode name kinneah and niouph let we suppose adam in the state of a grown man with a good understanding but in a strange country with all thing new and unknown about he and no other faculty to attain the knowledge of they but what one of this age have now he observe lamech more melancholy than usual and imagine it to be from a suspicion he have of he wife adah -lrb- whom he most ardently loved -rrb- that she have too much kindness for another man adam discourse these he thought to eve and desire she to take care that adah commit not folly : and in these discourse with eve he make use of these two new word kinneah and niouph in time adam 's mistake appear for he find lamech 's trouble proceed from have kill a man : but yet the two name kinneah and niouph -lrb- the one standing for suspicion in a husband of he wife 's disloyalty to he and the other for the act of commit disloyalty -rrb- lose not they distinct signification it be plain then that here be two distinct complex idea of mixed mode with name to they two distinct species of action essentially different i ask wherein consist the essence of these two distinct species of action and it be plain it consist in a precise combination of simple idea different in one from the other i ask whether the complex idea in adam 's mind which he call kinneah be adequate or not and it be plain it be for it be a combination of simple idea which he without any regard to any archetype without respect to anything as a pattern voluntarily put together abstracted and give the name kinneah to to express in short to other by that one sound all the simple idea contain and unite in that complex one it must necessarily follow that it be a adequate idea he own choice have make that combination it have all in it he intend it should and so could not but be perfect could not but be adequate it be refer to no other archetype which it be suppose to represent 45 these word kinneah and niouph by degree grow into common use and then the case be somewhat altered adam 's child have the same faculty and thereby the same power that he have to make what complex idea of mixed mode they please in they own mind to abstract they and make what sound they please the sign of they : but the use of name be to make we idea within we know to other that can not be do but when the same sign stand for the same idea in two who would communicate they thought and discourse together those therefore of adam 's child that find these two word kinneah and niouph in familiar use could not take they for insignificant sound but must need conclude they stand for something for certain idea abstract idea they be general name which abstract idea be the essence of the species distinguish by those name if therefore they would use these word as name of species already establish and agree on they be oblige to conform the idea in they mind signify by these name to the idea that they stand for in other man 's mind as to they pattern and archetype and then indeed they idea of these complex mode be liable to be inadequate as be very apt -lrb- especially those that consist of combination of many simple idea -rrb- not to be exactly conformable to the idea in other man 's mind use the same name though for this there be usually a remedy at hand which be to ask the meaning of any word we understand not of he that use it : it be as impossible to know certainly what the word jealousy and adultery -lrb- which i think answer -lrb- hebrew -rrb- and -lrb- hebrew -rrb- -rrb- stand for in another man 's mind with whom i would discourse about they as it be impossible in the beginning of language to know what kinneah and niouph stand for in another man 's mind without explication they be voluntary sign in every one 46 instance of a species of substance name zahab let we now also consider after the same manner the name of substance in they first application one of adam 's child rove in the mountain light on a glittering substance which please he eye home he carry it to adam who upon consideration of it find it to be hard to have a bright yellow color and a exceed great weight these perhaps at first be all the quality he take notice of in it and abstract this complex idea consist of a substance have that peculiar bright yellowness and a weight very great in proportion to its bulk he give the name zahab to denominate and mark all substance that have these sensible quality in they it be evident now that in this case adam act quite differently from what he do before in form those idea of mixed mode to which he give the name kinneah and niouph for there he put idea together only by he own imagination not take from the existence of anything and to they he give name to denominate all thing that should happen to agree to those he abstract idea without consider whether any such thing do exist or not : the standard there be of he own making but in the form he idea of this new substance he take the quite contrary course here he have a standard make by nature and therefore be to represent that to himself by the idea he have of it even when it be absent he put in no simple idea into he complex one but what he have the perception of from the thing itself he take care that he idea be conformable to this archetype and intend the name should stand for a idea so conformable 47 this piece of matter thus denominate zahab by adam be quite different from any he have see before nobody i think will deny to be a distinct species and to have its peculiar essence and that the name zahab be the mark of the species and a name belong to all thing partaking in that essence but here it be plain the essence adam make the name zahab stand for be nothing but a body hard shine yellow and very heavy but the inquisitive mind of man not content with the knowledge of these as i may say superficial quality put adam upon further examination of this matter he therefore knock and beat it with flint to see what be discoverable in the inside : he find it yield to blow but not easily separate into piece : he find it will bend without breaking be not now ductility to be add to he former idea and make part of the essence of the species that name zahab stand for further trial discover fusibility and fixedness be not they also by the same reason that any of the other be to be put into the complex idea signify by the name zahab if not what reason will there be show more for the one than the other if these must then all the other property which any further trial shall discover in this matter ought by the same reason to make a part of the ingredient of the complex idea which the name zahab stand for and so be the essence of the species mark by that name which property because they be endless it be plain that the idea make after this fashion by this archetype will be always inadequate 48 the abstract idea of substance always imperfect and therefore various but this be not all it would also follow that the name of substance would not only have as in truth they have but would also be suppose to have different signification as use by different man which would very much cumber the use of language for if every distinct quality that be discover in any matter by any one be suppose to make a necessary part of the complex idea signify by the common name give to it it must follow that man must suppose the same word to signify different thing in different man : since they can not doubt but different man may have discover several quality in substance of the same denomination which other know nothing of 49 therefore to fix the nominal species real essence suppose to avoid this therefore they have suppose a real essence belong to every species from which these proper tie all flow and would have they name of the species stand for that but they not have any idea of that real essence in substance and they word signify nothing but the idea they have that which be do by this attempt be only to put the name or sound in the place and stead of the thing have that real essence without know what the real essence be and this be that which man do when they speak of species of thing as suppose they make by nature and distinguish by real essence 50 which supposition be of no use for let we consider when we affirm that ` all gold be fix ' either it mean that fixedness be a part of the definition i e part of the nominal essence the word gold stand for and so this affirmation ` all gold be fix ' contain nothing but the signification of the term gold or else it mean that fixedness not be a part of the definition of the gold be a property of that substance itself : in which case it be plain that the word gold stand in the place of a substance have the real essence of a species of thing make by nature in which way of substitution it have so confused and uncertain a signification that though this proposition -- ` gold be fix ' -- be in that sense a affirmation of something real yet it be a truth will always fail we in its particular application and so be of no real use or certainty for let it be ever so true that all gold i e all that have the real essence of gold be fix what serve this for whilst we know not in this sense what be or be not gold for if we know not the real essence of gold it be impossible we should know what parcel of matter have that essence and so whether it be true gold or no 51 conclusion to conclude : what liberty adam have at first to make any complex idea of mixed mode by no other pattern but by he own thought the same have all man ever since have and the same necessity of conform he idea of substance to thing without he as to archetype make by nature that adam be under if he would not wilfully impose upon himself the same be all man ever since under too the same liberty also that adam have of affix any new name to any idea the same have any one still -lrb- especially the beginner of language if we can imagine any such -rrb- but only with this difference that in place where man in society have already establish a language amongst they the signification of word be very warily and sparingly to be alter because man be furnished already with name for they idea and common use have appropriate known name to certain idea a affected misapplication of they can not but be very ridiculous he that have new notion will perhaps venture sometimes on the coining of new term to express they : but man think it a boldness and it be uncertain whether common use will ever make they pass for current but in communication with other it be necessary that we conform the idea we make the vulgar word of any language stand for to they known proper signification -lrb- which i have explain at large already -rrb- or else to make know that new signification we apply they to chapter vii of particle 1 particle connect part or whole sentence together besides word which be name of idea in the mind there be a great many other that be make use of to signify the connexion that the mind give to idea or to proposition one with another the mind in communicate its thought to other do not only need sign of the idea it have then before it but other also to show or intimate some particular action of its own at that time relate to those idea this it do several way as _ i_s and _ i_s not be the general mark of the mind affirm or deny but besides affirmation or negation without which there be in word no truth or falsehood the mind do in declare its sentiment to other connect not only the part of proposition but whole sentence one to another with they several relation and dependency to make a coherent discourse 2 in right use of particle consist the art of well-speaking the word whereby it signify what connexion it give to the several affirmation and negation that it unite in one continue reasoning or narration be generally call particle : and it be in the right use of these that more particularly consist the clearness and beauty of a good style to think well it be not enough that a man have idea clear and distinct in he thought nor that he observe the agreement or disagreement of some of they but he must think in train and observe the dependence of he thought and reasoning upon one another and to express well such methodical and rational thought he must have word to show what connexion restriction distinction opposition emphasis & c he give to each respective part of he discourse to mistake in any of these be to puzzle instead of inform he hearer : and therefore it be that those word which be not truly by themselves the name of any idea be of such constant and indispensable use in language and do much contribute to man 's well express themselves 3 they say what relation the mind give to its own thought this part of grammar have be perhaps as much neglect as some other over-diligently cultivate it be easy for man to write one after another of case and gender mood and tense gerund and supine : in these and the like there have be great diligence use and particle themselves in some language have be with great show of exactness rank into they several order but though preposition and conjunction & c be name well know in grammar and the particle contain under they carefully rank into they distinct subdivision yet he who would show the right use of particle and what significancy and force they have must take a little more pain enter into he own thought and observe nicely the several posture of he mind in discourse 4 they be all mark of some action or intimation of the mind neither be it enough for the explain of these word to render they as be usual in dictionary by word of another tongue which come nearest to they signification : for what be mean by they be commonly as hard to be understand in one as another language they be all mark of some action or intimation of the mind and therefore to understand they rightly the several view posture stand turn limitation and exception and several other thought of the mind for which we have either none or very deficient name be diligently to be study of these there be a great variety much exceed the number of particle that most language have to express they by : and therefore it be not to be wonder that most of these particle have diver and sometimes almost opposite signification in the hebrew tongue there be a particle consist of but one single letter of which there be reckon up as i remember seventy i be sure above fifty several signification 5 instance in but ` but ' be a particle none more familiar in we language : and he that say it be a discretive conjunction and that it answer to sed latin or mai in french think he have sufficiently explain it but yet it seem to I to intimate several relation the mind give to the several proposition or part of they which it join by this monosyllable first ` but to say no more : ' here it intimate a stop of the mind in the course it be go before it come quite to the end of it secondly ' i saw but two plant ' here it show that the mind limit the sense to what be express with a negation of all other thirdly ` you pray but it be not that god would bring you to the true religion ' fourthly ` but that he would confirm you in you own ' the first of these but intimate a supposition in the mind of something otherwise than it should be the latter show that the mind make a direct opposition between that and what go before it fifthly ` all animal have sense but a dog be a animal : ' here it signify little more but that the latter proposition be join to the former as the minor of a syllogism 6 this matter of the use of particle but lightly touch here to these i doubt not might be add a great many other signification of this particle if it be my business to examine it in its full latitude and consider it in all the place it be to be find : which if one should do i doubt whether in all those manners it be make use of it would deserve the title of discretive which grammarian give to it but i intend not here a full explication of this sort of sign the instance i have give in this one may give occasion to reflect on they use and force in language and lead we into the contemplation of several action of we mind in discourse which it have find a way to intimate to other by these particle some whereof constantly and other in certain construction have the sense of a whole sentence contain in they chapter viii of abstract and concrete term 1 abstract term predicate one on another and why the ordinary word of language and we common use of they would have give we light into the nature of we idea if they have be but consider with attention the mind as have be show have a power to abstract its idea and so they become essence general essence whereby the sort of thing be distinguish now each abstract idea be distinct so that of any two the one can never be the other the mind will by its intuitive knowledge perceive they difference and therefore in proposition no two whole idea can ever be affirm one of another this we see in the common use of language which permit not any two abstract word or name of abstract idea to be affirm one of another for how near of kin soever they may seem to be and how certain soever it be that man be a animal or rational or white yet every one at first hearing perceive the falsehood of these proposition : humanity be animality or rationality or whiteness : and this be as evident as any of the most allow maxim all we affirmation then be only in concrete which be the affirm not one abstract idea to be another but one abstract idea to be join to another which abstract idea in substance may be of any sort in all the rest be little else but of relation and in substance the most frequent be of power : vg ' a man be white ' signify that the thing that have the essence of a man have also in it the essence of whiteness which be nothing but a power to produce the idea of whiteness in one whose eye can discover ordinary object : or ' a man be rational ' signify that the same thing that have the essence of a man have also in it the essence of rationality ie a power of reasoning 2 they show the difference of we idea this distinction of name show we also the difference of we idea : for if we observe they we shall find that we simple idea have all abstract as well as concrete name : the one whereof be -lrb- to speak the language of grammarian -rrb- a substantive the other a adjective as whiteness white sweetness sweet the like also hold in we idea of mode and relation as justice just equality equal : only with this difference that some of the concrete name of relation amongst man chiefly be substantive as paternita pater whereof it be easy to render a reason but as to we idea of substance we have very few or no abstract name at all for though the school have introduce animalitas humanita corporieta and some other yet they hold no proportion with that infinite number of name of substance to which they never be ridiculous enough to attempt the coining of abstract one : and those few that the school forge and put into the mouth of they scholar could never yet get admittance into common use or obtain the license of public approbation which seem to I at least to intimate the confession of all mankind that they have no idea of the real essence of substance since they have not name for such idea : which no doubt they would have have have not they consciousness to themselves of they ignorance of they keep they from so idle a attempt and therefore though they have idea enough to distinguish gold from a stone and metal from wood yet they but timorously venture on such term as aurieta and saxieta metallieta and lignieta or the like name which should pretend to signify the real essence of those substance whereof they know they have no idea and indeed it be only the doctrine of substantial form and the confidence of mistaken pretender to a knowledge that they have not which first coin and then introduce animalita and humanita and the like which yet go very little further than they own school and could never get to be current amongst understand man indeed humanita be a word in familiar use amongst the roman but in a far different sense and stand not for the abstract essence of any substance but be the abstracted name of a mode and its concrete humanus not homo chapter ix of the imperfection of word 1 word be use for recording and communicate we thought from what have be say in the foregoing chapter it be easy to perceive what imperfection there be in language and how the very nature of word make it almost unavoidable for many of they to be doubtful and uncertain in they signification to examine the perfection or imperfection of word it be necessary first to consider they use and end : for as they be more or less fit to attain that so they be more or less perfect we have in the former part of this discourse often upon occasion mention a double use of word first one for the recording of we own thought secondly the other for the communicate of we thought to other 2 any word will serve for record as to the first of these for the record we own thought for the help of we own memory whereby as it be we talk to ourselves any word will serve the turn for since sound be voluntary and indifferent sign of any idea a man may use what word he please to signify he own idea to himself : and there will be no imperfection in they if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea : for then he can not fail of have he meaning understand wherein consist the right use and perfection of language 3 communication by word either for civil or philosophical purpose secondly as to communication by word that too have a double use i civil ii philosophical first by they civil use i mean such a communication of thought and idea by word as may serve for the uphold common conversation and commerce about the ordinary affair and convenience of civil life in the society of man one amongst another secondly by the philosophical use of word i mean such a use of they as may serve to convey the precise notion of thing and to express in general proposition certain and undoubted truth which the mind may rest upon and be satisfy with in its search after true knowledge these two use be very distinct and a great deal less exactness will serve in the one than in the other as we shall see in what follow 4 the imperfection of word be the doubtfulness or ambiguity of they signification which be cause by the sort of idea they stand for the chief end of language in communication be to be understand word serve not well for that end neither in civil nor philosophical discourse when any word do not excite in the hearer the same idea which it stand for in the mind of the speaker now since sound have no natural connexion with we idea but have all they signification from the arbitrary imposition of man the doubtfulness and uncertainty of they signification which be the imperfection we here be speak of have its cause more in the idea they stand for than in any incapacity there be in one sound more than in another to signify any idea : for in that regard they be all equally perfect that then which make doubtfulness and uncertainty in the signification of some more than other word be the difference of idea they stand for 5 natural cause of they imperfection especially in those that stand for mixed mode and for we idea of substance word have naturally no signification the idea which each stand for must be learn and retain by those who would exchange thought and hold intelligible discourse with other in any language but this be the hardest to be do where first the idea they stand for be very complex and make up of a great number of idea put together secondly where the idea they stand for have no certain connexion in nature and so no settled standard anywhere in nature exist to rectify and adjust they by thirdly when the signification of the word be refer to a standard which standard be not easy to be know fourthly where the signification of the word and the real essence of the thing be not exactly the same these be difficulty that attend the signification of several word that be intelligible those which be not intelligible at all such as name stand for any simple idea which another have not organ or faculty to attain as the name of color to a blind man or sound to a deaf man need not here be mention in all these case we shall find a imperfection in word which i shall more at large explain in they particular application to we several sort of idea : for if we examine they we shall find that the name of _ m_ixed _ m_odes be most liable to doubtfulness and imperfection for the two first of these reason and the name of _ s_ubstances chiefly for the two latter 6 the name of mixed mode doubtful first the name of mixed mode be many of they liable to great uncertainty and obscurity in they signification i because the idea they stand for be so complex because of that great composition these complex idea be often make up of to make word serviceable to the end of communication it be necessary as have be say that they excite in the hearer exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker without this man fill one another 's head with noise and sound but convey not thereby they thought and lay not before one another they idea which be the end of discourse and language but when a word stand for a very complex idea that be compound and decompound it be not easy for man to form and retain that idea so exactly as to make the name in common use stand for the same precise idea without any the least variation hence it come to pass that man 's name of very compound idea such as for the most part be moral word have seldom in two different man the same precise signification since one man 's complex idea seldom agree with another 's and often differ from he own -- from that which he have yesterday or will have tomorrow 7 secondly because they have no standard in nature because the name of mixed mode for the most part want standard in nature whereby man may rectify and adjust they signification therefore they be very various and doubtful they be assemblage of idea put together at the pleasure of the mind pursue its own end of discourse and suit to its own notion whereby it design not to copy anything really exist but to denominate and rank thing as they come to agree with those archetype or form it have make he that first bring the word sham or wheedle or banter in use put together as he think fit those idea he make it stand for and as it be with any new name of mode that be now bring into any language so it be with the old one when they be first make use of name therefore that stand for collection of idea which the mind make at pleasure must need be of doubtful signification when such collection be nowhere to be find constantly unite in nature nor any pattern to be show whereby man may adjust they what the word murder or sacrilege & c signify can never be know from thing themselves : there be many of the part of those complex idea which be not visible in the action itself the intention of the mind or the relation of holy thing which make a part of murder or sacrilege have no necessary connexion with the outward and visible action of he that commit either : and the pull the trigger of the gun with which the murder be commit and be all the action that perhaps be visible have no natural connexion with those other idea that make up the complex one name murder they have they union and combination only from the understanding which unite they under one name : but unite they without any rule or pattern it can not be but that the signification of the name that stand for such voluntary collection should be often various in the mind of different man who have scarce any standing rule to regulate themselves and they notion by in such arbitrary idea 8 common use or propriety not a sufficient remedy it be true common use that be the rule of propriety may be suppose here to afford some aid to settle the signification of language and it can not be deny but that in some measure it do common use regulate the meaning of word pretty well for common conversation but nobody have a authority to establish the precise signification of word nor determine to what idea any one shall annex they common use be not sufficient to adjust they to philosophical discourse there be scarce any name of any very complex idea -lrb- to say nothing of other -rrb- which in common use have not a great latitude and which keep within the bound of propriety may not be make the sign of far different idea besides the rule and measure of propriety itself be nowhere establish it be often matter of dispute whether this or that way of use a word be propriety of speech or no from all which it be evident that the name of such kind of very complex idea be naturally liable to this imperfection to be of doubtful and uncertain signification and even in man that have a mind to understand one another do not always stand for the same idea in speaker and hearer though the name glory and gratitude be the same in every man 's mouth through a whole country yet the complex collective idea which every one think on or intend by that name be apparently very different in man use the same language 9 the way of learn these name contribute also to they doubtfulness the way also wherein the name of mixed mode be ordinarily learn do not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of they signification for if we will observe how child learn language we shall find that to make they understand what the name of simple idea or substance stand for people ordinarily show they the thing whereof they would have they have the idea and then repeat to they the name that stand for it as white sweet milk sugar cat dog but as for mixed mode especially the most material of they moral word the sound be usually learn first and then to know what complex idea they stand for they be either beholden to the explication of other or -lrb- which happen for the most part -rrb- be leave to they own observation and industry which be little lay out in the search of the true and precise meaning of name these moral word be in most man 's mouth little more than bare sound or when they have any it be for the most part but a very loose and undetermined and consequently obscure and confused signification and even those themselves who have with more attention settle they notion do yet hardly avoid the inconvenience to have they stand for complex idea different from those which other even intelligent and studious man make they the sign of where shall one find any either controversial debate or familiar discourse concern honor faith grace religion church & c wherein it be not easy to observe the different notion man have of they which be nothing but this that they be not agree in the signification of those word nor have in they mind the same complex idea which they make they stand for and so all the contest that follow thereupon be only about the meaning of a sound and hence we see that in the interpretation of law whether divine or human there be no end comment beget comment and explication make new matter for explication and of limit distinguish vary the signification of these moral word there be no end these idea of man 's make be by man still have the same power multiply in infinitum many a man who be pretty well satisfied of the meaning of a text of scripture or clause in the code at first reading have by consult commentator quite lose the sense of it and by these elucidation give rise or increase to he doubt and draw obscurity upon the place i say not this that i think commentary needless but to show how uncertain the name of mixed mode naturally be even in the mouth of those who have both the intention and the faculty of speak as clearly as language be capable to express they thought 10 hence unavoidable obscurity in ancient author what obscurity this have unavoidably bring upon the writings of man who have live in remote age and different country it will be needless to take notice since the numerous volume of learn man employ they thought that way be proof more than enough to show what attention study sagacity and reasoning be require to find out the true meaning of ancient author but there be no writings we have any great concernment to be very solicitous about the meaning of but those that contain either truth we be require to believe or law we be to obey and draw inconvenience on we when we mistake or transgress we may be less anxious about the sense of other author who write but they own opinion we be under no greater necessity to know they than they to know ours we good or evil depend not on they decree we may safely be ignorant of they notion : and therefore in the reading of they if they do not use they word with a due clearness and perspicuity we may lay they aside and without any injury do they resolve thus with ourselves si non vis intelligi debes negligi 11 name of substance of doubtful signification because the idea they stand for relate to the reality of thing if the signification of the name of mixed mode be uncertain because there be no real standard exist in nature to which those idea be refer and by which they may be adjust the name of substance be of a doubtful signification for a contrary reason viz because the idea they stand for be suppose conformable to the reality of thing and be refer to as standard make by nature in we idea of substance we have not the liberty as in mixed mode to frame what combination we think fit to be the characteristical note to rank and denominate thing by in these we must follow nature suit we complex idea to real existence and regulate the signification of they name by the thing themselves if we will have we name to be sign of they and stand for they here it be true we have pattern to follow but pattern that will make the signification of they name very uncertain : for name must be of a very unsteady and various mean if the idea they stand for be refer to standard without we that either can not be know at all or can be know but imperfectly and uncertainly 12 name of substance refer i to real essence that can not be know the name of substance have as have be show a double reference in they ordinary use first sometimes they be make to stand for and so they signification be suppose to agree to the real constitution of thing from which all they property flow and in which they all center but this real constitution or -lrb- as it be apt to be call -rrb- essence be utterly unknown to we any sound that be put to stand for it must be very uncertain in its application and it will be impossible to know what thing be or ought to be call a horse or antimony when those word be put for real essence that we have no idea of at all and therefore in this supposition the name of substance be refer to standard that can not be know they signification can never be adjust and establish by those standard 13 secondly to co-exist quality which be know but imperfectly secondly the simple idea that be find to co-exist in substance be that which they name immediately signify these as unite in the several sort of thing be the proper standard to which they name be refer and by which they signification may be best rectify but neither will these archetype so well serve to this purpose as to leave these name without very various and uncertain signification because these simple idea that co-exist and be unite in the same subject be very numerous and have all a equal right to go into the complex specific idea which the specific name be to stand for man though they propose to themselves the very same subject to consider yet frame very different idea about it and so the name they use for it unavoidably come to have in several man very different signification the simple quality which make up the complex idea be most of they power in relation to change which they be apt to make in or receive from other body be almost infinite he that shall but observe what a great variety of alteration any one of the baser metal be apt to receive from the different application only of fire and how much a greater number of change any of they will receive in the hand of a chymist by the application of other body will not think it strange that i count the property of any sort of body not easy to be collect and completely know by the way of inquiry which we faculty be capable of they be therefore at least so many that no man can know the precise and definite number they be differently discover by different man accord to they various skill attention and way of handle who therefore can not choose but have different idea of the same substance and therefore make the signification of its common name very various and uncertain for the complex idea of substance be make up of such simple one as be suppose to co-exist in nature every one have a right to put into he complex idea those quality he have find to be unite together for though in the substance of gold one satisfy himself with color and weight yet another think solubility in aqua regium as necessary to be join with that color in he idea of gold as any one do its fusibility solubility in aqua regium be a quality as constantly join with its color and weight as fusibility or any other other put into it ductility or fixedness & c as they have be teach by tradition or experience who of all these have establish the right signification of the word gold or who shall be the judge to determine each have he standard in nature which he appeal to and with reason think he have the same right to put into he complex idea signify by the word gold those quality which upon trial he have find unite as another who have not so well examine have to leave they out or a third who have make other trial have to put in other for the union in nature of these quality be the true ground of they union in one complex idea who can say one of they have more reason to be put in or leave out than another from hence it will unavoidably follow that the complex idea of substance in man use the same name for they will be very various and so the signification of those name very uncertain 14 thirdly to co-exist quality which be know but imperfectly besides there be scarce any particular thing exist which in some of its simple idea do not communicate with a greater and in other a less number of particular being : who shall determine in this case which be those that be to make up the precise collection that be to be signify by the specific name or can with any just authority prescribe which obvious or common quality be to be leave out or which more secret or more particular be to be put into the signification of the name of any substance all which together seldom or never fail to produce that various and doubtful signification in the name of substance which cause such uncertainty dispute or mistake when we come to a philosophical use of they 15 with this imperfection they may serve for civil but not well for philosophical use it be true as to civil and common conversation the general name of substance regulate in they ordinary signification by some obvious quality -lrb- as by the shape and figure in thing of known seminal propagation and in other substance for the most part by color join with some other sensible quality -rrb- do well enough to design the thing man would be understand to speak of : and so they usually conceive well enough the substance mean by the word gold or apple to distinguish the one from the other but in philosophical inquiry and debate where general truth be to be establish and consequence draw from position lay down there the precise signification of the name of substance will be find not only not to be well establish but also very hard to be so for example : he that shall make malleability or a certain degree of fixedness a part of he complex idea of gold may make proposition concern gold and draw consequence from they that will truly and clearly follow from gold take in such a signification : but yet such as another man can never be force to admit nor be convince of they truth who make not malleableness or the same degree of fixedness part of that complex idea that the name gold in he use of it stand for 16 instance liquor this be a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the name of substance in all language whatsoever which man will easily find when once pass from confuse or loose notion they come to more strict and close inquiry for then they will be convince how doubtful and obscure those word be in they signification which in ordinary use appear very clear and determine i be once in a meeting of very learn and ingenious physician where by chance there arise a question whether any liquor pass through the filament of the nerve the debate have be manage a good while by variety of argument on both side i -lrb- who have be use to suspect that the greatest part of dispute be more about the signification of word than a real difference in the conception of thing -rrb- desire that before they go any further on in this dispute they would first examine and establish amongst they what the word liquor signify they at first be a little surprised at the proposal and have they be person less ingenious they might perhaps have take it for a very frivolous or extravagant one : since there be no one there that think not himself to understand very perfectly what the word liquor stand for which i think too none of the most perplexed name of substance however they be please to comply with my motion and upon examination find that the signification of that word be not so settled or certain as they have all imagine but that each of they make it a sign of a different complex idea this make they perceive that the main of they dispute be about the signification of that term and that they differ very little in they opinion concern some fluid and subtle matter pass through the conduit of the nerve though it be not so easy to agree whether it be to be call liquor or no a thing which when consider they think it not worth the contend about 17 instance gold how much this be the case in the greatest part of dispute that man be engage so hotly in i shall perhaps have a occasion in another place to take notice let we only here consider a little more exactly the fore-mentioned instance of the word gold and we shall see how hard it be precisely to determine its signification i think all agree to make it stand for a body of a certain yellow shine color which be the idea to which child have annex that name the shine yellow part of a peacock 's tail be properly to they gold other find fusibility join with that yellow color in certain parcel of matter make of that combination a complex idea to which they give the name gold to denote a sort of substance and so exclude from be gold all such yellow shine body as by fire will be reduce to ash and admit to be of that species or to be comprehend under that name gold only such substance as have that shine yellow color will by fire be reduce to fusion and not to ash another by the same reason add the weight which be a quality as straightly join with that color as its fusibility he think have the same reason to be join in its idea and to be signify by its name : and therefore the other make up of body of such a color and fusibility to be imperfect and so on of all the rest : wherein no one can show a reason why some of the inseparable quality that be always unite in nature should be put into the nominal essence and other leave out or why the word gold signify that sort of body the ring on he finger be make of should determine that sort rather by its color weight and fusibility than by its color weight and solubility in aqua regium : since the dissolve it by that liquor be as inseparable from it as the fusion by fire and they be both of they nothing but the relation which that substance have to two other body which have a power to operate differently upon it for by what right be it that fusibility come to be a part of the essence signify by the word gold and solubility but a property of it or why be its color part of the essence and its malleableness but a property that which i mean be this that these be all but property depend on its real constitution and nothing but power either active or passive in reference to other body no one have authority to determine the signification of the word gold -lrb- as refer to such a body exist in nature -rrb- more to one collection of idea to be find in that body than to another : whereby the signification of that name must unavoidably be very uncertain since as have be say several people observe several property in the same substance and i think i may say nobody all and therefore we have but very imperfect description of thing and word have very uncertain signification 18 the name of simple idea the least doubtful from what have be say it be easy to observe what have be before remark viz that the name of simple idea be of all other the least liable to mistake and that for these reason first because the idea they stand for be each but one single perception be much easier get and more clearly retain than the more complex one and therefore be not liable to the uncertainty which usually attend those compounded one of substance and mixed mode in which the precise number of simple idea that make they up be not easily agree so readily keep in mind and secondly because they be never refer to any other essence but barely that perception they immediately signify : which reference be that which render the signification of the name of substance naturally so perplexed and give occasion to so many dispute man that do not perversely use they word or on purpose set themselves to cavil seldom mistake in any language which they be acquaint with the use and signification of the name of simple idea white and sweet yellow and bitter carry a very obvious meaning with they which every one precisely comprehend or easily perceive he be ignorant of and seek to be inform but what precise collection of simple idea modesty or frugality stand for in another 's use be not so certainly know and however we be apt to think we well enough know what be mean by gold or iron yet the precise complex idea other make they the sign of be not so certain : and i believe it be very seldom that in speaker and hearer they stand for exactly the same collection which must need produce mistake and dispute when they be make use of in discourse wherein man have to do with universal proposition and would settle in they mind universal truth and consider the consequence that follow from they 19 and next to they simple mode by the same rule the name of simple mode be next to those of simple idea least liable to doubt and uncertainty especially those of figure and number of which man have so clear and distinct idea who ever that have a mind to understand they mistake the ordinary meaning of seven or a triangle and in general the least compounded idea in every kind have the least dubious name 20 the most doubtful be the name of very compound mixed mode and substance mixed mode therefore that be make up but of a few and obvious simple idea have usually name of no very uncertain signification but the name of mixed mode which comprehend a great number of simple idea be commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined meaning as have be show the name of substance be annex to idea that be neither the real essence nor exact representation of the pattern they be refer to be liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty especially when we come to a philosophical use of they 21 why this imperfection charge upon word the great disorder that happen in we name of substance proceed for the most part from we want of knowledge and inability to penetrate into they real constitution it may probably be wonder why i charge this as a imperfection rather upon we word than understanding this exception have so much appearance of justice that i think myself oblige to give a reason why i have follow this method i must confess then that when i first begin this discourse of the understanding and a good while after i have not the least thought that any consideration of word be at all necessary to it but when have pass over the original and composition of we idea i begin to examine the extent and certainty of we knowledge i find it have so near a connexion with word that unless they force and manner of signification be first well observe there could be very little say clearly and pertinently concern knowledge : which be conversant about truth have constantly to do with proposition and though it terminate in thing yet it be for the most part so much by the intervention of word that they seem scarce separable from we general knowledge at least they interpose themselves so much between we understanding and the truth which it would contemplate and apprehend that like the medium through which visible object pass the obscurity and disorder do not seldom cast a mist before we eye and impose upon we understanding if we consider in the fallacy man put upon themselves as well as other and the mistake in man 's dispute and notion how great a part be owe to word and they uncertain or mistaken signification we shall have reason to think this no small obstacle in the way to knowledge which i conclude we be the more carefully to be warn of because it have be so far from be take notice of as a inconvenience that the art of improve it have be make the business of man 's study and obtain the reputation of learning and subtilty as we shall see in the follow chapter but i be apt to imagine that be the imperfection of language as the instrument of knowledge more thoroughly weigh a great many of the controversy that make such a noise in the world would of themselves cease and the way to knowledge and perhaps peace too lie a great deal opener than it do 22 this should teach we moderation in impose we own sense of old author sure i be that the signification of word in all language depend very much on the thought notion and idea of he that use they must unavoidably be of great uncertainty to man of the same language and country this be so evident in the greek author that he that shall peruse they writings will find in almost every one of they a distinct language though the same word but when to this natural difficulty in every country there shall be add different country and remote age wherein the speaker and writer have very different notion temper custom ornament and figure of speech & c every one of which influence the signification of they word then though to we now they be lose and unknown it would become we to be charitable one to another in we interpretation or misunderstanding of those ancient writings which though of great concernment to be understand be liable to the unavoidable difficulty of speech which -lrb- if we except the name of simple idea and some very obvious thing -rrb- be not capable without a constant define the term of convey the sense and intention of the speaker without any manner of doubt and uncertainty to the hearer and in discourse of religion law and morality as they be matter of the highest concernment so there will be the greatest difficulty 23 especially of the old and new testament scripture the volume of interpreter and commentator on the old and new testament be but too manifest proof of this though everything say in the text be infallibly true yet the reader may be nay can not choose but be very fallible in the understanding of it nor be it to be wonder that the will of god when clothe in word should be liable to that doubt and uncertainty which unavoidably attend that sort of conveyance when even he son whilst clothe in flesh be subject to all the frailty and inconvenience of human nature sin except and we ought to magnify he goodness that he have spread before all the world such legible character of he work and providence and give all mankind so sufficient a light of reason that they to whom this write word never come could not -lrb- whenever they set themselves to search -rrb- either doubt of the being of a god or of the obedience due to he since then the precept of natural religion be plain and very intelligible to all mankind and seldom come to be controvert and other reveal truth which be convey to we by book and language be liable to the common and natural obscurity and difficulty incident to word methink it would become we to be more careful and diligent in observe the former and less magisterial positive and imperious in impose we own sense and interpretation of the latter chapter x of the abuse of word 1 woeful abuse of word besides the imperfection that be naturally in language and the obscurity and confusion that be so hard to be avoid in the use of word there be several wilful fault and neglect which man be guilty of in this way of communication whereby they render these sign less clear and distinct in they signification than naturally they need to be 2 first word be often employ without any or without clear idea first in this kind the first and most palpable abuse be the use of word without clear and distinct idea or which be worse sign without anything signify of these there be two sort : -- i some word introduce without clear idea annex to they even in they first original one may observe in all language certain word that if they be examine will be find in they first original and they appropriate use not to stand for any clear and distinct idea these for the most part the several sect of philosophy and religion have introduce for they author or promoter either affect something singular and out of the way of common apprehension or to support some strange opinion or cover some weakness of they hypothesis seldom fail to coin new word and such as when they come to be examine may justly be call insignificant term for have either have no determinate collection of idea annex to they when they be first invent or at least such as if well examine will be find inconsistent it be no wonder if afterwards in the vulgar use of the same party they remain empty sound with little or no signification amongst those who think it enough to have they often in they mouth as the distinguish character of they church or school without much trouble they head to examine what be the precise idea they stand for i shall not need here to heap up instance every man 's reading and conversation will sufficiently furnish he or if he want to be better store the great mint-master of this kind of term i mean the schoolman and metaphysician -lrb- under which i think the dispute natural and moral philosopher of these latter age may be comprehend -rrb- have wherewithal abundantly to content he 3 ii other word to which idea be annex at first use afterwards without distinct meaning other there be who extend this abuse yet further who take so little care to lay by word which in they primary notation have scarce any clear and distinct idea which they be annex to that by a unpardonable negligence they familiarly use word which the propriety of language have affix to very important idea without any distinct meaning at all wisdom glory grace & c be word frequent enough in every man 's mouth but if a great many of those who use they should be ask what they mean by they they would be at a stand and not know what to answer : a plain proof that though they have learn those sound and have they ready at they tongue end yet there be no determine idea lay up in they mind which be to be express to other by they 4 this occasion by man learn name before they have the idea the name belong to man have be accustom from they cradle to learn word which be easily get and retain before they know or have frame the complex idea to which they be annex or which be to be find in the thing they be think to stand for they usually continue to do so all they life and without take the pain necessary to settle in they mind determine idea they use they word for such unsteady and confused notion as they have content themselves with the same word other people use as if they very sound necessarily carry with it constantly the same meaning this though man make a shift with in the ordinary occurrence of life where they find it necessary to be understand and therefore they make sign till they be so yet this insignificancy in they word when they come to reason concern either they tenet or interest manifestly fill they discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon especially in moral matter where the word for the most part stand for arbitrary and numerous collection of idea not regularly and permanently unite in nature they bare sound be often only think on or at least very obscure and uncertain notion annex to they man take the word they find in use amongst they neighbor and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use they confidently without much trouble they head about a certain fixed meaning whereby besides the ease of it they obtain this advantage that as in such discourse they seldom be in the right so they be as seldom to be convince that they be in the wrong it be all one to go about to draw those man out of they mistake who have no settle notion as to dispossess a vagrant of he habitation who have no settled abode this i guess to be so and every one may observe in himself and other whether it be so or not 5 secondly unsteady application of they secondly another great abuse of word be inconstancy in the use of they it be hard to find a discourse write on any subject especially of controversy wherein one shall not observe if he read with attention the same word -lrb- and those commonly the most material in the discourse and upon which the argument turn -rrb- use sometimes for one collection of simple idea and sometimes for another which be a perfect abuse of language word be intend for sign of my idea to make they know to other not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it be plain cheat and abuse when i make they stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful do whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in he account with another may with as much fairness make the character of number stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of unit : vg this character 3 stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in he discourse or reasoning make the same word stand for different collection of simple idea if man should do so in they reckoning i wonder who would have to do with they one who would speak thus in the affair and business of the world and call 8 sometimes seven and sometimes nine as best serve he advantage would presently have clap upon he one of the two name man be commonly disgust with and yet in arguing and learn contest the same sort of proceedings pass commonly for wit and learning but to I it appear a greater dishonesty than the misplacing of counter in the cast up a debt and the cheat the greater by how much truth be of greater concernment and value than money 6 thirdly affect obscurity as in the peripatetic and other sect of philosophy thirdly another abuse of language be a affected obscurity by either apply old word to new and unusual signification or introduce new and ambiguous term without define either or else put they so together as may confound they ordinary meaning though the peripatetick philosophy have be most eminent in this way yet other sect have not be wholly clear of it there be scarce any of they that be not cumber with some difficulty -lrb- such be the imperfection of human knowledge -rrb- which they have be fain to cover with obscurity of term and to confound the signification of word which like a mist before people 's eye might hinder they weak part from be discover that body and extension in common use stand for two distinct idea be plain to any one that will but reflect a little for be they signification precisely the same it would be as proper and as intelligible to say ` the body of a extension ' as the ` extension of a body ' and yet there be those who find it necessary to confound they signification to this abuse and the mischief of confound the signification of word logic and the liberal science as they have be handle in the school have give reputation and the admire art of dispute have add much to the natural imperfection of language whilst it have be make use of and fit to perplex the signification of word more than to discover the knowledge and truth of thing : and he that will look into that sort of learn writings will find the word there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in they meaning than they be in ordinary conversation 7 logic and dispute have must have contribute to this this be unavoidably to be so where man 's part and learn be estimate by they skill in dispute and if reputation and reward shall attend these conquest which depend mostly on the fineness and nicety of word it be no wonder if the wit of man so employ should perplex involve and subtilize the signification of sound so as never to want something to say in oppose or defend any question the victory be adjudge not to he who have truth on he side but the last word in the dispute 8 call it subtlety this though a very useless skill and that which i think the direct opposite to the way of knowledge have yet pass hitherto under the laudable and esteemed name of subtlety and acuteness and have have the applause of the school and encouragement of one part of the learn man of the world and no wonder since the philosopher of old -lrb- the disputing and wrangle philosopher i mean such as lucian wittily and with reason tax -rrb- and the schoolman since aim at glory and esteem for they great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretend to than really acquire find this a good expedient to cover they ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed word and procure to themselves the admiration of other by unintelligible term the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understand whilst it appear in all history that these profound doctor be no wiser nor more useful than they neighbor and bring but small advantage to human life or the society wherein they live unless the coining of new word where they produce no new thing to apply they to or the perplexing or obscure the signification of old one and so bring all thing into question and dispute be a thing profitable to the life of man or worthy commendation and reward 9 this learning very little benefit society for notwithstanding these learn disputant these all-knowing doctor it be to the unscholastic statesman that the government of the world owe they peace defense and liberty and from the illiterate and contemned mechanic -lrb- a name of disgrace -rrb- that they receive the improvement of useful art nevertheless this artificial ignorance and learn gibberish prevail mightily in these last age by the interest and artifice of those who find no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attain than by amusing the man of business and ignorant with hard word or employ the ingenious and idle in intricate dispute about unintelligible term and hold they perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth besides there be no such way to gain admittance or give defense to strange and absurd doctrine as to guard they round about with legion of obscure doubtful and undefined word which yet make these retreat more like the den of robber or hole of fox than the fortress of fair warrior which if it be hard to get they out of it be not for the strength that be in they but the briar and thorn and the obscurity of the thicket they be beset with for untruth be unacceptable to the mind of man there be no other defense leave for absurdity but obscurity 10 but destroy the instrument of knowledge and communication thus learn ignorance and this art of keep even inquisitive man from true knowledge have be propagate in the world and have much perplexed whilst it pretend to inform the understanding for we see that other well-meaning and wise man whose education and part have not acquire that acuteness could intelligibly express themselves to one another and in its plain use make a benefit of language but though unlearned man well enough understand the word white and black & c and have constant notion of the idea signify by those word yet there be philosopher find who have learning and subtlety enough to prove that snow be black ie to prove that white be black whereby they have the advantage to destroy the instrument and means of discourse conversation instruction and society whilst with great art and subtlety they do no more but perplex and confound the signification of word and thereby render language less useful than the real defect of it have make it a gift which the illiterate have not attain to 11 as useful as to confound the sound that the letter of the alphabet stand for these learn man do equally instruct man 's understanding and profit they life as he who should alter the signification of known character and by a subtle device of learn far surpass the capacity of the illiterate dull and vulgar should in he write show that he could put a for b and d for e & c to the no small admiration and benefit of for he reader it be as senseless to put black which be a word agree on to stand for one sensible idea to put it i say for another or the contrary idea ie to call snow black as to put this mark a which be a character agree on to stand for one modification of sound make by a certain motion of the organ of speech for b which be agree on to stand for another modification of sound make by another certain mode of the organ of speech 12 this art have perplex religion and justice nor have this mischief stop in logical nicety or curious empty speculation it have invade the great concernment of human life and society obscure and perplex the material truth of law and divinity bring confusion disorder and uncertainty into the affair of mankind and if not destroy yet in a great measure render useless these two great rule religion and justice what have the greatest part of the comment and dispute upon the law of god and man serve for but to make the meaning more doubtful and perplex the sense what have be the effect of those multiply curious distinction and acute nicety but obscurity and uncertainty leave the word more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else come it to pass that prince speak or write to they servant in they ordinary command be easily understand speak to they people in they law be not so and as i remark before doth it not often happen that a man of a ordinary capacity very well understand a text or a law that he read till he consult a expositor or go to counsel who by that time he have do explain they make the word signify either nothing at all or what he please 13 and ought not to pass for learn whether any by-interest of these profession have occasion this i will not here examine but i leave it to be consider whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it be to know thing as they be and to do what they ought and not to spend they life in talk about they or toss word to and fro -- whether it would not be well i say that the use of word be make plain and direct and that language which be give we for the improvement of knowledge and bond of society should not be employ to darken truth and unsettle people 's rights to raise mist and render unintelligible both morality and religion or that at least if this will happen it should not be think learn or knowledge to do so 14 iv fourthly by take word for thing fourthly another great abuse of word be the take they for thing this though it in some degree concern all name in general yet more particularly affect those of substance to this abuse those man be most subject who most confine they thought to any one system and give themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any receive hypothesis : whereby they come to be persuade that the term of that sect be so suit to the nature of thing that they perfectly correspond with they real existence who be there that have be breed up in the peripatetick philosophy who do not think the ten name under which be rank the ten predicament to be exactly conformable to the nature of thing who be there of that school that be not persuade that substantial form vegetative soul abhorrence of a vacuum intentional species & c be something real these word man have learn from they very entrance upon knowledge and have find they master and system lay great stress upon they : and therefore they can not quit the opinion that they be conformable to nature and be the representation of something that really exist the platonist have they soul of the world and the epicurean they endeavor towards motion in they atom when at rest there be scarce any sect in philosophy have not a distinct set of term that other understand not but yet this gibberish which in the weakness of human understanding serve so well to palliate man 's ignorance and cover they error come by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe to seem the most important part of language and of all other the term the most significant : and should aerial and oetherial vehicle come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally receive anywhere no doubt those term would make impression on man 's mind so as to establish they in the persuasion of the reality of such thing as much as peripatetick form and intentional species have heretofore do 15 instance in matter how much name take for thing be apt to mislead the understand the attentive reading of philosophical writer would abundantly discover and that perhaps in word little suspect of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate dispute have there be about matter as if there be some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it be evident the word matter stand for a idea distinct from the idea of body for if the idea these two term stand for be precisely the same they might indifferently in all place be put for one another but we see that though it be proper to say there be one matter of all body one can not say there be one body of all matter : we familiarly say one body be bigger than another but it sound harsh -lrb- and i think be never use -rrb- to say one matter be bigger than another whence come this then viz from hence : that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there be the one there be the other yet matter and body stand for two different conception whereof the one be incomplete and but a part of the other for body stand for a solid extended figure substance whereof matter be but a partial and more confused conception it seem to I to be use for the substance and solidity of body without take in its extension and figure : and therefore it be that speaking of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contain nothing but the idea of a solid substance which be everywhere the same everywhere uniform this be we idea of matter we no more conceive or speak of different matter in the world than we do of different solidity though we both conceive and speak of different body because extension and figure be capable of variation but since solidity can not exist without extension and figure the take matter to be the name of something really exist under that precision have no doubt produce those obscure and unintelligible discourse and dispute which have fill the head and book of philosopher concern materia prima which imperfection or abuse how far it may concern a great many other general term i leave to be consider this i think i may at least say that we should have a great many fewer dispute in the world if word be take for what they be the sign of we idea only and not for thing themselves for when we argue about matter or any the like term we truly argue only about the idea we express by that sound whether that precise idea agree to anything really exist in nature or no and if man would tell what idea they make they word stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangle in the search or support of truth that there be 16 this make error last but whatever inconvenience follow from this mistake of word this i be sure that by constant and familiar use they charm man into notion far remote from the truth of thing it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the word which he father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor use signified nothing that really exist in nature : which perhaps be none of the least cause that man be so hardly draw to quit they mistake even in opinion purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the word they have a long time be use to remain firm in they mind it be no wonder that the wrong notion annex to they should not be remove 17 fifthly by set they in the place of what they can not signify v fifthly another abuse of word be the set they in the place of thing which they do or can by no means signify we may observe that in the general name of substance whereof the nominal essence be only know to we when we put they into proposition and affirm or deny anything about they we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substance for when a man say gold be malleable he mean and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold be malleable -lrb- though truly it amount to no more -rrb- but would have this understand viz that gold ie what have the real essence of gold be malleable which amount to thus much that malleableness depend on and be inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not know wherein that real essence consist the connexion in he mind of malleableness be not truly with a essence he know not but only with the sound gold he put for it thus when we say that animal rationale be and animal imflume bipe lati unguibus be not a good definition of a man it be plain we suppose the name man in this case to stand for the real essence of a species and would signify that ' a rational animal ' better describe that real essence than ' a two-legged animal with broad nail and without feather ' for else why might not plato as properly make the word -lrb- word in greek -rrb- or man stand for he complex idea make up of the idea of a body distinguish from other by a certain shape and other outward appearance as aristotle make the complex idea to which he give the name -lrb- word in greek -rrb- or man of body and the faculty of reasoning join together unless the name -lrb- word in greek -rrb- or man be suppose to stand for something else than what it signify and to be put in the place of some other thing than the idea a man profess he would express by it 18 vi put they for the real essence of substance it be true the name of substance would be much more useful and proposition make in they much more certain be the real essence of substance the idea in we mind which those word signify and it be for want of those real essence that we word convey so little knowledge or certainty in we discourse about they and therefore the mind to remove that imperfection as much as it can make they by a secret supposition to stand for a thing have that real essence as if thereby it make some nearer approach to it for though the word man or gold signify nothing truly but a complex idea of property unite together in one sort of substance yet there be scarce anybody in the use of these word but often suppose each of those name to stand for a thing have the real essence on which these property depend which be so far from diminish the imperfection of we word that by a plain abuse it add to it when we would make they stand for something which not be in we complex idea the name we use can no way be the sign of 19 hence we think change of we complex idea of substance not to change they species this show we the reason why in mixed mode any of the idea that make the composition of the complex one be leave out or change it be allow to be another thing ie to be of another species as be plain in chance-medley manslaughter murder parricide & c the reason whereof be because the complex idea signify by that name be the real as well as nominal essence and there be no secret reference of that name to any other essence but that but in substance it be not so for though in that call gold one put into he complex idea what another leave out and vice versa : yet man do not usually think that therefore the species be change : because they secretly in they mind refer that name and suppose it annex to a real immutable essence of a thing exist on which those property depend he that add to he complex idea of gold that of fixedness and solubility in aqua regium which he put not in it before be not think to have change the species but only to have a more perfect idea by add another simple idea which be always in fact join with those other of which he former complex idea consist but this reference of the name to a thing whereof we have not the idea be so far from help at all that it only serve the more to involve we in difficulty for by this tacit reference to the real essence of that species of body the word gold -lrb- which by standing for a more or less perfect collection of simple idea serve to design that sort of body well enough in civil discourse -rrb- come to have no signification at all be put for somewhat whereof we have no idea at all and so can signify nothing at all when the body itself be away for however it may be think all one yet if well consider it will be find a quite different thing to argue about gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leaf-gold lay before we though in discourse we be fain to substitute the name for the thing 20 the cause of this abuse a supposition of nature 's work always regularly in set boundary to species that which i think very much dispose man to substitute they name for the real essence of species be the supposition before mention that nature work regularly in the production of thing and set the boundary to each of those species by give exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas any one who observe they different quality can hardly doubt that many of the individual call by the same name be in they internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which be rank under different specific name this supposition however that the same precise and internal constitution go always with the same specific name make man forward to take those name for the representative of those real essence though indeed they signify nothing but the complex idea they have in they mind when they use they so that if i may so say signify one thing and be suppose for or put in the place of another they can not but in such a kind of use cause a great deal of uncertainty in man 's discourse especially in those who have thoroughly imbibe the doctrine of substantial form whereby they firmly imagine the several species of thing to be determine and distinguish 21 this abuse contain two false supposition but however preposterous and absurd it be to make we name stand for idea we have not or -lrb- which be all one -rrb- essence that we know not it be in effect to make we word the sign of nothing yet it be evident to any one who ever so little reflect on the use man make of they word that there be nothing more familiar when a man ask whether this or that thing he see let it be a drill or a monstrous foetus be a man or no it be evident the question be not whether that particular thing agree to he complex idea express by the name man : but whether it have in it the real essence of a species of thing which he suppose he name man to stand for in which way of use the name of substance there be these false supposition contain : -- first that there be certain precise essence accord to which nature make all particular thing and by which they be distinguish into species that everything have a real constitution whereby it be what it be and on which its sensible quality depend be past doubt : but i think it have be prove that this make not the distinction of species as we rank they nor the boundary of they name secondly this tacitly also insinuate as if we have idea of these propose essence for to what purpose else be it to inquire whether this or that thing have the real essence of the species man if we do not suppose that there be such a specifick essence know which yet be utterly false and therefore such application of name as would make they stand for idea which we have not must need cause great disorder in discourse and reasoning about they and be a great inconvenience in we communication by word 22 vi sixthly by proceed upon the supposition that the word we use have a certain and evident signification which other man can not but understand sixthly there remain yet another more general though perhaps less observe abuse of word and that be that man have by a long and familiar use annex to they certain idea they be apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the name and signification they use they in that they forwardly suppose one can not but understand what they meaning be and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the word deliver as if it be past doubt that in the use of those common receive sound the speaker and hearer have necessarily the same precise idea whence presume that when they have in discourse use any term they have thereby as it be set before other the very thing they talk of and so likewise take the word of other as naturally stand for just what they themselves have be accustom to apply they to they never trouble themselves to explain they own or understand clearly other ' meaning from whence commonly proceed noise and wrangle without improvement or information whilst man take word to be the constant regular mark of agree notion which in truth be no more but the voluntary and unsteady sign of they own idea and yet man think it strange if in discourse or -lrb- where it be often absolutely necessary -rrb- in dispute one sometimes ask the meaning of they term : though the arguing one may every day observe in conversation make it evident that there be few name of complex idea which any two man use for the same just precise collection it be hard to name a word which will not be a clear instance of this life be a term none more familiar any one almost would take it for a affront to be ask what he mean by it and yet if it come in question whether a plant that lie ready form in the seed have life whether the embryo in a egg before incubation or a man in a swoon without sense or motion be alive or no it be easy to perceive that a clear distinct settle idea do not always accompany the use of so know a word as that of life be some gross and confused conception man indeed ordinarily have to which they apply the common word of they language and such a loose use of they word serve they well enough in they ordinary discourse or affair but this be not sufficient for philosophical inquiry knowledge and reasoning require precise determinate idea and though man will not be so importunately dull as not to understand what other say without demand a explication of they term nor so troublesomely critical as to correct other in the use of the word they receive from they : yet where truth and knowledge be concern in the case i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of word whose sense seem dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own he ignorance in what sense another man use he word since he have no other way of certainly know it but by be inform this abuse of take word upon trust have nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effect as amongst man of letter the multiplication and obstinacy of dispute which have so lay waste the intellectual world be owe to nothing more than to this ill use of word for though it be generally believe that there be great diversity of opinion in the volume and variety of controversy the world be distract with yet the most i can find that the contend learn man of different party do in they arguing one with another be that they speak different language for i be apt to imagine that when any of they quit term think upon thing and know what they think they think all the same : though perhaps what they would have be different 23 the end of language : first to convey we idea to conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of language the end of language in we discourse with other be chiefly these three : first to make known one man 's thought or idea to another secondly to do so with as much ease and quickness as possible and thirdly thereby to convey the knowledge of thing : language be either abused or deficient when it fail of any of these three first word fail in the first of these end and lay not open one man 's idea to another 's view : 1 when man have name in they mouth without any determinate idea in they mind whereof they be the sign : or 2 when they apply the common receive name of any language to idea to which the common use of that language do not apply they : or 3 when they apply they very unsteadily make they stand now for one and by and by for another idea 24 secondly to do it with quickness secondly man fail of convey they thought with the quickness and ease that may be when they have complex idea without have any distinct name for they this be sometimes the fault of the language itself which have not in it a sound yet apply to such a signification and sometimes the fault of the man who have not yet learn the name for that idea he would show another 25 thirdly therewith to convey the knowledge of thing thirdly there be no knowledge of thing convey by man 's word when they idea agree not to the reality of thing though it be a defect that have its original in we idea which be not so conformable to the nature of thing as attention study and application might make they yet it fail not to extend itself to we word too when we use they as sign of real being which yet never have any reality or existence 26 how man 's word fail in all these : first when use without any idea first he that have word of any language without distinct idea in he mind to which he apply they do so far as he use they in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learn soever he may seem by the use of hard word or learn term be not much more advanced thereby in knowledge than he would be in learning who have nothing in he study but the bare title of book without possess the contents of they for all such word however put into discourse accord to the right construction of grammatical rule or the harmony of well-turned period do yet amount to nothing but bare sound and nothing else 27 secondly when complex idea be without name annex to they secondly he that have complex idea without particular name for they would be in no better case than a bookseller who have in he warehouse volume that lay there unbound and without title which he could therefore make know to other only by show the loose sheet and communicate they only by tale this man be hinder in he discourse for want of word to communicate he complex idea which he be therefore force to make know by a enumeration of the simple one that compose they and so be fain often to use twenty word to express what another man signify in one 28 thirdly when the same sign be not put for the same idea thirdly he that put not constantly the same sign for the same idea but use the same word sometimes in one and sometimes in another signification ought to pass in the school and conversation for as fair a man as he do in the market and exchange who sell several thing under the same name 29 fourthly when word be divert from they common use fourthly he that apply the word of any language to idea different from those to which the common use of that country apply they however he own understanding may be fill with truth and light will not by such word be able to convey much of it to other without define he term for however the sound be such as be familiarly know and easily enter the ear of those who be accustom to they yet stand for other idea than those they usually be annex to and be wont to excite in the mind of the hearer they can not make know the thought of he who thus use they 30 fifthly when they be name of fantastical imagination fifthly he that imagine to himself substance such as never have be and fill he head with idea which have not any correspondence with the real nature of thing to which yet he give settle and define name may fill he discourse and perhaps another man 's head with the fantastical imagination of he own brain but will be very far from advance thereby one jot in real and true knowledge 31 summary he that have name without idea want meaning in he word and speak only empty sound he that have complex idea without name for they want liberty and dispatch in he expression and be necessitate to use periphrase he that use he word loosely and unsteadily will either be not mind or not understand he that apply he name to idea different from they common use want propriety in he language and speak gibberish and he that have the idea of substance disagree with the real existence of thing so far want the material of true knowledge in he understanding and have instead thereof chimera 32 how man 's word fail when they stand for substance in we notion concern substance we be liable to all the former inconvenience : v g he that use the word tarantula without have any imagination or idea of what it stand for pronounce a good word but so long means nothing at all by it 2 he that in a newly-discovered country shall see several sort of animal and vegetable unknown to he before may have as true idea of they as of a horse or a stag but can speak of they only by a description till he shall either take the name the native call they by or give they name himself 3 he that use the word body sometimes for pure extension and sometimes for extension and solidity together will talk very fallaciously 4 he that give the name horse to that idea which common usage call mule talk improperly and will not be understand 5 he that think the name centaur stand for some real be impose on himself and mistake word for thing 33 how when they stand for mode and relation in mode and relation generally we be liable only to the four first of these inconvenience viz 1 i may have in my memory the name of mode as gratitude or charity and yet not have any precise idea annex in my thought to those name 2 i may have idea and not know the name that belong to they : v g i may have the idea of a man 's drinking till he color and humor be alter till he tongue trip and he eye look red and he foot fail he and yet not know that it be to be call drunkenness 3 i may have the idea of virtue or vice and name also but apply they amiss : v g when i apply the name frugality to that idea which other call and signify by this sound covetousness 4 i may use any of those name with inconstancy 5 but in mode and relation i can not have idea disagree to the existence of thing : for mode be complex idea make by the mind at pleasure and relation being but by way of consider or compare two thing together and so also a idea of my own make these idea can scarce be find to disagree with anything exist since they be not in the mind as the copy of thing regularly make by nature nor as property inseparably flow from the internal constitution or essence of any substance but as it be pattern lodge in my memory with name annex to they to denominate action and relation by as they come to exist but the mistake be commonly in my give a wrong name to my conception and so use word in a different sense from other people : i be not understand but be think to have wrong idea of they when i give wrong name to they only if i put in my idea of mixed mode or relation any inconsistent idea together i fill my head also with chimera since such idea if well examine can not so much as exist in the mind much less any real be ever be denominate from they 34 seventhly language be often abuse by figurative speech since wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world than dry truth and real knowledge figurative speech and allusion in language will hardly be admit as a imperfection or abuse of it i confess in discourse where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information and improvement such ornament as be borrow from they can scarce pass for fault but yet if we would speak of thing as they be we must allow that all the art of rhetoric besides order and clearness all the artificial and figurative application of word eloquence have invent be for nothing else but to insinuate wrong idea move the passion and thereby mislead the judgment and so indeed be perfect cheat : and therefore however laudable or allowable oratory may render they in harangue and popular address they be certainly in all discourse that pretend to inform or instruct wholly to be avoid and where truth and knowledge be concern can not but be think a great fault either of the language or person that make use of they what and how various they be will be superfluous here to take notice the book of rhetoric which abound in the world will instruct those who want to be inform : only i can not but observe how little the preservation and improvement of truth and knowledge be the care and concern of mankind since the art of fallacy be endowed and preferred it be evident how much man love to deceive and be deceive since rhetoric that powerful instrument of error and deceit have its established professor be publicly teach and have always be have in great reputation : and i doubt not but it will be think great boldness if not brutality in I to have say thus much against it eloquence like the fair sex have too prevailing beauty in it to suffer itself ever to be speak against and it be in vain to find fault with those art of deceive wherein man find pleasure to be deceive chapter xi of the remedy of the foregoing imperfection and abuse of word 1 remedy be worth seek the natural and improved imperfection of language we have see above at large : and speech be the great bond that hold society together and the common conduit whereby the improvement of knowledge be convey from one man and one generation to another it would well deserve we most serious thought to consider what remedy be to be find for the inconvenience above mention 2 be not easy to find i be not so vain as to think that any one can pretend to attempt the perfect reform the language of the world no not so much as of he own country without render himself ridiculous to require that man should use they word constantly in the same sense and for none but determine and uniform idea would be to think that all man should have the same notion and should talk of nothing but what they have clear and distinct idea of : which be not to be expect by any one who have not vanity enough to imagine he can prevail with man to be very know or very silent and he must be very little skilled in the world who think that a voluble tongue shall accompany only a good understanding or that man 's talk much or little should hold proportion only to they knowledge 3 but yet necessary to those who search after truth but though the market and exchange must be leave to they own way of talk and gossiping not be rob of they ancient privilege : though the school and man of argument would perhaps take it amiss to have anything offer to abate the length or lessen the number of they dispute yet methink those who pretend seriously to search after or maintain truth should think themselves oblige to study how they might deliver themselves without obscurity doubtfulness or equivocation to which man 's word be naturally liable if care be not take 4 misuse of word the great cause of error for he that shall well consider the error and obscurity the mistake and confusion that be spread in the world by a ill use of word will find some reason to doubt whether language as it have be employ have contribute more to the improvement or hindrance of knowledge amongst mankind how many be there that when they would think on thing fix they thought only on word especially when they would apply they mind to moral matter and who then can wonder if the result of such contemplation and reasoning about little more than sound whilst the idea they annex to they be very confused and very unsteady or perhaps none at all who can wonder i say that such thought and reasoning end in nothing but obscurity and mistake without any clear judgment or knowledge 5 have make man more conceited and obstinate this inconvenience in a ill use of word man suffer in they own private meditation : but much more manifest be the disorder which follow from it in conversation discourse and arguing with other for language be the great conduit whereby man convey they discovery reasoning and knowledge from one to another he that make a ill use of it though he do not corrupt the fountain of knowledge which be in thing themselves yet he do as much as in he lie break or stop the pipe whereby it be distribute to the public use and advantage of mankind he that use word without any clear and steady meaning what do he but lead himself and other into error and he that designedly do it ought to be look on as a enemy to truth and knowledge and yet who can wonder that all the science and part of knowledge have be so overcharge with obscure and equivocal term and insignificant and doubtful expression capable to make the most attentive or quick-sighted very little or not at all the more know or orthodox : since subtlety in those who make profession to teach or defend truth have pass so much for a virtue : a virtue indeed which consist for the most part in nothing but the fallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful term be only fit to make man more conceit in they ignorance and more obstinate in they error 6 addict to wrangle about sound let we look into the book of controversy of any kind there we shall see that the effect of obscure unsteady or equivocal term be nothing but noise and wrangle about sound without convincing or better a man 's understanding for if the idea be not agree on betwixt the speaker and hearer for which the word stand the argument be not about thing but name as often as such a word whose signification be not ascertain betwixt they come in use they understanding have no other object wherein they agree but barely the sound the thing that they think on at that time as express by that word be quite different 7 instance bat and bird whether a bat be a bird or no be not a question whether a bat be another thing than indeed it be or have other quality than indeed it have for that would be extremely absurd to doubt of but the question be -lrb- i -rrb- either between those that acknowledge themselves to have but imperfect idea of one or both of this sort of thing for which these name be suppose to stand and then it be a real inquiry concern the nature of a bird or a bat to make they yet imperfect idea of it more complete by examine whether all the simple idea to which combine together they both give name bird be all to be find in a bat : but this be a question only of inquirer -lrb- not disputer -rrb- who neither affirm nor deny but examine : or -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be a question between disputant whereof the one affirm and the other deny that a bat be a bird and then the question be barely about the signification of one or both these word in that they not have both the same complex idea to which they give these two name one hold and the other deny that these two name may be affirm one of another be they agree in the signification of these two name it be impossible they should dispute about they for they would presently and clearly see -lrb- be that adjust between they -rrb- whether all the simple idea of the more general name bird be find in the complex idea of a bat or no and so there could be no doubt whether a bat be a bird or no and here i desire it may be consider and carefully examine whether the greatest part of the dispute in the world be not merely verbal and about the signification of word and whether if the term they be make in be define and reduce in they signification -lrb- as they must be where they signify anything -rrb- to determine collection of the simple idea they do or should stand for those dispute would not end of themselves and immediately vanish i leave it then to be consider what the learning of disputation be and how well they be employ for the advantage of themselves or other whose business be only the vain ostentation of sound i e those who spend they life in dispute and controversy when i shall see any of those combatant strip all he term of ambiguity and obscurity -lrb- which every one may do in the word he use himself -rrb- i shall think he a champion for knowledge truth and peace and not the slave of vain-glory ambition or a party 8 remedy to remedy the defect of speech before mention to some degree and to prevent the inconvenience that follow from they i imagine the observation of these follow rule may be of use till somebody better able shall judge it worth he while to think more maturely on this matter and oblige the world with he thought on it first remedy : to use no word without a idea annex to it first a man shall take care to use no word without a signification no name without a idea for which he make it stand this rule will not seem altogether needless to any one who shall take the pain to recollect how often he have meet with such word as instinct sympathy and antipathy & c in the discourse of other so make use of as he might easily conclude that those that use they have no idea in they mind to which they apply they but speak they only as sound which usually serve instead of reason on the like occasion not but that these word and the like have very proper signification in which they may be use but there be no natural connexion between any word and any idea these and any other may be learn by rote and pronounce or writ by man who have no idea in they mind to which they have annex they and for which they make they stand which be necessary they should if man would speak intelligibly even to themselves alone 9 second remedy : to have distinct determinate idea annex to word especially in mixed mode secondly it be not enough a man use he word as sign of some idea : those he annex they to if they be simple must be clear and distinct if complex must be determinate ie the precise collection of simple idea settle in the mind with that sound annex to it as the sign of that precise determine collection and no other this be very necessary in name of mode and especially moral word which have no settle object in nature from whence they idea be take as from they original be apt to be very confused justice be a word in every man 's mouth but most commonly with a very undetermined loose signification which will always be so unless a man have in he mind a distinct comprehension of the component part that complex idea consist of and if it be decompound must be able to resolve it still only till he at last come to the simple idea that make it up : and unless this be do a man make a ill use of the word let it be justice for example or any other i do not say a man need stand to recollect and make this analysis at large every time the word justice come in he way : but this at least be necessary that he have so examine the signification of that name and settle the idea of all its part in he mind that he can do it when he please if any one who make he complex idea of justice to be such a treatment of the person or goods of another as be accord to law have not a clear and distinct idea what law be which make a part of he complex idea of justice it be plain he idea of justice itself will be confuse and imperfect this exactness will perhaps be judge very troublesome and therefore most man will think they may be excuse from settle the complex idea of mixed mode so precisely in they mind but yet i must say till this be do it must not be wonder that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion in they own mind and a great deal of wrangle in they discourse with other 10 and distinct and conformable idea in word that stand for substance in the name of substance for a right use of they something more be require than barely determine idea in these the name must also be conformable to thing as they exist but of this i shall have occasion to speak more at large by and by this exactness be absolutely necessary in inquiry after philosophical knowledge and in controversy about truth and though it would be well too if it extend itself to common conversation and the ordinary affair of life yet i think that be scarce to be expect vulgar notion suit vulgar discourse : and both though confuse enough yet serve pretty well the market and the wake merchant and lover cook and tailor have word wherewithal to dispatch they ordinary affair : and so i think might philosopher and disputant too if they have a mind to understand and to clearly understand 11 third remedy : to apply word to such idea as common use have annex they to thirdly it be not enough that man have idea determine idea for which they make these sign stand but they must also take care to apply they word as near as may be to such idea as common use have annex they to for word especially of language already frame be no man 's private possession but the common measure of commerce and communication it be not for any one at pleasure to change the stamp they be current in nor alter the idea they be affix to or at least when there be a necessity to do so he be bind to give notice of it man 's intention in speak be or at least should be to be understand which can not be without frequent explanation demand and other the like incommodious interruption where man do not follow common use propriety of speech be that which give we thought entrance into other man 's mind with the greatest ease and advantage : and therefore deserve some part of we care and study especially in the name of moral word the proper signification and use of term be best to be learn from those who in they writings and discourse appear to have have the clearest notion and apply to they they term with the exactest choice and fitness this way of use a man 's word accord to the propriety of the language though it have not always the good fortune to be understand yet most commonly leave the blame of it on he who be so unskilful in the language he speak as not to understand it when make use of as it ought to be 12 fourth remedy : to declare the meaning in which we use they fourthly but because common use have not so visibly annex any signification to word as to make man know always certainly what they precisely stand for : and because man in the improvement of they knowledge come to have idea different from the vulgar and ordinary receive one for which they must either make new word -lrb- which man seldom venture to do for fear of be think guilty of affectation or novelty -rrb- or else must use old one in a new signification : therefore after the observation of the foregoing rule it be sometimes necessary for the ascertain the signification of word to declare they meaning where either common use have leave it uncertain and loose -lrb- as it have in most name of very complex idea -rrb- or where the term be very material in the discourse and that upon which it chiefly turn be liable to any doubtfulness or mistake 13 and that in three way as the idea man 's word stand for be of different sort so the way of make know the idea they stand for when there be occasion be also different for though define be think the proper way to make know the proper signification of word yet there be some word that will not be define as there be other whose precise meaning can not be make known but by definition : and perhaps a third which partake somewhat of both the other as we shall see in the name of simple idea mode and substance 14 in simple idea either by synonymous term or by show example i first when a man make use of the name of any simple idea which he perceive be not understand or be in danger to be mistaken he be oblige by the law of ingenuity and the end of speech to declare he meaning and make know what idea he make it stand for this as have be show can not be do by definition : and therefore when a synonymous word fail to do it there be but one of these way leave first sometimes the name the subject wherein that simple idea be to be find will make its name to be understand by those who be acquaint with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte color signify it may suffice to tell he it be the color of withered leaf fall in autumn secondly but the only sure way of make know the signification of the name of any simple idea be by present to he sens that subject which may produce it in he mind and make he actually have the idea that word stand for 15 in mixed mode by definition ii secondly mixed mode especially those belong to morality be most of they such combination of idea as the mind put together of its own choice and whereof there be not always stand pattern to be find exist the signification of they name can not be make know as those of simple idea by any showing : but in recompense thereof may be perfectly and exactly define for they be combination of several idea that the mind of man have arbitrarily put together without reference to any archetype man may if they please exactly know the idea that go to each composition and so both use these word in a certain and undoubted signification and perfectly declare when there be occasion what they stand for this if well consider would lay great blame on those who make not they discourse about moral thing very clear and distinct for since the precise signification of the name of mixed mode or which be all one the real essence of each species be to be know they be not of nature 's but man 's make it be a great negligence and perverseness to discourse of moral thing with uncertainty and obscurity which be more pardonable in treat of natural substance where doubtful term be hardly to be avoid for a quite contrary reason as we shall see by and by 16 morality capable of demonstration upon this ground it be that i be bold to think that morality be capable of demonstration as well as mathematics : since the precise real essence of the thing moral word stand for may be perfectly know and so the congruity and incongruity of the thing themselves be certainly discover in which consist perfect knowledge nor let any one object that the name of substance be often to be make use of in morality as well as those of mode from which will arise obscurity for as to substance when concern in moral discourse they diver nature be not so much inquire into as suppose : vg when we say that man be subject to law we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational creature : what the real essence or other quality of that creature be in this case be no way consider and therefore whether a child or changele be a man in a physical sense may amongst the naturalist be as disputable as it will it concern not at all the moral man as i may call he which be this immovable unchangeable idea a corporeal rational be for be there a monkey or any other creature to be find that have the use of reason to such a degree as to be able to understand general sign and to deduce consequence about general idea he would no doubt be subject to law and in that sense be a man how much soever he differ in shape from other of that name the name of substance if they be use in they as they should can no more disturb moral than they do mathematical discourse where if the mathematician speak of a cube or globe of gold or of any other body he have he clear settle idea which vary not though it may by mistake be apply to a particular body to which it belong not 17 definition can make moral discourse clear this i have here mention by the by to show of what consequence it be for man in they name of mixed mode and consequently in all they moral discourse to define they word when there be occasion : since thereby moral knowledge may be bring to so great clearness and certainty and it must be great want of ingenuousness -lrb- to say no worse of it -rrb- to refuse to do it : since a definition be the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral word can be know and yet a way whereby they meaning may be know certainly and without leave any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind can not be excuse if they discourse in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy : since they be about idea in the mind which be none of they false or disproportionate they have no external being for the archetype which they be refer to and must correspond with it be far easier for man to frame in they mind a idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so make all action that agree shall pass under that denomination than have see aristide to frame a idea that shall in all thing be exactly like he who be as he be let man make what idea they please of he for the one they need but know the combination of idea that be put together in they own mind for the other they must inquire into the whole nature and abstruse hidden constitution and various quality of a thing exist without they 18 and be the only way in which the meaning of mixed mode can be make known another reason that make the define of mixed mode so necessary especially of moral word be what i mention a little before viz that it be the only way whereby the signification of the most of they can be know with certainty for the idea they stand for be for the most part such whose component part nowhere exist together but scatter and mingle with other it be the mind alone that collect they and give they the union of one idea : and it be only by word enumerate the several simple idea which the mind have unite that we can make know to other what they name stand for the assistance of the sens in this case not help we by the proposal of sensible object to show the idea which we name of this kind stand for as it do often in the name of sensible simple idea and also to some degree in those of substance 19 in substance both by show and by define iii thirdly for the explain the signification of the name of substance as they stand for the idea we have of they distinct species both the foremention way viz of show and define be requisite in many case to be make use of for there be ordinarily in each sort some lead quality to which we suppose the other idea which make up we complex idea of that species annex we forwardly give the specific name to that thing wherein that characteristic mark be find which we take to be the most distinguishing idea of that species these lead or characteristical -lrb- as i may call they -rrb- idea in the sort of animal and vegetable be -lrb- as have be before remark ch vi section 29 and ch ix section 15 -rrb- mostly figure and in inanimate body color and in some both together now 20 idea of the lead quality of substance be best get by show these lead sensible quality be those which make the chief ingredient of we specific idea and consequently the most observable and invariable part in the definition of we specific name as attribute to sort of substance come under we knowledge for though the sound man in its own nature be as apt to signify a complex idea make up of animality and rationality unite in the same subject as to signify any other combination yet use as a mark to stand for a sort of creature we count of we own kind perhaps the outward shape be as necessary to be take into we complex idea signify by the word man as any other we find in it : and therefore why plato 's animal implume bipe lati unguibus should not be a good definition of the name man standing for that sort of creature will not be easy to show : for it be the shape as the lead quality that seem more to determine that species than a faculty of reasoning which appear not at first and in some never and if this be not allow to be so i do not know how they can be excuse from murder who kill monstrous birth -lrb- as we call they -rrb- because of a unordinary shape without know whether they have a rational soul or no which can be no more discern in a well-formed than ill-shaped infant as soon as bear and who be it have inform we that a rational soul can inhabit no tenement unless it have just such a sort of frontispiece or can join itself to and inform no sort of body but one that be just of such a outward structure 21 and can hardly be make known otherwise now these lead quality be best make know by show and can hardly be make known otherwise for the shape of a horse or cassowary will be but rudely and imperfectly imprint on the mind by word the sight of the animal doth it a thousand time better and the idea of the particular color of gold be not to be get by any description of it but only by the frequent exercise of the eye about as be evident in those who be use to this metal who frequently distinguish true from counterfeit pure from adulterate by the sight where other -lrb- who have as good eye but yet by use have not get the precise nice idea of that peculiar yellow -rrb- shall not perceive any difference the like may be say of those other simple idea peculiar in they kind to any substance for which precise idea there be no peculiar name the particular ringing sound there be in gold distinct from the sound of other body have no particular name annex to it no more than the particular yellow that belong to that metal 22 the idea of the power of substance be best know by definition but because many of the simple idea that make up we specific idea of substance be power which lie not obvious to we sens in the thing as they ordinarily appear therefore in the signification of we name of substance some part of the signification will be better make know by enumerate those simple idea than by show the substance itself for he that to the yellow shine color of gold get by sight shall from my enumerate they have the idea of great ductility fusibility fixedness and solubility in aqua regium will have a perfecter idea of gold than he can have by see a piece of gold and thereby imprint in he mind only its obvious quality but if the formal constitution of this shine heavy ductile thing -lrb- from whence all these its property flow -rrb- lay open to we sens as the formal constitution or essence of a triangle do the signification of the word gold might as easily be ascertain as that of triangle 23 a reflection on the knowledge of corporeal thing possess by spirit separate from body hence we may take notice how much the foundation of all we knowledge of corporeal thing lie in we sens for how spirit separate from body -lrb- whose knowledge and idea of these thing be certainly much more perfect than ours -rrb- know they we have no notion no idea at all the whole extent of we knowledge or imagination reach not beyond we own idea limit to we way of perception though yet it be not to be doubt that spirit of a higher rank than those immerse in flesh may have as clear idea of the radical constitution of substance as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all they property and operation flow from thence : but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceed we conception 24 idea of substance must also be conformable to thing fourthly but though definition will serve to explain the name of substance as they stand for we idea yet they leave they not without great imperfection as they stand for thing for we name of substance be not put barely for we idea but be make use of ultimately to represent thing and so be put in they place they signification must agree with the truth of thing as well as with man 's idea and therefore in substance we be not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly receive as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature and property of the thing themselves and thereby perfect as much as we can we idea of they distinct species or else learn they from such as be use to that sort of thing and be experience in they for since it be intend they name should stand for such collection of simple idea as do really exist in thing themselves as well as for the complex idea in other man 's mind which in they ordinary acceptation they stand for therefore to define they name right natural history be to be inquire into and they property be with care and examination to be find out for it be not enough for the avoid inconvenience in discourse and arguing about natural body and substantial thing to have learn from the propriety of the language the common but confused or very imperfect idea to which each word be apply and to keep they to that idea in we use of they but we must by acquaint ourselves with the history of that sort of thing rectify and settle we complex idea belong to each specific name and in discourse with other -lrb- if we find they mistake we -rrb- we ought to tell what the complex idea be that we make such a name stand for this be the more necessary to be do by all those who search after knowledge and philosophical verity in that child be teach word whilst they have but imperfect notion of thing apply they at random and without much thinking and seldom frame determine idea to be signify by they which custom -lrb- it be easy and serve well enough for the ordinary affair of life and conversation -rrb- they be apt to continue when they be man : and so begin at the wrong end learn word first and perfectly but make the notion to which they apply those word afterwards very overtly by this mean it come to pass that man speak the language of they country ie accord to grammar rule of that language do yet speak very improperly of thing themselves and by they argue one with another make but small progress in the discovery of useful truth and the knowledge of thing as they be to be find in themselves and not in we imagination and it matter not much for the improvement of we knowledge how they be call 25 not easy to be make so it be therefore to be wish that man verse in physical inquiry and acquaint with the several sort of natural body would set down those simple idea wherein they observe the individual of each sort constantly to agree this would remedy a great deal of that confusion which come from several person apply the same name to a collection of a smaller or greater number of sensible quality proportionably as they have be more or less acquaint with or accurate in examine the quality of any sort of thing which come under one denomination but a dictionary of this sort contain as it be a natural history require too many hand as well as too much time cost pain and sagacity ever to be hope for and till that be do we must content ourselves with such definition of the name of substance as explain the sense man use they in and it would be well where there be occasion if they would afford we so much this yet be not usually do but man talk to one another and dispute in word whose meaning be not agree between they out of a mistake that the signification of common word be certainly establish and the precise idea they stand for perfectly know and that it be a shame to be ignorant of they both which supposition be false no name of complex idea have so settled determine signification that they be constantly use for the same precise idea nor be it a shame for a man to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary way of attain it and so it be no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stand for in another man 's mind without he declare it to I by some other way than barely use that sound there be no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language bring man to a agreement in the signification of common word within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation : and so a man can not be suppose wholly ignorant of the idea which be annex to word by common use in a language familiar to he but common use be but a very uncertain rule which reduce itself at last to the idea of particular man prove often but a very variable standard but though such a dictionary as i have above mention will require too much time cost and pain to be hope for in this age yet methink it be not unreasonable to propose that word stand for thing which be know and distinguish by they outward shape should be express by little draught and print make of they a vocabulary make after this fashion would perhaps with more ease and in less time teach the true signification of many term especially in language of remote country or age and settle truer idea in man 's mind of several thing whereof we read the name in ancient author than all the large and laborious comment of learn critic naturalist that treat of plant and animal have find the benefit of this way : and he that have have occasion to consult they will have reason to confess that he have a clearer idea of apium or ibex from a little print of that herb or beast than he could have from a long definition of the name of either of they and so no doubt he would have of strigil and sistrum if instead of currycomb and cymbal -lrb- which be the english name dictionary render they by -rrb- he could see stamped in the margin small picture of these instrument as they be in use amongst the ancient toga tunica pallium be word easily translate by gown coat and cloak but we have thereby no more true idea of the fashion of those habit amongst the roman than we have of the face of the tailor who make they such thing as these which the eye distinguish by they shape would be best let into the mind by draught make of they and more determine the signification of such word than any other word set for they or make use of to define they but this be only by the bye 26 v fifth remedy : to use the same word constantly in the same sense fifthly if man will not be at the pain to declare the meaning of they word and definition of they term be not to be have yet this be the least that can be expect that in all discourse wherein one man pretend to instruct or convince another he should use the same word constantly in the same sense if this be do -lrb- which nobody can refuse without great disingenuity -rrb- many of the book extant might be spare many of the controversy in dispute would be at a end several of those great volume swollen with ambiguous word now use in one sense and by and by in another would shrink into a very narrow compass and many of the philosopher -lrb- to mention no other -rrb- as well as poet work might be contain in a nutshell 27 when not so use the variation be to be explain but after all the provision of word be so scanty in respect to that infinite variety of thought that man want term to suit they precise notion will notwithstanding they utmost caution be force often to use the same word in somewhat different sens and though in the continuation of a discourse or the pursuit of a argument there can be hardly room to digress into a particular definition as often as a man vary the signification of any term yet the import of the discourse will for the most part if there be no design fallacy sufficiently lead candid and intelligent reader into the true meaning of it but where there be not sufficient to guide the reader there it concern the writer to explain he meaning and show in what sense he there use that term book iv of knowledge and probability synopsis of the fourth book locke 's review of the different sort of idea or appearance of what exist that can be entertain in a human understanding and of they relation to word lead in the fourth book to a investigation of the extent and validity of the knowledge that we idea bring within we reach and into the nature of faith in probability by which assent be extend beyond knowledge for the conduct of life he find -lrb- ch i ii -rrb- that knowledge be either a intuitive a demonstrative or a sensuous perception of absolute certainty in regard to one or other of four sort of agreement or disagreement on the part of idea : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- of each idea with itself as identical and different from every other -lrb- 2 -rrb- in they abstract relation to one another -lrb- 3 -rrb- in they necessary connexion as quality and power coexist in concrete substance and -lrb- 4 -rrb- as revelation to we of the final reality of existence the unconditional certainty that constitute knowledge be perceptible by man only in regard to the first second and fourth of these four sort : in all general proposition only in regard to the first and second that be to say in identical proposition and in those which express abstract relation of simple or mixed mode in which nominal and real essence coincide e g proposition in pure mathematics and abstract morality -lrb- chh iii v-viii -rrb- the fourth sort which express certainty as to reality of existence refer to any of three reality for every man be able to perceive with absolute certainty that he himself exist that god must exist and that finite being other than himself exist -- the first of these perception be awaken by all we idea the second as the consequence of perception of the first and the last in the reception of we simple idea of sense -lrb- chh i section 7 ii section 14 iii section 21 iv ix-xi -rrb- agreement of the third sort of necessary coexistence of simple idea as quality and power in particular substance with which all physical inquiry be concerned lie beyond human knowledge for here the nominal and real essence be not coincident : general proposition of this sort be determine by analogy of experience in judgment that be more or less probable : intellectually necessary science of nature presuppose omniscience man 's interpretation of nature have to turn upon presumption of probability -lrb- chh iii section 9-17 iv section 11-17 vi xiv-xvi -rrb- in form they stock of certainty and probability man employ the faculty of reason faith in divine revelation

about we idea only since the mind in all its thought and reasoning have no other immediate object but its own idea which it alone do or can contemplate it be evident that we knowledge be only conversant about they 2 knowledge be the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two idea knowledge then seem to I to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and agreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of we idea in this alone it consist where this perception be there be knowledge and where it be not there though we may fancy guess or believe yet we always come short of knowledge for when we know that white be not black what do we else but perceive that these two idea do not agree when we possess ourselves with the utmost security of the demonstration that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one what do we more but perceive that equality to two right one do necessarily agree to and be inseparable from the three angle of a triangle 3 this agreement or disagreement may be any of four sort but to understand a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement consist i think we may reduce it all to these four sort : i identity or diversity ii relation iii co-existence or necessary connexion iv real existence 4 first of identity or diversity in idea first as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement viz identity or diversity it be the first act of the mind when it have any sentiment or idea at all to perceive its idea and so far as it perceive they to know each what it be and thereby also to perceive they difference and that one be not another this be so absolutely necessary that without it there could be no knowledge no reasoning no imagination no distinct thought at all by this the mind clearly and infallibly perceive each idea to agree with itself and to be what it be and all distinct idea to disagree i e the one not to be the other : and this it do without pain labor or deduction but at first view by its natural power of perception and distinction and though man of art have reduce this into those general rule what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be for ready application in all case wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it : yet it be certain that the first exercise of this faculty be about particular idea a man infallibly know as soon as ever he have they in he mind that the idea he call white and round be the very idea they be and that they be not other idea which he call red or square nor can any maxim or proposition in the world make he know it clearer or surer than he do before and without any such general rule this then be the first agreement or disagreement which the mind perceive in its idea which it always perceive at first sight : and if there ever happen any doubt about it it will always be find to be about the name and not the idea themselves whose identity and diversity will always be perceive as soon and clearly as the idea themselves be nor can it possibly be otherwise 5 secondly of abstract relation between idea secondly the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceive in any of its idea may i think be call relative and be nothing but the perception of the relation between any two idea of what kind soever whether substance mode or any other for since all distinct idea must eternally be know not to be the same and so be universally and constantly deny one of another there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all if we could not perceive any relation between we idea and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with another in several way the mind take of compare they 6 thirdly of they necessary co-existence in substance thirdly the third sort of agreement or disagreement to be find in we idea which the perception of the mind be employ about be co-existence or non-co-existence in the same subject and this belong particularly to substance thus when we pronounce concern gold that it be fix we knowledge of this truth amount to no more but this that fixedness or a power to remain in the fire unconsumed be a idea that always accompany and be join with that particular sort of yellowness weight fusibility malleableness and solubility in aqua regium which make we complex idea signify by the word gold 7 fourthly of real existence agree to any idea fourthly the fourth and last sort be that of actual real existence agree to any idea within these four sort of agreement or disagreement be i suppose contain all the knowledge we have or be capable of for all the inquiry we can make concern any of we idea all that we know or can affirm concern any of they be that it be or be not the same with some other that it do or do not always co-exist with some other idea in the same subject that it have this or that relation with some other idea or that it have a real existence without the mind thus ` blue be not yellow ' be of identity ` two triangle upon equal basis between two parallel be equal ' be of relation ` iron be susceptible of magnetical impression ' be of co-existence ` god be ' be of real existence though identity and co-existence be truly nothing but relation yet they be such peculiar way of agreement or disagreement of we idea that they deserve well to be consider as distinct head and not under relation in general since they be so different grounds of affirmation and negation as will easily appear to any one who will but reflect on what be say in several place of this essay i should now proceed to examine the several degree of we knowledge but that it be necessary first to consider the different acceptation of the word knowledge 8 knowledge be either actual or habitual there be several way wherein the mind be possess of truth each of which be call knowledge i there be actual knowledge which be the present view the mind have of the agreement or disagreement of any of its idea or of the relation they have one to another ii a man be say to know any proposition which have be once lay before he thought he evidently perceive the agreement or disagreement of the idea whereof it consist and so lodge it in he memory that whenever that proposition come again to be reflect on he without doubt or hesitation embrace the right side assent to and be certain of the truth of it this i think one may call habitual knowledge and thus a man may be say to know all those truth which be lodge in he memory by a foregoing clear and full perception whereof the mind be assure past doubt as often as it have occasion to reflect on they for we finite understanding be able to think clearly and distinctly but on one thing at once if man have no knowledge of any more than what they actually think on they would all be very ignorant : and he that know most would know but one truth that be all he be able to think on at one time 9 habitual knowledge be of two degree of habitual knowledge there be also vulgarly speak two degree : first the one be of such truth lay up in the memory as whenever they occur to the mind it actually perceive the relation be between those idea and this be in all those truth whereof we have a intuitive knowledge where the idea themselves by a immediate view discover they agreement or disagreement one with another secondly the other be of such truth whereof the mind have be convince it retain the memory of the conviction without the proof thus a man that remember certainly that he once perceive the demonstration that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one be certain that he know it because he can not doubt the truth of it in he adherence to a truth where the demonstration by which it be at first know be forget though a man may be think rather to believe he memory than really to know and this way of entertain a truth seem formerly to I like something between opinion and knowledge a sort of assurance which exceed bare belief for that rely on the testimony of another -- yet upon a due examination i find it come not short of perfect certainty and be in effect true knowledge that which be apt to mislead we first thought into a mistake in this matter be that the agreement or disagreement of the idea in this case be not perceive as it be at first by a actual view of all the intermediate idea whereby the agreement or disagreement of those in the proposition be at first perceive but by other intermediate idea that show the agreement or disagreement of the idea contain in the proposition whose certainty we remember for example : in this proposition that ` the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one ' one who have see and clearly perceive the demonstration of this truth know it to be true when that demonstration be go out of he mind so that at present it be not actually in view and possibly can not be recollect : but he know it in a different way from what he do before the agreement of the two idea join in that proposition be perceive but it be by the intervention of other idea than those which at first produce that perception he remember ie he know -lrb- for remembrance be but the revive of some past knowledge -rrb- that he be once certain of the truth of this proposition that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one the immutability of the same relation between the same immutable thing be now the idea that show he that if the three angle of a triangle be once equal to two right one they will always be equal to two right one and hence he come to be certain that what be once true in the case be always true what idea once agree will always agree and consequently what he once know to be true he will always know to be true as long as he can remember that he once know it upon this ground it be that particular demonstration in mathematics afford general knowledge if then the perception that the same idea will eternally have the same habitude and relation be not a sufficient ground of knowledge there could be no knowledge of general proposition in mathematics for no mathematical demonstration would be any other than particular : and when a man have demonstrate any proposition concern one triangle or circle he knowledge would not reach beyond that particular diagram if he would extend it further he must renew he demonstration in another instance before he could know it to be true in another like triangle and so on : by which mean one could never come to the knowledge of any general proposition nobody i think can deny that mr newton certainly know any proposition that he now at any time read in he book to be true though he have not in actual view that admirable chain of intermediate idea whereby he at first discover it to be true such a memory as that able to retain such a train of particulars may be well think beyond the reach of human faculty when the very discovery perception and lay together that wonderful connexion of idea be find to surpass most reader ' comprehension but yet it be evident the author himself know the proposition to be true remember he once see the connexion of those idea as certainly as he know such a man wound another remember that he see he run he through but because the memory be not always so clear as actual perception and do in all man more or less decay in length of time this amongst other difference be one which show that demonstrative knowledge be much more imperfect than intuitive as we shall see in the follow chapter chapter ii of the degree of we knowledge 1 of the degree or difference in clearness of we knowledge : i intuitive all we knowledge consist as i have say in the view the mind have of its own idea which be the utmost light and greatest certainty we with we faculty and in we way of knowledge be capable of it may not be amiss to consider a little the degree of its evidence the different clearness of we knowledge seem to I to lie in the different way of perception the mind have of the agreement or disagreement of any of its idea for if we will reflect on we own way of think we will find that sometimes the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of two idea immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other : and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind be at no pain of prove or examine but perceive the truth as the eye doth light only by be direct towards it thus the mind perceive that white be not black that a circle be not a triangle that three be more than two and equal to one and two such kind of truth the mind perceive at the first sight of the idea together by bare intuition without the intervention of any other idea : and this kind of knowledge be the clearest and most certain that human frailty be capable of this part of knowledge be irresistible and like bright sunshine force itself immediately to be perceive as soon as ever the mind turn its view that way and leave no room for hesitation doubt or examination but the mind be presently fill with the clear light of it it be on this intuition that depend all the certainty and evidence of all we knowledge which certainty every one find to be so great that he can not imagine and therefore not require a greater : for a man can not conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in he mind be such as he perceive it to be and that two idea wherein he perceive a difference be different and not precisely the same he that demand a greater certainty than this demand he know not what and show only that he have a mind to be a sceptic without be able to be so certainty depend so wholly on this intuition that in the next degree of knowledge which i call demonstrative this intuition be necessary in all the connexion of the intermediate idea without which we can not attain knowledge and certainty 2 ii demonstrative the next degree of knowledge be where the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of any idea but not immediately though wherever the mind perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of its idea there be certain knowledge yet it do not always happen that the mind see that agreement or disagreement which there be between they even where it be discoverable and in that case remain in ignorance and at most get no further than a probable conjecture the reason why the mind can not always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of two idea be because those idea concern whose agreement or disagreement the inquiry be make can not by the mind be so put together as to show it in this case then when the mind can not so bring its idea together as by they immediate comparison and as it be juxta-position or application one to another to perceive they agreement or disagreement it be fain by the intervention of other idea -lrb- one or more as it happen -rrb- to discover the agreement or disagreement which it search and this be that which we call reasoning thus the mind be willing to know the agreement or disagreement in bigness between the three angle of a triangle and two right one can not by a immediate view and compare they do it : because the three angle of a triangle can not be bring at once and be compare with any other one or two angle and so of this the mind have no immediate no intuitive knowledge in this case the mind be fain to find out some other angle to which the three angle of a triangle have a equality and find those equal to two right one come to know they equality to two right one 3 demonstration depend on clearly perceive proof those intervene idea which serve to show the agreement of any two other be call proof and where the agreement and disagreement be by this mean plainly and clearly perceive it be call demonstration it be show to the understanding and the mind make to see that it be so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate idea -lrb- that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other -rrb- and to apply they right be i suppose that which be call sagacity 4 as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge this knowledge by intervene proof though it be certain yet the evidence of it be not altogether so clear and bright nor the assent so ready as in intuitive knowledge for though in demonstration the mind do at last perceive the agreement or disagreement of the idea it consider yet it be not without pain and attention : there must be more than one transient view to find it a steady application and pursuit be require to this discovery : and there must be a progression by step and degree before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty and come to perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two idea that need proof and the use of reason to show it 5 the demonstrate conclusion not without doubt precedent to the demonstration another difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge be that though in the latter all doubt be remove when by the intervention of the intermediate idea the agreement or disagreement be perceive yet before the demonstration there be a doubt which in intuitive knowledge can not happen to the mind that have its faculty of perception leave to a degree capable of distinct idea no more than it can be a doubt to the eye -lrb- that can distinctly see white and black -rrb- whether this ink and this paper be all of a color if there be sight in the eye it will at first glimpse without hesitation perceive the word print on this paper different from the color of the paper : and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those idea that produce intuitive knowledge if the eye have lose the faculty of see or the mind of perceive we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other 6 not so clear as intuitive knowledge it be true the perception produce by demonstration be also very clear yet it be often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive : like a face reflect by several mirror one to another where as long as it retain the similitude and agreement with the object it produce a knowledge but it be still in every successive reflection with a lessen of that perfect clearness and distinctness which be in the first till at last after many remove it have a great mixture of dimness and be not at first sight so knowable especially to weak eye thus it be with knowledge make out by a long train of proof 7 each step in demonstrate knowledge must have intuitive evidence now in every step reason make in demonstrative knowledge there be a intuitive knowledge of that agreement or disagreement it seek with the next intermediate idea which it use as a proof : for if it be not so that yet would need a proof since without the perception of such agreement or disagreement there be no knowledge produce : if it be perceive by itself it be intuitive knowledge : if it can not be perceive by itself there be need of some intervene idea as a common measure to show they agreement or disagreement by which it be plain that every step in reasoning that produce knowledge have intuitive certainty which when the mind perceive there be no more required but to remember it to make the agreement or disagreement of the idea concern which we inquire visible and certain so that to make anything a demonstration it be necessary to perceive the immediate agreement of the intervene idea whereby the agreement or disagreement of the two idea under examination -lrb- whereof the one be always the first and the other the last in the account -rrb- be find this intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea in each step and progression of the demonstration must also be carry exactly in the mind and a man must be sure that no part be leave out : which because in long deduction and the use of many proof the memory do not always so readily and exactly retain therefore it come to pass that this be more imperfect than intuitive knowledge and man embrace often falsehood for demonstration 8 hence the mistake ex praecognitis et praeconcessis the necessity of this intuitive knowledge in each step of scientifical or demonstrative reasoning give occasion i imagine to that mistaken axiom that all reasoning be ex praecognitis et praeconcessis : which how far it be a mistake i shall have occasion to show more at large when i come to consider proposition and particularly those proposition which be call maxim and to show that it be by a mistake that they be suppose to be the foundation of all we knowledge and reasoning 9 demonstration not limit to idea of mathematical quantity -lrb- it have be generally take for grant that mathematics alone be capable of demonstrative certainty : but to have such a agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceive be as i imagine not the privilege of the idea of number extension and figure alone it may possibly be the want of due method and application in we and not of sufficient evidence in thing that demonstration have be think to have so little to do in other part of knowledge and be scarce so much as aim at by any but mathematician -rrb- for whatever idea we have wherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement that be between they there the mind be capable of intuitive knowledge and where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two idea by a intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate idea there the mind be capable of demonstration : which be not limit to idea of extension figure number and they mode 10 why it have be think to be so limited the reason why it have be generally seek for and suppose to be only in those i imagine have be not only the general usefulness of those science but because in compare they equality or excess the mode of number have every the least difference very clear and perceivable : and though in extension every the least excess be not so perceptible yet the mind have find out way to examine and discover demonstratively the just equality of two angle or extension or figure : and both these i e number and figure can be set down by visible and lasting mark wherein the idea under consideration be perfectly determine which for the most part they be not where they be mark only by name and word 11 mode of quality not demonstrable like mode of quantity but in other simple idea whose mode and difference be make and count by degree and not quantity we have not so nice and accurate a distinction of they difference as to perceive or find way to measure they just equality or the least difference for those other simple idea be appearance of sensation produce in we by the size figure number and motion of minute corpuscle singly insensible they different degree also depend upon the variation of some or of all those cause : which since it can not be observe by we in particle of matter whereof each be too subtile to be perceive it be impossible for we to have any exact measure of the different degree of these simple idea for suppose the sensation or idea we name whiteness be produce in we by a certain number of globule which have a verticity about they own centre strike upon the retina of the eye with a certain degree of rotation as well as progressive swiftness it will hence easily follow that the more the superficial part of any body be so order as to reflect the greater number of globule of light and to give they the proper rotation which be fit to produce this sensation of white in we the more white will that body appear that from a equal space send to the retina the greater number of such corpuscle with that peculiar sort of motion i do not say that the nature of light consist in very small round globule nor of whiteness in such a texture of part as give a certain rotation to these globule when it reflect they : for i be not now treat physically of light or color but this i think i may say that i can not -lrb- and i would be glad any one would make intelligible that he do -rrb- conceive how body without we can any way affect we sens but by the immediate contact of the sensible body themselves as in tasting and feeling or the impulse of some sensible particle come from they as in see hearing and smell by the different impulse of which part cause by they different size figure and motion the variety of sensation be produce in we 12 particle of light and simple idea of color whether then they be globule or no or whether they have a verticity about they own centre that produce the idea of whiteness in we this be certain that the more particle of light be reflect from a body fit to give they that peculiar motion which produce the sensation of whiteness in we and possibly too the quicker that peculiar motion be -- the whiter do the body appear from which the greatest number be reflect as be evident in the same piece of paper put in the sunbeam in the shade and in a dark hole in each of which it will produce in we the idea of whiteness in far different degree 13 the secondary quality of thing not discover by demonstration not know therefore what number of particle nor what motion of they be fit to produce any precise degree of whiteness we can not demonstrate the certain equality of any two degree of whiteness because we have no certain standard to measure they by nor mean to distinguish every the least real difference the only help we have be from we sens which in this point fail we but where the difference be so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct idea whose difference can be perfectly retain there these idea or color as we see in different kind as blue and red be as capable of demonstration as idea of number and extension what i have here say of whiteness and color i think hold true in all secondary quality and they mode 14 iii sensitive knowledge of the particular existence of finite being without we these two viz intuition and demonstration be the degree of we knowledge whatever come short of one of these with what assurance soever embrace be but faith or opinion but not knowledge at least in all general truth there be indeed another perception of the mind employ about the particular existence of finite being without we which go beyond bare probability and yet not reach perfectly to either of the foregoing degree of certainty pass under the name of knowledge there can be nothing more certain than that the idea we receive from a external object be in we mind : this be intuitive knowledge but whether there be anything more than barely that idea in we mind whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without we which correspond to that idea be that whereof some man think there may be a question make because man may have such idea in they mind when no such thing exist no such object affect they sens but yet here i think we be provide with a evidence that put we past doubt for i ask any one whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different perception when he look on the sun by day and think on it by night when he actually taste wormwood or smell a rose or only think on that savor or odour we as plainly find the difference there be between any idea revive in we mind by we own memory and actually come into we mind by we sens as we do between any two distinct idea if any one say a dream may do the same thing and all these idea may be produce in we without any external object he may please to dream that i make he this answer : -- i that it be no great matter whether i remove he scruple or no : where all be but dream reasoning and argument be of no use truth and knowledge nothing 2 that i believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dream of be in the fire and be actually in it but yet if he be resolve to appear so sceptical as to maintain that what i call be actually in the fire be nothing but a dream and that we can not thereby certainly know that any such thing as fire actually exist without we : i answer that we certainly find that pleasure or pain follow upon the application of certain object to we whose existence we perceive or dream that we perceive by we sens this certainty be as great as we happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment to know or to be so that i think we may add to the two former sort of knowledge this also of the existence of particular external object by that perception and consciousness we have of the actual entrance of idea from they and allow these three degree of knowledge viz intuitive demonstrative and sensitive in each of which there be different degree and way of evidence and certainty 15 knowledge not always clear where the idea that enter into it be clear but since we knowledge be found on and employ about we idea only will it not follow from thence that it be conformable to we idea and that where we idea be clear and distinct or obscure and confused we knowledge will be so too to which i answer no : for we knowledge consist in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two idea its clearness or obscurity consist in the clearness or obscurity of that perception and not in the clearness or obscurity of the idea themselves : v g a man that have as clear idea of the angle of a triangle and of equality to two right one as any mathematician in the world may yet have but a very obscure perception of they agreement and so have but a very obscure knowledge of it -lrb- but idea which by reason of they obscurity or otherwise be confuse can not produce any clear or distinct knowledge because as far as any idea be confuse so far the mind can not perceive clearly whether they agree or disagree or to express the same thing in a way less apt to be misunderstand : he that have not determine idea to the word he use can not make proposition of they of whose truth he can be certain -rrb- chapter iii of the extent of human knowledge 1 extent of we knowledge knowledge as have be say lie in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of we idea it follow from hence that first it extend no further than we have idea first we can have knowledge no further than we have idea 2 secondly it extend no further than we can perceive they agreement or disagreement secondly that we can have no knowledge further than we can have perception of that agreement or disagreement which perception being : 1 either by intuition or the immediate compare any two idea or 2 by reason examine the agreement or disagreement of two idea by the intervention of some other or 3 by sensation perceive the existence of particular thing : hence it also follow : 3 thirdly intuitive knowledge extend itself not to all the relation of all we idea thirdly that we can not have a intuitive knowledge that shall extend itself to all we idea and all that we would know about they because we can not examine and perceive all the relation they have one to another by juxta-position or a immediate comparison one with another thus have the idea of a obtuse and a acute angled triangle both draw from equal basis and between parallel i can by intuitive knowledge perceive the one not to be the other but can not that way know whether they be equal or no because they agreement or disagreement in equality can never be perceive by a immediate compare they : the difference of figure make they part incapable of a exact immediate application and therefore there be need of some intervene quality to measure they by which be demonstration or rational knowledge 4 fourthly nor do demonstrative knowledge fourthly it follow also from what be above observe that we rational knowledge can not reach to the whole extent of we idea : because between two different idea we would examine we can not always find such medium as we can connect one to another with a intuitive knowledge in all the part of the deduction and wherever that fail we come short of knowledge and demonstration 5 fifthly sensitive knowledge narrower than either fifthly sensitive knowledge reach no further than the existence of thing actually present to we sens be yet much narrower than either of the former 6 sixthly we knowledge therefore narrower than we idea sixthly from all which it be evident that the extent of we knowledge come not only short of the reality of thing but even of the extent of we own idea though we knowledge be limit to we idea and can not exceed they either in extent or perfection and though these be very narrow bound in respect of the extent of all-being and far short of what we may justly imagine to be in some even create understanding not tie down to the dull and narrow information that be to be receive from some few and not very acute way of perception such as be we sens yet it would be well with we if we knowledge be but as large as we idea and there be not many doubt and inquiry concern the idea we have whereof we be not nor i believe ever shall be in this world resolve nevertheless i do not question but that human knowledge under the present circumstance of we being and constitution may be carry much further than it have hitherto be if man would sincerely and with freedom of mind employ all that industry and labor of think in improve the means of discover truth which they do for the coloring or support of falsehood to maintain a system interest or party they be once engage in but yet after all i think i may without injury to human perfection be confident that we knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know concern those idea we have nor be able to surmount all the difficulty and resolve all the question that might arise concern any of they we have the idea of a square a circle and equality and yet perhaps shall never be able to find a circle equal to a square and certainly know that it be so we have the idea of matter and thinking but possibly shall never be able to know whether -lrb- any mere material be -rrb- think or no it be impossible for we by the contemplation of we own idea without revelation to discover whether omnipotency have not give to some system of matter fitly dispose a power to perceive and think or else join and fix to matter so dispose a think immaterial substance : it be in respect of we notion not much more remote from we comprehension to conceive that god can if he please superadd to matter a faculty of think than that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of think since we know not wherein think consist nor to what sort of substance the almighty have be please to give that power which can not be in any create be but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the creator for i see no contradiction in it that the first eternal thinking be or omnipotent spirit should if he please give to certain system of create senseless matter put together as he think fit some degree of sense perception and thought : though as i think i have prove lib iv ch 10 section 14 & c it be no less than a contradiction to suppose matter -lrb- which be evidently in its own nature void of sense and thought -rrb- should be that eternal first-thinking be what certainty of knowledge can any one have that some perception such as v g pleasure and pain should not be in some body themselves after a certain manner modify and move as well as that they should be in a immaterial substance upon the motion of the part of body : body as far as we can conceive be able only to strike and affect body and motion accord to the utmost reach of we idea be able to produce nothing but motion so that when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain or the idea of a color or sound we be fain to quit we reason go beyond we idea and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of we maker for since we must allow he have annex effect to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to produce what reason have we to conclude that he could not order they as well to be produce in a subject we can not conceive capable of they as well as in a subject we can not conceive the motion of matter can any way operate upon i say not this that i would any way lessen the belief of the soul 's immateriality : i be not here speak of probability but knowledge and i think not only that it become the modesty of philosophy not to pronounce magisterially where we want that evidence that can produce knowledge but also that it be of use to we to discern how far we knowledge do reach for the state we be at present in not be that of vision we must in many thing content ourselves with faith and probability : and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if we faculty can not arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great end of morality and religion be well enough secure without philosophical proof of the soul 's immateriality since it be evident that he who make we at the begin to subsist here sensible intelligent being and for several year continue we in such a state can and will restore we to the like state of sensibility in another world and make we capable there to receive the retribution he have design to man accord to they doings in this life -lrb- and therefore it be not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some over-zealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have be forward to make the world believe who either on the one side indulge too much they thought immerse altogether in matter can allow no existence to what be not material : or who on the other side finding not cogitation within the natural power of matter examine over and over again by the utmost intention of mind have the confidence to conclude -- that omnipotency itself can not give perception and think to a substance which have the modification of solidity he that consider how hardly sensation be in we thought reconcilable to extended matter or existence to anything that have no extension at all will confess that he be very far from certainly know what he soul be it be a point which seem to I to be put out of the reach of we knowledge : and he who will give himself leave to consider freely and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis will scarce find he reason able to determine he fixedly for or against the soul 's materiality since on which side soever he view it either as a unextended substance or as a think extended matter the difficulty to conceive either will whilst either alone be in he thought still drive he to the contrary side a unfair way which some man take with themselves : who because of the inconceivableness of something they find in one throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis though altogether as unintelligible to a unbiassed understanding this serve not only to show the weakness and the scantiness of we knowledge but the insignificant triumph of such sort of argument which draw from we own view may satisfy we that we can find no certainty on one side of the question : but do not at all thereby help we to truth by run into the opposite opinion which on examination will be find clog with equal difficulty for what safety what advantage to any one be it for the avoid the seeming absurdity and to he unsurmountable rub he meet with in one opinion to take refuge in the contrary which be build on something altogether as inexplicable and as far remote from he comprehension it be past controversy that we have in we something that think we very doubt about what it be confirm the certainty of its be though we must content ourselves in the ignorance of what kind of be it be : and it be in vain to go about to be sceptical in this as it be unreasonable in most other case to be positive against the being of anything because we can not comprehend its nature for i would fain know what substance exist that have not something in it which manifestly baffle we understanding other spirit who see and know the nature and inward constitution of thing how much must they exceed we in knowledge to which if we add larger comprehension which enable they at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many idea and readily supply to they the intermediate proof which we by single and slow step and long poring in the dark hardly at last find out and be often ready to forget one before we have hunt out another we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior rank of spirit who have a quicker and more penetrate sight as well as a larger field of knowledge -rrb- but to return to the argument in hand : we knowledge i say be not only limited to the paucity and imperfection of the idea we have and which we employ it about but even come short of that too : but how far it reach let we now inquire 7 how far we knowledge reach the affirmation or negation we make concern the idea we have may as i have before intimate in general be reduce to these four sort viz identity co-existence relation and real existence i shall examine how far we knowledge extend in each of these : 8 firstly we knowledge of identity and diversity in idea extend as far as we idea themselves first as to identity and diversity in this way of agreement or disagreement of we idea we intuitive knowledge be as far extend as we idea themselves : and there can be no idea in the mind which it do not presently by a intuitive knowledge perceive to be what it be and to be different from any other 9 secondly of they co-existence extend only a very little way secondly as to the second sort which be the agreement or disagreement of we idea in co-existence in this we knowledge be very short though in this consist the greatest and most material part of we knowledge concern substance for we idea of the species of substance be as i have show nothing but certain collection of simple idea unite in one subject and so co-exist together vg we idea of flame be a body hot luminous and move upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible : for these or some such complex idea as these in man 's mind do these two name of the different substance flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concern these or any other sort of substance what do we inquire but what other quality or power these substance have or have not which be nothing else but to know what other simple idea do or do not co-exist with those that make up that complex idea 10 because the connexion between simple idea in substance be for the most part unknown this how weighty and considerable a part soever of human science be yet very narrow and scarce any at all the reason whereof be that the simple idea whereof we complex idea of substance be make up be for the most part such as carry with they in they own nature no visible necessary connexion or inconsistency with any other simple idea whose co-existence with they we would inform ourselves about 11 especially of the secondary quality of body the idea that we complex one of substance be make up of and about which we knowledge concern substance be most employ be those of they secondary quality which depend all -lrb- as have be show -rrb- upon the primary quality of they minute and insensible part or if not upon they upon something yet more remote from we comprehension it be impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not know the root they spring from not know what size figure and texture of part they be on which depend and from which result those quality which make we complex idea of gold it be impossible we should know what other quality result from or be incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible part of gold and so consequently must always co-exist with that complex idea we have of it or else be inconsistent with it 12 because necessary connexion between any secondary and the primary quality be undiscoverable by we besides this ignorance of the primary quality of the insensible part of body on which depend all they secondary quality there be yet another and more incurable part of ignorance which set we more remote from a certain knowledge of the co-existence or inco-existence -lrb- if i may so say -rrb- of different idea in the same subject and that be that there be no discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those primary quality which it depend on 13 we have no perfect knowledge of they primary quality that the size figure and motion of one body should cause a change in the size figure and motion of another body be not beyond we conception the separation of the part of one body upon the intrusion of another and the change from rest to motion upon impulse these and the like seem to have some connexion one with another and if we know these primary quality of body we might have reason to hope we might be able to know a great deal more of these operation of they one upon another : but we mind not be able to discover any connexion betwixt these primary quality of body and the sensation that be produce in we by they we can never be able to establish certain and undoubted rule of the consequence or co-existence of any secondary quality though we could discover the size figure or motion of those invisible part which immediately produce they we be so far from know what figure size or motion of part produce a yellow color a sweet taste or a sharp sound that we can by no means conceive how any size figure or motion of any particle can possibly produce in we the idea of any color taste or sound whatsoever : there be no conceivable connexion between the one and the other 14 and seek in vain for certain and universal knowledge of unperceived quality in substance in vain therefore shall we endeavor to discover by we idea -lrb- the only true way of certain and universal knowledge -rrb- what other idea be to be find constantly join with that of we complex idea of any substance : since we neither know the real constitution of the minute part on which they quality do depend nor do we know they could we discover any necessary connexion between they and any of the secondary quality : which be necessary to be do before we can certainly know they necessary co-existence so that let we complex idea of any species of substance be what it will we can hardly from the simple idea contain in it certainly determine the necessary co-existence of any other quality whatsoever we knowledge in all these inquiry reach very little further than we experience indeed some few of the primary quality have a necessary dependence and visible connexion one with another as figure necessarily suppose extension receive or communicate motion by impulse suppose solidity but though these and perhaps some other of we idea have : yet there be so few of they that have a visible connexion one with another that we can by intuition or demonstration discover the co-existence of very few of the quality that be to be find unite in substance : and we be leave only to the assistance of we sens to make know to we what quality they contain for of all the quality that be co-existent in any subject without this dependence and evident connexion of they idea one with another we can not know certainly any two to co-exist any further than experience by we sens inform we thus though we see the yellow color and upon trial find the weight malleableness fusibility and fixedness that be unite in a piece of gold yet because no one of these idea have any evident dependence or necessary connexion with the other we can not certainly know that where any four of these be the fifth will be there also how highly probable soever it may be because the highest probability amount not to certainty without which there can be no true knowledge for this co-existence can be no further know than it be perceive and it can not be perceive but either in particular subject by the observation of we sens or in general by the necessary connexion of the idea themselves 15 of repugnancy to co-exist we knowledge be larger as to the incompatibility or repugnancy to co-existence we may know that any subject may have of each sort of primary quality but one particular at once : vg each particular extension figure number of part motion exclude all other of each kind the like also be certain of all sensible idea peculiar to each sense for whatever of each kind be present in any subject exclude all other of that sort : vg no one subject can have two smell or two color at the same time to this perhaps will be say have not a opal or the infusion of lignum nephriticum two color at the same time to which i answer that these body to eye differently place may at the same time afford different color : but i take liberty also to say that to eye differently place it be different part of the object that reflect the particle of light : and therefore it be not the same part of the object and so not the very same subject which at the same time appear both yellow and azure for it be as impossible that the very same particle of any body should at the same time differently modify or reflect the ray of light as that it should have two different figure and texture at the same time 16 we knowledge of the co-existence of power in body extend but a very little way but as to the power of substance to change the sensible quality of other body which make a great part of we inquiry about they and be no inconsiderable branch of we knowledge i doubt as to these whether we knowledge reach much further than we experience or whether we can come to the discovery of most of these power and be certain that they be in any subject by the connexion with any of those idea which to we make its essence because the active and passive power of body and they way of operate consist in a texture and motion of part which we can not by any means come to discover it be but in very few case we can be able to perceive they dependence on or repugnance to any of those idea which make we complex one of that sort of thing i have here instance in the corpuscularian hypothesis as that which be think to go furthest in a intelligible explication of those quality of body and i fear the weakness of human understanding be scarce able to substitute another which will afford we a fuller and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and co-existence of the power which be to be observe unite in several sort of they this at least be certain that whichever hypothesis be clearest and truest -lrb- for of that it be not my business to determine -rrb- we knowledge concern corporeal substance will be very little advanced by any of they till we be make to see what quality and power of body have a necessary connexion or repugnancy one with another which in the present state of philosophy i think we know but to a very small degree : and i doubt whether with those faculty we have we shall ever be able to carry we general knowledge -lrb- i say not particular experience -rrb- in this part much further experience be that which in this part we must depend on and it be to be wish that it be more improve we find the advantage some man 's generous pain have this way bring to the stock of natural knowledge and if other especially the philosopher by fire who pretend to it have be so wary in they observation and sincere in they report as those who call themselves philosopher ought to have be we acquaintance with the body here about we and we insight into they power and operation have be yet much greater 17 of the power that co-exist in spirit yet narrower if we be at a loss in respect of the power and operation of body i think it be easy to conclude we be much more in the dark in reference to spirit whereof we naturally have no idea but what we draw from that of we own by reflect on the operation of we own soul within we as far as they can come within we observation but how inconsiderable a rank the spirit that inhabit we body hold amongst those various and possibly innumerable kind of nobler being and how far short they come of the endowment and perfection of cherubim and seraph and infinite sort of spirit above we be what by a transient hint in another place i have offer to my reader 's consideration 18 thirdly of relation between abstracted idea it be not easy to say how far we knowledge extend thirdly as to the third sort of we knowledge viz the agreement or disagreement of any of we idea in any other relation : this as it be the largest field of we knowledge so it be hard to determine how far it may extend : because the advance that be make in this part of knowledge depend on we sagacity in find intermediate idea that may show the relation and habitude of idea whose co-existence be not consider it be a hard matter to tell when we be at a end of such discovery and when reason have all the help it be capable of for the finding of proof or examine the agreement or disagreement of remote idea they that be ignorant of algebra can not imagine the wonder in this kind be to be do by it : and what further improvement and help advantageous to other part of knowledge the sagacious mind of man may yet find out it be not easy to determine this at least i believe that the idea of quantity be not those alone that be capable of demonstration and knowledge and that other and perhaps more useful part of contemplation would afford we certainty if vice passion and domineering interest do not oppose or menace such endeavor morality capable of demonstration the idea of a supreme be infinite in power goodness and wisdom whose workmanship we be and on whom we depend and the idea of ourselves as understand rational creature be such as be clear in we would i suppose if duly consider and pursue afford such foundation of we duty and rule of action as might place morality amongst the science capable of demonstration : wherein i doubt not but from self-evident proposition by necessary consequence as incontestible as those in mathematics the measure of right and wrong might be make out to any one that will apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he do to the other of these science the relation of other mode may certainly be perceive as well as those of number and extension : and i can not see why they should not also be capable of demonstration if due method be think on to examine or pursue they agreement or disagreement ` where there be no property there be no injustice ' be a proposition as certain as any demonstration in euclid : for the idea of property be a right to anything and the idea of which the name ` injustice ' be give be the invasion or violation of that right it be evident that these idea be thus establish and these name annex to they i can as certainly know this proposition to be true as that a triangle have three angle equal to two right one again : ` no government allow absolute liberty ' the idea of government be the establishment of society upon certain rule or law which require conformity to they and the idea of absolute liberty be for any one to do whatever he please i be as capable of be certain of the truth of this proposition as of any in the mathematics 19 two thing have make moral idea to be think incapable of demonstration : they unfitness for sensible representation and they complexedness that which in this respect have give the advantage to the idea of quantity and make they think more capable of certainty and demonstration be first that they can be set down and represent by sensible mark which have a greater and nearer correspondence with they than any word or sound whatsoever diagrams draw on paper be copy of the idea in the mind and not liable to the uncertainty that word carry in they signification a angle circle or square draw in line lie open to the view and can not be mistake : it remain unchangeable and may at leisure be consider and examine and the demonstration be revise and all the part of it may be go over more than once without any danger of the least change in the idea this can not be thus do in moral idea : we have no sensible mark that resemble they whereby we can set they down we have nothing but word to express they by which though when write they remain the same yet the idea they stand for may change in the same man and it be very seldom that they be not different in different person secondly another thing that make the greater difficulty in ethic be that moral idea be commonly more complex than those of the figure ordinarily consider in mathematics from whence these two inconvenience follow : -- first that they name be of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple idea they stand for not be so easily agree on and so the sign that be use for they in communication always and in think often do not steadily carry with it the same idea upon which the same disorder confusion and error follow as would if a man go to demonstrate something of a heptagon should in the diagram he take to do it leave out one of the angle or by oversight make the figure with one angle more than the name ordinarily import or he intend it should when at first he think of he demonstration this often happen and be hardly avoidable in very complex moral idea where the same name be retain one angle ie one simple idea be leave out or put in the complex one -lrb- still call by the same name -rrb- more at one time than another secondly from the complexedness of these moral idea there follow another inconvenience viz that the mind can not easily retain those precise combination so exactly and perfectly as be necessary in the examination of the habitude and correspondence agreement or disagreement of several of they one with another especially where it be to be judge of by long deduction and the intervention of several other complex idea to show the agreement or disagreement of two remote one the great help against this which mathematician find in diagram and figure which remain unalterable in they draught be very apparent and the memory would often have great difficulty otherwise to retain they so exactly whilst the mind go over the part of they step by step to examine they several correspondence and though in cast up a long sum either in addition multiplication or division every part be only a progression of the mind take a view of its own idea and consider they agreement or disagreement and the resolution of the question be nothing but the result of the whole make up of such particulars whereof the mind have a clear perception : yet without set down the several part by mark whose precise signification be know and by mark that last and remain in view when the memory have let they go it would be almost impossible to carry so many different idea in the mind without confound or let slip some part of the reckoning and thereby make all we reasoning about it useless in which case the cypher or mark help not the mind at all to perceive the agreement of any two or more number they equality or proportion that the mind have only by intuition of its own idea of the number themselves but the numerical character be help to the memory to record and retain the several idea about which the demonstration be make whereby a man may know how far he intuitive knowledge in survey several of the particulars have proceed that so he may without confusion go on to what be yet unknown and at last have in one view before he the result of all he perception and reasoning 20 remedy of we difficulty in deal demonstratively with moral idea one part of these disadvantage in moral idea which have make they be think not capable of demonstration may in a good measure be remedy by definition set down that collection of simple idea which every term shall stand for and then use the term steadily and constantly for that precise collection and what method algebra or something of that kind may hereafter suggest to remove the other difficulty it be not easy to foretell confident i be that if man would in the same method and with the same indifferency search after moral as they do mathematical truth they would find they have a stronger connexion one with another and a more necessary consequence from we clear and distinct idea and to come nearer perfect demonstration than be commonly imagine but much of this be not to be expect whilst the desire of esteem riches or power make man espouse the well-endowed opinion in fashion and then seek argument either to make good they beauty or varnish over and cover they deformity nothing be so beautiful to the eye as truth be to the mind nothing so deform and irreconcilable to the understanding as a lie for though many a man can with satisfaction enough own a no very handsome wife in he bosom yet who be bold enough openly to avow that he have espouse a falsehood and receive into he breast so ugly a thing as a lie whilst the party of man cram they tenet down all man 's throat whom they can get into they power without permit they to examine they truth or falsehood and will not let truth have fair play in the world nor man the liberty to search after it what improvement can be expect of this kind what greater light can be hope for in the moral science the subject part of mankind in most place might instead thereof with egyptian bondage expect egyptian darkness be not the candle of the lord set up by himself in man 's mind which it be impossible for the breath or power of man wholly to extinguish 21 fourthly of the three real existence of which we have certain knowledge fourthly as to the fourth sort of we knowledge viz of the real actual existence of thing we have a intuitive knowledge of we own existence and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of a god : of the existence of anything else we have no other but a sensitive knowledge which extend not beyond the object present to we sens 22 we ignorance great we knowledge be so narrow as i have show it will perhaps give we some light into the present state of we mind if we look a little into the dark side and take a view of we ignorance which be infinitely larger than we knowledge may serve much to the quiet of dispute and improvement of useful knowledge if discover how far we have clear and distinct idea we confine we thought within the contemplation of those thing that be within the reach of we understanding and launch not out into that abyss of darkness -lrb- where we have not eye to see nor faculty to perceive anything -rrb- out of a presumption that nothing be beyond we comprehension but to be satisfy of the folly of such a conceit we need not go far he that know anything know this in the first place that he need not seek long for instance of he ignorance the meanest and most obvious thing that come in we way have dark side that the quickest sight can not penetrate into the clearest and most enlarged understanding of think man find themselves puzzle and at a loss in every particle of matter we shall the less wonder to find it so when we consider the cause of we ignorance which from what have be say i suppose will be find to be these three : -- first want of idea its cause secondly want of a discoverable connexion between the idea we have thirdly want of trace and examine we idea 23 first one cause of we ignorance want of idea i want of simple idea that other creature in other part of the universe may have first there be some thing and those not a few that we be ignorant of for want of idea first all the simple idea we have be confine -lrb- as i have show -rrb- to those we receive from corporeal object by sensation and from the operation of we own mind as the object of reflection but how much these few and narrow inlet be disproportionate to the vast whole extent of all being will not be hard to persuade those who be not so foolish as to think they span the measure of all thing what other simple idea it be possible the creature in other part of the universe may have by the assistance of sens and faculty more or perfecter than we have or different from ours it be not for we to determine but to say or think there be no such because we conceive nothing of they be no better a argument than if a blind man should be positive in it that there be no such thing as sight and color because he have no manner of idea of any such thing nor could by any means frame to himself any notion about see the ignorance and darkness that be in we no more hinder nor confines the knowledge that be in other than the blindness of a mole be a argument against the quicksightedness of a eagle he that will consider the infinite power wisdom and goodness of the creator of all thing will find reason to think it be not all lay out upon so inconsiderable mean and impotent a creature as he will find man to be who in all probability be one of the lowest of all intellectual being what faculty therefore other species of creature have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitution of thing what idea they may receive of they far different from ours we know not this we know and certainly find that we want several other view of they besides those we have to make discovery of they more perfect and we may be convince that the idea we can attain to by we faculty be very disproportionate to thing themselves when a positive clear distinct one of substance itself which be the foundation of all the rest be conceal from we but want of idea of this kind be a part as well as cause of we ignorance can not be describe only this i think i may confidently say of it that the intellectual and sensible world be in this perfectly alike : that that part which we see of either of they hold no proportion with what we see not and whatsoever we can reach with we eye or we thought of either of they be but a point almost nothing in comparison of the the rest 24 want of simple idea that man be capable of have but have not -lrb- 1 -rrb- because they remoteness or secondly another great cause of ignorance be the want of idea we be capable of as the want of idea which we faculty be not able to give we shut we wholly from those view of thing which it be reasonable to think other being perfecter than we have of which we know nothing so the want of idea i now speak of keep we in ignorance of thing we conceive capable of be know to we bulk figure and motion we have idea of but though we be not without idea of these primary quality of body in general yet not know what be the particular bulk figure and motion of the greatest part of the body of the universe we be ignorant of the several power efficacy and way of operation whereby the effect which we daily see be produce these be hide from we in some thing by be too remote and in other by be too minute when we consider the vast distance of the known and visible part of the world and the reason we have to think that what lie within we ken be but a small part of the universe we shall then discover a huge abyss of ignorance what be the particular fabric of the great mass of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal being how far they be extend what be they motion and how continued or communicate and what influence they have one upon another be contemplation that at first glimpse we thought lose themselves in if we narrow we contemplation and confine we thought to this little canton -- i mean this system of we sun and the grosser mass of matter that visibly move about it what several sort of vegetable animal and intellectual corporeal being infinitely different from those of we little spot of earth may there probably be in the other planet to the knowledge of which even of they outward figure and part we can no way attain whilst we be confine to this earth there be no natural means either by sensation or reflection to convey they certain idea into we mind they be out of the reach of those inlet of all we knowledge : and what sort of furniture and inhabitant those mansion contain in they we can not so much as guess much less have clear and distinct idea of they 25 -lrb- 2 -rrb- because of they minuteness if a great nay far the greatest part of the several rank of body in the universe escape we notice by they remoteness there be other that be no less conceal from we by they minuteness these insensible corpuscle be the active part of matter and the great instrument of nature on which depend not only all they secondary quality but also most of they natural operation we want of precise distinct idea of they primary quality keep we in a incurable ignorance of what we desire to know about they i doubt not but if we could discover the figure size texture and motion of the minute constituent part of any two body we should know without trial several of they operation one upon another as we do now the property of a square or a triangle do we know the mechanical affection of the particle of rhubarb hemlock opium and a man as a watchmaker do those of a watch whereby it perform its operation and of a file which by rub on they will alter the figure of any of the wheel we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge hemlock kill and opium make a man sleep : as well as a watchmaker can that a little piece of paper lay on the balance will keep the watch from go till it be remove or that some small part of it be rub by a file the machine would quite lose its motion and the watch go no more the dissolve of silver in aqua forti and gold in aqua regium and not vice versa would be then perhaps no more difficult to know than it be to a smith to understand why the turning of one key will open a lock and not the turning of another but whilst we be destitute of sens acute enough to discover the minute particle of body and to give we idea of they mechanical affection we must be content to be ignorant of they property and way of operation nor can we be assure about they any further than some few trial we make be able to reach but whether they will succeed again another time we can not be certain this hinder we certain knowledge of universal truth concern natural body : and we reason carry we herein very little beyond particular matter of fact 26 hence no science of body within we reach and therefore i be apt to doubt that how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical thing scientifical will still be out of we reach : because we want perfect and adequate idea of those very body which be nearest to we and most under we command those which we have rank into class under name and we think ourselves best acquaint with we have but very imperfect and incomplete idea of distinct idea of the several sort of body that fall under the examination of we sens perhaps we may have : but adequate idea i suspect we have not of any one amongst they and though the former of these will serve we for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we be not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truth concern they certainty and demonstration be thing we must not in these matter pretend to by the color figure taste and smell and other sensible quality we have as clear and distinct idea of sage and hemlock as we have of a circle and a triangle : but have no idea of the particular primary quality of the minute part of either of these plant nor of other body which we would apply they to we can not tell what effect they will produce nor when we see those effect can we so much as guess much less know they manner of production thus have no idea of the particular mechanical affection of the minute part of body that be within we view and reach we be ignorant of they constitution power and operation : and of body more remote we be yet more ignorant not know so much as they very outward shape or the sensible and grosser part of they constitution 27 much less a science of unembodied spirit this at first will show we how disproportionate we knowledge be to the whole extent even of material being to which if we add the consideration of that infinite number of spirit that may be and probably be which be yet more remote from we knowledge whereof we have no cognizance nor can frame to ourselves any distinct idea of they several rank and sort we shall find this cause of ignorance conceal from we in a impenetrable obscurity almost the whole intellectual world a greater certainly and more beautiful world than the material for bate some very few and those if i may so call they superficial idea of spirit which by reflection we get of we own and from thence the best we can collect of the father of all spirit the eternal independent author of they and we and all thing we have no certain information so much as of the existence of other spirit but by revelation angel of all sort be naturally beyond we discovery and all those intelligence whereof it be likely there be more order than of corporeal substance be thing whereof we natural faculty give we no certain account at all that there be mind and think being in other man as well as himself every man have a reason from they word and action to be satisfy : and the knowledge of he own mind can not suffer a man that consider to be ignorant that there be a god but that there be degree of spiritual being between we and the great god who be there that by he own search and ability can come to know much less have we distinct idea of they different nature condition state power and several constitution wherein they agree or differ from one another and from we and therefore in what concern they different species and property we be in absolute ignorance 28 secondly another cause want of a discoverable connexion between idea we have secondly what a small part of the substantial being that be in the universe the want of idea leave open to we knowledge we have see in the next place another cause of ignorance of no less moment be a want of a discoverable connection between those idea we have for wherever we want that we be utterly incapable of universal and certain knowledge and be in the former case leave only to observation and experiment : which how narrow and confine it be how far from general knowledge we need not be tell i shall give some few instance of this cause of we ignorance and so leave it it be evident that the bulk figure and motion of several body about we produce in we several sensation as of color sound taste smell pleasure and pain & c these mechanical affection of body have no affinity at all with those idea they produce in we -lrb- there be no conceivable connexion between any impulse of any sort of body and any perception of a color or smell which we find in we mind -rrb- we can have no distinct knowledge of such operation beyond we experience and can reason no otherwise about they than as effect produce by the appointment of a infinitely wise agent which perfectly surpass we comprehension as the idea of sensible secondary quality which we have in we mind can by we be no way deduce from bodily cause nor any correspondence or connexion be find between they and those primary quality which -lrb- experience show we -rrb- produce they in we so on the other side the operation of we mind upon we body be as inconceivable how any thought should produce a motion in body be as remote from the nature of we idea as how any body should produce any thought in the mind that it be so if experience do not convince we the consideration of the thing themselves would never be able in the least to discover to we these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of thing yet that connexion be not discoverable in the idea themselves which appear to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute they connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that all-wise agent who have make they to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above we weak understanding to conceive 29 instance in some of we idea there be certain relation habitude and connexion so visibly include in the nature of the idea themselves that we can not conceive they separable from they by any power whatsoever and in these only we be capable of certain and universal knowledge thus the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily carry with it a equality of its angle to two right one nor can we conceive this relation this connexion of these two idea to be possibly mutable or to depend on any arbitrary power which of choice make it thus or could make it otherwise but the coherence and continuity of the part of matter the production of sensation in we of color and sound & c by impulse and motion nay the original rule and communication of motion be such wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any idea we have we can not but ascribe they to the arbitrary will and good pleasure of the wise architect i need not i think here mention the resurrection of the dead the future state of this globe of earth and such other thing which be by every one acknowledge to depend wholly on the determination of a free agent the thing that as far as we observation reach we constantly find to proceed regularly we may conclude do act by a law set they but yet by a law that we know not : whereby though cause work steadily and effect constantly flow from they yet they connexion and dependency be not discoverable in we idea we can have but a experimental knowledge of they from all which it be easy to perceive what a darkness we be involve in how little it be of be and the thing that be that we be capable to know and therefore we shall do no injury to we knowledge when we modestly think with ourselves that we be so far from be able to comprehend the whole nature of the universe and all the thing contain in it that we be not capable of a philosophical knowledge of the body that be about we and make a part of we : concern they secondary quality power and operation we can have no universal certainty several effect come every day within the notice of we sens of which we have so far sensitive knowledge : but the cause manner and certainty of they production for the two foregoing reason we must be content to be very ignorant of in these we can go no further than particular experience inform we of matter of fact and by analogy to guess what effect the like body be upon other trial like to produce but as to a perfect science of natural body -lrb- not to mention spiritual being -rrb- we be i think so far from be capable of any such thing that i conclude it lose labor to seek after it 30 thirdly a third cause want of trace we idea thirdly where we have adequate idea and where there be a certain and discoverable connexion between they yet we be often ignorant for want of trace those idea which we have or may have and for want of find out those intermediate idea which may show we what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many be ignorant of mathematical truth not out of any imperfection of they faculty or uncertainty in the thing themselves but for want of application in acquire examine and by due way compare those idea that which have most contribute to hinder the due trace of we idea and find out they relation and agreement or disagreement one with another have be i suppose the ill use of word it be impossible that man should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of idea themselves whilst they thought flutter about or stick only in sound of doubtful and uncertain signification mathematician abstract they thought from name and accustom themselves to set before they mind the idea themselves that they would consider and not sound instead of they have avoid thereby a great part of that perplexity puddering and confusion which have so much hinder man 's progress in other part of knowledge for whilst they stick in word of undetermined and uncertain signification they be unable to distinguish true from false certain from probable consistent from inconsistent in they own opinion this have be the fate or misfortune of a great part of man of letter the increase bring into the stock of real knowledge have be very little in proportion to the school dispute and writings the world have be fill with whilst student be lose in the great wood of word know not whereabouts they be how far they discovery be advance or what be want in they own or the general stock of knowledge have man in the discovery of the material do as they have in those of the intellectual world involve all in the obscurity of uncertain and doubtful way of talk volume writ of navigation and voyage theory and story of zone and tide multiply and dispute nay ship build and fleet send out would never have teach we the way beyond the line and the antipode would be still as much unknown as when it be declare heresy to hold there be any but have speak sufficiently of word and the ill or careless use that be commonly make of they i shall not say anything more of it here 31 extent of human knowledge in respect to its universality hitherto we have examine the extent of we knowledge in respect of the several sort of being that be there be another extent of it in respect of universality which will also deserve to be consider and in this regard we knowledge follow the nature of we idea if the idea be abstract whose agreement or disagreement we perceive we knowledge be universal for what be know of such general idea will be true of every particular thing in whom that essence ie that abstract idea be to be find : and what be once know of such idea will be perpetually and for ever true so that as to all general knowledge we must search and find it only in we mind and it be only the examine of we own idea that furnisheth we with that truth belong to essence of thing -lrb- that be to abstract idea -rrb- be eternal and be to be find out by the contemplation only of those essence : as the existence of thing be to be know only from experience but have more to say of this in the chapter where i shall speak of general and real knowledge this may here suffice as to the universality of we knowledge in general chapter iv of the reality of knowledge 1 objection ` knowledge place in we idea may be all unreal or chimerical ' i doubt not but my reader by this time may be apt to think that i have be all this while only build a castle in the air and be ready to say to I : -- ` to what purpose all this stir knowledge say you be only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of we own idea : but who know what those idea may be be there anything so extravagant as the imagination of man 's brain where be the head that have no chimera in it or if there be a sober and a wise man what difference will there be by you rule between he knowledge and that of the most extravagant fancy in the world they both have they idea and perceive they agreement and disagreement one with another if there be any difference between they the advantage will be on the warm-headed man 's side as have the more idea and the more lively and so by you rule he will be the more know if it be true that all knowledge lie only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of we own idea the vision of a enthusiast and the reasoning of a sober man will be equally certain it be no matter how thing be : so a man observe but the agreement of he own imagination and talk conformably it be all truth all certainty such castle in the air will be as stronghold of truth as the demonstration of euclid that a harpy be not a centaur be by this way as certain knowledge and as much a truth as that a square be not a circle ` but of what use be all this fine knowledge of man 's own imagination to a man that inquire after the reality of thing it matter not what man 's fancy be it be the knowledge of thing that be only to be prize : it be this alone give a value to we reasoning and preference to one man 's knowledge over another be that it be of thing as they really be and not of dream and fancy ' 2 answer not so where idea agree with thing to which i answer that if we knowledge of we idea terminate in they and reach no further where there be something further intend we most serious thought will be of little more use than the reverie of a crazy brain and the truth build thereon of no more weight than the discourse of a man who see thing clearly in a dream and with great assurance utter they but i hope before i have do to make it evident that this way of certainty by the knowledge of we own idea go a little further than bare imagination : and i believe it will appear that all the certainty of general truth a man have lie in nothing else 3 but what shall be the criterion of this agreement it be evident the mind know not thing immediately but only by the intervention of the idea it have of they we knowledge therefore be real only so far as there be a conformity between we idea and the reality of thing but what shall be here the criterion how shall the mind when it perceive nothing but its own idea know that they agree with thing themselves this though it seem not to want difficulty yet i think there be two sort of idea that we may be assure agree with thing 4 as first all simple idea be really conform to thing first the first be simple idea which since the mind as have be show can by no means make to itself must necessarily be the product of thing operate on the mind in a natural way and produce therein those perception which by the wisdom and will of we maker they be ordain and adapt to from whence it follow that simple idea be not fiction of we fancy but the natural and regular production of thing without we really operate upon we and so carry with they all the conformity which be intend or which we state require : for they represent to we thing under those appearance which they be fit to produce in we : whereby we be enable to distinguish the sort of particular substance to discern the state they be in and so to take they for we necessity and apply they to we use thus the idea of whiteness or bitterness as it be in the mind exactly answer that power which be in any body to produce it there have all the real conformity it can or ought to have with thing without we and this conformity between we simple idea and the existence of thing be sufficient for real knowledge 5 secondly all complex idea except idea of substance be they own archetype secondly all we complex idea except those of substance be archetype of the mind 's own make not intend to be the copy of anything nor refer to the existence of anything as to they original can not want any conformity necessary to real knowledge for that which be not design to represent anything but itself can never be capable of a wrong representation nor mislead we from the true apprehension of anything by its dislikeness to it : and such except those of substance be all we complex idea which as i have show in another place be combination of idea which the mind by its free choice put together without consider any connexion they have in nature and hence it be that in all these sort the idea themselves be consider as the archetype and thing no otherwise regard but as they be conformable to they so that we can not but be infallibly certain that all the knowledge we attain concern these idea be real and reach thing themselves because in all we thought reasoning and discourse of this kind we intend thing no further than as they be conformable to we idea so that in these we can not miss of a certain and undoubted reality 6 hence the reality of mathematical knowledge i doubt not but it will be easily grant that the knowledge we have of mathematical truth be not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimera of the brain : and yet if we will consider we shall find that it be only of we own idea the mathematician consider the truth and property belong to a rectangle or circle only as they be in idea in he own mind for it be possible he never find either of they exist mathematically ie precisely true in he life but yet the knowledge he have of any truth or property belong to a circle or any other mathematical figure be nevertheless true and certain even of real thing exist : because real thing be no further concerned nor intended to be mean by any such proposition than as thing really agree to those archetype in he mind be it true of the idea of a triangle that its three angle be equal to two right one it be true also of a triangle wherever it really exist whatever other figure exist that it be not exactly answerable to that idea of a triangle in he mind be not at all concern in that proposition and therefore he be certain all he knowledge concern such idea be real knowledge : because intend thing no further than they agree with those he idea he be sure what he know concern those figure when they have barely a ideal existence in he mind will hold true of they also when they have a real existance in matter : he consideration be barely of those figure which be the same wherever or however they exist 7 and of moral and hence it follow that moral knowledge be as capable of real certainty as mathematics for certainty be but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of we idea and demonstration nothing but the perception of such agreement by the intervention of other idea or medium we moral idea as well as mathematical be archetype themselves and so adequate and complete idea all the agreement or disagreement which we shall find in they will produce real knowledge as well as in mathematical figure 8 existence not require to make abstract knowledge real -lrb- for the attaining of knowledge and certainty it be requisite that we have determine idea : -rrb- and to make we knowledge real it be requisite that the idea answer they archetype nor let it be wonder that i place the certainty of we knowledge in the consideration of we idea with so little care and regard -lrb- as it may seem -rrb- to the real existence of thing : since most of those discourse which take up the thought and engage the dispute of those who pretend to make it they business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be find to be general proposition and notion in which existence be not at all concern all the discourse of the mathematician about the square of a circle conic section or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figure : but they demonstration which depend on they idea be the same whether there be any square or circle exist in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourse abstract from the life of man and the existence of those virtue in the world whereof they treat : nor be tully 's office less true because there be nobody in the world that exactly practise he rule and live up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he have give we and which exist nowhere when he writ but in idea if it be true in speculation ie in idea that murder deserve death it will also be true in reality of any action that exist conformable to book iv that idea of murder as for other action the truth of that proposition concern they not and thus it be of all other species of thing which have no other essence but those idea which be in the mind of man 9 nor will it be less true or certain because moral idea be of we own making and naming but it will here be say that if moral knowledge be place in the contemplation of we own moral idea and those as other mode be of we own make what strange notion will there be of justice and temperance what confusion of virtue and vice if every one may make what idea of they he please no confusion or disorder in the thing themselves nor the reasoning about they no more than -lrb- in mathematics -rrb- there would be a disturbance in the demonstration or a change in the property of figure and they relation one to another if a man should make a triangle with four corner or a trapezium with four right angle : that be in plain english change the name of the figure and call that by one name which mathematician call ordinarily by another for let a man make to himself the idea of a figure with three angle whereof one be a right one and call it if he please equilaterum or trapezium or anything else the property of and demonstration about that idea will be the same as if he call it a rectangular triangle i confess the change of the name by the impropriety of speech will at first disturb he who know not what idea it stand for : but as soon as the figure be draw the consequence and demonstration be plain and clear just the same be it in moral knowledge : let a man have the idea of take from other without they consent what they honest industry have possess they of and call this justice if he please he that take the name here without the idea put to it will be mistake by join another idea of he own to that name : but strip the idea of that name or take it such as it be in the speaker 's mind and the same thing will agree to it as if you call it injustice indeed wrong name in moral discourse breed usually more disorder because they be not so easily rectify as in mathematics where the figure once draw and see make the name useless and of no force for what need of a sign when the thing signify be present and in view but in moral name that can not be so easily and shortly do because of the many decomposition that go to the make up the complex idea of those mode but yet for all this the miscalling of any of those idea contrary to the usual signification of the word of that language hinder not but that we may have certain and demonstrative knowledge of they several agreement and disagreement if we will carefully as in mathematics keep to the same precise idea and trace they in they several relation one to another without be lead away by they name if we but separate the idea under consideration from the sign that stand for it we knowledge go equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sound we make use of 10 misnaming disturb not the certainty of the knowledge one thing more we be to take notice of that where god or any other law-maker have define any moral name there they have make the essence of that species to which that name belong and there it be not safe to apply or use they otherwise : but in other case it be bare impropriety of speech to apply they contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturb not the certainty of that knowledge which be still to be have by a due contemplation and compare of those even nick-named idea 11 thirdly we complex idea of substance have they archetype without we and here knowledge come short thirdly there be another sort of complex idea which be refer to archetype without we may differ from they and so we knowledge about they may come short of be real such be we idea of substance which consist of a collection of simple idea suppose take from the work of nature may yet vary from they by have more or different idea unite in they than be to be find unite in the thing themselves from whence it come to pass that they may and often do fail of be exactly conformable to thing themselves 12 so far as we complex idea agree with those archetype without we so far we knowledge concern substance be real i say then that to have idea of substance which by be conformable to thing may afford we real knowledge it be not enough as in mode to put together such idea as have no inconsistence though they do never before so exist : vg the idea of sacrilege or perjury & c be as real and true idea before as after the existence of any such fact but we idea of substance be suppose copy and refer to archetype without we must still be take from something that do or have exist : they must not consist of idea put together at the pleasure of we thought without any real pattern they be take from though we can perceive no inconsistence in such a combination the reason whereof be because we know not what real constitution it be of substance whereon we simple idea depend and which really be the cause of the strict union of some of they one with another and the exclusion of other there be very few of they that we can be sure be or be not inconsistent in nature : any further than experience and sensible observation reach herein therefore be found the reality of we knowledge concern substance -- that all we complex idea of they must be such and such only as be make up of such simple one as have be discover to co-exist in nature and we idea be thus true though not perhaps very exact copy be yet the subject of real -lrb- as far as we have any -rrb- knowledge of they which -lrb- as have be already show -rrb- will not be find to reach very far : but so far as it do it will still be real knowledge whatever idea we have the agreement we find they have with other will still be knowledge if those idea be abstract it will be general knowledge but to make it real concern substance the idea must be take from the real existence of thing whatever simple idea have be find to co-exist in any substance these we may with confidence join together again and so make abstract idea of substance for whatever have once have a union in nature may be unite again 13 in we inquiry about substance we must consider idea and not confine we thought to name or species suppose set out by name this if we rightly consider and confine not we thought and abstract idea to name as if there be or could be no other sort of thing than what know name have already determine and as it be set out we should think of thing with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be think a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changeling who have live forty year together without any appearance of reason be something between a man and a beast : which prejudice be found upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two name man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essence that there can come no other species between they : whereas if we will abstract from those name and the supposition of such specific essence make by nature wherein all thing of the same denomination do exactly and equally partake if we would not fancy that there be a certain number of these essence wherein all thing as in mould be cast and form we should find that the idea of the shape motion and life of a man without reason be as much a distinct idea and make as much a distinct sort of thing from man and beast as the idea of the shape of a ass with reason would be different from either that of man or beast and be a species of a animal between or distinct from both 14 objection against a changele be something between a man and beast answer here everybody will be ready to ask if changeling may be suppose something between man and beast pray what be they i answer changeling which be as good a word to signify something different from the signification of man or beast as the name man and beast be to have signification different one from the other this well consider would resolve this matter and show my meaning without any more ado but i be not so unacquainted with the zeal of some man which enable they to spin consequence and to see religion threaten whenever any one venture to quit they form of speak as not to foresee what name such a proposition as this be like to be charge with : and without doubt it will be ask if changeling be something between man and beast what will become of they in the other world to which i answer i it concern I not to know or inquire to they own master they stand or fall it will make they state neither better nor worse whether we determine anything of it or no they be in the hand of a faithful creator and a bountiful father who dispose not of he creature accord to we narrow thought or opinion nor distinguish they accord to name and species of we contrivance and we that know so little of this present world we be in may i think content ourselves without be peremptory in define the different state which creature shall come into when they go off this stage it may suffice we that he have make know to all those who be capable of instruction discoursing and reasoning that they shall come to a account and receive accord to what they have do in this body 15 what will become of changeling in a future state but secondly i answer the force of these man 's question -lrb- viz will you deprive changeling of a future state -rrb- be found on one of these two supposition which be both false the first be that all thing that have the outward shape and appearance of a man must necessarily be design to a immortal future be after this life : or secondly that whatever be of human birth must be so take away these imagination and such question will be groundless and ridiculous i desire then those who think there be no more but a accidental difference between themselves and changeling the essence in both be exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annex to any outward shape of the body the very propose it be i suppose enough to make they disown it no one yet that ever i hear of how much soever immerse in matter allow that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restore hereafter to a everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it be mould into this or that figure and have such a particular frame of its visible part such a opinion as this place immortality in a certain superficial figure turn out of door all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal being have hitherto be conclude immortal and other not this be to attribute more to the outside than inside of thing and to place the excellency of a man more in the external shape of he body than internal perfection of he soul : which be but little better than to annex the great and inestimable advantage of immortality and life everlasting which he have above other material being to annex it i say to the cut of he beard or the fashion of he coat for this or that outward mark of we body no more carry with it the hope of a eternal duration than the fashion of a man 's suit give he reasonable grounds to imagine it will never wear out or that it will make he immortal it will perhaps be say that nobody think that the shape make anything immortal but it be the shape that be the sign of a rational soul within which be immortal i wonder who make it the sign of any such thing : for barely say it will not make it so it would require some proof to persuade one of it no figure that i know speak any such language for it may as rationally be conclude that the dead body of a man wherein there be to be find no more appearance or action of life than there be in a statue have yet nevertheless a living soul in it because of its shape as that there be a rational soul in a changele because he have the outside of a rational creature when he action carry far less mark of reason with they in the whole course of he life than what be to be find in many a beast 16 monster but it be the issue of rational parent and must therefore be conclude to have a rational soul i know not by what logic you must so conclude i be sure this be a conclusion that man nowhere allow of for if they do they would not make bold as everywhere they do to destroy ill-formed and mis-shaped production ay but these be monster let they be so : what will you drivelling unintelligent intractable changele be shall a defect in the body make a monster a defect in the mind -lrb- the far more noble and in the common phrase the far more essential part -rrb- not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of man the want of reason and understanding not this be to bring all back again to what be explode just now : this be to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by he outside to show that accord to the ordinary way of reasoning in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man -lrb- as they make it -rrb- into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace they thought and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the well-shaped changeling be a man have a rational soul though it appear not : this be past doubt say you : make the ear a little longer and more pointed and the nose a little flatter than ordinary and then you begin to boggle : make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you be at a stand : add still more and more of the likeness of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it be a monster and it be demonstration with you that it have no rational soul and must be destroy where now -lrb- i ask -rrb- shall be the just measure which the utmost bound of that shape that carry with it a rational soul for since there have be human foetus produce half beast and half man and other three part one and one part the other and so it be possible they may be in all the variety of approach to the one or the other shape and may have several degree of mixture of the likeness of a man or a brute -- i would gladly know what be those precise lineament which accord to this hypothesis be or be not capable of a rational soul to be join to they what sort of outside be the certain sign that there be or be not such a inhabitant within for till that be do we talk at random of man : and shall always i fear do so as long as we give ourselves up to certain sound and the imagination of settle and fix species in nature we know not what but after all i desire it may be consider that those who think they have answer the difficulty by tell we that a mis-shaped foetus be a monster run into the same fault they be argue against by constitute a species between man and beast for what else i pray be they monster in the case -lrb- if the word monster signify anything at all -rrb- but something neither man nor beast but partake somewhat of either and just so be the changele before mention so necessary be it to quit the common notion of species and essence if we will truly look into the nature of thing and examine they by what we faculty can discover in they as they exist and not by groundless fancy that have be take up about they 17 word and species i have mention this here because i think we can not be too cautious that word and species in the ordinary notion which we have be use to of they impose not on we for i be apt to think therein lie one great obstacle to we clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substance : and from thence have rise a great part of the difficulty about truth and certainty would we accustom ourselves to separate we contemplation and reasoning from word we might in a great measure remedy this inconvenience within we own thought : but yet it would still disturb we in we discourse with other as long as we retain the opinion that species and they essence be anything else but we abstract idea -lrb- such as they be -rrb- with name annex to they to be the sign of they 18 recapitulation wherever we perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of we idea there be certain knowledge : and wherever we be sure those idea agree with the reality of thing there be certain real knowledge of which agreement of we idea with the reality of thing have here give the mark i think i have show wherein it be that certainty real certainty consist which whatever it be to other be i confess to I heretofore one of those desideratum which i find great want of chapter v of truth in general 1 what truth be what be truth be a inquiry many age since and it be that which all mankind either do or pretend to search after it can not but be worth we while carefully to examine wherein it consist and so acquaint ourselves with the nature of it as to observe how the mind distinguish it from falsehood 2 a right join or separate of sign ie either idea or word truth then seem to I in the proper import of the word to signify nothing but the join or seperate of sign as the thing signify by they do agree or disagree one with another the join or separate of sign here mean be what by another name we call proposition so that truth properly belong only to proposition : whereof there be two sort viz mental and verbal as there be two sort of sign commonly make use of viz idea and word 3 which make mental or verbal proposition to form a clear notion of truth it be very necessary to consider truth of thought and truth of word distinctly one from another : but yet it be very difficult to treat of they asunder because it be unavoidable in treat of mental proposition to make use of word : and then the instance give of mental proposition cease immediately to be barely mental and become verbal for a mental proposition be nothing but a bare consideration of the idea as they be in we mind strip of name they lose the nature of purely mental proposition as soon as they be put into word 4 mental proposition be very hard to be treat of and that which make it yet harder to treat of mental and verbal proposition separately be that most man if not all in they thinking and reasoning within themselves make use of word instead of idea at least when the subject of they meditation contain in it complex idea which be a great evidence of the imperfection and uncertainty of we idea of that kind and may if attentively make use of serve for a mark to show we what be those thing we have clear and perfect established idea of and what not for if we will curiously observe the way we mind take in think and reasoning we shall find i suppose that when we make any proposition within we own thought about white or black sweet or bitter a triangle or a circle we can and often do frame in we mind the idea themselves without reflect on the name but when we would consider or make proposition about the more complex idea as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea : because the idea these name stand for be for the most part imperfect confused and undetermined we reflect on the name themselves because they be more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to we thought than the pure idea : and so we make use of these word instead of the idea themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental proposition in substance as have be already notice this be occasion by the imperfection of we idea : we make the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in mode it be occasion by the great number of simple idea that go to the make they up for many of they be compound the name occur much easier than the complex idea itself which require time and attention to be recollect and exactly represent to the mind even in those man who have formerly be at the pain to do it and be utterly impossible to be do by those who though they have ready in they memory the greatest part of the common word of that language yet perhaps never trouble themselves in all they life to consider what precise idea the most of they stand for some confuse or obscure notion have serve they turn and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstruction and humor melancholy and choler would perhaps have little left in they thought and meditation if one should desire they to think only of the thing themselves and lay by those word with which they so often confound other and not seldom themselves also 5 mental and verbal proposition contrast but to return to the consideration of truth : we must i say observe two sort of proposition that we be capable of make : -- first mental wherein the idea in we understanding be without the use of word put together or separate by the mind perceive or judge of they agreement or disagreement secondly verbal proposition which be word the sign of we idea put together or separate in affirmative or negative sentence by which way of affirm or deny these sign make by sound be as it be put together or separate from another so that proposition consist in join or separate sign and truth consist in the put together or separate those sign accord as the thing which they stand for agree or disagree 6 when mental proposition contain real truth and when verbal every one 's experience will satisfy he that the mind either by perceive or suppose the agreement or disagreement of any of its idea do tacitly within itself put they into a kind of proposition affirmative or negative which i have endeavor to express by the term put together and separate but this action of the mind which be so familiar to every thinking and reasoning man be easier to be conceive by reflect on what pass in we when we affirm or deny than to be explain by word when a man have in he head the idea of two line viz the side and diagonal of a square whereof the diagonal be a inch long he may have the idea also of the division of that line into a certain number of equal part vg into five ten a hundred a thousand or any other number and may have the idea of that inch line be divisible or not divisible into such equal part as a certain number of they will be equal to the sideline now whenever he perceive believe or suppose such a kind of divisibility to agree or disagree to he idea of that line he as it be join or separate those two idea viz the idea of that line and the idea of that kind of divisibility and so make a mental proposition which be true or false accord as such a kind of divisibility a divisibility into such aliquot part do really agree to that line or no when idea be so put together or separate in the mind as they or the thing they stand for do agree or not that be as i may call it mental truth but truth of word be something more and that be the affirm or deny of word one of another as the idea they stand for agree or disagree : and this again be two-fold either purely verbal and trifling which i shall speak of -lrb- chap viii -rrb- or real and instructive which be the object of that real knowledge which we have speak of already 7 objection against verbal truth that thus it may all be chimerical but here again will be apt to occur the same doubt about truth that do about knowledge : and it will be object that if truth be nothing but the join and separate of word in proposition as the idea they stand for agree or disagree in man 's mind the knowledge of truth be not so valuable a thing as it be take to be nor worth the pain and time man employ in the search of it : since by this account it amount to no more than the conformity of word to the chimera of man 's brain who know not what odd notion many man 's head be fill with and what strange idea all man 's brain be capable of but if we rest here we know the truth of nothing by this rule but of the visionary word in we own imagination nor have other truth but what as much concern harpy and centaur as man and horse for those and the like may be idea in we head and have they agreement or disagreement there as well as the idea of real being and so have as true proposition make about they and it will be altogether as true a proposition to say all centaur be animal as that all man be animal and the certainty of one as great as the other for in both the proposition the word be put together accord to the agreement of the idea in we mind : and the agreement of the idea of animal with that of centaur be as clear and visable to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two proposition be equally true equally certain but of what use be all such truth to we 8 answer real truth be about idea agree to thing though what have be say in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or -lrb- if you please -rrb- barely nominal they depend both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though we word signify thing the truth they contain when put into proposition will be only verbal when they stand for idea in the mind that have not a agreement with the reality of thing and therefore truth as well as knowledge may well come under the distinction of verbal and real that be only verbal truth wherein term be join accord to the agreement or disagreement of the idea they stand for without regard whether we idea be such as really have or be capable of have a existence in nature but then it be they contain real truth when these sign be join as we idea agree and when we idea be such as we know be capable of have a existence in nature : which in substance we can not know but by know that such have exist 9 truth and falsehood in general truth be the mark down in word the agreement or disagreement of idea as it be falsehood be the mark down in word the agreement or disagreement of idea otherwise than it be and so far as these idea thus mark by sound agree to they archetype so far only be the truth real the knowledge of this truth consist in know what idea the word stand for and the perception of the agreement or disagreement of those idea accord as it be mark by those word 10 general proposition to be treat of more at large but because word be look on as the great conduit of truth and knowledge and that in convey and receive of truth and commonly in reasoning about it we make use of word and proposition i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truth contain in proposition consist and where it be to be have and endeavor to show in what sort of universal proposition we be capable of be certain of they real truth or falsehood i shall begin with general proposition as those which most employ we thought and exercise we contemplation general truth be most look after by the mind as those that most enlarge we knowledge and by they comprehensiveness satisfy we at once of many particulars enlarge we view and shorten we way to knowledge 11 moral and metaphysical truth besides truth take in the strict sense before mention there be other sort of truth : as 1 moral truth which be speak of thing accord to the persuasion of we own mind though the proposition we speak agree not to the reality of thing 2 metaphysical truth which be nothing but the real existence of thing conformable to the idea to which we have annex they name this though it seem to consist in the very being of thing yet when consider a little nearly will appear to include a tacit proposition whereby the mind join that particular thing to the idea it have before settle with the name to it but these consideration of truth either have be before take notice of or not be much to we present purpose it may suffice here only to have mention they chapter vi of universal proposition : they truth and certainty 1 treat of word necessary to knowledge though the examine and judge of idea by themselves they name be quite lay aside be the best and surest way to clear and distinct knowledge : yet through the prevail custom of use sound for idea i think it be very seldom practice every one may observe how common it be for name to be make use of instead of the idea themselves even when man think and reason within they own breast especially if the idea be very complex and make up of a great collection of simple one this make the consideration of word and proposition so necessary a part of the treatise of knowledge that it be very hard to speak intelligibly of the one without explain the other 2 general truth hardly to be understand but in verbal proposition all the knowledge we have be only of particular or general truth it be evident that whatever may be do in the former of these the latter which be that which with reason be most seek after can never be well make known and be very seldom apprehend but as conceive and express in word it be not therefore out of we way in the examination of we knowledge to inquire into the truth and certainty of universal proposition 3 certainty twofold -- of truth and of knowledge but that we may not be mislead in this case by that which be the danger everywhere i mean by the doubtfulness of term it be fit to observe that certainty be twofold : certainty of truth and certainty of knowledge certainty of truth be when word be so put together in proposition as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the idea they stand for as really it be certainty of knowledge be to perceive the agreement or disagreement of idea as express in any proposition this we usually call know or be certain of the truth of any proposition 4 no proposition can be certainly know to be true where the real essence of each species mention be not know now because we can not be certain of the truth of any general proposition unless we know the precise bound and extent of the species its term stand for it be necessary we should know the essence of each species which be that which constitute and bound it this in all simple idea and mode be not hard to do for in these the real and nominal essence be the same or which be all one the abstract idea which the general term stand for be the sole essence and boundary that be or can be suppose of the species there can be no doubt how far the species extend or what thing be comprehend under each term which it be evident be all that have a exact conformity with the idea it stand for and no other but in substance wherein a real essence distinct from the nominal be suppose to constitute determine and bind the species the extent of the general word be very uncertain because not know this real essence we can not know what be or what be not of that species and consequently what may or may not with certainty be affirm of it and thus speaking of a man or gold or any other species of natural substance as suppose constitute by a precise and real essence which nature regularly impart to every individual of that kind whereby it be make to be of that species we can not be certain of the truth of any affirmation or negation make of it for man or gold take in this sense and use for species of thing constitute by real essence different from the complex idea in the mind of the speaker stand for we know not what and the extent of these species with such boundary be so unknown and undetermined that it be impossible with any certainty to affirm that all man be rational or that all gold be yellow but where the nominal essence be keep to as the boundary of each species and man extend the application of any general term no further than to the particular thing in which the complex idea it stand for be to be find there they be in no danger to mistake the bound of each species nor can be in doubt on this account whether any proposition be true or not i have choose to explain this uncertainty of proposition in this scholastic way and have make use of the term of essence and species on purpose to show the absurdity and inconvenience there be to think of they as of any other sort of reality than barely abstract idea with name to they to suppose that the species of thing be anything but the sorting of they under general name accord as they agree to several abstract idea of which we make those name sign be to confound truth and introduce uncertainty into all general proposition that can be make about they though therefore these thing might to people not possess with scholastic learning be treat of in a better and clearer way yet those wrong notion of essence or species have get root in most people 's mind who have receive any tincture from the learning which have prevail in this part of the world be to be discover and remove to make way for that use of word which should convey certainty with it 5 this more particularly concern substance the name of substance then whenever make to stand for species which be suppose to be constitute by real essence which we know not be not capable to convey certainty to the understanding of the truth general proposition make up of such term we can not be sure -lrb- the reason whereof be plain : for how can we be sure that this or that quality be in gold when we know not what be or be not gold since in this way of speak nothing be gold but what partake of a essence which we not know can not know where it be or be not and so can not be sure that any parcel of matter in the world be or be not in this sense gold be incurably ignorant whether it have of have not that which make anything to be call gold i e that real essence of gold whereof we have no idea at all this be as impossible for we to know as it be for a blind man to tell in what flower the color of a pansy be or be not to be find whilst he have no idea of the color of a pansy at all or if we could -lrb- which be impossible -rrb- certainly know where a real essence which we know not be vg in what parcel of matter the real essence of gold be yet could we not be sure that this or that quality could with truth be affirm of gold since it be impossible for we to know that this or that quality or idea have a necessary connexion with a real essence of which we have no idea at all whatever species that suppose real essence may be imagine to constitute -rrb- 6 on the other side the name of substance when make use of as they should be for the idea man have in they mind though they carry a clear and determinate signification with they will not yet serve we to make many universal proposition of whose truth we can be certain not because in this use of they we be uncertain what thing be signify by they but because the complex idea they stand for be such combination of simple one as carry not with they any discoverable connexion or repugnancy but with a very few other idea 7 the complex idea that we name of the species of substance properly stand for be collection of such quality as have be observe to co-exist in a unknown substratum which we call substance but what other quality necessarily co-exist with such combination we can not certainly know unless we can discover they natural dependence which in they primary quality we can go but a very little way in and in all they secondary quality we can discover no connexion at all : for the reason mention chap iii viz 1 because we know not the real constitution of substance on which each secondary quality particularly depend 2 do we know that it would serve we only for experimental -lrb- not universal -rrb- knowledge and reach with certainty no further than that bare instance : because we understanding can discover no conceivable connexion between any secondary quality and any modification whatsoever of any of the primary one and therefore there be very few general proposition to be make concern substance which can carry with they undoubted certainty 8 instance in gold ` all gold be fix ' be a proposition whose truth we can not be certain of how universally soever it be believe for if accord to the useless imagination of the school any one suppose the term gold to stand for a species of thing set out by nature by a real essence belong to it it be evident he know not what particular substance be of that species and so can not with certainty affirm anything universally of gold but if he make gold stand for a species determine by its nominal essence let the nominal essence for example be the complex idea of a body of a certain yellow color malleable fusible and heavier than any other know -- in this proper use of the word gold there be no difficulty to know what be or be not gold but yet no other quality can with certainty be universally affirm or deny of gold but what have a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with that nominal essence fixedness for example have no necessary connexion that we can discover with the color weight or any other simple idea of we complex one or with the whole combination together it be impossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition that all gold be fix 9 no discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence gold and other simple idea as there be no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the color weight and other simple idea of that nominal essence of gold so if we make we complex idea of gold a body yellow fusable ductile weighty and fix we shall be at the same uncertainty concern solubility in aqua regium and for the same reason since we can never from consideration of the idea themselves with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea be make up of yellow very weighty ductile fusible and fix that it be soluble in aqua regium : and so on of the rest of its quality i would gladly meet with one general affirmation concern any will no doubt be presently object be not this a universal proposition all gold be malleable to which i answer it be a very complex idea the word gold stand for but then here be nothing affirm of gold but that that sound stand for a idea in which malleableness be contain : and such a sort of truth and certainty as this it be to say a centaur be four-footed but if malleableness make not a part of the specific essence the name of gold stand for it be plain all gold be malleable be not a certain proposition because let the complex idea of gold be make up of whichsoever of its other quality you please malleableness will not appear to depend on that complex idea nor follow from any simple one contain in it : the connexion that malleableness have -lrb- if it have any -rrb- with those other quality be only by the intervention of the real constitution of its insensible part which since we know not it be impossible we should perceive that connexion unless we could discover that which tie they together 10 as far as any such co-existence can be know so far universal proposition maybe certain but this will go but a little way the more indeed of these co-exist quality we unite into one complex idea under one name the more precise and determinate we make the signification of that word but never yet make it thereby more capable of universal certainty in respect of other quality not contain in we complex idea : since we perceive not they connexion or dependence on one another be ignorant both of that real constitution in which they be all found and also how they flow from it for the chief part of we knowledge concern substance be not as in other thing barely of the relation of two idea that may exist separately but be of the necessary connexion and co-existence of several distinct idea in the same subject or of they repugnancy so to co-exist could we begin at the other end and discover what it be wherein that color consist what make a body lighter or heavier what texture of part make it malleable fusible and fixed and fit to be dissolve in this sort of liquor and not in another -- if i say we have such a idea as this of body and could perceive wherein all sensible quality originally consist and how they be produce we might frame such abstract idea of they as would furnish we with matter of more general knowledge and enable we to make universal proposition that should carry general truth and certainty with they but whilst we complex idea of the sort of substance be so remote from that internal real constitution on which they sensible quality depend and be make up of nothing but a imperfect collection of those apparent quality we sens can discover there can be few general proposition concern substance of whose real truth we can be certainly assure since there be but few simple idea of whose connexion and necessary co-existence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary quality of substance and the power relate to they there can not any two be name whose necessary co-existence or repugnance to co-exist can certainly be know unless in those of the same sense which necessarily exclude one another as i have elsewhere show no one i think by the color that be in any body can certainly know what smell taste sound or tangible quality it have nor what alteration it be capable to make or receive on or from other body the same may be say of the sound or taste & c we specific name of substance stand for any collection of such idea it be not to be wonder that we can with they make very few general proposition of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substance contain in it any simple idea whose necessary co-existence with any other may be discover so far universal proposition may with certainty be make concern it : vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the color or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signify by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concern gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold be malliable would be as certain as of this the three angle of all right-lined triangle be all equal to two right one 11 the quality which make we complex idea of substance depend mostly on external remote and unperceived cause have we such idea of substance as to know what real constitution produce those sensible quality we find in they and how those quality flow from thence we could by the specific idea of they real essence in we own mind more certainly find out they property and discover what quality they have or have not than we can now by we sens : and to know the property of gold it would be no more necessary that gold should exist and that we should make experiment upon it than it be necessary for the know the property of a triangle that a triangle should exist in any matter the idea in we mind would serve for the one as well as the other but we be so far from be admit into the secret of nature that we scarce so much as ever approach the first entrance towards they for we be wont to consider the substance we meet with each of they as a entire thing by itself have all its quality in itself and independent of other thing overlook for the most part the operation of those invisible fluid they be encompass with and upon whose motion and operation depend the greatest part of those quality which be take notice of in they and be make by we the inherent mark of distinction whereby we know and denominate they put a piece of gold anywhere by itself separate from the reach and influence of all other body it will immediately lose all its color and weight and perhaps malleableness too which for aught i know would be change into a perfect friability water in which to we fluidity be a essential quality leave to itself would cease to be fluid but if inanimate body owe so much of they present state to other body without they that they would not be what they appear to we be those body that environ they remove it be yet more so in vegetable which be nourished grow and produce leaf flower and seed in a constant succession and if we look a little nearer into the state of animal we shall find that they dependence as to life motion and the most considerable quality to be observe in they be so wholly on extrinsical cause and quality of other body that make no part of they that they can not subsist a moment without they : though yet those body on which they depend be little take notice of and make no part of the complex idea we frame of those animal take the air but for a minute from the greatest part of live creature and they presently lose sense life and motion this the necessity of breathing have force into we knowledge but how many other extrinsical and possibly very remote body do the spring of these admirable machine depend on which be not vulgarly observe or so much as think on and how many be there which the severest inquiry can never discover the inhabitant of this spot of the universe though remove so many million of mile from the sun yet depend so much on the duly temper motion of particle come from or agitate by it that be this earth remove but a small part of the distance out of its present situation and place a little further or nearer that source of heat it be more than probable that the greatest part of the animal in it would immediately perish : since we find they so often destroy by a excess or defect of the sun 's warmth which a accidental position in some part of this we little globe expose they to the quality observe in a loadstone must need have they source far beyond the confines of that body and the ravage make often on several sort of animal by invisible cause the certain death -lrb- as we be tell -rrb- of some of they by barely pass the line or as it be certain of other by be remove into a neighbouring country evidently show that the concurrence and operation of several body with which they be seldom think to have anything to do be absolutely necessary to make they be what they appear to we and to preserve those quality by which we know and distinguish they we be then quite out of the way when we think that thing contain within themselves the quality that appear to we in they and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or a elephant upon which depend those quality and power we observe in they for which perhaps to understand they aright we ought to look not only beyond this we earth and atmosphere but even beyond the sun or remotest star we eye have yet discover for how much the be and operation of particular substance in this we globe depend on cause utterly beyond we view be impossible for we to determine we see and perceive some of the motion and grosser operation of thing here about we but whence the stream come that keep all these curious machine in motion and repair how convey and modify be beyond we notice and apprehension : and the great part and wheel as i may so say of this stupendous structure of the universe may for aught we know have such a connexion and dependence in they influence and operation one upon another that perhaps thing in this we mansion would put on quite another face and cease to be what they be if some one of the star or great body incomprehensibly remote from we should cease to be or move as it do this be certain : thing however absolute and entire they seem in themselves be but retainer to other part of nature for that which they be most take notice of by we they observable quality action and power be owe to something without they and there be not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature which do not owe the be it have and the excellence of it to its neighbor and we must not confine we thought within the surface of any body but look a great deal further to comprehend perfectly those quality that be in it 12 we nominal essence of substance furnish few universal proposition about they that be certain if this be so it be not to be wonder that we have very imperfect idea of substance and that the real essence on which depend they property and operation be unknown to we we can not discover so much as that size figure and texture of they minute and active part which be really in much less the different motion and impulse make in and upon they by body from without upon which depend and by which be form the greatest and most remarkable part of those quality we observe in they and of which we complex idea of they be make up this consideration alone be enough to put a end to all we hope of ever have the idea of they real essence which whilst we want the nominal essence we make use of instead of they will be able to furnish we but very sparingly with any general knowledge or universal proposition capable of real certainty 13 judgment of probability concern substance may reach further : but that be not knowledge we be not therefore to wonder if certainty be to be find in very few general proposition make concern substance : we knowledge of they quality and property go very seldom further than we sens reach and inform we possibly inquisitive and observe man may by strength of judgment penetrate further and on probability take from wary observation and hint well lay together often guess right at what experience have not yet discover to they but this be but guess still it amount only to opinion and have not that certainty which be requisite to knowledge for all general knowledge lie only in we own thought and consist barely in the contemplation of we own abstract idea wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement amongst they there we have general knowledge and by put the name of those idea together accordingly in proposition can with certainty pronounce general truth but because the abstract idea of substance for which they specific name stand whenever they have any distinct and determinate signification have a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with but a very few other idea the certainty of universal proposition concern substance be very narrow and scanty in that part which be we principal inquiry concern they and there be scarce any of the name of substance let the idea it be apply to be what it will of which we can generally and with certainty pronounce that it have or have not this or that other quality belong to it and constantly co-exist or inconsistent with that idea wherever it be to be find 14 what be requisite for we knowledge of substance before we can have any tolerable knowledge of this kind we must first know what change the primary quality of one body do regularly produce in the primary quality of another and how secondly we must know what primary quality of any body produce certain sensation or idea in we this be in truth no less than to know all the effect of matter under its diver modification of bulk figure cohesion of part motion and rest which i think every body will allow be utterly impossible to be know by we without revelation nor if it be reveal to we what sort of figure bulk and motion of corpuscle would produce in we the sensation of a yellow color and what sort of figure bulk and texture of part in the superficies of any body be fit to give such corpuscle they due motion to produce that color would that be enough to make universal proposition with certainty concern the several sort of they unless we have faculty acute enough to perceive the precise bulk figure texture and motion of body in those minute part by which they operate on we sens so that we might by those frame we abstract idea of they i have mention here only corporeal substance whose operation seem to lie more level to we understanding for as to the operation of spirit both they thinking and moving of body we at first sight find ourselves at a loss though perhaps when we have apply we thought a little nearer to the consideration of body and they operation and examine how far we notion even in these reach with any clearness beyond sensible matter of fact we shall be bind to confess that even in these too we discovery amount to very little beyond perfect ignorance and incapacity 15 whilst we complex idea of substance contain not idea of they real constitution we can make but few general proposition concern they this be evident the abstract complex idea of substance for which they general name stand not comprehend they real constitution can afford we very little universal certainty because we idea of they be not make up of that on which those quality we observe in they and would inform ourselves about do depend or with which they have any certain connexion : vg let the idea to which we give the name man be as it commonly be a body of the ordinary shape with sense voluntary motion and reason join to it this be the abstract idea and consequently the essence of we species man we can make but very few general certain proposition concern man standing for such a idea because not know the real constitution on which sensation power of motion and reasoning with that peculiar shape depend and whereby they be unite together in the same subject there be very few other quality with which we can perceive they to have a necessary connexion : and therefore we can not with certainty affirm : that all man sleep by interval that no man can be nourish by wood or stone that all man will be poison by hemlock : because these idea have no connexion nor repugnancy with this we nominal essence of man with this abstract idea that name stand for we must in these and the like appeal to trial in particular subject which can reach but a little way we must content ourselves with probability in the rest : but can have no general certainty whilst we specific idea of man contain not that real constitution which be the root wherein all he inseparable quality be unite and from whence they flow whilst we idea the word man stand for be only a imperfect collection of some sensible quality and power in he there be no discernible connexion or repugnance between we specific idea and the operation of either the part of hemlock or stone upon he constitution there be animal that safely eat hemlock and other that be nourish by wood and stone : but as long as we want idea of those real constitution of different sort of animal whereon these and the like quality and power depend we must not hope to reach certainty in universal proposition concern they those few idea only which have a discernible connexion with we nominal essence or any part of it can afford we such proposition but these be so few and of so little moment that we may justly look on we certain general knowledge of substance as almost none at all 16 wherein lie the general certainty of proposition to conclude : general proposition of what kind soever be then only capable of certainty when the term use in they stand for such idea whose agreement or disagreement as there express be capable to be discover by we and we be then certain of they truth or falsehood when we perceive the idea the term stand for to agree or not agree accord as they be affirm or deny one of another whence we may take notice that general certainty be never to be find but in we idea whenever we go to seek it elsewhere in experiment or observation without we we knowledge go not beyond particulars it be the contemplation of we own abstract idea that alone be able to afford we general knowledge chapter vii of maxim 1 maxim or axiom be self-evident proposition there be a sort of proposition which under the name of maxim and axiom have pass for principle of science : and because they be self-evident have be suppose innate without that anybody -lrb- that i know -rrb- ever go about to show the reason and foundation of they clearness or cogency it may however be worth while to inquire into the reason of they evidence and see whether it be peculiar to they alone and also to examine how far they influence and govern we other knowledge 2 where in that self-evidence consist knowledge as have be show consist in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of idea now where that agreement or disagreement be perceive immediately by itself without the intervention or help of any other there we knowledge be self-evident this will appear to be so to any who will but consider any of those proposition which without any proof he assent to at first sight : for in all of they he will find that the reason of he assent be from that agreement or disagreement which the mind by a immediate compare they find in those idea answer the affirmation or negation in the proposition 3 self evidence not peculiar to receive axiom this be so in the next place let we consider whether this self-evidence be peculiar only to those proposition which commonly pass under the name of maxim and have the dignity of axiom allow they and here it be plain that several other truth not allow to be axiom partake equally with they in this self-evidence this we shall see if we go over these several sort of agreement or disagreement of idea which i have above mention viz identity relation co-existence and real existence which will discover to we that not only those few proposition which have have the credit of maxim be self-evident but a great many even almost a infinite number of other proposition be such 4 as to identity and diversity all proposition be equally self-evident i for first the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of identity be found in the mind 's have distinct idea this afford we as many self-evident proposition as we have distinct idea every one that have any knowledge at all have as the foundation of it various and distinct idea : and it be the first act of the mind -lrb- without which it can never be capable of any knowledge -rrb- to know every one of its idea by itself and distinguish it from other every one find in himself that he know the idea he have that he know also when any one be in he understanding and what it be and that when more than one be there he know they distinctly and unconfusedly one from another which always be so -lrb- it be impossible but that he should perceive what he perceive -rrb- he can never be in doubt when any idea be in he mind that it be there and be that idea it be and that two distinct idea when they be in he mind be there and be not one and the same idea so that all such affirmation and negation be make without any possibility of doubt uncertainty or hesitation and must necessarily be assent to as soon as understand that be as soon as we have in we mind -lrb- determine idea -rrb- which the term in the proposition stand for -lrb- and therefore whenever the mind with attention consider any proposition so as to perceive the two idea signify by the term and affirm or deny one of the other to be the same or different it be presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition and this equally whether these proposition be in term stand for more general idea or such as be less so : vg whether the general idea of be be affirm of itself as in this proposition ` whatsoever be be ' or a more particular idea be affirm of itself as ' a man be a man ' or ` whatsoever be white be white ' or whether the idea of be in general be deny of not-being which be the only -lrb- if i may so call it -rrb- idea different from it as in this other proposition ` it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be ' : or any idea of any particular be be deny of another different from it as ' a man be not a horse ' ` red be not blue ' the difference of the idea as soon as the term be understand make the truth of the proposition presently visible and that with a equal certainty and easiness in the less as well as the more general proposition and all for the same reason viz because the mind perceive in any idea that it have the same idea to be the same with itself and two different idea to be different and not the same and this it be equally certain of whether these idea be more or less general abstract and comprehensive -rrb- it be not therefore alone to these two general proposition -- ` whatsoever be be ' and ` it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be ' -- that this sort of self-evidence belong by any peculiar right the perception of be or not be belong no more to these vague idea signify by the term whatsoever and thing than it do to any other idea -lrb- these two general maxim amount to no more in short but this that the same be the same and the same be not different be truth know in more particular instance as well as in those general maxim and know also in particular instance before these general maxim be ever think on and draw all they force from the discernment of the mind employ about particular idea there be nothing more visible than that -rrb- the mind without the help of any proof -lrb- or reflection on either of these general proposition -rrb- perceive so clearly and know so certainly that the idea of white be the idea of white and not the idea of blue and that the idea of white when it be in the mind be there and be not absent -lrb- that the consideration of these axiom can add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge -rrb- -lrb- just so it be -lrb- as every one may experiment in himself -rrb- in all the idea a man have in he mind : he know each to be itself and not to be another and to be in he mind and not away when it be there with a certainty that can not be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be know with a greater certainty nor add anything to this -rrb- so that in respect of identity we intuitive knowledge reach as far as we idea and we be capable of make as many self-evident proposition as we have name for distinct idea and i appeal to every one 's own mind whether this proposition ' a circle be a circle ' be not as self-evident a proposition as that consist of more general term ` whatsoever be be ' and again whether this proposition ` blue be not red ' be not a proposition that the mind can no more doubt of as soon as it understand the word than it do of that axiom ` it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be ' and so of all the like 5 in co-existance we have few self-evident proposition ii secondly as to co-existance or such a necessary connexion between two idea that in the subject where one of they be suppose there the other must necessarily be also : of such agreement or disagreement as this the mind have a immediate perception but in very few of they and therefore in this sort we have but very little intuitive knowledge : nor be there to be find very many proposition that be self-evident though some there be : vg the idea of fill a place equal to the contents of its superficies be annex to we idea of body i think it be a self-evident proposition that two body can not be in the same place 6 iii in other relation we may have many thirdly as to the relation of mode mathematician have frame many axiom concern that one relation of equality as ` equal take from equal the remainder will be equal ' which with the rest of that kind however they be receive for maxim by the mathematician and be unquestionable truth yet i think that any one who consider they will not find that they have a clearer self-evidence than these -- that ` one and one be equal to two ' that ` if you take from the five finger of one hand two and from the five finger of the other hand two the remain number will be equal ' these and a thousand other such proposition may be find in number which at the very first hearing force the assent and carry with they a equal if not greater clearness than those mathematical axiom 7 iv concern real existence we have none fourthly as to real existance since that have no connexion with any other of we idea but that of ourselves and of a first be we have in that concern the real existence of all other being not so much as demonstrative much less a self-evident knowledge : and therefore concern those there be no maxim 8 these axiom do not much influence we other knowledge in the next place let we consider what influence these receive maxim have upon the other part of we knowledge the rule establish in the school that all reasoning be ex praecognitis et praeconcessis seem to lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxim and to suppose they to be praecognita whereby i think be mean these two thing : first that these axiom be those truth that be first know to the mind and secondly that upon they the other part of we knowledge depend 9 because maxim or axiom be not the truth we first know first that they be not the truth first know to the mind be evident to experience as we have show in another place -lrb- book i chap 1 -rrb- who perceive not that a child certainly know that a stranger be not its mother that its sucking-bottle be not the rod long before he know that ` it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be ' and how many truth be there about number which it be obvious to observe that the mind be perfectly acquaint with and fully convince of before it ever think on these general maxim to which mathematician in they arguing do sometimes refer they whereof the reason be very plain : for that which make the mind assent to such proposition be nothing else but the perception it have of the agreement or disagreement of its idea accord as it find they affirm or deny one of another in word it understand and every idea be know to be what it be and every two distinct idea be know not to be the same it must necessarily follow that such self-evident truth must be first know which consist of idea that be first in the mind and the idea first in the mind it be evident be those of particular thing from whence by slow degree the understanding proceed to some few general one which be take from the ordinary and familiar object of sense be settle in the mind with general name to they thus particular idea be first receive and distinguish and so knowledge get about they and next to they the less general or specific which be next to particular for abstract idea be not so obvious or easy to child or the yet unexercised mind as particular one if they seem so to grow man it be only because by constant and familiar use they be make so for when we nicely reflect upon they we shall find that general idea be fiction and contrivance of the mind that carry difficulty with they and do not so easily offer themselves as we be apt to imagine for example do it not require some pain and skill to form the general idea of a triangle -lrb- which be yet none of the more abstract comprehensive and difficult -rrb- for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalinon but all and none of these at once in effect it be something imperfect that can not exist a idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistant idea be put together it be true the mind in this imperfect state have need of such idea and make all the haste to they it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it be naturally very much inclined but yet one have reason to suspect such idea be mark of we imperfection at least this be enough to show that the most abstract and general idea be not those that the mind be first and most easily acquaint with nor such as its earliest knowledge be conversant about 10 because on perception of they the other part of we knowledge do not depend secondly from what have be say it plainly follow that these magnify maxim be not the principle and foundation of all we other knowledge for if there be a great many other truth which have as much self-evidence as they and a great many that we know before they it be impossible they should be the principle from which we deduce all other truth be it impossible to know that one and two be equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz ` the whole be equal to all its part take together ' many a one know that one and two be equal to three without have hear or think on that or any other axiom by which it might be prove and know it as certainly as any other man know that ` the whole be equal to all its part ' or any other maxim and all from the same reason of self-evidence : the equality of those idea be as visible and certain to he without that or any other axiom as with it it need no proof to make it perceive nor after the knowledge that the whole be equal to all its part do he know that one and two be equal to three better or more certainly than he do before for if there be any odds in those idea the whole and part be more obscure or at least more difficult to be settle in the mind than those of one two and three and indeed i think i may ask these man who will need have all knowledge besides those general principle themselves to depend on general innate and self-evident principle what principle be requisite to prove that one and one be two that two and two be four that three time two be six which be know without any proof do evince that either all knowledge do not depend on certain praecognita or general maxim call principle or else that these be principle : and if these be to be count principle a great part of numeration will be so to which if we add all the self-evident proposition which may be make about all we distinct idea principle will be almost infinite at least innumerable which man arrive to the knowledge of at different age and a great many of these innate principle they never come to know all they life but whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later this be true of they that they be all know by they native evidence be wholly independent receive no light nor be capable of any proof one from another much less the more particular from the more general or the more simple from the more compound the more simple and less abstract be the most familiar and the easier and earlier apprehend but whichever be the clearest idea the evidence and certainty of all such proposition be in this that a man see the same idea to be the same idea and infallibly perceive two different idea to be different idea for when a man have in he understand the idea of one and of two the idea of yellow and the idea of blue he can not but certainly know that the idea of one be the idea of one and not the idea of two and that the idea of yellow be the idea of yellow and not the idea of blue for a man can not confound the idea in he mind which he have distinct : that would be to have they confused and distinct at the same time which be a contradiction : and to have none distinct be to have no use of we faculty to have no knowledge at all and therefore what idea soever be affirm of itself or whatsoever two entire distinct idea be deny one of another the mind can not but assent to such a proposition as infallibly true as soon as it understand the term without hesitation or need of proof or regard those make in more general term and call maxim 11 what use these general maxim or axiom have -lrb- what shall we then say be these general maxim of no use by no means though perhaps they use be not that which it be commonly take to be but since doubt in the least of what have be by some man ascribe to these maxim may be apt to be cry out against as overturn the foundation of all the science it may be worth while to consider they with respect to other part of we knowledge and examine more particularly to what purpose they serve and to what not -lcb- of no use to prove less general proposition nor as foundation on consideration of which any science have be build -rcb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be evident from what have be already say that they be of no use to prove or confirm less general self-evident proposition -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be as plain that they be not nor have be the foundation whereon any science have be build there be i know a great deal of talk propagate from scholastic man of science and the maxim on which they be build : but it have be my ill-luck never to meet with any such science much less any one build upon these two maxim what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i would be glad to be show where any such science erect upon these or any other general axiom be to be find : and should be oblige to any one who would lay before I the frame and system of any science so build on these or any such like maxim that could not be show to stand as firm without any consideration of they i ask whether these general maxim have not the same use in the study of divinity and in theological question that they have in other science they serve here too to silence wrangler and put a end to dispute but i think that nobody will therefore say that the christian religion be build upon these maxim or that the knowledge we have of it be derive from these principle it be from revelation we have receive it and without revelation these maxim have never be able to help we to it when we find out a idea by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two other this be a revelation from god to we by the voice of reason : for we then come to know a truth that we do not know before when god declare any truth to we this be a revelation to we by the voice of he spirit and we be advance in we knowledge but in neither of these do we receive we light or knowledge from maxim but in the one the thing themselves afford it : and we see the truth in they by perceive they agreement or disagreement in the other god himself afford it immediately to we : and we see the truth of what he say in he unerring veracity -lrb- 3 -rrb- nor as help in the discovery of yet unknown truth they be not of use to help man forward in the advancement of science or new discovery of yet unknown truth mr newton in he never enough to be admire book have demonstrate several proposition which be so many new truth before unknown to the world and be further advance in mathematical knowledge : but for the discovery of these it be not the general maxim ` what be be ' or ` the whole be bigger than a part ' or the like that help he these be not the clue that lead he into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those proposition nor be it by they that he get the knowledge of those demonstration but by find out intermediate idea that show the agreement or disagreement of the idea as express in the proposition he demonstrate this be the greatest exercise and improvement of human understanding in the enlarge of knowledge and advance the science wherein they be far enough from receive any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnify maxim would those who have this traditional admiration of these proposition that they think no step can be make in knowledge without the support of a axiom no stone lay in the building of the science without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquire knowledge and of communicate it between the method of raise any science and that of teach it to other as far as it be advance -- they would see that those general maxim be not the foundation on which the first discoverer raise they admirable structure nor the key that unlock and open those secret of knowledge though afterwards when school be erect and science have they professor to teach what other have find out they often make use of maxim ie lay down certain proposition which be self-evident or to be receive for true which be settle in the mind of they scholar as unquestionable verity they on occasion make use of to convince they of truth in particular instance that be not so familiar to they mind as those general axiom which have before be inculcate to they and carefully settle in they mind though these particular instance when well reflect on be no less self-evident to the understanding than the general maxim bring to confirm they : and it be in those particular instance that the first discoverer find the truth without the help of the general maxim : and so may any one else do who with attention consider they -lcb- maxim of use in the exposition of what have be discover and in silencing obstinate wrangler -rcb- to come therefore to the use that be make of maxim -lrb- 1 -rrb- they be of use as have be observe in the ordinary method of teaching science as far as they be advance : but of little or none in advance they further -lrb- 2 -rrb- they be of use in dispute for the silencing of obstinate wrangler and bring those contest to some conclusion whether a need of they to that end come not in the manner follow i crave leave to inquire the school have make disputation the touchstone of man 's ability and the criterion of knowledge adjudge victory to he that keep the field : and he that have the last word be conclude to have the better of the argument if not of the cause but because by this mean there be like to be no decision between skilful combatant whilst one never fail of a medius terminus to prove any proposition and the other could as constantly without or with a distinction deny the major or minor to prevent as much as could be run out of dispute into a endless train of syllogism certain general proposition -- most of they indeed self-evident -- be introduce into the school : which be such as all man allow and agree in be look on as general measure of truth and serve instead of principle -lrb- where the disputant have not lie down any other between they -rrb- beyond which there be no go and which must not be recede from by either side and thus these maxim get the name of principle beyond which man in dispute could not retreat be by mistake take to be the original and source from whence all knowledge begin and the foundation whereon the science be build because when in they dispute they come to any of these they stop there and go no further the matter be determine but how much this be a mistake have be already show -lcb- how maxim come to be so much in vogue -rcb- this method of the school which have be think the fountain of knowledge introduce as i suppose the like use of these maxim into a great part of conversation out of the school to stop the mouth of caviller whom any one be excuse from argue any longer with when they deny these general self-evident principle receive by all reasonable man who have once think of they : but yet they use herein be but to put a end to wrangle they in truth when urge in such case teach nothing : that be already do by the intermediate idea make use of in the debate whose connexion may be see without the help of those maxim and so the truth know before the maxim be produce and the argument bring to a first principle man would give off a wrong argument before it come to that if in they dispute they propose to themselves the finding and embrace of truth and not a contest for victory and thus maxim have they use to put a stop to they perverseness whose ingenuity should have yield sooner but the method of the school have allow and encourage man to oppose and resist evident truth till they be baffle ie till they be reduce to contradict themselves or some established principle : it be no wonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that which in the school be count a virtue and a glory viz obstinately to maintain that side of the question they have choose whether true or false to the last extremity even after conviction a strange way to attain truth and knowledge : and that which i think the rational part of mankind not corrupt by education could scare believe should ever be admit amongst the lover of truth and student of religion or nature or introduce into the seminary of those who be to propegate the truth of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and unconvinced how much such a way of learning be like to turn young man 's mind from the sincere search and love of truth nay and to make they doubt whether there be any such thing or at least worth the adhering to i shall not now inquire this i think that bate those place which bring the peripatetic philosophy into they school where it continue many age without teach the world anything but the art of wrangle these maxim be nowhere think the foundation on which the science be build nor the great help to the advancement of knowledge -rrb- -lcb- of great use to stop wrangler in dispute but of little use to the discovery of truth -rcb- as to these general maxim therefore they be as i have say of great use in dispute to stop the mouth of wrangler but not of much use to the discovery of unknown truth or to help the mind forwards in its search after knowledge for who ever begin to build he knowledge on this general proposition what be be or it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be : and from either of these as from a principle of science deduce a system of useful knowledge wrong opinion often involve contradiction one of these maxim as a touchstone may serve well to show whither they lead but yet however fit to lay open the absurdity or mistake of a man 's reasoning or opinion they be of very little use for enlighten the understanding : and it will not be find that the mind receive much help from they in its progress in knowledge which would be neither less nor less certain be these two general proposition never think on it be true as i have say they sometimes serve in argumentation to stop a wrangler 's mouth by show the absurdity of what he saith -lrb- and by expose he to the shame of contradict what all the world know and he himself can not but own to be true -rrb- but it be one thing to show a man that he be in a error and another to put he in possession of truth and i would fain know what truth these two proposition be able to teach and by they influence make we know which we do not know before or could not know without they let we reason from they as well as we can they be only about identical predication and influence if any at all none but such each particular proposition concern identity or diversity be as clearly and certainly know in itself if attend to as either of these general one : -lrb- only these general one as serve in all case be therefore more inculcate and insist on -rrb- as to other less general maxim many of they be no more than bare verbal proposition and teach we nothing but the respect and import of name one to another ` the whole be equal to all its part : ' what real truth i beseech you do it teach we what more be contain in that maxim than what the signification of the word totum or the whole do of itself import and he that know that the word whole stand for what be make up of all its part know very little less than that the whole be equal to all its part and upon the same ground i think that this proposition ' a hill be higher than a valley ' and several the like may also pass for maxim but yet -lrb- master of mathematics when they would as teacher of what they know initiate other in that science do not -rrb- without reason place this and some other such maxim -lrb- at the entrance of they system -rrb- that they scholar have in the beginning perfectly acquaint they thought with these proposition make in such general term may be use to make such reflection and have these more general proposition as form rule and saying ready to apply to all particular case not that if they be equally weigh they be more clear and evident than the particular instance they be bring to confirm but that be more familiar to the mind the very name they be enough to satisfy the understanding but this i say be more from we custom of use they and the establishment they have get in we mind by we often think of they than from the different evidence of the thing but before custom have settle method of think and reasoning in we mind i be apt to imagine it be quite otherwise and that the child when a part of he apple be take away know it better in that particular instance than by this general proposition ` the whole be equal to all its part ' and that if one of these have need to be confirm to he by the other the general have more need to be let into he mind by the particular than the particular by the general for in _ particulars _ we knowledge begin and so spread itself by degree to _ general _ -lrb- footnote : this be the order in time of the conscious acquistion of knowledge that be human the _ essay _ might be regard as a commentary on this one sentence we intellectual progress be from particulars and involuntary recipiency through reactive doubt and criticism into what be at last reason faith -rrb- though afterwards the mind take the quite contrary course and have draw its knowledge into as general proposition as it can make those familiar to its thought and accustom itself to have recourse to they as to the standard of truth and falsehood -lrb- footnote : this be the philosophic attitude therein one consciously apprehend the intellectual necessity that be unconciously presuppose its previous intellectual progress in philosophy we ` draw we knowledge into as general proposition as it can ' be make to assume and thus either learn to see it as a organic while in a speculative unity or learn that it can not be so see in a finite intelligence and that even at the last it must remain ` break ' and mysterious in the human understanding -rrb- by which familiar use of they as rule to measure the truth of other proposition it come in time to be think that more particular proposition have they truth and evidence from they conformity to these more general one which in discourse and argumentation be so frequently urge and constantly admit and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many self-evident proposition the most general only have have the title of maxim 12 maxim if care be not take in the use of word may prove contradiction one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concern these general maxim that they be so far from improve or establish we mind in true knowledge that if we notion be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up we thought to the sound of word rather than -lrb- fix they on settle determine -rrb- idea of thing i say these general maxim will serve to confirm we in mistake and in such a way of use of word which be most common will serve to prove contradiction : vg he that with descarte shall frame in he mind a idea of what he call body to be nothing but extension may easily demonstrate that there be no vacuum ie no space void of body by this maxim what be be for the idea to which he annex the name body be bare extension he knowledge that space can not be without body be certain for he know he own idea of extension clearly and distinctly and know that it be what it be and not another idea though it be call by these three name -- extension body space which three word stand for one and the same idea may no doubt with the same evidence and certainty be affirm one of another as each of itself : and it be as certain that whilst i use they all to stand for one and the same idea this predication be as true and identical in its signification that ` space be body ' as this predication be true and identical that ` body be body ' both in signification and sound 13 instance in vacuum but if another should come and make to himself another idea different from descarte 's of the thing which yet with descarte he call by the same name body and make he idea which he express by the word body to be of a thing that have both extension and solidity together he will as easily demonstrate that there may be a vacuum or space without a body as descarte demonstrate the contrary because the idea to which he give the name space be barely the simple one of extension and the idea to which he give the name body be the complex idea of extension and resistibility or solidity together in the same subject these two idea be not exactly one and the same but in the understanding as distinct as the idea of one and two white and black or as of corporeity and humanity if i may use those barbarous term : and therefore the predication of they in we mind or in word stand for they be not identical but the negation of they one of another -lrb- viz this proposition : ` extension or space be not body ' be -rrb- as true and evidently certain as this maxim it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be -lrb- can make any proposition -rrb- 14 but they prove not the existance of thing without we but yet though both these proposition -lrb- as you see -rrb- may be equally demonstrate viz that there may be a vacuum and that there can not be a vacuum by these two certain principle viz what be be and the same thing can not be and not be : yet neither of these principle will serve to prove to we that any or what body do exist : for that we be leave to we sens to discover to we as far as they can those universal and self-evident principle be only we constant clear and distinct knowledge of we own idea more general or comprehensive can assure we of nothing that pass without the mind : they certainty be found only upon the knowledge we have of each idea by itself and of its distinction from other about which we can not be mistaken whilst they be in we mind though we may be and often be mistake when we retain the name without the idea or use they confusedly sometimes for one and sometimes for another idea in which case the force of these axiom reach only to the sound and not the signification of the word serve only to lead we into confusion mistake and error -lrb- it be to show man that these maxim however cry up for the great guard of truth will not secure they from error in a careless loose use of they word that i have make this remark in all that be here suggest concern they little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined idea i have be far enough from say or intend they should be lay aside as some have be too forward to charge I i affirm they to be truth self-evident truth and so can not be lay aside as far as they influence will reach it be in vain to endeavor nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think they use be not answerable to the great stress which seem to be lay on they and i may warn man not to make a ill use of they for the confirm themselves in error -rrb- 15 they can not add to we knowledge of substance and they application to complex idea be dangerous but let they be of what use they will in verbal proposition they can not discover or prove to we the least knowledge of the nature of substance as they be find and exist without we any further than ground on experience and though the consequence of these two proposition call principle be very clear and they use not dangerous or hurtful in the probation of such thing wherein there be no need at all of they for proof but such as be clear by themselves without they viz where we idea be -lrb- determine -rrb- and know by the name that stand for they : yet when these principle viz what be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be make use of in the probation of proposition wherein be word stand for complex idea vg man horse gold virtue there they be of infinite danger and most commonly make man receive and retain falsehood for manifest truth and uncertainty for demonstration : upon which follow error obstinacy and all the mischief that can happen from wrong reasoning the reason whereof be not that these principle be less true -lrb- or of less force -rrb- in prove proposition make of term stand for complex idea than where the proposition be about simple idea -lrb- but because man mistake generally -- think that where the same term be preserve the proposition be about the same thing though the idea they stand for be in truth different therefore these maxim be make use of to support those which in sound and appearance be contradictory proposition and be clear in the demonstration above mention about a vacuum so that whilst man take word for thing as usually they do these maxim may and do commonly serve to prove contradictory proposition as shall yet be further make manifest -rrb- 16 instance in demonstration about man which can only be verbal for instance : let man be that concern which you would by these first principle demonstrate anything and we shall see that so far as demonstration be by these principle it be only verbal and give we no certain universal true proposition or knowledge of any be exist without we first a child have frame the idea of a man it be probable that he idea be just like that picture which the painter make of the visible appearance join together and such a complication of idea together in he understanding make up the single complex idea which he call man whereof white or flesh-colour in england be one the child can demonstrate to you that a negro be not a man because white color be one of the constant simple idea of the complex idea he call man and therefore he can demonstrate by the principle it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that a negro be not a man the foundation of he certainty be not that universal proposition which perhaps he never hear nor think of but the clear distinct perception he have of he own simple idea of black and white which he can not be persuade to take nor can ever mistake one for another whether he know that maxim or no and to this child or any one who have such a idea which he call man can you never demonstrate that a man have a soul because he idea of man include no such notion or idea in it and therefore to he the principle of what be be prove not this matter but it depend upon collection and observation by which he be to make he complex idea call man 17 another instance secondly another that have go further in frame and collect the idea he call man and to the outward shape add laughter and rational discourse may demonstrate that infant and changeling be no man by this maxim it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i have discourse with very rational man who have actually deny that they be man 18 a third instance thirdly perhaps another make up the complex idea which he call man only out of the idea of body in general and the power of language and reason and leave out the shape wholly : this man be able to demonstrate that a man may have no hand but be quadrupe neither of those be include in he idea of man : and in whatever body or shape he find speech and reason join that be a man because have a clear knowledge of such a complex idea it be certain that what be be 19 little use of these maxim in proof where we have clear and distinct idea so that if rightly consider i think we may say that where we idea be determine in we mind and have annex to they by we known and steady name under those settle determination there be little need or no use at all of these maxim to prove the agreement or disagreement of any of they he that can not discern the truth or falsehood of such proposition without the help of these and the like maxim will not be help by these maxim to do it : since he can not be suppose to know the truth of these maxim themselves without proof if he can not know the truth of other without proof which be as self-evident as these upon this ground it be that intuitive knowledge neither require nor admit any proof one part of it more than another he that will suppose it do take away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty and he that need any proof to make he certain and give he assent to this proposition that two be equal to two will also have need of a proof to make he admit that what be be he that need a probation to convince he that two be not three that white be not black that a triangle be not a circle & c or any other two -lrb- determine -rrb- distinct idea be not one and the same will need also a demonstration to convince he that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be 20 they use dangerous where we idea be not determine and as these maxim be of little use where we have determine idea so they be as i have show of dangerous use where -lrb- we idea be not determine and where -rrb- we use word that be not annex to determine idea but such as be of a loose and wander signification sometimes stand for one and sometimes for another idea : from which follow mistake and error which these maxim -lrb- bring as proof to establish proposition wherein the term stand for undetermined idea -rrb- do by they authority confirm and rivet chapter viii of trifling proposition 1 some proposition bring no increase to we knowledge whether the maxim treat of in the foregoing chapter be of that use to real knowledge as be generally suppose i leave to be consider this i think may confidently be affirm that there be universal proposition which though they be certainly true yet they add no light to we understanding bring no increase to we knowledge such be -- 2 as first identical proposition first all purely identical proposition these obviously and at first blush appear to contain no instruction in they for when we affirm the say term of itself whether it be barely verbal or whether it contain any clear and real idea it show we nothing but what we must certainly know before whether such a proposition be either make by or propose to we indeed that most general one what be be may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he be guilty of when by circumlocution or equivocal term he would in particular instance deny the same thing of itself because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense as to affirm visible and direct contradiction in plain word or if he do a man be excuse if he break off any further discourse with he but yet i think i may say that neither that receive maxim nor any other identical proposition teach we anything and though in such kind of proposition this great and magnify maxim boast to be the foundation of demonstration may be and often be make use of to confirm they yet all it prove amount to no more than this that the same word may with great certainty be affirm of itself without any doubt of the truth of any such proposition and let I add also without any real knowledge 3 example for at this rate any very ignorant person who can but make a proposition and know what he mean when he say ay or no may make a million of proposition of whose truth he may be infallibly certain and yet not know one thing in the world thereby vg ` what be a soul be a soul ' or ' a soul be a soul ' ' a spirit be a spirit ' ' a fetiche be a fetiche ' & c these all be equivalent to this proposition viz what be be ie what have existence have existence or who have a soul have a soul what be this more than trifle with word it be but like a monkey shift he oyster from one hand to the other : and have he but word might no doubt have say ` oyster in right hand be subject and oyster in left hand be predicate : ' and so might have make a self-evident proposition of oyster ie oyster be oyster and yet with all this not have be one whit the wiser or more know : and that way of handle the matter would much at one have satisfy the monkey 's hunger or a man 's understanding and they would have improve in knowledge and bulk together 4 secondly proposition in which apart of any complex idea be predicate of the whole ii another sort of trifling proposition be when a part of the complexidea be predicate of the name of the whole a part of the definition of the word define such be all proposition wherein the genus be predicate of the species or more comprehensive of less comprehensive term for what information what knowledge carry this proposition in it viz ` lead be a metal ' to a man who know the complex idea the name lead stand for all the simple idea that go to the complex one signify by the term metal be nothing but what he before comprehend and signify by the name lead indeed to a man that know the signification of the word metal and not of the word lead it be a shorter way to explain the signification of the word lead by say it be a metal which at once express several of its simple idea than to enumerate they one by one tell he it be a body very heavy fusible and malleable 5 as part of the definition of the term define alike trifle it be to predicate any other part of the definition of the term define or to affirm anyone of the simple idea of a complex one of the name of the whole complex idea as ` all gold be fusible ' for fusibility be one of the simple idea that go to the make up the complex one the sound gold stand for what can it be but play with sound to affirm that of the name gold which be comprehend in its receive signification it would be think little better than ridiculous to affirm gravely as a truth of moment that gold be yellow and i see not how it be any jot more material to say it be fusible unless that quality be leave out of the complex idea of which the sound gold be the mark in ordinary speech what instruction can it carry with it to tell one that which he have be tell already or he be suppose to know before for i be suppose to know the signification of the word another use to I or else he be to tell I and if i know that the name gold stand for this complex idea of body yellow heavy fusible malleable it will not much instruct I to put it solemnly afterwards in a proposition and gravely say all gold be fusible such proposition can only serve to show the disingenuity of one who will go from the definition of he own term by remind he sometimes of it but carry no knowledge with they but of the signification of word however certain they be 6 instance man and palfrey ` every man be a animal or living body ' be as certain a proposition as can be but no more conduce to the knowledge of thing than to say a palfrey be a ambling horse or a neighing amble animal both be only about the signification of word and make I know but this -- that body sense and motion or power of sensation and move be three of those idea that i always comprehend and signify by the word man : and where they be not to be find together the name man belong not to that thing : and so of the other -- that body sense and a certain way of go with a certain kind of voice be some of those idea which i always comprehend and signify by the word palfrey and when they be not to be find together the name palfrey belong not to that thing it be just the same and to the same purpose when any term standing for any one or more of the simple idea that altogether make up that complex idea which be call man be affirm of the term man : -- vg suppose a roman signify by the word homo all these distinct idea unite in one subject corporieta sensibilita potentia se movendi rationalitas risibilitas he might no doubt with great certainty universally affirm one more or all of these together of the word homo but do no more than say that the word homo in he country comprehend in its signification all these idea much like a romance knight who by the word palfrey signify these idea : -- body of a certain figure four-legged with sense motion amble neighing white use to have a woman on he back -- might with the same certainty universally affirm also any or all of these of the word palfrey : but do thereby teach no more but that the word palfrey in he or romance language stand for all these and be not to be apply to anything where any of these be want but he that shall tell I that in whatever thing sense motion reason and laughter be unite that thing have actually a notion of god or would be cast into a sleep by opium make indeed a instructive proposition : because neither have the notion of god nor be cast into sleep by opium be contain in the idea signify by the word man we be by such proposition teach something more than barely what the word man stand for : and therefore the knowledge contain in it be more than verbal 7 for this teach but the signification of word before a man make any proposition he be suppose to understand the term he use in it or else he talk like a parrot only make a noise by imitation and frame certain sound which he have learn of other but not as a rational creature use they for sign of idea which he have in he mind the hearer also be suppose to understand the term as the speaker use they or else he talk jargon and make a unintelligible noise and therefore he trifle with word who make such a proposition which when it be make contain no more than one of the term do and which a man be suppose to know before : vg a triangle have three side or saffron be yellow and this be no further tolerable than where a man go to explain he term to one who be suppose or declare himself not to understand he and then it teach only the signification of that word and the use of that sign 8 but add no real knowledge we can know then the truth of two sort of proposition with perfect certainty the one be of those trifling proposition which have a certainty in they but it be only a verbal certainty but not instructive and secondly we can know the truth and so may be certain in proposition which affirm something of another which be a necessary consequence of its precise complex idea but not contain in it : as that the external angle of all triangle be bigger than either of the opposite internal angle which relation of the outward angle to either of the opposite internal angle make no part of the complex idea signify by the name triangle this be a real truth and convey with it instructive real knowledge 9 general proposition concern substance be often trifling we have little or no knowledge of what combination there be of simple idea exist together in substance but by we sens we can not make any universal certain proposition concern they any further than we nominal essence lead we which be to a very few and inconsiderable truth in respect of those which depend on they real constitution the general proposition that be make about substance if they be certain be for the most part but trifling and if they be instructive be uncertain and such as we can have no knowledge of they real truth how much soever constant observation and analogy may assist we judgment in guess hence it come to pass that one may often meet with very clear and coherent discourse that amount yet to nothing for it be plain that name of substantial being as well as other as far as they have relative signification affix to they may with great truth be join negatively and affirmatively in proposition as they relative definition make they fit to be so join and proposition consist of such term may with the same clearness be deduce one from another as those that convey the most real truth : and all this without any knowledge of the nature or reality of thing exist without we by this method one may make demonstration and undoubted proposition in word and yet thereby advance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of thing : v g he that have learn these follow word with they ordinary mutual relative acceptation annex to they v g substance man animal form soul vegetative sensitive rational may make several undoubted proposition about the soul without know at all what the soul really be : and of this sort a man may find a infinite number of proposition reasoning and conclusion in book of metaphysics school-divinity and some sort of natural philosophy and after all know as little of god spirit or body as he do before he set out 10 and why he that have liberty to define ie to determine the signification of he name of substance -lrb- as certainly every one do in effect who make they stand for he own idea -rrb- and make they signification at a venture take they from he own or other man 's fancy and not from a examination or inquiry into the nature of thing themselves may with little trouble demonstrate they one of another accord to those several respects and mutual relation he have give they one to another wherein however thing agree or disagree in they own nature he need mind nothing but he own notion with the name he have bestow upon they : but thereby no more increase he own knowledge than he do he riches who take a bag of counter call one in a certain place a pound another in another place a shilling and a third in a third place a penny and so proceeding may undoubtedly reckon right and cast up a great sum accord to he counter so place and stand for more or less as he please without be one jot the richer or without even know how much a pound shilling or penny be but only that one be contain in the other twenty time and contain the other twelve : which a man may also do in the signification of word by make they in respect of one another more or less or equally comprehensive 11 thirdly use word variously be trifling with they though yet concern most word use in discourse equally argumentative and controversial there be this more to be complain of which be the worst sort of trifling and which set we yet further from the certainty of knowledge we hope to attain by they or find in they viz that most writer be so far from instruct we in the nature and knowledge of thing that they use they word loosely and uncertainly and do not by use they constantly and steadily in the same signification make plain and clear deduction of word one from another and make they discourse coherent and clear -lrb- how little soever they be instructive -rrb- which be not difficult to do do they not find it convenient to shelter they ignorance or obstinacy under the obscurity and perplexedness of they term : to which perhaps inadvertency and ill custom do in many man much contribute 12 mark of verbal proposition first predication in abstract to conclude barely verbal proposition may be know by these follow mark : first all proposition wherein two abstract term be affirm one of another be barely about the signification of sound for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name be affirm of any other term it can signify no more but this that it may or ought to be call by that name or that these two name signify the same idea thus should any one say that parsimony be frugality that gratitude be justice that this or that action be or be not temperate : however specious these and the like proposition may at first sight seem yet when we come to press they and examine nicely what they contain we shall find that it all amount to nothing but the signification of those term 13 secondly a part of the definition predicate of any term secondly all proposition wherein a part of the complex idea which any term stand for be predicate of that term be only verbal : vg to say that gold be a metal or heavy and thus all proposition wherein more comprehensive word call genus be affirm of subordinate or less comprehensive call species or individual be barely verbal when by these two rule we have examine the proposition that make up the discourse we ordinarily meet with both in and out of book we shall perhaps find that a greater part of they than be usually suspect be purely about the signification of word and contain nothing in they but the use and application of these sign this i think i may lay down for a infallible rule that wherever the distinct idea any word stand for be not know and consider and something not contain in the idea be not affirm or deny of it there we thought stick wholly in sound and be able to attain no real truth or falsehood this perhaps if well heed might save we a great deal of useless amusement and dispute and very much shorten we trouble and wander in the search of real and true knowledge chapter ix of we threefold knowledge of existence 1 general proposition that be certain concern not existence hitherto we have only consider the essence of thing which be only abstract idea and thereby remove in we thought from particular existence -lrb- that be the proper operation of the mind in abstraction to consider a idea under no other existence but what it have in the understanding -rrb- give we no knowledge of real existence at all where by the way we may take notice that universal proposition of whose truth or falsehood we can have certain knowledge concern not existence : and further that all particular affirmation or negation that would not be certain if they be make general be only concern existence they declare only the accidental union or separation of idea in thing exist which in they abstract nature have no known necessary union or repugnancy 2 a threefold knowledge of existence but leave the nature of proposition and different way of predication to be consider more at large in another place let we proceed now to inquire concern we knowledge of the existance of thing and how we come by it i say then that we have the knowledge of we own existence by intuition of the existence of god by demonstration and of other thing by sensation 3 we knowledge of we own existence be intuitive as for we own existence we perceive it so plainly and so certainly that it neither need nor be capable of any proof for nothing can be more evident to we than we own existence i think i reason i feel pleasure and pain : can any of these be more evident to I than my own existence if i doubt of all other thing that very doubt make I perceive my own existence and will not suffer I to doubt of that for if i know i feel pain it be evident i have as certain perception of my own existence as of the existence of the pain i feel : or if i know i doubt i have as certain perception of the existence of the thing doubt as of that thought which i call doubt experience then convince we that we have a intuitive knowledge of we own existence and a internal infallible perception that we be in every act of sensation reasoning or think we be conscious to ourselves of we own being and in this matter come not short of the highest degree of certainty chapter x of we knowledge of the existence of a god 1 we be capable of know certainly that there be a god though god have give we no innate idea of himself though he have stamp no original character on we mind wherein we may read he be yet have furnish we with those faculty we mind be endow with he have not leave himself without witness : since we have sense perception and reason and can not want a clear proof of he as long as we carry ourselves about we nor can we justly complain of we ignorance in this great point since he have so plentifully provide we with the means to discover and know he so far as be necessary to the end of we be and the great concernment of we happiness but though this be the most obvious truth that reason discover and though its evidence be -lrb- if i mistake not -rrb- equal to mathematical certainty : yet it require thought and attention and the mind must apply itself to a regular deduction of it from some part of we intuitive knowledge or else we shall be as uncertain and ignorant of this as of other proposition which be in themselves capable of clear demonstration to show therefore that we be capable of know ie be certain that there be a god and how we may come by this certainty i think we need go no further than ourselves and that undoubted knowledge we have of we own existence 2 for man know that he himself exist i think it be beyond question that man have a clear idea of he own be he know certainly he exist and that he be something he that can doubt whether he be anything or no i speak not to no more than i would argue with pure nothing or endeavor to convince nonentity that it be something if any one pretend to be so sceptical as to deny he own existence -lrb- for really to doubt of it be manifestly impossible -rrb- let he for I enjoy he beloved happiness of be nothing until hunger or some other pain convince he of the contrary this then i think i may take for a truth which every one 's certain knowledge assure he of beyond the liberty of doubt viz that he be something that actually exist 3 he know also that nothing can not produce a be there ore something must have exist from eternity in the next place man know by a intuitive certainty that bare nothing can no more produce any real be than it can be equal to two right angle if a man know not that nonentity or the absence of all be can not be equal to two right angle it be impossible he should know any demonstration in euclid if therefore we know there be some real be and that nonentity can not produce any real be it be a evident demonstration that from eternity there have be something since what be not from eternity have a beginning and what have a beginning must be produce by something else 4 and that eternal be must be most powerful next it be evident that what have its be and begin from another must also have all that which be in and belong to its be from another too all the power it have must be owe to and receive from the same source this eternal source then of all be must also be the source and original of all power and so this eternal be must be also the most powerful 5 and most know again a man find in himself perception and knowledge we have then get one step further and we be certain now that there be not only some be but some know intelligent be in the world there be a time then when there be no know being and when knowledge begin to be or else there have be also a know be from eternity if it be say there be a time when no be have any knowledge when that eternal being be void of all understand i reply that then it be impossible there should ever have be any knowledge : it be as impossible that thing wholly void of knowledge and operate blindly and without any perception should produce a know be as it be impossible that a triangle should make itself three angle bigger than two right one for it be as repugnant to the idea of senseless matter that it should put into itself sense perception and knowledge as it be repugnant to the idea of a triangle that it should put into itself greater angle than two right one 6 and therefore god thus from the consideration of ourselves and what we infallibly find in we own constitution we reason lead we to the knowledge of this certain and evident truth -- that there be a eternal most powerful and most know be which whether any one will please to call god it matter not the thing be evident and from this idea duly consider will easily be deduce all those other attribute which we ought to ascribe to this eternal being -lrb- if nevertheless any one should be find so senselessly arrogant as to suppose man alone know and wise but yet the product of mere ignorance and chance and that all the rest of the universe act only by that blind haphazard i shall leave with he that very rational and emphatical rebuke of tully -lrb- 1 ii de leg -rrb- to be consider at he leisure : ` what can be more sillily arrogant and misbecoming than for a man to think that he have a mind and understanding in he but yet in all the universe beside there be no such thing or that those thing which with the utmost stretch of he reason he can scarce comprehend should be move and manage without any reason at all ' quid est enim verius quam neminem esse oportere tam stulte arogantem ut in se mentem et rationem putet inesse in coelo mundoque non putet aut ea quoe viz summa ingenius ratione comprehendat nullum ratione moverus putet -rrb- from what have be say it be plain to I we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a god than of anything : we sens have not immediately discover to we nay i presume i may say that we more certainly know that there be a god than that there be anything else without we when i say we know i mean there be such a knowledge within we reach which we can not miss if we will but apply we mind to that as we do to several other inquiry 7 we idea of a most perfect be not the sole proof of a god how far the idea of a most perfect be which a man may frame in he mind do or do not prove the existence of a god i will not here examine for in the different make of man 's temper and application of they thought some argument prevail more on one and some on another for the confirmation of the same truth but yet i think this i may say that it be a ill way of establish this truth and silencing atheist to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon that sole foundation : and take some man 's have that idea of god in they mind -lrb- for it be evident some man have none and some worse than none and the most very different -rrb- for the only proof of a deity and out of a over fondness of that darling invention cashier or at least endeavor to invalidate all other argument and forbid we to hearken to those proof as be weak or fallacious which we own existence and the sensible part of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to we thought that i deem it impossible for a consider man to withstand they for i judge it as certain and clear a truth as can anywhere be deliver that ` the invisible thing of god be clearly see from the creation of the world be understand by the thing that be make even he eternal power and godhead ' though we own be furnish we as i have show with a evident and incontestible proof of a deity and i believe nobody can avoid the cogency of it who will but as carefully attend to it as to any other demonstration of so many part : yet this be so fundamental a truth and of that consequence that all religion and genuine morality depend thereon i doubt not but i shall be forgive by my reader if i go over some part of this argument again and enlarge a little more upon they 8 recapitulation something from eternity there be no truth more evident than that something must be from eternity i never yet hear of any one so unreasonable or that could suppose so manifest a contradiction as a time wherein there be perfectly nothing this being of all absurdity the greatest to imagine that pure nothing the perfect negation and absence of all being should ever produce any real existence it be then unavoidable for all rational creature to conclude that something have exist from eternity let we next see what kind of thing that must be 9 two sort of being cogitative and incogitative there be but two sort of being in the world that man know or conceive first such as be purely material without sense perception or think as the clipping of we beard and paring of we nail secondly sensible think perceive being such as we find ourselves to be which if you please we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative being which to we present purpose if for nothing else be perhaps better term than material and immaterial 10 incogitative be can not produce a cogitative be if then there must be something eternal let we see what sort of be it must be and to that it be very obvious to reason that it must necessarily be a cogitative be for it be as impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a think intelligent be as that nothing should of itself produce matter let we suppose any parcel of matter eternal great or small we shall find it in itself able to produce nothing for example : let we suppose the matter of the next pebble we meet with eternal closely unite and the part firmly at rest together if there be no other be in the world must it not eternally remain so a dead inactive lump be it possible to conceive it can add motion to itself be purely matter or produce anything matter then by its own strength can not produce in itself so much as motion : the motion it have must also be from eternity or else be produce and add to matter by some other be more powerful than matter matter as be evident have not power to produce motion in itself but let we suppose motion eternal too : yet matter incogitative matter and motion whatever change it might produce of figure and bulk could never produce thought : knowledge will still be as far beyond the power of motion and matter to produce as matter be beyond the power of nothing or nonentity to produce and i appeal to every one 's own thought whether he can not as easily conceive matter produce by nothing as think to be produce by pure matter when before there be no such thing as thought or a intelligent be exist divide matter into as many part as you will -lrb- which we be apt to imagine a sort of spiritualize or make a think thing of it -rrb- vary the figure and motion of it as much as you please -- a globe cube cone prism cylinder & c whose diameter be but 100000th part of a gry will operate no otherwise upon other body of proportionable bulk than those of a inch or foot diameter and you may as rationally expect to produce sense thought and knowledge by put together in a certain figure and motion gross particle of matter as by those that be the very minutest that do anywhere exist they knock impel and resist one another just as the greater do and that be all they can do so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal matter can never begin to be : if we suppose bare matter without motion eternal motion can never begin to be : if we suppose only matter and motion first or eternal thought can never begin to be -lrb- for it be impossible to conceive that matter either with or without motion could have originally in and from itself sense perception and knowledge as be evident from hence that then sense perception and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it not to add that though we general or specific conception of matter make we speak of it as one thing yet really all matter be not one individual thing neither be there any such thing exist as one material be or one single body that we know or can conceive and therefore if matter be the eternal first cogitative be there would not be one eternal infinite cogitative be but a infinite number of eternal finite cogitative being independent one of another of limited force and distinct thought which could never produce that order harmony and beauty which be to be find in nature since therefore whatsoever be the first eternal be must necessarily be cogitative and -rrb- whatsoever be first of all thing must necessarily contain in it and actually have at least all the perfection that can ever after exist nor can it ever give to another any perfection that it have not either actually in itself or at least in a higher degree -lrb- it necessarily follow that the first eternal being can not be matter -rrb- 11 therefore there have be a eternal wisdom if therefore it be evident that something necessarily must exist from eternity it be also as evident that that something must necessarily be a cogitative being : for it be as impossible that incogitative matter should produce a cogitative be as that nothing or the negation of all be should produce a positive be or matter 12 the attribute of the eternal cogitative be though this discovery of the necessary existance of a eternal mind do sufficiently lead we into the knowledge of god since it will hence follow that all other know being that have a beginning must depend on he and have in other way of knowledge or extent of power than what he give they and therefore if he make those he make all the less excellent piece of this universe -- all inanimate being whereby he omniscience power and providence will be establish and all he other attribute necessarily follow yet to clear up this a little further we will see what doubt can be raise against it 13 whether the eternal mind may be also material or no first perhaps it will be say that though it be as clear as demonstration can make it that there must be a eternal being and that be must also be know : yet it do not follow but that think be may also be material let it be so it equally still follow that there be a god for there be a eternal omniscient omnipotent be it be certain that there be a god whether you imagine that be to be material or no but herein i suppose lie the danger and deceit of that supposition : -- there be no way to avoid the demonstration that there be a eternal know be man devote to matter would willingly have it grant that that know be be material and then let slide out of they mind or the discourse the demonstration whereby a eternal know be be prove necessarily to exist would argue all to be matter and so deny a god that be a eternal cogitative be : whereby they be so far from establish that they destroy they own hypothesis for if there can be in they opinion eternal matter without any eternal cogitative be they manifestly separate matter and thinking and suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other and so establish the necessity of a eternal spirit but not of matter since it have be prove already that a eternal cogitative be be unavoidably to be grant now if thinking and matter may be separate the eternal existence of matter will not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative be and they suppose it to no purpose 14 not material : first because each particle of matter be not cogitative but now let we see how they can satisfy themselves or other that this eternal thinking be be material i i would ask they whether they imagine that all matter every particle of matter think this i suppose they will scarce say since then there would be as many eternal thinking being as there be particle of matter and so a infinity of god and yet if they will not allow matter as matter that be every particle of matter to be as well cogitative as extend they will have as hard a task to make out to they own reason a cogitative be out of incogitative particle as a extend be out of unextended part if i may so speak 15 ii secondly because one particle alone of matter can not be cogitative if all matter do not think i next ask whether it be only one atom that do so this have as many absurdity as the other for then this atom of matter must be alone eternal or not if this alone be eternal then this alone by its powerful thought or will make all the rest of matter and so we have the creation of matter by a powerful thought which be that the materialist stick at for if they suppose one single think atom to have produce all the rest of matter they can not ascribe that pre-eminency to it upon any other account than that of its think the only supposed difference but allow it to be by some other way which be above we conception it must still be creation and these man must give up they great maxim ex nihilo nil fit if it be say that all the rest of matter be equally eternal as that think atom it will be to say anything at pleasure though ever so absurd for to suppose all matter eternal and yet one small particle in knowledge and power infinitely above all the rest be without any the least appearance of reason to frame a hypothesis every particle of matter as matter be capable of all the same figure and motion of any other and i challenge any one in he thought to add anything else to one above another 16 iii thirdly because a system of incogitative matter can not be cogitative if then neither one peculiar atom alone can be this eternal thinking be nor all matter as matter i e every particle of matter can be it it only remain that it be some certain system of matter duly put together that be this think eternal be this be that which i imagine be that notion which man be aptest to have of god who would have he a material be as most readily suggest to they by the ordinary conceit they have of themselves and other man which they take to be material thinking being but this imagination however more natural be no less absurd than the other for to suppose the eternal thinking be to be nothing else but a composition of particle of matter each whereof be incogitative be to ascribe all the wisdom and knowledge of that eternal be only to the juxta-position of part than which nothing can be more absurd for unthinking particle of matter however put together can have nothing thereby add to they but a new relation of position which it be impossible should give thought and knowledge to they 17 and whether this corporeal system be in motion or at rest but further : this corporeal system either have all its part at rest or it be a certain motion of the part wherein its thinking consist if it be perfectly at rest it be but one lump and so can have no privilege above one atom if it be the motion of its part on which its thinking depend all the thought there must be unavoidably accidental and limited since all the particle that by motion cause think be each of they in itself without any thought can not regulate its own motion much less be regulate by the thought of the whole since that thought be not the cause of motion -lrb- for then it must be antecedent to it and so without it -rrb- but the consequence of it whereby freedom power choice and all rational and wise thinking or act will be quite take away : so that such a thinking be will be no better nor wiser than pure blind matter since to resolve all into the accidental unguided motion of blind matter or into think depend on unguided motion of blind matter be the same thing : not to mention the narrowness of such thought and knowledge that must depend on the motion of such part but there need no enumeration of any more absurdity and impossibility in this hypothesis -lrb- however full of they it be -rrb- than that before mention since let this think system be all or a part of the matter of the universe it be impossible that any one particle should either know its own or the motion of any other particle or the whole know the motion of every particle and so regulate its own thought or motion or indeed have any thought result from such motion 18 matter not co-eternal with a eternal mind secondly other would have matter to be eternal notwithstanding that they allow a eternal cogitative immaterial be this though it take not away the being of a god yet since it deny one and the first great piece of he workmanship the creation let we consider it a little matter must be allow eternal : why because you can not conceive how it can be make out of nothing : why do you not also think yourself eternal you will answer perhaps because about twenty or forty year since you begin to be but if i ask you what that you be which begin then to be you can scarce tell I the matter whereof you be make begin not then to be : for if it do then it be not eternal : but it begin to be put together in such a fashion and frame as make up you body but yet that frame of particle be not you it make not that think thing you be -lrb- for i have now to do with one who allow a eternal immaterial thinking be but would have unthinking matter eternal too -rrb- therefore when do that think thing begin to be if it do never begin to be then have you always be a think thing from eternity the absurdity whereof i need not confute till i meet with one who be so void of understand as to own it if therefore you can allow a think thing to be make out of nothing -lrb- as all thing that be not eternal must be -rrb- why also can you not allow it possible for a material be to be make out of nothing by a equal power but that you have the experience of the one in view and not of the other though when well consider creation -lrb- of a spirit will be find to require no less power than the creation of matter nay possibly if we would emancipate ourselves from vulgar notion and raise we thought as far as they would reach to a closer contemplation of thing we might be able to aim at some dim and seeming conception how matter might at first be make and begin to exist by the power of that eternal first being : but to give beginning and be to a spirit would be find a more inconceivable effect of omnipotent power but this be what would perhaps lead we too far from the notion on which the philosophy now in the world be build it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from they or to inquire so far as grammar itself would authorize if the common settle opinion oppose it : especially in this place where the receive doctrine serve well enough to we present purpose and leave this past doubt that -rrb- the creation or beginning of any one -lrb- substance -rrb- out of nothing be once admit the creation of all other but the creator himself may with the same ease be suppose 19 objection : creation out of nothing but you will say be it not impossible to admit of the make anything out of nothing since we can not possibly conceive it i answer no because it be not reasonable to deny the power of a infinite be because we can not comprehend its operation we do not deny other effect upon this ground because we can not possibly conceive the manner of they production we can not conceive how anything but impulse of body can move body and yet that be not a reason sufficient to make we deny it possible against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves in all we voluntary motion which be produce in we only by the free action or thought of we own mind and be not nor can be the effect of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon we own body for then it could not be in we power or choice to alter it for example : my right hand write whilst my left hand be still : what cause rest in one and motion in the other nothing but my will -- a thought of my mind my think only change the right hand rest and the left hand move this be matter of fact which can not be deny : explain this and make it intelligible and then the next step will be to understand creation -lrb- for the give a new determination to the motion of the animal spirit -lrb- which some make use of to explain voluntary motion -rrb- clear not the difficulty one jot to alter the determination of motion be in this case no easier nor less than to give motion itself : since the new determination give to the animal spirit must be either immediately by thought or by some other body put in they way by thought which be not in they way before and so must owe its motion to thought : either of which leave voluntary motion as unintelligible as it be before -rrb- in the meantime it be a over-valuing ourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of we capacity and to conclude all thing impossible to be do whose manner of do exceed we comprehension this be to make we comprehension infinite or god finite when what he can do be limit to what we can conceive of it if you do not understand the operation of you own finite mind that think thing within you do not deem it strange that you can not comprehend the operation of that eternal infinite mind who make and govern all thing and whom the heaven of heaven can not contain chapter xi of we knowledge of the existence of other thing 1 knowledge of the existence of other finite being be to be have only by actual sensation the knowledge of we own be we have by intuition the existence of a god reason clearly make know to we as have be show the knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can have only by sensation : for there be no necessary connexion of real existence with any idea a man have in he memory nor of any other existence but that of god with the existence of any particular man : no particular man can know the existence of any other be but only when by actual operating upon he it make itself perceive by he for the have the idea of anything in we mind no more prove the existence of that thing than the picture of a man evidence he be in the world or the vision of a dream make thereby a true history 2 instance : whiteness of this paper it be therefore the actual receiving of idea from without that give we notice of the existence of other thing and make we know that something doth exist at that time without we which cause that idea in we though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it do it for it take not from the certainty of we sens and the idea we receive by they that we know not the manner wherein they be produce : vg whilst i write this i have by the paper affect my eye that idea produce in my mind which whatever object cause i call white by which i know that that quality or accident -lrb- ie whose appearance before my eye always cause that idea -rrb- doth really exist and have a be without I and of this the greatest assurance i can possibly have and to which my faculty can attain be the testimony of my eye which be the proper and sole judge of this thing whose testimony i have reason to rely on as so certain that i can no more doubt whilst i write this that i see white and black and that something really exist that cause that sensation in I than that i write or move my hand which be a certainty as great as human nature be capable of concern the existence of anything but a man 's self alone and of god 3 this notice by we sens though not so certain as demonstration yet may be call knowledge and prove the existence of thing without we the notice we have by we sens of the exist of thing without we though it be not altogether so certain as we intuitive knowledge or the deduction of we reason employ about the clear abstract idea of we own mind yet it be a assurance that deserve the name of knowledge if we persuade ourselves that we faculty act and inform we right concern the existence of those object that affect they it can not pass for a ill-grounded confidence : for i think nobody can in earnest be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those thing which he see and feel at least he that can doubt so far -lrb- whatever he may have with he own thought -rrb- will never have any controversy with I since he can never be sure i say anything contrary to he own opinion as to myself i think god have give I assurance enough of the existence of thing without I : since by they different application i can produce in myself both pleasure and pain which be one great concernment of my present state this be certain : the confidence that we faculty do not herein deceive we be the greatest assurance we be capable of concern the existence of material being for we can not act anything but by we faculty nor talk of knowledge itself but by the help of those faculty which be fit to apprehend even what knowledge be but besides the assurance we have from we sens themselves that they do not err in the information they give we of the existence of thing without we when they be affect by they we be further confirm in this assurance by other concurrent reason : -- 4 i confirm by concurrent reason : -- first because we can not have idea of sensation but by the inlet of the sens it be plain those perception be produce in we by exterior cause affect we sens : because those that want the organ of any sense never can have the idea belong to that sense produce in they mind this be too evident to be doubt : and therefore we can not but be assure that they come in by the organ of that sense and no other way the organ themselves it be plain do not produce they : for then the eye of a man in the dark would produce color and he nose smell rose in the winter : but we see nobody get the relish of a pineapple till he go to the indy where it be and taste it 5 ii secondly because we find that a idea from actual sensatio and another from memory be very distinct perception because sometimes i find that i can not avoid the have those idea produce in my mind for though when my eye be shut or window fast i can at pleasure recal to my mind the idea of light or the sun which former sensation have lodge in my memory so i can at pleasure lay by that idea and take into my view that of the smell of a rose or taste of sugar but if i turn my eye at noon towards the sun i can not avoid the idea which the light or sun then produce in I so that there be a manifest difference between the idea lay up in my memory -lrb- over which if they be there only i should have constantly the same power to dispose of they and lay they by at pleasure -rrb- and those which force themselves upon I and i can not avoid have and therefore it must need be some exterior cause and the brisk acting of some object without I whose efficacy i can not resist that produce those idea in my mind whether i will or no besides there be nobody who doth not perceive the difference in himself between contemplate the sun as he have the idea of it in he memory and actually look upon it : of which two he perception be so distinct that few of he idea be more distinguishable one from another and therefore he have certain knowledge that they be not both memory or the action of he mind and fancy only within he but that actual see have a cause without 6 iii thirdly because pleasure or pain which accompany actual sensation accompany not the return of those idea without the external object add to this that many of those idea be produce in we with pain which afterwards we remember without the least offence thus the pain of heat or cold when the idea of it be revive in we mind give we no disturbance which when feel be very troublesome and be again when actually repeat : which be occasion by the disorder the external object cause in we body when apply to they : and we remember the pain of hunger thirst or the headache without any pain at all which would either never disturb we or else constantly do it as often as we think of it be there nothing more but idea float in we mind and appearance entertain we fancy without the real existence of thing affect we from abroad the same may be say of pleasure accompany several actual sensation and though mathematical demonstration depend not upon sense yet the examine they by diagram give great credit to the evidence of we sight and seem to give it a certainty approach to that of demonstration itself for it would be very strange that a man should allow it for a undeniable truth that two angle of a figure which he measure by line and angle of a diagram should be bigger one than the other and yet doubt of the existence of those line and angle which by look on he make use of to measure that by 7 iv fourthly because we sens assist one another 's testimony of the existence of outward thing and enable we to predict we sens in many case bear witness to the truth of each other 's report concern the existence of sensible thing without we he that see a fire may if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy feel it too and be convince by put he hand in it which certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom unless that the pain be a fancy too : which yet he can not when the burn be well by raise the idea of it bring upon himself again thus i see whilst i write this i can change the appearance of the paper and by design the letter tell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment by barely draw my pen over it : which will neither appear -lrb- let I fancy as much as i will -rrb- if my hand stand still or though i move my pen if my eye be shut : nor when those character be once make on the paper can i choose afterwards but see they as they be that be have the idea of such letter as i have make whence it be manifest that they be not barely the sport and play of my own imagination when i find that the character that be make at the pleasure of my own thought do not obey they nor yet cease to be whenever i shall fancy it but continue to affect my sens constantly and regularly accord to the figure i make they to which if we will add that the sight of those shall from another man draw such sound as i beforehand design they shall stand for there will be little reason leave to doubt that those word i write do really exist without I when they cause a long series of regular sound to affect my ear which could not be the effect of my imagination nor could my memory retain they in that order 8 this certainty be as great as we condition need but yet if after all this any one will be so sceptical as to distrust he sens and to affirm that all we see and hear feel and taste think and do during we whole be be but the series and delude appearance of a long dream whereof there be no reality and therefore will question the existence of all thing or we knowledge of anything : i must desire he to consider that if all be a dream then he doth but dream that he make the question and so it be not much matter that a wake man should answer he but yet if he please he may dream that i make he this answer that the certainty of thing exist in rerum natura when we have the testimony of we sens for it be not only as great as we frame can attain to but as we condition need for we faculty be suit not to the full extent of be nor to a perfect clear comprehensive knowledge of thing free from all doubt and scruple but to the preservation of we in whom they be and accommodate to the use of life : they serve to we purpose well enough if they will but give we certain notice of those thing which be convenient or inconvenient to we for he that see a candle burning and have experiment the force of its flame by put he finger in it will little doubt that this be something exist without he which do he harm and put he to great pain : which be assurance enough when no man require greater certainty to govern he action by than what be as certain as he action themselves and if we dreamer please to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wander imagination in a drowsy man 's fancy by put he hand into it he may perhaps be waken into a certainty greater than he could wish that it be something more than bare imagination so that this evidence be as great as we can desire be as certain to we as we pleasure or pain ie happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment either of know or be such a assurance of the existence of thing without we be sufficient to direct we in the attain the good and avoid the evil which be cause by they which be the important concernment we have of be make acquaint with they 9 but reach no further than actual sensation in fine then when we sens do actually convey into we understanding any idea we can not but be satisfy that there doth something at that time really exist without we which doth affect we sens and by they give notice of itself to we apprehensive faculty and actually produce that idea which we then perceive : and we can not so far distrust they testimony as to doubt that such collection of simple idea as we have observe by we sens to be unite together do really exist together but this knowledge extend as far as the present testimony of we sens employ about particular object that do then affect they and no further for if i see such a collection of simple idea as be wont to be call man exist together one minute since and be now alone i can not be certain that the same man exist now since there be no necessary connexion of he existence a minute since with he existence now : by a thousand way he may cease to be since i have the testimony of my sens for he existence and if i can not be certain that the man i see last to-day be now in be i can less be certain that he be so who have be longer remove from my sens and i have not see since yesterday or since the last year : and much less can i be certain of the existence of man that i never see and therefore though it be highly probable that million of man do now exist yet whilst i be alone write this i have not that certainty of it which we strictly call knowledge though the great likelihood of it put I past doubt and it be reasonable for I to do several thing upon the confidence that there be man -lrb- and man also of my acquaintance with whom i have to do -rrb- now in the world : but this be but probability not knowledge 10 folly to expect demonstration in everything whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it be for a man of a narrow knowledge who have reason give he to judge of the different evidence and probability of thing and to be sway accordingly how vain i say it be to expect demonstration and certainty in thing not capable of it and refuse assent to very rational proposition and act contrary to very plain and clear truth because they can not be make out so evident as to surmount every the least -lrb- i will not say reason but -rrb- pretence of doubt he that in the ordinary affair of life would admit of nothing but direct plain demonstration would be sure of nothing in this world but of perish quickly the wholesomeness of he meat or drink would not give he reason to venture on it : and i would fain know what it be he could do upon such grounds as be capable of no doubt no objection 11 past existence of other thing be know by memory as when we sens be actually employ about any object we do know that it do exist so by we memory we may be assure that heretofore thing that affect we sens have exist and thus we have knowledge of the past existence of several thing whereof we sens have inform we we memory still retain the idea and of this we be past all doubt so long as we remember well but this knowledge also reach no further than we sens have formerly assure we thus see water at this instant it be a unquestionable truth to I that water doth exist : and remember that i see it yesterday it will also be always true and as long as my memory retain it always a undoubted proposition to I that water do exist the 10th of July 1688 as it will also be equally true that a certain number of very fine color do exist which at the same time i saw upon a bubble of that water : but be now quite out of sight both of the water and bubble too it be no more certainly know to I that the water doth now exist than that the bubble or color therein do so : it be no more necessary that water should exist to-day because it exist yesterday than that the color or bubble exist to-day because they exist yesterday though it be exceedingly much more probable because water have be observe to continue long in existence but bubble and the color on they quickly cease to be 12 the existence of other finite spirit not knowable and rest on faith what idea we have of spirit and how we come by they i have already show but though we have those idea in we mind and know we have they there the have the idea of spirit do not make we know that any such thing do exist without we or that there be any finite spirit or any other spiritual being but the eternal god we have ground from revelation and several other reason to believe with assurance that there be such creature : but we sens not be able to discover they we want the means of know they particular existence for we can no more know that there be finite spirit really exist by the idea we have of such being in we mind than by the idea any one have of fairy or centaur he can come to know that thing answer those idea do really exist and therefore concern the existence of finite spirit as well as several other thing we must content ourselves with the evidence of faith but universal certain proposition concern this matter be beyond we reach for however true it may be vg that all the intelligent spirit that god ever create do still exist yet it can never make a part of we certain knowledge these and the like proposition we may assent to as highly probable but be not i fear in this state capable of know we be not then to put other upon demonstrate nor ourselves upon search of universal certainty in all those matter wherein we be not capable of any other knowledge but what we sens give we in this or that particular 13 only particular proposition concern concrete existance be knowable by which it appear that there be two sort of proposition : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be one sort of proposition concern the existence of anything answerable to such a idea : as have the idea of a elephant phoenix motion or a angel in my mind the first and natural inquiry be whether such a thing do anywhere exist and this knowledge be only of particulars no existence of anything without we but only of god can certainly be know further than we sens inform we -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be another sort of proposition wherein be express the agreement or disagreement of we abstract idea and they dependence on one another such proposition may be universal and certain so have the idea of god and myself of fear and obedience i can not but be sure that god be to be fear and obey by I : and this proposition will be certain concern man in general if i have make a abstract idea of such a species whereof i be one particular but yet this proposition how certain soever that ` man ought to fear and obey god ' prove not to I the existence of man in the world but will be true of all such creature whenever they do exist : which certainty of such general proposition depend on the agreement or disagreement to be discover in those abstract idea 14 and all general proposition that be know to be true concern abstract idea in the former case we knowledge be the consequence of the existence of thing produce idea in we mind by we sens : in the latter knowledge be the consequence of the idea -lrb- be they what they will -rrb- that be in we mind produce there general certain proposition many of these be call aeternae veritate and all of they indeed be so not from be write all or any of they in the mind of all man or that they be any of they proposition in any one 's mind till he have get the abstract idea join or separate they by affirmation or negation but wheresoever we can suppose such a creature as man be endowed with such faculty and thereby furnish with such idea as we have we must conclude he must need when he apply he thought to the consideration of he idea know the truth of certain proposition that will arise from the agreement or disagreement which he will perceive in he own idea such proposition be therefore call eternal truth not because they be eternal proposition actually form and antecedent to the understanding that at any time make they nor because they be imprint on the mind from any pattern that be anywhere out of the mind and exist before : but because be once make about abstract idea so as to be true they will whenever they can be suppose to be make again at any time past or come by a mind have those idea always actually be true for name be suppose to stand perpetually for the same idea and the same idea have immutably the same habitude one to another proposition concern any abstract idea that be once true must need be eternal verity chapter xii of the improvement of we knowledge 1 knowledge be not get from maxim it have be the common receive opinion amongst man of letter that maxim be the foundation of all knowledge and that the science be each of they build upon certain praecognita from whence the understanding be to take its rise and by which it be to conduct itself in its inquiry into the matter belong to that science the beaten road of the school have be to lay down in the begin one or more general proposition as foundation whereon to build the knowledge that be to be have of that subject these doctrine thus lay down for foundation of any science be call principle as the beginning from which we must set out and look no further backwards in we inquiry as we have already observe 2 -lrb- the occasion of that opinion -rrb- one thing which might probably give a occasion to this way of proceeding in other science be -lrb- as i suppose -rrb- the good success it seem to have in mathematics wherein man be observe to attain a great certainty of knowledge these science come by pre-eminence to be call -lrb- word in greek -rrb- and -lrb- word in greek -rrb- learning or thing learn thoroughly learn as have of all other the greatest certainty clearness and evidence in they 3 but from compare clear and distinct idea but if any one will consider he will -lrb- i guess -rrb- find that the great advancement and certainty of real knowledge which man arrive to in these science be not owe to the influence of these principle nor derive from any peculiar advantage they receive from two or three general maxim lay down in the beginning but from the clear distinct complete idea they thought be employ about and the relation of equality and excess so clear between some of they that they have a intuitive knowledge and by that a way to discover it in other and this without the help of those maxim for i ask be it not possible for a young lad to know that he whole body be bigger than he little finger but by virtue of this axiom that the whole be bigger than a part nor be assure of it till he have learn that maxim or can not a country wench know that have receive a shilling from one that owe she three and a shilling also from another that owe she three the remain debt in each of they hand be equal can not she know this i say unless she fetch the certainty of it from this maxim that if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal a maxim which possibly she never hear or thought of i desire any one to consider from what have be elsewhere say which be know first and clearest by most people the particular instance or the general rule and which it be that give life and birth to the other these general rule be but the compare we more general and abstract idea which be the workmanship of the mind make and name give to they for the easier dispatch in its reasoning and draw into comprehensive term and short rule its various and multiply observation but knowledge begin in the mind and be found on particulars though afterwards perhaps no notice be take thereof : it be natural for the mind -lrb- forward still to enlarge its knowledge -rrb- most attentively to lay up those general notion and make the proper use of they which be to disburden the memory of the cumbersome load of particulars for i desire it may be consider what more certainty there be to a child or any one that he body little finger and all be bigger than he little finger alone after you have give to he body the name whole and to he little finger the name part than he could have have before or what new knowledge concern he body can these two relative term give he which he could not have without they could he not know that he body be bigger than he little finger if he language be yet so imperfect that he have no such relative term as whole and part i ask further when he have get these name how be he more certain that he body be a whole and he little finger a part than he be or might be certain before he learn those term that he body be bigger than he little finger any one may as reasonably doubt or deny that he little finger be a part of he body as that it be less than he body and he that can doubt whether it be less will as certainly doubt whether it be a part so that the maxim the whole be bigger than a part can never be make use of to prove the little finger less than the body but when it be useless by be bring to convince one of a truth which he know already for he that do not certainly know that any parcel of matter with another parcel of matter join to it be bigger than either of they alone will never be able to know it by the help of these two relative term whole and part make of they what maxim you please 4 dangerous to build upon precarious principle but be it in the mathematics as it will whether it be clearer that take a inch from a black line of two inch and a inch from a red line of two inch the remain part of the two line will be equal or that if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal : which i say of these two be the clearer and first know i leave to any one to determine it not be material to my present occasion that which i have here to do be to inquire whether if it be the readiest way to knowledge to begin with general maxim and build upon they it be yet a safe way to take the principle which be lay down in any other science as unquestionable truth and so receive they without examination and adhere to they without suffer they to be doubt of because mathematician have be so happy or so fair to use none but self-evident and undeniable if this be so i know not what may not pass for truth in morality what may not be introduce and prove in natural philosophy let that principle of some of the old philosopher that all be matter and that there be nothing else be receive for certain and indubitable and it will be easy to be see by the writings of some that have revive it again in we day what consequence it will lead we into let any one with polemo take the world or with the stoic the aether or the sun or with anaximene the air to be god and what a divinity religion and worship must we need have nothing can be so dangerous as principle thus take up without question or examination especially if they be such as concern morality which influence man 's life and give a bias to all they action who might not justly expect another kind of life in aristippus who place happiness in bodily pleasure and in antisthene who make virtue sufficient to felicity and he who with plato shall place beatitude in the knowledge of god will have he thought raise to other contemplation than those who look not beyond this spot of earth and those perish thing which be to be have in it he that with archelaus shall lay it down as a principle that right and wrong honest and dishonest be define only by law and not by nature will have other measure of moral rectitude and gravity than those who take it for grant that we be under obligation antecedent to all human constitution 5 to do so be no certain way to truth if therefore those that pass for principle be not certain -lrb- which we must have some way to know that we may be able to distinguish they from those that be doubtful -rrb- but be only make so to we by we blind assent we be liable to be mislead by they and instead of be guide into truth we shall by principle be only confirm in mistake and error 6 but to compare clear complete idea under steady name but since the knowledge of the certainty of principle as well as of all other truth depend only upon the perception we have of the agreement or disagreement of we idea the way to improve we knowledge be not i be sure blindly and with a implicit faith to receive and swallow principle but be i think to get and fix in we mind clear distinct and complete idea as far as they be to be have and annex to they proper and constant name and thus perhaps without any other principle but barely consider those perfect idea and by compare they one with another find they agreement and disagreement and they several relation and habitude we shall get more true and clear knowledge by the conduct of this one rule than by take up principle and thereby put we mind into the disposal of other 7 the true method of advance knowledge be by consider we abstract idea we must therefore if we will proceed as reason advise adapt we method of inquiry to the nature of the idea we examine and the truth we search after general and certain truth be only found in the habitude and relation of abstract idea a sagacious and methodical application of we thought for the find out these relation be the only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty concern they into general proposition by what step we be to proceed in these be to be learn in the school of the mathematician who from very plain and easy beginning by gentle degree and a continued chain of reasoning proceed to the discovery and demonstration of truth that appear at first sight beyond human capacity the art of find proof and the admirable method they have invent for the single out and lay in order those intermediate idea that demonstratively show the equality or inequality of unapplicable quantity be that which have carry they so far and produce such wonderful and unexpected discovery : but whether something like this in respect of other idea as well as those of magnitude may not in time be find out i will not determine this i think i may say that if other idea that be the real as well as nominal essence of they species be pursue in the way familiar to mathematician they would carry we thought further and with greater evidence and clearness than possibly we be apt to imagine 8 by which morality also may be make clearer this give I the confidence to advance that conjecture which i suggest -lrb- chap iii -rrb- viz that morality be capable of demonstration as well as mathematics for the idea that ethic be conversant about be all real essence and such as i imagine have a discoverable connexion and agreement one with another so far as we can find they habitude and relation so far we shall be possess of certain real and general truth and i doubt not but if a right method be take a great part of morality might be make out with that clearness that could leave to a consider man no more reason to doubt than he could have to doubt of the truth of proposition in mathematics which have be demonstrate to he 9 we knowledge of substance be to be improve not by contemplation of abstract idea but only by experience in we search after the knowledge of substance we want of idea that be suitable to such a way of proceed oblige we to a quite different method we advance not here as in the other -lrb- where we abstract idea be real as well as nominal essence -rrb- by contemplate we idea and consider they relation and correspondence that help we very little for the reason that in another place we have at large set down by which i think it be evident that substance afford matter of very little general knowledge and the bare contemplation of they abstract idea will carry we but a very little way in the search of truth and certainty what then be we to do for the improvement of we knowledge in substantial being here we be to take a quite contrary course : the want of idea of they real essence send we from we own thought to the thing themselves as they exist experience here must teach I what reason can not : and it be by try alone that i can certainly know what other quality co-exist with those of my complex idea vg whether that yellow heavy fusible body i call gold be malleable or no which experience -lrb- which way ever it prove in that particular body i examine -rrb- make I not certain that it be so in all or any other yellow heavy fusible body but that which i have try because it be no consequence one way or the other from my complex idea : the necessity or inconsistence of malleability have no visible connexion with the combination of that color weight and fusibility in any body what i have say here of the nominal essence of gold suppose to consist of a body of such a determinate color weight and fusibility will hold true if malleableness fixedness and solubility in aqua regium be add to it we reasoning from these idea will carry we but a little way in the certain discovery of the other property in those mass of matter wherein all these be to be find because the other property of such body depend not on these but on that unknown real essence on which these also depend we can not by they discover the rest we can go no further than the simple idea of we nominal essence will carry we which be very little beyond themselves and so afford we but very sparingly any certain universal and useful truth for upon trial have find that particular piece -lrb- and all other of that color weight and fusibility that i ever try -rrb- malleable that also make now perhaps a part of my complex idea part of my nominal essence of gold : whereby though i make my complex idea to which i affix the name gold to consist of more simple idea than before yet still it not contain the real essence of any species of body it help I not certainly to know -lrb- i say to know perhaps it may be to conjecture -rrb- the other remain property of that body further than they have a visible connexion with some or all of the simple idea that make up my nominal essence for example i can not be certain from this complex idea whether gold be fix or no because as before there be no necessary connexion or inconsistence to be discover betwixt a complex idea of a body yellow heavy fusible malleable betwixt these i say and fixedness so that i may certainly know that in whatsoever body these be find there fixedness be sure to be here again for assurance i must apply myself to experience as far as that reach i may have certain knowledge but no further 10 experience may procure be convenience not science i deny not but a man accustom to rational and regular experiment shall be able to see further into the nature of body and guess righter at they yet unknown property than one that be a stranger to they : but yet as i have say this be but judgment and opinion not knowledge and certainty this way of get and improve we knowledge in substance only by experience and history which be all that the weakness of we faculty in this state of mediocrity which we be in this world can attain to make I suspect that natural philosophy be not capable be be make a science we be able i imagine to reach very little general knowledge concern the species of body and they several property experiment and historical observation we may have from which we may draw advantage of ease and health and thereby increase we stock of convenience for this life but beyond this i fear we talent reach not nor be we faculty as i guess able to advance 11 we be fit for moral science but only for probable interpretation of external nature from whence be it obvious to conclude that since we faculty be not fit to penetrate into the internal fabric and real essence of body but yet plainly discover to we the being of a god and the knowledge of ourselves enough to lead we into a full and clear discovery of we duty and great concernment it will become we as rational creature to employ those faculty we have about what they be most adapt to and follow the direction of nature where it seem to point we out the way for it be rational to conclude that we proper employment lie in those inquiry and in that sort of knowledge which be most suit to we natural capacity and carry in it we greatest interest ie the condition of we eternal estate hence i think i may conclude that morality be the proper science and business of mankind in general -lrb- who be both concerned and fitted to search out they summum bonum -rrb- as several art conversant about several part of nature be the lot and private talent of particular man for the common use of human life and they own particular subsistence in this world of what consequence the discovery of one natural body and its property may be to human life the whole great continent of america be a convincing instance : whose ignorance in useful art and want of the greatest part of the convenience of life in a country that abound with all sort of natural plenty i think may be attribute to they ignorance of what be to be find in a very ordinary despicable stone i mean the mineral of iron and whatever we think of we part or improvement in this part of the world where knowledge and plenty seem to vie with each other yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it i suppose it will appear past doubt that be the use of iron lose among we we should in a few age be unavoidably reduce to the want and ignorance of the ancient savage american whose natural endowment and provision come no way short of those of the most flourishing and polite nation so that he who first make know the use of that contemptible mineral may be truly style the father of art and author of plenty 12 in the study of nature we must beware of hypothesis and wrong principle i would not therefore be think to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of he work give we occasion to admire revere and glorify they author : and if rightly direct may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monument of exemplary charity that have at so great charge be raise by the founder of hospital and almshouse he that first invent printing discover the use of the compass or make public the virtue and right use of kin kina do more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodity and save more from the grave than those who build college workhouse and hospital all that i would say be that we should not be too forwardly possess with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it be not to be have or by way that will not attain to it : that we should not take doubtful system for complete science nor unintelligible notion for scientifical demonstration in the knowledge of body we must be content to glean what we can from particular experiment : since we can not from a discovery of they real essence grasp at a time whole sheaf and in bundle comprehend the nature and property of whole species together where we inquiry be concern co-existence or repugnancy to co-exist which by contemplation of we idea we can not discover there experience observation and natural history must give we by we sens and by retail a insight into corporeal substance the knowledge of body we must get by we sens warily employ in take notice of they quality and operation on one another : and what we hope to know of separate spirit in this world we must i think expect only from revelation he that shall consider how little general maxim precarious principle and hypothesis lay down at pleasure have promote true knowledge or help to satisfy the inquiry of rational man after real improvement how little i say the set out at that end have for many age together advance man 's progress towards the knowledge of natural philosophy will think we have reason to thank those who in this latter age have take another course and have tread out to we though not a easier way to learn ignorance yet a surer way to profitable knowledge 13 the true use of hypothesis not that we may not to explain any phenomenon of nature make use of any probable hypothesis whatsoever : hypothesis if they be well make be at least great help to the memory and often direct we to new discovery but my meaning be that we should not take up any one too hastily -lrb- which the mind that would always penetrate into the cause of thing and have principle to rest on be very apt to do -rrb- till we have very well examine particulars and make several experiment in that thing which we would explain by we hypothesis and see whether it will agree to they all whether we principle will carry we quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principle deceive we not nor impose on we by make we receive that for a unquestionable truth which be really at best but a very doubtful conjecture such as be most -lrb- i have almost say all -rrb- of the hypothesis in natural philosophy 14 clear and distinct idea with settle name and the finding of those intermediate idea which show they agreement or disagreement be the way to enlarge we knowledge but whether natural philosophy be capable of certainty or no the way to enlarge we knowledge as far as we be capable seem to I in short to be these two : -- first the first be to get and settle in we mind -lrb- determine idea of those thing whereof we have general or specific name at least so many of they as we would consider and improve we knowledge in or reason about -rrb- -lrb- and if they be specific idea of substance we should endeavor also to make they as complete as we can whereby i mean that we should put together as many simple idea as be constantly observe to co-exist may perfectly determine the species and each of those simple idea which be the ingredient of we complex one should be clear and distinct in we mind -rrb- for it be evident that we knowledge can not exceed we idea -lrb- as far as -rrb- they be either imperfect confused or obscure we can not expect to have certain perfect or clear knowledge secondly the other be the art of find out those intermediate idea which may show we the agreement or repugnancy of other idea which can not be immediately compare 15 mathematics a instance of this that these two -lrb- and not the rely on maxim and draw consequence from some general proposition -rrb- be the right method of improve we knowledge in the idea of other mode besides those of quantity the consideration of mathematical knowledge will easily inform we where first we shall find that he that have not a perfect and clear idea of those angle or figure of which he desire to know anything be utterly thereby incapable of any knowledge about they suppose but a man not to have a perfect exact idea of a right angle a scalenum or trapezium and there be nothing more certain than that he will in vain seek any demonstration about they further it be evident that it be not the influence of those maxim which be take for principle in mathematics that have lead the master of that science into those wonderful discovery they have make let a man of good part know all the maxim generally make use of in mathematics ever so perfectly and contemplate they extent and consequence as much as he please he will by they assistance i suppose scarce ever come to know that the square of the hypothenuse in a right-angled triangle be equal to the square of the two other side the knowledge that ` the whole be equal to all its part ' and ` if you take equal from equal the remainder will be equal ' & c help he not i presume to this demonstration : and a man may i think pore long enough on those axiom without ever see one jot the more of mathematical truth they have be discover by the thought otherwise apply : the mind have other object other view before it far different from those maxim when it first get the knowledge of such truth in mathematics which man well enough acquaint with those receive axiom but ignorant of they method who first make these demonstration can never sufficiently admire and who know what method to enlarge we knowledge in other part of science may hereafter be invent answer that of algebra in mathematics which so readily find out the idea of quantity to measure other by whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly or perhaps never come to know chapter xiii some further consideration concern we knowledge 1 we knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary we knowledge as in other thing so in this have so great a conformity with we sight that it be neither wholly necessary nor wholly voluntary if we knowledge be altogether necessary all man 's knowledge would not only be alike but every man would know all that be knowable and if it be wholly voluntary some man so little regard or value it that they would have extreme little or none at all man that have sens can not choose but receive some idea by they and if they have memory they can not but retain some of they and if they have any distinguish faculty can not but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of they one with another as he that have eye if he will open they by day can not but see some object and perceive a difference in they but though a man with he eye open in the light can not but see yet there be certain object which he may choose whether he will turn he eye to there may be in he reach a book contain picture and discourse capable to delight or instruct he which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pain to look into 2 the application of we faculty voluntary but they be employ we know as thing be not as we please there be also another thing in a man 's power and that be though he turn he eye sometimes towards a object yet he may choose whether he will curiously survey it and with a intent application endeavor to observe accurately all that be visible in it but yet what he do see he can not see otherwise than he do it depend not on he will to see that black which appear yellow nor to persuade himself that what actually scald he feel cold the earth will not appear paint with flower nor the field cover with verdure whenever he have a mind to it : in the cold winter he can not help see it white and hoary if he will look abroad just thus be it with we understanding : all that be voluntary in we knowledge be the employ or withhold any of we faculty from this or that sort of object and a more or less accurate survey of they : but they be employ we will have no power to determine the knowledge of the mind one way or another that be do only by the object themselves as far as they be clearly discover and therefore as far as man 's sens be conversant about external object the mind can not but receive those idea which be present by they and be inform of the existence of thing without : and so far as man 's thought converse with they own determine idea they can not but in some measure observe the agreement or disagreement that be to be find amongst some of they which be so far knowledge : and if they have name for those idea which they have thus consider they must need be assure of the truth of those proposition which express that agreement or disagreement they perceive in they and be undoubtedly convince of those truth for what a man see he can not but see and what he perceive he can not but know that he perceive 3 instance in number thus he that have get the idea of number and have take the pain to compare one two and three to six can not choose but know that they be equal : he that have get the idea of a triangle and find the way to measure its angle and they magnitude be certain that its three angle be equal to two right one and can as little doubt of that as of this truth that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be 4 instance in natural religion he also that have the idea of a intelligent but frail and weak be make by and depend on another who be eternal omnipotent perfectly wise and good will as certainly know that man be to honor fear and obey god as that the sun shine when he see it for if he have but the idea of two such being in he mind and will turn he thought that way and consider they he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent be under a obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he be certain to find that three four and seven be less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those number : nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun be rise if he will but open he eye and turn they that way but yet these truth be ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of they who will never take the pain to employ he faculty as he should to inform himself about they chapter xiv of judgment 1 we knowledge be short we want something else the understanding faculty be give to man not barely for speculation but also for the conduct of he life man would be at a great loss if he have nothing to direct he but what have the certainty of true knowledge for that be very short and scanty as we have see he would be often utterly in the dark and in most of the action of he life perfectly at a stand have he nothing to guide he in the absence of clear and certain knowledge he that will not eat till he have demonstration that it will nourish he he that will not stir till he infallibly know the business he go about will succeed will have little else to do but to sit still and perish 2 what use to be make of this twilight state therefore as god have set some thing in broad daylight as he have give we some certain knowledge though limit to a few thing in comparison probably as a taste of what intellectual creature be capable of to excite in we a desire and endeavor after a better state : so in the greatest part of we concernment he have afford we only the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he have be please to place we in here wherein to check we over-confidence and presumption we might by every day 's experience be make sensible of we short-sightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to we to spend the day of this we pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and following of that way which might lead we to a state of greater perfection it be highly rational to think even be revelation silent in the case that as man employ those talent god have give they here they shall accordingly receive they reward at the close of the day when they sun shall set and night shall put a end to they labor 3 judgement or assent to probability supply we want of knowledge the faculty which god have give man to supply the want of clear and certain knowledge in case where that can not be have be judgement : whereby the mind take its idea to agree or disagree or which be the same any proposition to be true or false without perceive a demonstrative evidence in the proof the mind sometimes exercise this judgment out of necessity where demonstrative proof and certain knowledge be not to be have and sometimes out of laziness unskilfulness or haste even where demonstrative and certain proof be to be have man often stay not warily to examine the agreement or disagreement of two idea which they be desirous or concerned to know but either incapable of such attention as be requisite in a long train of gradation or impatient of delay lightly cast they eye on or wholly pass by the proof and so without make out the demonstration determine of the agreement or disagreement of two idea as it be by a view of they as they be at a distance and take it to be the one or the other as seem most likely to they upon such a loose survey this faculty of the mind when it be exercise immediately about thing be call judgement when about truth deliver in word be most commonly call assent or dissent : which be the most usual way wherein the mind have occasion to employ this faculty i shall under these term treat of it as feast liable in we language to equivocation 4 judgement be the presume thing to be so without perceive it thus the mind have two faculty conversant -lrb- about truth and falsehood -rrb- : -- first knowledge whereby it certainly perceive and be undoubtedly satisfied of the agreement or disagreement of any idea secondly judgement which be the put idea together or separate they from one another in the mind when they certain agreement or disagreement be not perceive but presume to be so which be as the word import take to be so before it certainly appear and if it so unite or separate they as in reality thing be it be right judgement chapter xv of probability 1 probability be the appearance of agreement upon fallible proof as demonstration be the show the agreement or disagreement of two idea by the intervention of one or more proof which have a constant immutable and visible connexion one with another so probability be nothing but the appearance of such a agreement or disagreement by the intervention of proof whose connexion be not constant and immutable or at least be not perceive to be so but be or appear for the most part to be so and be enough to induce the mind to judge the proposition to be true or false rather than the contrary for example : in the demonstration of it a man perceive the certain immutable connexion there be of equality between the three angle of a triangle and those intermediate one which be make use of to show they equality to two right one and so by a intuitive knowledge of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea in each step of the progress the whole series be continue with a evidence which clearly show the agreement or disagreement of those three angle in equality to two right one : and thus he have certain knowledge that it be so but another man who never take the pain to observe the demonstration hear a mathematician a man of credit affirm the three angle of a triangle to be equal to two right one assent to it ie receive it for true : in which case the foundation of he assent be the probability of the thing the proof be such as for the most part carry truth with it : the man on whose testimony he receive it not be wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides he knowledge especially in matter of this kind : so that that which cause he assent to this proposition that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one that which make he take these idea to agree without knowing they to do so be the wonted veracity of the speaker in other case or he suppose veracity in this 2 it be to supply we want of knowledge we knowledge as have be show be very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the proposition we think reason discourse -- nay act upon be such as we can not have undoubted knowledge of they truth : yet some of they border so near upon certainty that we make no act accord to the assent as resolutely as if they be infallibly demonstrate and that we knowledge of they be perfect and certain but there be degree herein from the very neighborhood of certainty and demonstration quite down to improbability and unlikeness even to the confines of impossibility and also degree of assent from full assurance and confidence quite down to conjecture doubt and distrust : i shall come now -lrb- have as i think find out the bound of human knowledge and certainty -rrb- in the next place to consider the several degree and grounds of probability and assent or faith 3 be that which make we presume thing to be true before we know they to be so probability be likeliness to be true the very notation of the word signify such a proposition for which there be argument or proof to make it pass or be receive for true the entertainment the mind give this sort of proposition be call belief assent or opinion which be the admit or receive any proposition for true upon argument or proof that be find to persuade we to receive it as true without certain knowledge that it be so and herein lie the difference between probability and certainty faith and knowledge that in all the part of knowledge there be intuition each immediate idea each step have its visible and certain connexion : in belief not so that which make I believe be something extraneous to the thing i believe something not evidently join on both side to and so not manifestly show the agreement or disagreement of those idea that be under consideration 4 the grounds of probability be two : conformity with we own experience or the testimony of other probability then be to supply the defect of we knowledge and to guide we where that fail be always conversant about proposition whereof we have no certainty but only some inducement to receive they for true the grounds of it be in short these two follow : -- first the conformity of anything with we own knowledge observation and experience secondly the testimony of other vouch they observation and experience in the testimony of other be to be consider : 1 the number 2 the integrity 3 the skill of the witness 4 the design of the author where it be a testimony out of a book cite 5 the consistency of the part and circumstance of the relation 6 contrary testimony 5 in this all the argument pro and con ought to be examine before we come to a judgment probability want that intuitive evidence which infallibly determine the understanding and produce certain knowledge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the grounds of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assent to or dissent from it and upon a due balance the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or the other for example : -- if i myself see a man walk on the ice it be past probability it be knowledge but if another tell I he see a man in england in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water harden with cold this have so great conformity with what be usually observe to happen that i be dispose by the nature of the thing itself to assent to it unless some manifest suspicion attend the relation of that matter of fact but if the same thing be tell to one bear between the tropics who never see nor hear of any such thing before there the whole probability rely on testimony : and as the relator be more in number and of more credit and have no interest to speak contrary to the truth so that matter of fact be like to find more or less belief though to a man whose experience have always be quite contrary and who have never hear of anything like it the most untainted credit of a witness will scarce be able to find belief as it happen to a dutch ambassador who entertain the king of siam with the particularity of holland which he be inquisitive after amongst other thing tell he that the water in he country would sometimes in cold weather be so hard that man walk upon it and that it would bear a elephant if he be there to which the king reply hitherto _ i _ have believe the strange thing you have tell I because _ i _ look upon you as a sober fair man but now _ i _ be sure you lie 6 probable argument capable of great variety upon these grounds depend the probability of any proposition : and as the conformity of we knowledge as the certainty of observation as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimony do more or less agree or disagree with it so be any proposition in itself more or less probable there be another i confess which though by itself it be no true ground of probability yet be often make use of for one by which man most commonly regulate they assent and upon which they pin they faith more than anything else and that be the opinion of other though there can not be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there be much more falsehood and error among man than truth and knowledge and if the opinion and persuasion of other whom we know and think well of be a ground of assent man have reason to be heathen in japan mahometan in turkey papist in spain protestant in england and lutheran in sweden but of this wrong ground of assent i shall have occasion to speak more at large in another place chapter xvi of the degree of assent 1 we assent ought to be regulate by the grounds of probability the grounds of probability we have lay down in the foregoing chapter : as they be the foundation on which we assent be build so be they also the measure whereby its several degree be or ought to be regulate : only we be to take notice that whatever grounds of probability there may be they yet operate no further on the mind which search after truth and endeavor to judge right than they appear at least in the first judgment or search that the mind make i confess in the opinion man have and firmly stick to in the world they assent be not always from a actual view of the reason that at first prevail with they : it be in many case almost impossible and in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memory to retain all the proof which upon a due examination make they embrace that side of the question it suffice that they have once with care and fairness sift the matter as far as they could and that they have search into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of they skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence : and thus have once find on which side the probability appear to they after as full and exact a inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in they memory as a truth they have discover and for the future they remain satisfied with the testimony of they memory that this be the opinion that by the proof they have once see of it deserve such a degree of they assent as they afford it 2 these can not always be actually in view and then we must content ourselves with the remembrance that we once see ground for such a degree of assent this be all that the greatest part of man be capable of do in regulate they opinion and judgment unless a man will exact of they either to retain distinctly in they memory all the proof concern any probable truth and that too in the same order and regular deduction of consequence in which they have formerly place or see they which sometimes be enough to fill a large volume on one single question : or else they must require a man for every opinion that he embrace every day to examine the proof : both which be impossible it be unavoidable therefore that the memory be rely on in the case and that man be persuade of several opinion whereof the proof be not actually in they thought nay which perhaps they be not able actually to recall without this the greatest part of man must be either very sceptic or change every moment and yield themselves up to whoever have lately study the question offer they argument which for want of memory they be not able presently to answer 3 the ill consequence of this if we former judgment be not rightly make i can not but own that man 's stick to they past judgment and adhering firmly to conclusion formerly make be often the cause of great obstinacy in error and mistake but the fault be not that they rely on they memory for what they have before well judge but because they judge before they have well examine may we not find a great number -lrb- not to say the greatest part -rrb- of man that think they have form right judgment of several matter and that for no other reason but because they never think otherwise that themselves to have judge right only because they never question never examine they own opinion which be indeed to think they judge right because they never judge at all and yet these of all man hold they opinion with the greatest stiffness those be generally the most fierce and firm in they tenet who have least examine they what we once know we be certain be so : and we may be secure that there be no latent proof undiscovered which may overturn we knowledge or bring it in doubt but in matter of probability it be not in every case we can be sure that we have all the particulars before we that any way concern the question and that there be no evidence behind and yet unseen which may cast the probability on the other side and outweigh all that at present seem to preponderate with we who almost be there that have the leisure patience and mean to collect together all the proof concern most of the opinion he have so as safely to conclude that he have a clear and full view and that there be no more to be allege for he better information and yet we be force to determine ourselves on the one side or other the conduct of we life and the management of we great concern will not bear delay : for those depend for the most part on the determination of we judgment in point wherein we be not capable of certain and demonstrative knowledge and wherein it be necessary for we to embrace the one side or the other 4 the right use of it mutual charity and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinion since therefore it be unavoidable to the greatest part of man if not all to have several opinion without certain and indubitable proof of they truth and it carry too great a imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for man to quit and renounce they former tenet presently upon the offer of a argument which they can not immediately answer and show the insufficiency of : it would methink become all man to maintain peace and the common office of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinion since we can not reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit he own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to a authority which the understanding of man acknowledge not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictate of another if he you would bring over to you sentiment be one that examine before he assent you must give he leave at he leisure to go over the account again and recall what be out of he mind examine all the particulars to see on which side the advantage lie : and if he will not think we argument of weight enough to engage he anew in so much pain it be but what we often do ourselves in the like case and we should take it amiss if other should prescribe to we what point we should study and if he be one who take he opinion upon trust how can we imagine that he should renounce those tenet which time and custom have so settle in he mind that he think they self-evident and of a unquestionably certainty or which he take to be impression he have receive from god himself or from man send by he how can we expect i say that opinion thus settle should be give up to the argument or authority of a stranger or adversary especially if there be any suspicion of interest or design as there never fail to be where man find themselves ill-trusted we should do well to commiserate we mutual ignorance and endeavor to remove it in all the gentle and fair way of information and not instantly treat other ill as obstinate and perverse because they will not renounce they own and receive we opinion or at least those we would force upon they when it be more than probable that we be no less obstinate in not embrace some of theirs for where be the man that have incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he hold or of the falsehood of all he condemn or can say that he have examine to the bottom all he own or other man 's opinion the necessity of believe without knowledge nay often upon very slight grounds in this fleeting state of action and blindness we be in should make we more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain other at least those who have not thoroughly examine to the bottom all they own tenet must confess they be unfit to prescribe to other and be unreasonable in impose that as truth on other man 's belief which they themselves have not search into nor weigh the argument of probability on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examine and be thereby get past doubt in all the doctrine they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require other to follow they : but these be so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in they opinion that nothing insolent and imperious be to be expect from they : and there be reason to think that if man be better instruct themselves they would be less impose on other 5 probability be either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what be beyond the evidence of we sens but to return to the grounds of assent and the several degree of it we be to take notice that the proposition we receive upon inducement of probability be of two sort : either concern some particular existance or as it be usually term matter of fact which fall under observation be capable of human testimony or else concern thing which be beyond the discovery of we sens be not capable of any such testimony 6 concern the first of these viz particular matter of fact i the concurrent experience of all other man with ours produce assurance approach to knowledge where any particular thing consonant to the constant observation of ourselves and other in the like case come attest by the concurrent report of all that mention it we receive it as easily and build as firmly upon it as if it be certain knowledge and we reason and act thereupon with as little doubt as if it be perfect demonstration thus if all englishman who have occasion to mention it should affirm that it freeze in england the last winter or that there be swallow see there in the summer i think a man could almost as little doubt of it as that seven and four be eleven the first therefore and highest degree of probability be when the general consent of all man in all age as far as it can be know concur with a man 's constant and never-failing experience in like case to confirm the truth of any particular matter of fact attest by fair witness : such be all the state constitution and property of body and the regular proceedings of cause and effect in the ordinary course of nature this we call a argument from the nature of thing themselves for what we own and other man 's constant observation have find always to be after the same manner that we with reason conclude to be the effect of steady and regular cause though they come not within the reach of we knowledge thus that fire warm a man make lead fluid and change the color or consistency in wood or charcoal that iron sink in water and swam in quicksilver : these and the like proposition about particular fact be agreeable to we constant experience as often as we have to do with these matter and be generally speak of -lrb- when mention by other -rrb- as thing find constantly to be so and therefore not so much as controvert by anybody -- we be put past doubt that a relation affirm any such thing to have be or any predication that it will happen again in the same manner be very true these probability rise so near to certainty that they govern we thought as absolutely and influence all we action as fully as the most evident demonstration and in what concern we we make little or no difference between they and certain knowledge we belief thus ground rise to assurance 7 ii unquestionable testimony and we own experience that a thing be for the most part so produce confidence the next degree of probability be when i find by my own experience and the agreement of all other that mention it a thing to be for the most part so and that the particular instance of it be attest by many and undoubted witness : vg history give we such a account of man in all age and my own experience as far as i have a opportunity to observe confirm it that most man prefer they private advantage to the public : if all historian that write of tiberius say that tiberius do so it be extremely probable and in this case we assent have a sufficient foundation to raise itself to a degree which we may call confidence 8 iii fair testimony and the nature of the thing indifferent produce unavoidable assent in thing that happen indifferently as that a bird should fly this or that way that it should thunder on a man 's right or left hand & c when any particular matter of fact be vouch by the concurrent testimony of unsuspected witness there we assent be also unavoidable thus : that there be such a city in italy as rome : that about one thousand seven hundred year ago there live in it a man call julius caesar that he be a general and that he win a battle against another call pompey this though in the nature of the thing there be nothing for nor against it yet be relate by historian of credit and contradict by no one writer a man can not avoid believe it and can as little doubt of it as he do of the be and action of he own acquaintance whereof he himself be a witness 9 experience and testimony clash infinitely vary the degree of probability thus far the matter go easy enough probability upon such grounds carry so much evidence with it that it naturally determine the judgment and leave we as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration do whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty be when testimony contradict common experience and the report of history and witness clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it be where diligence attention and exactness be require to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing : which rise and fall accord as those two foundation of credibility viz common observation in like case and particular testimony in that particular instance favor or contradict it these be liable to so great variety of contrary observation circumstance report different qualification temper design oversight & c of the reporter that it be impossible to reduce to precise rule the various degree wherein man give they assent this only may be say in general that as the argument and proof pro and con upon due examination nicely weigh every particular circumstance shall to any one appear upon the whole matter in a greater or less degree to preponderate on either side so they be fit to produce in the mind such different entertainment as we call belief conjecture guess doubt waver distrust disbelief & c 10 traditional testimony the further remove the less they proof become this be what concern assent in matter wherein testimony be make use of : concern which i think it may not be amiss to take notice of a rule observe in the law of england which be that though the attested copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attest and by ever so credible witness will not be admit as a proof in judicature this be so generally approve as reasonable and suit to the wisdom and caution to be use in we inquiry after material truth that i never yet hear of any one that blame it this practice if it be allowable in the decision of right and wrong carry this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it be from the original truth the less force and proof it have the be and existence of the thing itself be what i call the original truth a credible man vouch he knowledge of it be a good proof but if another equally credible do witness it from he report the testimony be weaker : and a third that attest the hearsay of a hearsay be yet less considerable so that in traditional truth each remove weaken the force of the proof : and the more hand the tradition have successively pass through the less strength and evidence do it receive from they this i think necessary to be take notice of : because i find amongst some man the quite contrary commonly practice who look on opinion to gain force by grow older and what a thousand year since would not to a rational man contemporary with the first voucher have appear at all probable be now urge as certain beyond all question only because several have since from he say it one after another upon this ground proposition evidently false or doubtful enough in they first beginning come by a inverted rule of probability to pass for authentic truth and those which find or deserve little credit from the mouth of they first author be think to grow venerable by age be urge as undeniable 11 yet history be of great use i would not be think here to lessen the credit and use of history : it be all the light we have in many case and we receive from it a great part of the useful truth we have with a convincing evidence i think nothing more valuable than the record of antiquity : i wish we have more of they and more uncorrupted but this truth itself force I to say that no probability can rise higher than its first original what have no other evidence than the single testimony of one only witness must stand or fall by he only testimony whether good bad or indifferent and though cite afterwards by hundred of other one after another be so far from receive any strength thereby that it be only the weaker passion interest inadvertency mistake of he meaning and a thousand odd reason or capricio man 's mind be act by -lrb- impossible to be discover -rrb- may make one man quote another man 's word or mean wrong he that have but ever so little examine the citation of writer can not doubt how little credit the quotation deserve where the original be want and consequently how much less quotation of quotation can be rely on this be certain that what in one age be affirm upon slight grounds can never after come to be more valid in future age by be often repeat but the further still it be from the original the less valid it be and have always less force in the mouth or writing of he that last make use of it than in he from whom he receive it 12 secondly in thing which sense can not discover analogy be the great rule of probability -lrb- secondly -rrb- the probability we have hitherto mention be only such as concern matter of fact and such thing as be capable of observation and testimony there remain that other sort concern which man entertain opinion with variety of assent though the thing be such that fall not under the reach of we sens they be not capable of testimony such be 1 the existence nature and operation of finite immaterial being without we as spirit angel devil & c or the existence of material being which either for they smallness in themselves or remoteness from we we sens can not take notice of -- as whether there be any plant animal and intelligent inhabitant in the planet and other mansion of the vast universe 2 concern the manner of operation in most part of the work of nature : wherein though we see the sensible effect yet they cause be unknown and we perceive not the way and manner how they be produce we see animal be generate nourished and move the loadstone draw iron and the part of a candle successively melting turn into flame and give we both light and heat these and the like effect we see and know : but the cause that operate and the manner they be produce in we can only guess and probably conjecture for these and the like come not within the scrutiny of human sens can not be examine by they or be attest by anybody and therefore can appear more or less probable only as they more or less agree to truth that be establish in we mind and as they hold proportion to other part of we knowledge and observation analogy in these matter be the only help we have and it be from that alone we draw all we grounds of probability thus observe that the bare rubbing of two body violently one upon another produce heat and very often fire itself we have reason to think that what we call heat and fire consist in a violent agitation of the imperceptible minute part of the burning matter observe likewise that the different refraction of pellucid body produce in we eye the different appearance of several color and also that the different range and lay the superficial part of several body as of velvet water silk & c do the like we think it probable that the color and shine of body be in they nothing but the different arrangement and refraction of they minute and insensible part thus find in all part of the creation that fall under human observation that there be a gradual connexion of one with another without any great or discernible gap between in all that great variety of thing we see in the world which be so closely link together that in the several rank of being it be not easy to discover the bound betwixt they we have reason to be persuade that by such gentle step thing ascend upward in degree of perfection it be a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin and where insensible and irrational end : and who be there quick-sighted enough to determine precisely which be the lowest species of live thing and which the first of those which have no life thing as far as we can observe lessen and augment as the quantity do in a regular cone where though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance yet the difference between the upper and under where they touch one another be hardly discernible the difference be exceed great between some man and some animal : but if we will compare the understanding and ability of some man and some brute we shall find so little difference that it will be hard to say that that of the man be either clearer or larger observe i say such gradual and gentle descent downward in those part of the creation that be beneath man the rule of analogy may make it probable that it be so also in thing above we and we observation and that there be several rank of intelligent being excel we in several degree of perfection ascend upward towards the infinite perfection of the creator by gentle step and difference that be every one at no great distance from the next to it this sort of probability which be the best conduct of rational experiment and the rise of hypothesis have also its use and influence and a wary reasoning from analogy lead we often into the discovery of truth and useful production which would otherwise lie conceal 13 one case where contrary experience lessen not the testimony though the common experience and the ordinary course of thing have justly a mighty influence on the mind of man to make they give or refuse credit to anything propose to they belief yet there be one case wherein the strangeness of the fact lessen not the assent to a fair testimony give of it for where such supernatural event be suitable to end aim at by he who have the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstance that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they be beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this be the proper case of miracle which well attest do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truth which need such confirmation 14 the bare testimony of divine revelation be the highest certainty besides those we have hitherto mention there be one sort of proposition that challenge the highest degree of we assent upon bare testimony whether the thing propose agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of thing or no the reason whereof be because the testimony be of such a one as can not deceive nor be deceive : and that be of god himself this carry with it a assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond exception this be call by a peculiar name revelation and we assent to it faith which -lrb- as absolutely determine we mind and as perfectly exclude all waver -rrb- as we knowledge itself and we may as well doubt of we own be as we can whether any revelation from god be true so that faith be a settle and sure principle of assent and assurance and leave no manner of room for doubt or hesitation only we must be sure that it be a divine revelation and that we understand it right : else we shall expose ourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm and all the error of wrong principle if we have faith and assurance in what be not divine revelation and therefore in those case we assent can be rationally no higher than the evidence of its be a revelation and that this be the meaning of the expression it be deliver in if the evidence of its be a revelation or that this be its true sense be only on probable proof we assent can reach no higher than a assurance or diffidence arise from the more or less apparent probability of the proof but of faith and the precedency it ought to have before other argument of persuasion i shall speak more hereafter where i treat of it as it be ordinarily place in contradistinction to reason though in truth it be nothing else but a assent found on the highest reason chapter xvii of reason 1 various signification of the word reason the word reason in the english language have different signification : sometimes it be take for true and clear principle : sometimes for clear and fair deduction from those principle : and sometimes for the cause and particularly the final cause but the consideration i shall have of it here be in a signification different from all these and that be as it stand for a faculty in man that faculty whereby man be suppose to be distinguish from beast and wherein it be evident he much surpass they 2 wherein reasoning consist if general knowledge as have be show consist in a perception of the agreement or disagreement of we own idea and the knowledge of the existence of all thing without we -lrb- except only of a god whose existence every man may certainly know and demonstrate to himself from he own existence -rrb- be have only by we sens what room be there for the exercise of any other faculty but outward sense and inward perception what need be there of reason very much : both for the enlargement of we knowledge and regulate we assent for it have to do both in knowledge and opinion and be necessary and assist to all we other intellectual faculty and indeed contain two of they viz sagacity and illation by the one it find out and by the other it so order the intermediate idea as to discover what connexion there be in each link of the chain whereby the extreme be hold together and thereby as it be to draw into view the truth seek for which be that which we call illation or inference and consist in nothing but the perception of the connexion there be between the idea in each step of the deduction whereby the mind come to see either the certain agreement or disagreement of any two idea as in demonstration in which it arrive at knowledge or they probable connexion on which it give or withhold its assent as in opinion sense and intuition reach but a very little way the greatest part of we knowledge depend upon deduction and intermediate idea : and in those case where we be fain to substitute assent instead of knowledge and take proposition for true without be certain they be so we have need to find out examine and compare the grounds of they probability in both these case the faculty which find out the means and rightly apply they to discover certainty in the one and probability in the other be that which we call reason for as reason perceive the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the idea or proof one to another in each step of any demonstration that produce knowledge so it likewise perceive the probable connexion of all the idea or proof one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this be the lowest degree of that which can be truly call reason for where the mind do not perceive this probable connexion where it do not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there man 's opinion be not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effect of chance and hazard of a mind float at all adventure without choice and without direction 3 reason in its four degree so that we may in reason consider these four degree : the first and highest be the discover and find out of truth the second the regular and methodical disposition of they and lay they in a clear and fit order to make they connexion and force be plainly and easily perceive the third be the perceive they connexion and the fourth a make a right conclusion these several degree may be observe in any mathematical demonstration it be one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration be make by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the part a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly one 's self and something different from all these to have first find out these intermediate idea or proof by which it be make 4 whether syllogism be the great instrument of reason there be one thing more which i shall desire to be consider concern reason and that be whether syllogism as be generally think be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercise this faculty the cause i have to doubt be these : -- first cause to doubt this first because syllogism serve we reason but in one only of the forementioned part of it and that be to show the connexion of the proof in any one instance and no more but in this it be of no great use since the mind can perceive such connexion where it really be as easily nay perhaps better without it man can reason well who can not make a syllogism if we will observe the acting of we own mind we shall find that we reason best and clearest when we only observe the connexion of the proof without reduce we thought to any rule of syllogism and therefore we may take notice that there be many man that reason exceed clear and rightly who know not how to make a syllogism he that will look into many part of asia and america will find man reason there perhaps as acutely as himself who yet never hear of a syllogism nor can reduce any one argument to those form : -lrb- and i believe scarce any one make syllogism in reasoning within himself -rrb- indeed syllogism be make use of on occasion to discover a fallacy hide in a rhetorical flourish or cunningly wrapt up in a smooth period and strip a absurdity of the cover of wit and good language show it in its naked deformity but the mind be not teach to reason by these rule it have a native faculty to perceive the coherence or incoherence of its idea and can range they right without any such perplexing repetition tell a country gentlewoman that the wind be south-west and the weather lowering and like to rain and she will easily understand it be not safe for she to go abroad thin clothe in such a day after a fever : she clearly see the probable connexion of all these viz south-west wind and cloud rain wet take cold relapse and danger of death without tie they together in those artificial and cumbersome fetter of several syllogism that clog and hinder the mind which proceed from one part to another quicker and clearer without they : and the probability which she easily perceive in thing thus in they native state would be quite lose if this argument be manage learnedly and propose in mode and figure for it very often confound the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstration that the knowledge gain thereby come shortest and clearest without syllogism secondly because though syllogism serve to show the force or fallacy of a argument make use of in the usual way of discourse by supply the absent proposition and so set it before the view in a clear light yet it no less engage the mind in the perplexity of obscure equivocal and fallacious term wherewith this artificial way of reasoning always abound : it be adapt more to the attaining of victory in dispute than the discovery and confirmation of truth in fair enquiry 5 syllogism help little in demonstration less in probability but however it be in knowledge i think i may truly say it be of far less or no use at all in probability for the assent there be to be determine by the preponderancy after due weigh of all the proof with all circumstance on both side nothing be so unfit to assist the mind in that as syllogism which run away with one assume probability or one topical argument pursue that till it have lead the mind quite out of sight of the thing under consideration and force it upon some remote difficulty hold it fast there entangled perhaps and as it be manacle in the chain of syllogism without allow it the liberty much less afford it the help requisite to show on which side all thing consider be the greater probability 6 serve not to increase we knowledge but to fence with the knowledge we suppose we have but let it help we -lrb- as perhaps may be say -rrb- in convince man of they error and mistake : -lrb- and yet i would fain see the man that be force out of he opinion by dint of syllogism -rrb- yet still it fail we reason in that part which if not its highest perfection be yet certainly its hardest task and that which we most need its help in and that be the find out of proof and make new discovery the rule of syllogism serve not to furnish the mind with those intermediate idea that may show the connexion of remote one this way of reasoning discover no new proof but be the art of marshalling and range the old one we have already the forty-seventh proposition of the first book of euclid be very true but the discovery of it i think not owe to any rule of common logic a man know first and then he be able to prove syllogistically so that syllogism come after knowledge and then a man have little or no need of it but it be chiefly by the find out those idea that show the connexion of distant one that we stock of knowledge be increase and that useful art and science be advanced syllogism at best be but the art of fencing with the little knowledge we have without make any addition to it and if a man should employ he reason all this way he will not do much otherwise than he who have get some iron out of the bowels of the earth should have it beat up all into sword and put it into he servant ' hand to fence with and bang one another have the king of spain employ the hand of he people and he spanish iron so he have bring to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hide in the dark entrails of america and i be apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of he reason only in brandish of syllogism will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lie yet conceal in the secret recess of nature and which i be apt to think native rustic reason -lrb- as it formerly have do -rrb- be likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict rule of mode and figure 7 other help to reason than syllogism should be seek i doubt not nevertheless but there be way to be find to assist we reason in this most useful part and this the judicious hooker encourage I to say who in he eccl pol 1 i section 6 speak thus : ` if there might be add the right help of true art and learning -lrb- which help i must plainly confess this age of the world carry the name of a learn age doth neither much know nor generally regard -rrb- there would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of judgment between man therewith inure and that which man now be as between man that be now and innocent ' i do not pretend to have find or discover here any of those ` right help of art ' this great man of deep thought mention : but that be plain that syllogism and the logic now in use which be as well know in he day can be none of those he mean it be sufficient for I if by a discourse perhaps something out of the way i be sure as to I wholly new and unborrowed i shall have give occasion to other to cast about for new discovery and to seek in they own thought for those right help of art which will scarce be find i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rule and dictate of other for beaten track lead this sort of cattle -lrb- as a observe roman call they -rrb- whose thought reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age be adorn with some man of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ they thought on this subject could open new and undiscovered way to the advancement of knowledge 8 we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all we reasoning be nothing but particular idea have here have occasion to speak of syllogism in general and the use of it in reasoning and the improvement of we knowledge it be fit before i leave this subject to take notice of one manifest mistake in the rule of syllogism : viz that no syllogistical reasoning can be right and conclusive but what have at least one general proposition in it as if we could not reason and have knowledge about particulars : whereas in truth the matter rightly consider the immediate object of all we reasoning and knowledge be nothing but particulars every man 's reasoning and knowledge be only about the idea exist in he own mind which be truly every one of they particular existence : and we knowledge and reason about other thing be only as they correspond with those we particular idea so that the perception of the agreement or disagreement of we particular idea be the whole and utmost of all we knowledge universality be but accidental to it and consist only in this that the particular idea about which it be be such as more than one particular thing can correspond with and be represent by but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of we particular idea and consequently we knowledge be equally clear and certain whether either or both or neither of those idea be capable of represent more real being than one or no 9 we reason often fail we reason though it penetrate into the depths of the sea and earth elevate we thought as high as the star and lead we through the vast space and large room of this mighty fabric yet it come far short of the real extent of even corporeal be and there be many instance wherein it fail we : as first in case when we have no idea i it perfectly fail we where we idea fail it neither do nor can extend itself further than they do and therefore wherever we have no idea we reasoning stop and we be at a end of we reckoning : and if at any time we reason about word which do not stand for any idea it be only about those sound and nothing else 10 secondly because we idea be often obscure or imperfect ii we reason be often puzzle and at a loss because of the obscurity confusion or imperfection of the idea it be employ about and there we be involve in difficulty and contradiction thus not have any perfect idea of the least extension of matter nor of infinity we be at a loss about the divisibility of matter but have perfect clear and distinct idea of number we reason meet with none of those inextricable difficulty in number nor find itself involve in any contradiction about they thus we have but imperfect idea of the operation of we mind and of the beginning of motion or think how the mind produce either of they in we and much imperfecter yet of the operation of god run into great difficulty about free create agent which reason can not well extricate itself out of 11 iii thirdly because we perceive not intermediate idea to show conclusion we reason be often at a stand because it perceive not those idea which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two idea : and in this some man 's faculty far outgo other till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity be discover man with amazement look on several of the demonstration of ancient mathematician and could scarce forbear to think the finding several of those proof to be something more than human 12 iv fourthly because we often proceed upon wrong principle the mind by proceed upon false principle be often engage in absurdity and difficulty bring into strait and contradiction without know how to free itself : and in that case it be in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject the influence of those wrong principle reason be so far from clear the difficulty which the building upon false foundation bring a man into that if he will pursue it it entangle he the more and engage he deeper in perplexity 13 v fifthly because we often employ doubtful term as obscure and imperfect idea often involve we reason so upon the same ground do dubious word and uncertain sign often in discourse and arguing when not warily attend to puzzle man 's reason and bring they to a nonplus but these two latter be we fault and not the fault of reason but yet the consequence of they be nevertheless obvious and the perplexity or error they fill man 's mind with be everywhere observable 14 we highest degree of knowledge be intuitive without reasoning some of the idea that be in the mind be so there that they can be by themselves immediately compare one with another : and in these the mind be able to perceive that they agree or disagree as clearly as that it have they thus the mind perceive that a arch of a circle be less than the whole circle as clearly as it do the idea of a circle : and this therefore as have be say i call intuitive knowledge which be certain beyond all doubt and need no probation nor can have any this be the highest of all human certainty in this consist the evidence of all those maxim which nobody have any doubt about but every man -lrb- do not as be say only assent to but -rrb- know to be true as soon as ever they be propose to he understanding in the discovery of and assent to these truth there be no use of the discursive faculty no need of reasoning but they be know by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at thing unknown i be apt to think that angel have now and the spirit of just man make perfect shall have in a future state of thousand of thing which now either wholly escape we apprehension or which we short-sighted reason have get some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after 15 the next be get by reasoning but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some spark of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of we idea be such that we can not discern they agreement or disagreement by a immediate compare they and in all these we have need of reasoning and must by discourse and inference make we discovery now of these there be two sort which i shall take the liberty to mention here again : -- first through reasoning that be demonstrative first those whose agreement or disagreement though it can not be see by a immediate put they together yet may be examine by the intervention of other idea which can be compare with they in this case when the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea on both side with those which we would compare be plainly discern : there it amount to demonstration whereby knowledge be produce which though it be certain yet it be not so easy nor altogether so clear as intuitive knowledge because in that there be barely one simple intuition wherein there be no room for any the least mistake or doubt : the truth be see all perfectly at once in demonstration it be true there be intuition too but not altogether at once for there must be a remembrance of the intuition of the agreement of the medium or intermediate idea with that we compare it with before when we compare it with the other : and where there be many medium there the danger of the mistake be the greater for each agreement or disagreement of the idea must be observe and see in each step of the whole train and retain in the memory just as it be and the mind must be sure that no part of what be necessary to make up the demonstration be omit or overlook this make some demonstration long and perplexed and too hard for those who have not strength of part distinctly to perceive and exactly carry so many particulars orderly in they head and even those who be able to master such intricate speculation be fain sometimes to go over they again and there be need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retain the intuition it have of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth & c there the agreement of the first and the fourth be a demonstration and produce certain knowledge which may be call rational knowledge as the other be intuitive 16 secondly to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reasoning secondly there be other idea whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judge of but by the intervention of other which have not a certain agreement with the extreme but a usual or likely one : and in these be that the judgment be properly exercise which be the acquiescing of the mind that any idea do agree by compare they with such probable medium this though it never amount to knowledge no not to that which be the lowest degree of it yet sometimes the intermediate idea tie the extreme so firmly together and the probability be so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follow it as knowledge do demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment be to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then cast they up all right together choose that side which have the overbalance 17 intuition demonstration judgment intuitive knowledge be the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two idea immediately compare together rational knowledge be the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two idea by the intervention of one or more other idea judgment be the thinking or take two idea to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more idea whose certain agreement or disagreement with they it do not perceive but have observe to be frequent and usual 18 consequence of word and consequence of idea though the deduce one proposition from another or make inference in word be a great part of reason and that which it be usually employ about yet the principal act of ratiocination be the find the agreement or disagreement of two idea one with another by the intervention of a third as a man by a yard find two house to be of the same length which could not be bring together to measure they equality by juxta-position word have they consequence as the sign of such idea : and thing agree or disagree as really they be but we observe it only by we idea 19 four sort of argument before we quit this subject it may be worth we while a little to reflect on four sort of argument that man in they reasoning with other do ordinarily make use of to prevail on they assent or at least so to awe they as to silence they opposition first argumentum ad verecundiam i the first be to allege the opinion of man whose part learn eminency power or some other cause have gain a name and settle they reputation in the common esteem with some kind of authority when man be establish in any kind of dignity it be think a breach of modesty for other to derogate any way from it and question the authority of man who be in possession of it this be apt to be censure as carry with it too much pride when a man do not readily yield to the determination of approve author which be wont to be receive with respect and submission by other : and it be look upon as insolence for a man to set up and adhere to he own opinion against the current stream of antiquity or to put it in the balance against that of some learn doctor or otherwise approve writer whoever back he tenet with such authority think he ought thereby to carry the cause and be ready to style it impudence in any one who shall stand out against they this i think may be call argumentum ad verecundiam 20 secondly argumentum ad ignorantiam ii secondly another way that man ordinarily use to drive other and force they to submit they judgment and receive the opinion in debate be to require the adversary to admit what they allege as a proof or to assign a better and this i call argumentum ad ignorantiam 21 thirdly argumentum ad hominem iii thirdly a third way be to press a man with consequence draw from he own principle or concession this be already know under the name of argumentum ad hominem 22 fourthly argumentum ad justicium the fourth alone advance we in knowledge and judgment iv the fourth be the use of proof draw from any of the foundation of knowledge or probability this i call argumentum ad justicium this alone of all the four bring true instruction with it and advance we in we way to knowledge for 1 it argue not another man 's opinion to be right because i out of respect or any other consideration but that of conviction will not contradict he 2 it prove not another man to be in the right way nor that i ought to take the same with he because i know not a better 3 nor do it follow that another man be in the right way because he have show I that i be in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another man 's persuasion : i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better : i may be in a error and another may show I that i be so this may dispose I perhaps for the reception of truth but help I not to it : that must come from proof and argument and light arise from the nature of thing themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error 23 above contrary and accord to reason by what have be before say of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of thing into those that be accord to above and contrary to reason 1 accord to reason be such proposition whose truth we can discover by examine and trace those idea we have from sensation and reflection and by natural deduction find to be true or probable 2 above reason be such proposition whose truth or probability we can not by reason derive from those principle 3 contrary to reason be such proposition as be inconsistent with or irreconcilable to we clear and distinct idea thus the existence of one god be accord to reason the existence of more than one god contrary to reason the resurrection of the dead above reason above reason also may be take in a double sense viz either as signify above probability or above certainty : and in that large sense also contrary to reason be i suppose sometimes take 24 reason and faith not opposite for faith must be regulate by reason there be another use of the word reason wherein it be oppose to faith : which though it be in itself a very improper way of speak yet common use have so authorize it that it would be folly either to oppose or hope to remedy it only i think it may not be amiss to take notice that however faith be oppose to reason faith be nothing but a firm assent of the mind : which if it be regulate as be we duty can not be afford to anything but upon good reason and so can not be opposite to it he that believe without have any reason for believe may be in love with he own fancy but neither seek truth as he ought nor pay the obedience due to he maker who would have he use those discerning faculty he have give he to keep he out of mistake and error he that do not this to the best of he power however he sometimes light on truth be in the right but by chance and i know not whether the luckiness of the accident will excuse the irregularity of he proceed this at least be certain that he must be accountable for whatever mistake he run into : whereas he that make use of the light and faculty god have give he and seek sincerely to discover truth by those help and ability he have may have this satisfaction in do he duty as a rational creature that though he should miss truth he will not miss the reward of it for he govern he assent right and place it as he should who in any case or matter whatsoever believe or disbelieve accord as reason direct he he that doth otherwise transgress against he own light and misuse those faculty which be give he to no other end but to search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith be by some man oppose we will so consider they in the follow chapter chapter xviii of faith and reason and they distinct province 1 necessary to know they boundary it have be above show 1 that we be of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sort where we want idea 2 that we be ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proof 3 that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determine specific idea 4 that we want probability to direct we assent in matter where we have neither knowledge of we own nor testimony of other man to bottom we reason upon from these thing thus premise i think we may come to lay down the measure and boundary between faith and reason : the want whereof may possibly have be the cause if not of great disorder yet at least of great dispute and perhaps mistake in the world for till it be resolve how far we be to be guide by reason and how far by faith we shall in vain dispute and endeavor to convince one another in matter of religion 2 faith and reason what as contradistingushed i find every sect as far as reason will help they make use of it gladly : and where it fail they they cry out it be matter of faith and above reason and i do not see how they can argue with any one or ever convince a gainsayer who make use of the same plea without set down strict boundary between faith and reason which ought to be the first point establish in all question where faith have anything to do reason therefore here as contradistinguish to faith i take to be the discovery of the certainty or probability of such proposition or truth which the mind arrive at by deduction make from such idea which it have get by the use of its natural faculty viz by sensation or reflection faith on the other side be the assent to any proposition not thus make out by the deduction of reason but upon the credit of the proposer as come from god in some extraordinary way of communication this way of discover truth to man we call revelation 3 first no new simple idea can be convey by traditional revelation first then i say that no man inspire by god can by any revelation communicate to other any new simple idea which they have not before from sensation or reflection for whatsoever impression he himself may have from the immediate hand of god this revelation if it be of new simple idea can not be convey to another either by word or any other sign because word by they immediate operation on we cause no other idea but of they natural sound : and it be by the custom of use they for sign that they excite and revive in we mind latent idea but yet only such idea as be there before for word see or hear recal to we thought those idea only which to we they have be wont to be sign of but can not introduce any perfectly new and formerly unknown simple idea the same hold in all other sign which can not signify to we thing of which we have before never have any idea at all thus whatever thing be discover to st paul when he be rapt up into the third heaven whatever new idea he mind there receive all the description he can make to other of that place be only this that there be such thing ` as eye have not see nor ear hear nor have it enter into the heart of man to conceive ' and suppose god should discover to any one supernaturally a species of creature inhabit for example jupiter or saturn -lrb- for that it be possible there may be such nobody can deny -rrb- which have six sens and imprint on he mind the idea convey to theirs by that sixth sense : he could no more by word produce in the mind of other man those idea imprint by that sixth sense than one of we could convey the idea of any color by the sound of word into a man who have the other four sens perfect have always totally want the fifth of see for we simple idea then which be the foundation and sole matter of all we notion and knowledge we must depend wholly on we reason i mean we natural faculty and can by no means receive they or any of they from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impression which be make immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we can not set any bound and by the other those impression deliver over to other in word and the ordinary way of convey we conception one to another 4 secondly traditional revelation may make we know proposition knowable also by reason but not with the same certainty that reason doth secondly i say that the same truth may be discover and convey down from revelation which be discernable to we by reason and by those idea we naturally may have so god might by revelation discover the truth of any proposition in euclid as well as man by the natural use of they faculty come to make the discovery themselves in all thing of this kind there be little need or use of revelation god have furnish we with natural and surer means to arrive at the knowledge of they for whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery of from the knowledge and contemplation of we own idea will always be certainer to we than those which be convey to we by traditional revelation for the knowledge we have that this revelation come at first from god can never be so sure as the knowledge we have from the clear and distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of we own idea : vg if it be reveal some age since that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one i might assent to the truth of that proposition upon the credit of the tradition that it be reveal : but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the knowledge of it upon the compare and measure my own idea of two right angle and the three angle of a triangle the like hold in matter of fact knowable by we sens vg the history of the deluge be convey to we by writings which have they original from revelation : and yet nobody i think will say he have as certain and clear a knowledge of the flood as noah that see it or that he himself would have have have he then be alive and see it for he have no greater a assurance than that of he sens that it be writ in the book suppose writ by mose inspire : but he have not so great a assurance that mose write that book as if he have see mose write it so that the assurance of its be a revelation be less still than the assurance of he sens 5 even original revelation can not be admit against the clear evidence of reason in proposition then whose certainty be build upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of we idea attain either by immediate intuition as in self-evident proposition or by evident deduction of reason in demonstration we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain we assent and introduce they into we mind because the natural way of knowledge could settle they there or have do it already which be the greatest assurance we can possibly have of anything unless where god immediately reveal it to we : and there too we assurance can be no greater than we knowledge be that it be a revelation from god but yet nothing i think can under that title shake or overrule plain knowledge or rationally prevail with any man to admit it for true in a direct contradiction to the clear evidence of he own understanding for since no evidence of we faculty by which we receive such revelation can exceed if equal the certainty of we intuitive knowledge we can never receive for a truth anything that be directly contrary to we clear and distinct knowledge vg the idea of one body and one place do so clearly agree and the mind have so evident a perception of they agreement that we can never assent to a proposition that affirm the same body to be in two distant place at once however it should pretend to the authority of a divine revelation : since the evidence first that we deceive not ourselves in ascribe it to god secondly that we understand it right can never be so great as the evidence of we own intuitive knowledge whereby we discern it impossible for the same body to be in two place at once and therefore no proposition can be receive for divine revelation or obtain the assent due to all such if it be contradictory to we clear intuitive knowledge because this would be to subvert the principle and foundation of all knowledge evidence and assent whatsoever : and there would be leave no difference between truth and falsehood no measure of credible and incredible in the world if doubtful proposition shall take place before self-evident and what we certainly know give way to what we may possibly be mistake in in proposition therefore contrary to the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of we idea it will be in vain to urge they as matter of faith they can not move we assent under that or any other title whatsoever for faith can never convince we of anything that contradict we knowledge because though faith be found on the testimony of god -lrb- who can not lie -rrb- reveal any proposition to we : yet we can not have a assurance of the truth of its be a divine revelation greater than we own knowledge since the whole strength of the certainty depend upon we knowledge that god reveal it which in this case where the proposition suppose reveal contradict we knowledge or reason will always have this objection hang to it viz that we can not tell how to conceive that to come from god the bountiful author of we be which if receive for true must overturn all the principle and foundation of knowledge he have give we render all we faculty useless wholly destroy the most excellent part of he workmanship we understanding and put a man in a condition wherein he will have less light less conduct than the beast that perisheth for if the mind of man can never have a clearer -lrb- and perhaps not so clear -rrb- evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it have of the principle of its own reason it can never have a ground to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation have not a greater evidence than those principle have 6 traditional revelation much less thus far a man have use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it be suppose to be make to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but be require to pay obedience and to receive the truth reveal to other which by the tradition of writings or word of mouth be convey down to they reason have a great deal more to do and be that only which can induce we to receive they for matter of faith be only divine revelation and nothing else faith as we use the word -lrb- call commonly divine faith -rrb- have to do with no proposition but those which be suppose to be divinely reveal so that i do not see how those who make revelation alone the sole object of faith can say that it be a matter of faith and not of reason to believe that such or such a proposition to be find in such or such a book be of divine inspiration unless it be reveal that that proposition or all in that book be communicate by divine inspiration without such a revelation the believe or not believe that proposition or book to be of divine authority can never be matter of faith but matter of reason and such as i must come to a assent to only by the use of my reason which can never require or enable I to believe that which be contrary to itself : it be impossible for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appear unreasonable in all thing therefore where we have clear evidence from we idea and those principle of knowledge i have above mention reason be the proper judge and revelation though it may in consent with it confirm its dictate yet can not in such case invalidate its decree : nor can we be oblige where we have the clear and evident sentence of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it be matter of faith : which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictate of reason 7 thirdly thing above reason be when reveal the proper matter of faith but thirdly there be many thing wherein we have very imperfect notion or none at all and other thing of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of we faculty we can have no knowledge at all these as be beyond the discovery of we natural faculty and above reason be when reveal the proper matter of faith thus that part of the angel rebel against god and thereby lose they first happy state : and that the dead shall rise and live again : these and the like be beyond the discovery of reason be purely matter of faith with which reason have directly nothing to do 8 or not contrary to reason if reveal be matter of faith and must carry it against probable conjecture of reason but since god in give we the light of reason have not thereby tie up he own hand from afford we when he think fit the light of revelation in any of those matter wherein we natural faculty be able to give a probable determination revelation where god have be please to give it must carry it against the probable conjecture of reason because the mind not be certain of the truth of that it do not evidently know but only yield to the probability that appear in it be bind to give up its assent to such a testimony which it be satisfied come from one who can not err and will not deceive but yet it still belong to reason to judge of the truth of its be a revelation and of the signification of the word wherein it be deliver indeed if anything shall be think revelation which be contrary to the plain principle of reason and the evident knowledge the mind have of its own clear and distinct idea there reason must be hearken to as to a matter within its province since a man can never have so certain a knowledge that a proposition which contradict the clear principle and evidence of he own knowledge be divinely reveal or that he understand the word rightly wherein it be deliver as he have that the contrary be true and so be bind to consider and judge of it as a matter of reason and not swallow it without examination as a matter of faith 9 revelation in matter where reason can not judge or but probably ought to be hearken to first whatever proposition be reveal of whose truth we mind by its natural faculty and notion can not judge that be purely matter of faith and above reason secondly all proposition whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculty can come to determine and judge from naturally acquire idea be matter of reason with this difference still that in those concern which it have but a uncertain evidence and so be persuade of they truth only upon probable grounds which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without do violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturn the principle of all reason in such probable proposition i say a evident revelation ought to determine we assent even against probability for where the principle of reason have not evidence a proposition to be certainly true or false there clear revelation as another principle of truth and ground of assent may determine and so it may be matter of faith and be also above reason because reason in that particular matter be able to reach no higher than probability faith give the determination where reason come short and revelation discover on which side the truth lay 10 in matter where reason can afford certain knowledge that be to be hearken to thus far the dominion of faith reach and that without any violence or hindrance to reason which be not injure or disturb but assist and improve by new discovery of truth come from the eternal fountain of all knowledge whatever god have reveal be certainly true : no doubt can be make of it this be the proper object of faith : but whether it be a divine revelation or no reason must judge which can never permit the mind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what be less evident nor allow it to entertain probability in opposition to knowledge and certainty there can be no evidence that any traditional revelation be of divine original in the word we receive it and in the sense we understand it so clear and so certain as that of the principle of reason : and therefore nothing that be contrary to and inconsistent with the clear and self-evident dictate of reason have a right to be urge or assent to as a matter of faith wherein reason have nothing to do whatsoever be divine revelation ought to overrule all we opinion prejudice and interest and have a right to be receive with full assent such a submission as this of we reason to faith take not away the landmark of knowledge : this shake not the foundation of reason but leave we that use of we faculty for which they be give we 11 if the boundary be not set between faith and reason no enthusiasm or extravagancy in religion can be contradict if the province of faith and reason be not keep distinct by these boundary there will in matter of religion be no room for reason at all and those extravagant opinion and ceremony that be to be find in the several religion of the world will not deserve to be blame for to this cry up of faith in opposition to reason we may i think in good measure ascribe those absurdity that fill almost all the religion which possess and divide mankind for man have be principled with a opinion that they must not consult reason in the thing of religion however apparently contradictory to common sense and the very principle of all they knowledge have let loose they fancy and natural superstition and have be by they lead into so strange opinion and extravagant practice in religion that a considerate man can not but stand amaze at they folly and judge they so far from be acceptable to the great and wise god that he can not avoid think they ridiculous and offensive to a sober good man so that in effect religion which should most distinguish we from beast and ought most peculiarly to elevate we as rational creature above brute be that wherein man often appear most irrational and more senseless than beast themselves credo quia impossibile est : i believe because it be impossible might in a good man pass for a sally of zeal but would prove a very ill rule for man to choose they opinion or religion by chapter xix -lrb- not in early edition -rrb- chapter xx of wrong assent or error 1 cause of error or how man come to give assent contrary to probability knowledge be to be have only of visible and certain truth error be not a fault of we knowledge but a mistake of we judgment give assent to that which be not true but if assent be ground on likelihood if the proper object and motive of we assent be probability and that probability consist in what be lay down in the foregoing chapter it will be demand how man come to give they assent contrary to probability for there be nothing more common than contrariety of opinion nothing more obvious than that one man wholly disbelieve what another only doubt of and a third steadfastly believe and firmly adhere to the reason whereof though they may be very various yet i suppose may all be reduce to these four : i want of proof ii want of ability to use they iii want of will to see they iv wrong measure of probability 2 first cause of error want of proof first by want of proof i do not mean only the want of those proof which be nowhere extant and so be nowhere to be have but the want even of those proof which be in be or might be procure and thus man want proof who have not the convenience or opportunity to make experiment and observation themselves tend to the proof of any proposition nor likewise the convenience to inquire into and collect the testimony of other : and in this state be the greatest part of mankind who be give up to labor and enslave to the necessity of they mean condition whose life be wear out only in the provision for live these man 's opportunity of knowledge and inquiry be commonly as narrow as they fortune and they understanding be but little instruct when all they whole time and pain be lay out to still the croak of they own belly or the cry of they child it be not to be expect that a man who drudge on all he life in a laborious trade should be more know in the variety of thing do in the world than a packhorse who be drive constantly forwards and backwards in a narrow lane and dirty road only to market should be skilled in the geography of the country nor be it at all more possible that he who want leisure book and language and the opportunity of converse with variety of man should be in a condition to collect those testimony and observation which be in be and be necessary to make out many nay most of the proposition that in the society of man be judge of the greatest moment or to find out grounds of assurance so great as the belief of the point he would build on they be think necessary so that a great part of mankind be by the natural and unalterable state of thing in this world and the constitution of human affair unavoidably give over to invincible ignorance of those proof on which other build and which be necessary to establish those opinion : the greatest part of man have much to do to get the means of living be not in a condition to look after those of learn and laborious inquiry 3 objection what shall become of those who want proof answer what shall we say then be the greatest part of mankind by the necessity of they condition subject to unavoidable ignorance in those thing which be of greatest importance to they -lrb- for of those it be obvious to inquire -rrb- have the bulk of mankind no other guide but accident and blind chance to conduct they to they happiness or misery be the current opinion and licensed guide of every country sufficient evidence and security to every man to venture he great concernment on nay he everlasting happiness or misery or can those be the certain and infallible oracle and standard of truth which teach one thing in christendom and another in turkey or shall a poor countryman be eternally happy for have the chance to be bear in italy or a day-labourer be unavoidably lose because he have the ill-luck to be bear in england how ready some man may be to say some of these thing i will not here examine : but this i be sure that man must allow one or other of these to be true -lrb- let they choose which they please -rrb- or else grant that god have furnish man with faculty sufficient to direct they in the way they should take if they will but seriously employ they that way when they ordinary vocation allow they the leisure no man be so wholly take up with the attendance on the means of live as to have no spare time at all to think of he soul and inform himself in matter of religion be man as intent upon this as they be on thing of lower concernment there be none so enslaved to the necessity of life who might not find many vacancy that might be husband to this advantage of they knowledge 4 people hinder from inquiry besides those whose improvement and information be straiten by the narrowness of they fortune there be other whose largeness of fortune would plentifully enough supply book and other requisite for clearing of doubt and discover of truth : but they be coop in close by the law of they country and the strict guard of those whose interest it be to keep they ignorant lest know more they should believe the less in they these be as far nay further from the liberty and opportunity of a fair inquiry than these poor and wretched labourer we before speak of : and however they may seem high and great be confine to narrowness of thought and enslave in that which should be the freest part of man they understanding this be generally the case of all those who live in place where care be take to propagate truth without knowledge where man be force at a venture to be of the religion of the country and must therefore swallow down opinion as silly people do empiric 's pill without know what they be make of or how they will work and have nothing to do but believe that they will do the cure : but in this be much more miserable than they in that they be not at liberty to refuse swallow what perhaps they have rather let alone or to choose the physician to whose conduct they would trust themselves 5 second cause of error want of skill to use proof secondly those who want skill to use those evidence they have of probability who can not carry a train of consequence in they head nor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proof and testimony make every circumstance its due allowance may be easily mislead to assent to position that be not probable there be some man of one some but of two syllogism and no more and other that can but advance one step further these can not always discern that side on which the strongest proof lie can not constantly follow that which in itself be the more probable opinion now that there be such a difference between man in respect of they understanding i think nobody who have have any conversation with he neighbor will question : though he never be at westminster-hall or the exchange on the one hand nor at alms-house or bedlam on the other which great difference in man 's intellectual whether it rise from any defect in the organ of the body particularly adapt to think or in the dulness or untractableness of those faculty for want of use or as some think in the natural difference of man 's soul themselves or some or all of these together it matter not here to examine : only this be evident that there be a difference of degree in man 's understanding apprehension and reasoning to so great a latitude that one may without do injury to mankind affirm that there be a greater distance between some man and other in this respect than between some man and some beast but how this come about be a speculation though of great consequence yet not necessary to we present purpose 6 third cause of error want of will to use they thirdly there be another sort of people that want proof not because they be out of they reach but because they will not use they : who though they have riches and leisure enough and want neither part nor learning may yet through they hot pursuit of pleasure or business or else out of laziness or fear that the doctrine whose truth they would inquire into would not suit well with they opinion life or design may never come to the knowledge of nor give they assent to those possibility which lie so much within they view that to be convince of they they need but turn they eye that way we know some man will not read a letter which be suppose to bring ill news and many man forbear to cast up they account or so much as think upon they estate who have reason to fear they affair be in no very good posture how man whose plentiful fortune allow they leisure to improve they understanding can satisfy themselves with a lazy ignorance i can not tell : but methink they have a low opinion of they soul who lay out all they income in provision for the body and employ none of it to procure the means and help of knowledge who take great care to appear always in a neat and splendid outside and would think themselves miserable in coarse clothes or a patched coat and yet contentedly suffer they mind to appear abroad in a piebald livery of coarse patch and borrow shred such as it have please chance or they country tailor -lrb- i mean the common opinion of those they have converse with -rrb- to clothe they in i will not here mention how unreasonable this be for man that ever think of a future state and they concernment in it which no rational man can avoid to do sometimes : nor shall i take notice what a shame and confusion it be to the greatest contemner of knowledge to be find ignorant in thing they be concern to know but this at least be worth the consideration of those who call themselves gentleman that however they may think credit respect power and authority the concomitant of they birth and fortune yet they will find all these still carry away from they by man of lower condition who surpass they in knowledge they who be blind will always be lead by those that see or else fall into the ditch : and he be certainly the most subject the most enslave who be so in he understanding in the foregoing instance some of the cause have be show of wrong assent and how it come to pass that probable doctrine be not always receive with a assent proportionable to the reason which be to be have for they probability : but hitherto we have consider only such probability whose proof do exist but do not appear to he who embrace the error 7 fourth cause of error wrong measure of probability : which be -- fourthly there remain yet the last sort who even where the real probability appear and be plainly lay before they do not admit of the conviction nor yield unto manifest reason but do either suspend they assent or give it to the less probable opinion and to this danger be those expose who have take up wrong measure of probability which be : i proposition that be in themselves certain and evident but doubtful and false take up for principle ii receive hypothesis iii predominant passion or inclination iv authority 8 i doubtful proposition take for principle the first and firmest ground of probability be the conformity anything have to we own knowledge especially that part of we knowledge which we have embrace and continue to look on as principle these have so great a influence upon we opinion that it be usually by they we judge of truth and measure probability to that degree that what be inconsistent with we principle be so far from pass for probable with we that it will not be allow possible the reverence bear to these principle be so great and they authority so paramount to all other that the testimony not only of other man but the evidence of we own sens be often reject when they offer to vouch anything contrary to these established rule how much the doctrine of innate principle and that principle be not to be prove or question have contribute to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth can not contradict another : but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admit for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly know it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he do only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of other for he have a strong bias put into he understanding which will unavoidably misguide he assent who have imbibe wrong principle and have blindly give himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true 9 instil in childhood there be nothing more ordinary than child 's receive into they mind proposition -lrb- especially about matter of religion -rrb- from they parent nurse or those about they : which be insinuate into they unwary as well as unbiassed understanding and fasten by degree be at last -lrb- equally whether true or false -rrb- rivet there by long custom and education beyond all possibility of be pull out again for man when they be grow up reflect upon they opinion and find those of this sort to be as ancient in they mind as they very memory not have observe they early insinuation nor by what mean they get they they be apt to reverence they as sacred thing and not to suffer they to be profane touch or question : they look on they as the urim and thummim set up in they mind immediately by god himself to be the great and unerring decider of truth and falsehood and the judge to which they be to appeal in all manner of controversy 10 of irresistible efficacy this opinion of he principle -lrb- let they be what they will -rrb- be once establish in any one 's mind it be easy to be imagine what reception any proposition shall find how clearly soever prove that shall invalidate they authority or at all thwart with these internal oracle whereas the grossest absurdity and improbability be but agreeable to such principle go down glibly and be easily digest the great obstinacy that be to be find in man firmly believe quite contrary opinion though many time equally absurd in the various religion of mankind be as evident a proof as they be a unavoidable consequence of this way of reasoning from receive traditional principle so that man will disbelieve they own eye renounce the evidence of they sens and give they own experience the lie rather than admit of anything disagree with these sacred tenet take a intelligent romanist that from the first dawn of any notion in he understanding have have this principle constantly inculcate viz that he must believe as the church -lrb- ie those of he communion -rrb- believe or that the pope be infallible and this he never so much as hear question till at forty or fifty year old he meet with one of other principle : how be he prepare easily to swallow not only against all probability but even the clear evidence of he sens the doctrine of transubstantiation this principle have such a influence on he mind that he will believe that to be flesh which he see to be bread and what way will you take to convince a man of any improbable opinion he hold who with some philosopher have lay down this as a foundation of reasoning that he must believe he reason -lrb- for so man improperly call argument draw from they principle -rrb- against he sens let a enthusiast be principled that he or he teacher be inspire and act by a immediate communication of the divine spirit and you in vain bring the evidence of clear reason against he doctrine whoever therefore have imbibe wrong principle be not in thing inconsistent with these principle to be move by the most apparent and convincing probability till they be so candid and ingenuous to themselves as to be persuade to examine even those very principle which many never suffer themselves to do 11 receive hypothesis next to these be man whose understanding be cast into a mould and fashion just to the size of a receive hypothesis the difference between these and the former be that they will admit of matter of fact and agree with dissenter in that but differ only in assign of reason and explain the manner of operation these be not at that open defiance with they sens with the former : they can endure to hearken to they information a little more patiently but will by no means admit of they report in the explanation of thing nor be prevail on by probability which would convince they that thing be not bring about just after the same manner that they have decree within themselves that they be would it not be a insufferable thing for a learn professor and that which he scarlet would blush at to have he authority of forty year stand work out of hard rock greek and latin with no small expense of time and candle and confirm by general tradition and a reverend beard in a instant overturn by a upstart novelist can any one expect that he should be make to confess that what he teach he scholar thirty year ago be all error and mistake and that he sell they hard word and ignorance at a very dear rate what probability i say be sufficient to prevail in such a case and who ever by the most cogent argument will be prevail with to disrobe himself at once of all he old opinion and pretence to knowledge and learning which with hard study he have all this time be labor for and turn himself out stark naked in quest afresh of new notion all the argument that can be use will be as little able to prevail as the wind do with the traveller to part with he cloak which he hold only the faster to this of wrong hypothesis may be reduce the error that may be occasion by a true hypothesis or right principle but not rightly understand there be nothing more familiar than this the instance of man contend for different opinion which they all derive from the infallible truth of the scripture be a undeniable proof of it all that call themselves christian allow the text that say -lrb- word in greek -rrb- to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty but yet how very erroneous will one of they practice be who understand nothing but the french take this rule with one translation to be repentez-vous repent or with the other fatiez penitence do penance 12 iii predominant passion probability which cross man 's appetite and prevail passion run the same fate let ever so much probability hang on one side of a covetous man 's reasoning and money on the other it be easy to foresee which will outweigh earthly mind like mud wall resist the strongest battery : and though perhaps sometimes the force of a clear argument may make some impression yet they nevertheless stand firm and keep out the enemy truth that would captivate or disturb they tell a man passionately in love that he be jilt bring a score of witness of the falsehood of he mistress it be ten to one but three kind word of hers shall invalidate all they testimony quod volumus facile credimus what suit we wish be forwardly believe be i suppose what every one have more than once experiment : and though man can not always openly gainsay or resist the force of manifest probability that make against they yet yield they not to the argument not but that it be the nature of the understanding constantly to close with the more probable side but yet a man have a power to suspend and restrain its inquiry and not permit a full and satisfactory examination as far as the matter in question be capable and will bear it to be make until that be do there will be always these two way leave of evade the most apparent probability : 13 two means of evade probability : 1 suppose fallacy latent in the word employ first that the argument be -lrb- as for the most part they be -rrb- bring in word there may be a fallacy latent in they : and the consequence be perhaps many in train they may be some of they incoherent there be very few discourse so short clear and consistent to which most man may not with satisfaction enough to themselves raise this doubt and from whose conviction they may not without reproach of disingenuity or unreasonableness set themselves free with the old reply non persuadebi etiamsus persuaseri though i can not answer i will not yield 14 suppose unknown argument for the contrary secondly manifest probability maybe evade and the assent withhold upon this suggestion that i know not yet all that may be say on the contrary side and therefore though i be beat it be not necessary i should yield not know what force there be in reserve behind this be a refuge against conviction so open and so wide that it be hard to determine when a man be quite out of the verge of it 15 what probability naturally determine the assent but yet there be some end of it and a man have carefully inquire into all the grounds of probability and unlikeliness do he utmost to inform himself in all particulars fairly and cast up the sum total on both side may in most case come to acknowledge upon the whole matter on which side the probability rest : wherein some proof in matter of reason be supposition upon universal experience be so cogent and clear and some testimony in matter of fact so universal that he can not refuse he assent so that i think we may conclude that in proposition where though the proof in view be of most moment yet there be sufficient grounds to suspect that there be either fallacy in word or certain proof as considerable to be produce on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent be often voluntary action but where the proof be such as make it highly probable and there be not sufficient ground to suspect that there be either fallacy of word -lrb- which sober and serious consideration may discover -rrb- nor equally valid proof yet undiscovered latent on the other side -lrb- which also the nature of the thing may in some case make plain to a considerate man -rrb- there i think a man who have weigh they can scarce refuse he assent to the side on which the greater probability appear whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letter should often fall into a method and order which should stamp on paper a coherent discourse or that a blind fortuitous concourse of atom not guide by a understanding agent should frequently constitute the body of any species of animal : in these and the like case i think nobody that consider they can be one jot at a stand which side to take nor at all waver in he assent lastly when there can be no supposition -lrb- the thing in its own nature indifferent and wholly depend upon the testimony of witness -rrb- that there be as fair testimony against as for the matter of fact attest which by inquiry be to be learn vg whether there be one thousand seven hundred year ago such a man at rome as julius caesar : in all such case i say i think it be not in any rational man 's power to refuse he assent but that it necessarily follow and close with such probability in other less clear case i think it be in man 's power to suspend he assent and perhaps content himself with the proof he have if they favor the opinion that suit with he inclination or interest and so stop from further search but that a man should afford he assent to that side on which the less probability appear to he seem to I utterly impracticable and as impossible as it be to believe the same thing probable and improbable at the same time 16 where it be in we power to suspend we judgment as knowledge be no more arbitrary than perception so i think assent be no more in we power than knowledge when the agreement of any two idea appear to we mind whether immediately or by the assistance of reason i can no more refuse to perceive no more avoid know it than i can avoid see those object which i turn my eye to and look on in daylight and what upon full examination i find the most probable i can not deny my assent to but though we can not hinder we knowledge where the agreement be once perceive nor we assent where the probability manifestly appear upon due consideration of all the measure of it : yet we can hinder both knowledge and assent by stop we inquiry and not employ we faculty in the search of any truth if it be not so ignorance error or infidelity could not in any case be a fault thus in some case we can prevent or suspend we assent : but can a man verse in modern or ancient history doubt whether there be such a place as rome or whether there be such a man as julius caesar indeed there be million of truth that a man be not or may not think himself concern to know as whether we king richard the third be crooked or no or whether roger bacon be a mathematician or a magician in these and such like case where the assent one way or other be of no importance to the interest of any one no action no concernment of he follow or depend thereon there it be not strange that the mind should give itself up to the common opinion or render itself to the first comer these and the like opinion be of so little weight and moment that like mote in the sun they tendency be very rarely take notice of they be there as it be by chance and the mind let they float at liberty but where the mind judge that the proposition have concernment in it : where the assent or not assent be think to draw consequence of moment after it and good and evil to depend on choose or refuse the right side and the mind set itself seriously to inquire and examine the probability : there i think it be not in we choice to take which side we please if manifest odds appear on either the greater probability i think in that case will determine the assent : and a man can no more avoid assent or take it to be true where he perceive the greater probability than he can avoid know it to be true where he perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two idea if this be so the foundation of error will lie in wrong measure of probability as the foundation of vice in wrong measure of good 17 iv authority the fourth and last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keep in ignorance or error more people than all the other together be that which i have mention in the foregoing chapter : i mean the give up we assent to the common receive opinion either of we friend or party neighborhood or country how many man have no other ground for they tenet than the suppose honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish man could not err or truth be to be establish by the vote of the multitude : yet this with most man serve the turn the tenet have have the attestation of reverend antiquity it come to I with the passport of former age and therefore i be secure in the reception i give it : other man have be and be of the same opinion -lrb- for that be all be say -rrb- and therefore it be reasonable for I to embrace it a man may more justifiably throw up cross and pile for he opinion than take they up by such measure all man be liable to error and most man be in many point by passion or interest under temptation to it if we could but see the secret motive that influence the man of name and learning in the world and the leader of party we should not always find that it be the embrace of truth for its own sake that make they espouse the doctrine they own and maintain this at least be certain there be not a opinion so absurd which a man may not receive upon this ground there be no error to be name which have not have its professor : and a man shall never want crooked path to walk in if he think that he be in the right way wherever he have the footstep of other to follow 18 not so many man in error as be commonly suppose but notwithstanding the great noise be make in the world about error and opinion i must do mankind that right as to say there be not so many man in error and wrong opinion as be commonly suppose not that i think they embrace the truth but indeed because concern those doctrine they keep such a stir about they have no thought no opinion at all for if any one should a little catechise the greatest part of the partizan of most of the sect in the world he would not find concern those matter they be so zealous for that they have any opinion of they own : much less would he have reason to think that they take they upon the examination of argument and appearance of probability they be resolve to stick to a party that education or interest have engage they in and there like the common soldier of a army show they courage and warmth as they leader direct without ever examine or so much as know the cause they contend for if a man 's life show that he have no serious regard for religion for what reason should we think that he beat he head about the opinion of he church and trouble himself to examine the grounds of this or that doctrine it be enough for he to obey he leader to have he hand and he tongue ready for the support of the common cause and thereby approve himself to those who can give he credit preferment or protection in that society thus man become professor of and combatant for those opinion they be never convince of nor proselyte to no nor ever have so much as float in they head : and though one can not say there be fewer improbable or erroneous opinion in the world than there be yet this be certain there be fewer that actually assent to they and mistake they for truth than be imagine chapter xxi of the division of the science 1 science may be divide into three sort all that can fall within the compass of human understanding be either first the nature of thing as they be in themselves they relation and they manner of operation : or secondly that which man himself ought to do as a rational and voluntary agent for the attainment of any end especially happiness : or thirdly the way and mean whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these be attain and communicate i think science may be divide properly into these three sort : -- 2 first physica first the knowledge of thing as they be in they own proper being then constitution property and operation whereby i mean not only matter and body but spirit also which have they proper nature constitution and operation as well as body this in a little more enlarged sense of the word i call -lrb- word in greek : physika -rrb- or natural philosophy the end of this be bare speculative truth : and whatsoever can afford the mind of man any such fall under this branch whether it be god himself angel spirit body or any of they affection as number and figure & c 3 secondly practica secondly -lrb- word in greek : praktika -rrb- the skill of right apply we own power and action for the attainment of thing good and useful the most considerable under this head be ethic which be the seek out those rule and measure of human action which lead to happiness and the means to practice they the end of this be not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth but right and a conduct suitable to it 4 thirdly -lrb- word in greek : semeiotika -rrb- thirdly the third branch may be call -lrb- word in greek : semeiotika -rrb- or the doctrine of sign the most usual whereof be word it be aptly enough term also -lrb- word in greek : logika -rrb- logic : the business whereof be to consider the nature of sign the mind make use of for the understanding of thing or convey its knowledge to other for since the thing the mind contemplate be none of they besides itself present to the understand it be necessary that something else as a sign or representation of the thing it consider should be present to it : and these be idea and because the scene of idea that make one man 's thought can not be lay open to the immediate view of another nor lay up anywhere but in the memory a no very sure repository : therefore to communicate we thought to one another as well as record they for we own use sign of we idea be also necessary : those which man have find most convenient and therefore generally make use of be articulate sound the consideration then of idea and word as the great instrument of knowledge make no despicable part of they contemplation who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it and perhaps if they be distinctly weigh and duly consider they would afford we another sort of logic and critic than what we have be hitherto acquaint with 5 this be the first and most general division of the object of we understanding this seem to I the first and most general as well as natural division of the object of we understanding for a man can employ he thought about nothing but either the contemplation of thing themselves for the discovery of truth or about the thing in he own power which be he own action for the attainment of he own end or the sign the mind make use of both in the one and the other and the right order of they for its clearer information all which three viz thing as they be in themselves knowable action as they depend on we in order to happiness and the right use of sign in order to knowledge be toto coelo different they seem to I to be the three great province of the intellectual world wholly separate and distinct one from another the end end of the
