a instant and with a wild whoop and shout he be scud across the green he curl fly in the wind and he little foot hardly seem to touch the ground there be none in the village so quick-footed as teddy and for daring feat and downright pluck he hold the foremost place perhaps this account for he popularity perhaps it be he marvellous aptitude for tell story many of they wild production from he fertile brain but certain it be that he be the pet and the darling of the village and none as yet have resist he sway over the green up a shady lane across two field and then breathless and panting teddy pause before a old-fashioned farmhouse he pass he hand lightly through he curl pull himself up with a jerk and then quietly and sedately open a latched door and enter the long low-roofed kitchen

honey in its comb a plate of fresh watercress and a currant loaf complete the simple fare preside at the tea-tray be a stern forbidding-looking woman of sixty or more opposite she be seat she son the

whilst tea be be take away by the woman he turn to he uncle who pull out a pipe from he pocket sit down by the open door to smoke ` uncle jake ' a grunt be the only response but that be sufficient the

appear quite a match for teddy who with he golden head well up look like a war-horse scent the battle-field it be thus they meet again both employ they Saturday afternoon in roam along the edge of a stream they have suddenly come face to face with one another ` you be to let I come over first ' she assert very emphatically ` because i be a girl ' -lrb- illustration : ` you be to let I come over

plea ` you be not a proper boy at all ' ` you be not a proper girl you be wear a boy 's hat and a boy 's jacket ' ` i be a sailor 's daughter and everybody can see i be you say you be a soldier 's son

sputter teddy now with rise wrath ` pooh i expect i could lick you i do not b ` lieve you have half as big a muscle as i have on my arm ' ' a girl have muscle it be just a bit of fat ' the tone of scorn proved too much for nancy 's self-control with a passionate exclamation she make a quick rush across the plank there be a struggle and the result be what might have be expect -- a great splash a scream from nancy and both little figure be immerse in the stream happily the water be not very deep and after a few minute ' scramble they be on dry ground considerably sober by they immersion teddy begin to laugh a little shamefacedly but nancy be very near tear ` i 'll tell my mother you nearly drown I dead ' ` if you be a sailor 's daughter you ought not to be afraid of the water sailor and fish be always in the sea ' ` they be never in it never ' ` well they be on it as close as they can be to it why you be nearly cry but you be only a girl and a sailor 's girl can not be very brave -- not like a soldier 's girl would be ' ` sailor be much braver than soldier ' say nancy quickly swallow down she tear ` and when they do fight they be in much more danger than the soldier father say how would soldier like the earth to swallow they up just when they have be fight hard and get the victory that be what the sea do to the poor sailor they ship begin to sink and they send up three cheer for queen and country and then stand on deck with fold arm and go down down down to the bottom of the sea and never make a cry ' nancy forget she wet clothes in she eloquence and teddy stare wonderingly at she ` well ' he say as if consider the matter ` they may be sometimes brave but they do not fight like the soldier and they have no banner and red coat and band and they do not know how to march a sailor walk anyhow i see one once and i think he be tipsy but he be not a sailor walk like a goose -- he waddle ' ` you be the horridest rudest boy i have ever see ' and with the utmost dignity nancy walk away teddy call after she ` you make a pretty good charge for a girl but you could not get past I ' and then with one of he loud whoop he race home and hardly draw a breath till he

you ' ` and you do too granny ' teddy 's laugh blue eye as he raise they to the grim face before he conquer as they generally do ` there go to you mother she be in the dairy i wash my hand of you ' but teddy creep up to he little room to change he wet clothes before he meet he mother and then be very silent about he adventure merely say by way of explanation that he have fall into the brook but at tea a short time after he suddenly say -- ` if you put a sailor and a soldier together which would you choose uncle jake ' ` eh my laddie well they be both good in they way i could not say i be sure ' ` mother would not you say the soldier be the bravest ' ` perhaps i might sonny but a sailor can be quite as brave ' teddy 's face fall ' i never think a sailor could fight at all ' he say in a disappointed tone ' i think they just take care of we ship and now and then fire a big gun off ' ` who be be bring up the sailor to you ' ask he grandmother ` that little girl i tell you of -- nancy she name be ' ` where have you see she ' ` down by the brook we fall into the water together because we both want to cross at once ' ` but my boy that be naughty for you not to give place to she ' and mr john speak reprovingly ' i know it be mother but i be not go to turn back that would be run away from the enemy you see we meet in the middle and she be not at all a nice girl and she be so proud and stick up about the sailor ' ` as proud as you be of the redcoat i guess ' old mr platt say ` do sailor and soldier like each other ' question teddy ignore the thrust ' i be sure i do not know ' he mother answer smile ' i have never see they together that i remember but i should think they do they both fight for they queen and country ' ` well i be a soldier 's son and i do not like a sailor 's

say he want one ' ` yes i do ' and teddy give a fervent nod as he speak ` and mother i believe most good people have enemy so it must be right to have one ' ` they never make one as you be try to do ' teddy look puzzle ` well ' he say presently ' i expect it be because she be a stranger she do not belong to we village i do not like stranger ' ` she be no more a stranger than you be when you first

shall i take you with I to see the little girl ' ` i have see she enough granny please i think i would rather not ' the subject be drop but teddy 's thought be busy he run down to the village green after tea and there meet one or two of he special chum to whom he confide the event of the afternoon they highly applaud the scene at the bridge but teddy shake he curly head a little doubtfully ` man ought always to give way to woman i have hear mother say but i could not turn back you see -- it would have disgrace my button ' ` tell you what ' cry harry brown commonly know as ` carrot ' from he fiery hair ` you could ' a do what the goat do in the primer at school -- you ought ter have lay flat down and let she walk across you ' ` she would have hurt dreadful ' teddy observe thoughtfully ` besides she be so proud i do not think i would have like to do that ' ` no ' put in sam water ` you do fine i say let 's come up to the turnpike and see if she be about there i 'll give she a word if she begin to sauce I ' teddy agree to this and the trio trot off along a flat dusty road teddy beguile the way by some of he wonderful story till they come in sight of the low thatched cottage cover with rose that guard the turnpike they soon see the young damsel for she be swing on the gate she dark hair fly in the wind and she eye and cheek bright with the exercise she look at the boy then laugh ` poor little button-boy ' she say ` you have to be take care of by two bigger one ' ` we have come to see you ' say sam valiantly ` because we be not go to stand any cheek from you so you have

girl ' say teddy ` you push they into the water ' ' i do not ' ' i tell mother about it she think you be a very rude boy not to wait till i cross over ' there be silence then carrot start forward ` look here you 'll have to learn you manners and we will not have a strange girl like you stick yourself up so we have come to tell you to look out for yourself if you do not stop it ' nancy laugh again and swing herself violently backwards and forwards ` yo ho my lad yo ho ' she sing ` i be on my ship and i do not care for boy a bit they be all as stupid as they can be yo ho we go yo ho lad

be up the rigging and a storm be begin hurray -- come on ' sam and carrot make a furious onslaught and the gate be roughly handle but the more it shake and swing the more derisive be nancy 's laughter as she clutch a firm hold with she small hand and sway to and fro call out excitedly ` furl the main-sail stand by lad -- steady -- starboard hard port you helm rock to leeward reef the top-sail breaker ahead yo ho ' teddy look on awed by these nautical term which seem to slip so easily from she lip to he they seem wonderfully clever but he be not one to stand aside long in a scene of excitement and with one of he wild war whoop he rush forward ` on boy charge hurrah ' the gate rock violently and nancy begin to feel she position be a perilous one all the little people be scream at the top of they voice when suddenly in the midst of the din appear old sol ` what now who be these try to break one of she majesty 's gate down be off you young ruffian teddy platt you be at the

pocket and my foot close together i will pretend i be go to be shoot by a file of soldier and then i really think that will help I not to fidget i promise you i 'll be good to-day ' and have receive this protestation from he mr john pass into church with a relieved mind teddy 's restless little body be a sore trial to any one who sit next he in church and many be the lecture that have be bestow on he by sunday-school teacher and pastor besides the gentle admonition of he mother as teddy quietly perch himself on the seat beside he mother he murmur to himself ` twenty soldier in front of I twenty rifle point -- i shall stand like a rock -- i 'll set my tooth and i sha not even blink my eye now i see the officer come -- he be go to say present i be not move a muscle five minute more they

eye fix steadily on he teddy could not remain unmoved beneath she gaze for long he little hand be work nervously in he coat pocket why do she stare at he so well he could stare back and then blue eye and brown confront each other for some moment with unblinking defiance in they gaze at last teddy 's patience give way and twist up he little feature into a most grotesque grimace he mount a hassock to give she the full benefit of it instantly out come a little red tongue at he and at this daring piece of audacity he gasp out loud ' i hate you ' then as all eye in the surround pew be turn upon he and he mother 's shocked gaze meet he teddy crimson to the root of he hair and take up a large prayer-book he use it as a shield from he small antagonist during the remainder of the service as the congregation be leave the church later on the rector make he way to young mr platt who be linger talk to a neighbor he be a grey-haired gentle-faced man with a slow dreamy manner in speak ` mr john what have happen to make you little boy so forget himself this morning ' ` indeed sir i can not say i really think he be go to be good to-day ' ' i think he have better come to tea with I this afternoon and we will have a little talk together ' teddy look up with awe in he blue eye he well know that this be the rector 's usual practice when any delinquent be bring before he notice but it have never yet fall to he lot to receive the invitation mr upton have he own way of do thing so people say and he have greater faith in reasoning with any culprit than scold they whether they be grow man or woman or child teddy 's restless way in church have be a trial to he for a long time and he feel that this morning 's action must receive a check ` thank you sir ' respond mr john ` he shall come to you after school be over this afternoon ' and teddy completely sober walk home beside he mother without utter a word at half-past four he stand on the rectory doorstep look into the cool broad hall in front of he which lead out of a glass door at the opposite end into a brilliant flower garden spotless white druggeting cover the floor and stair and everything indoors denote a careful housekeeper mr upton be a widower and be to a great extent rule by two or three old and faithful servant as the boy stand there the rector appear and lead he into he study ` we shall have half a hour

want you to read I a verse in the first epistle of st john and the third chapter it be the fifteenth verse can you find it ' ` yes sir ' and with a eager importance teddy turn over the leaf ` whosoever hateth he brother be a murderer ' he read solemnly ` that will do now think it over for five minute in silence and then tell I what you thought be about it ' the boy hang he head in shame he fold he arm and sit immovable till the five minute be over then he say timidly ' i would not hate a brother i would like to have one do you think it mean the same when it be a girl ' ` precisely the same -- a brother mean any person in the world man woman or child ' ` then i ought to be hang ' there be much self-pity in teddy 's tone mr upton do not smile he be gaze abstractedly out of the window and say slowly ` the root of murder be anger the same motive that prompt a passionate statement prompt a passionate and perhaps fatal blow ' there be silence then in a more cheerful tone the rector turn to the little culprit ` and now tell I the whole story and who it be that you speak to in church ' teddy be perfectly ready with he defense and he pour into he listener 's ear such a voluble story that the rector be quite bewilder when it come to a end ` it be father 's button i care about ' add the boy finger he beloved object proudly ` and she do not believe I a bit and she put out she tongue as long as ever she could ' ` tell I the story of the button i have hear but have forget the detail ' teddy 's eye sparkle and he little head be raise erect again slip off he chair he stand in front of the rector and tell the oft-repeated tale with dramatic force and effect mr upton listen with interest but before he could offer any comment on it tea be announce and take the child by the hand he march he into the dining-room hot tea-cake strawberry jam and plum cake keep we little friend fully occupy for some time he wonder if all the naughty boy interview by the rector have be treat to the same fare and he begin to think a invitation to Sunday tea at the rectory highly desirable ` and now ' say mr upton towards the end of the meal ' i want some more talk with you you father be a brave soldier he die in save the color you want to grow up like he do you not ' ` yes sir indeed i do ' ` there be a little verse in god 's word that describe we lord 's banner -- he color will you say it after I -- he banner over I be love ' teddy repeat the verse slowly and with interest ` it be a wonderful banner ' pursued mr upton thoughtfully ` the enemy confront with it on every side in the thick of the fight we can but hoist we color love god 's love to man when man be fight from he infancy against he maker what host would not march to meet the foe with such a banner dye red with the life-blood of they captain the son of god the savior of the world ' teddy draw a long breath and when the rector pause he cry enthusiastically ` please go on sir i like to hear it will god let I hold up the banner for he ' ` if you have enlist in he service be you one of he soldier ' ' i do not know ' ` god always want each of we to present ourselves to he if we want to enlist in he army have you do that there must come a time in we life when we yield ourselves wholly and unreservedly to the one who be we rightful owner why my boy do you believe that jesus die upon the cross to save you do he bear you sin for you there ' ` yes ' say teddy fix he blue eye earnestly on the rector ' i really believe he do for mother have often explain it to I ' ` then how dare you stand aloof from he army how be it that you have never enlist be you march along in the enemy 's rank ' teddy 's small hand be clench and he eye light up with a great resolve ` i 'll enlist at once sir i 'll be one of god 's soldier now ' ` how be you go to do it ' ' i do not know tell I please ' there be silence mr upton meet the child 's earnest upward gaze with awe as he realize how much hang on he word he have a firm belief in child be able to lead a consistent christian life he know the master would accept a child 's heart and guide and keep the frail and helpless step on the way heavenward and with a swift prayer for guidance he speak ` you must tell god about it yourself and do not be in a hurry kneel down quietly by yourself somewhere and first of all ask that the holy spirit may guide you that you sin may be blot out and you name write in the book of life for the sake of jesus who die for you then tell god you want he to enlist you and give yourself right up to he for now and for all eternity ' mr upton speak slowly and emphatically he know he often preach above the head of he little hearer and he strive to speak in simple language now teddy remain very silent then he say ` and if i enlist shall i have to be god 's soldier for ever and ever till i be a old man of a hundred with white hair and no tooth ' ` would you rather be one of the devil 's soldier ' ` no ' ` you be quite right to think it over i would rather you do not decide too hastily go home and think it out and come and tell I when you have decide ' the boy 's white brow be crumple with anxious crease ' i should like to be one of god 's soldier but who shall i have to fight any real enemy or only make believe ' ' i will tell you about you enemy after you have enlist i can show you one very real one that be you worst

keep in but have slip away the minute school be over and be soon dodge in and out of the thick overhang tree along the edge of he favorite stream he little foot speed swiftly along and as he run he talk in a whisper to himself which be he way when anything special be weigh on he mind ` i 'll go right into the wood and get under a thick tree i will not let a squirrel see I nor even a rabbit i must be quite quiet and it must be like church and i sha not come away till i have do it ' into the wood he go but he be hard to satisfy roaming here and there peep round corner and thrust he curly head in amongst the bush it be fully half a hour before he choose he spot it be a secluded little nook under a old oak-tree where the moss grow thick and green and bush of all sort and size form a natural bower round the gnarled trunk in front of this tree teddy stand and then half shyly half reverently he take off he cap and lay it on the ground look up through the veil of green leaf above he to the sunny blue sky beyond he stand with clasped hand and part lip for a moment or two in perfect silence the soft wind play gently with he curl and rustle amongst the leafy bough overhead and in the distance the bird ' sweet voice be the only sound that meet he ear as the boy 's eye come back to earth they seem to have reflect in they something of the bright sunshine above and then down on he knee he drop place he little clasped hand against the old trunk in front of he and bend he golden head till it rest likewise against the tree teddy pray aloud slowly and with frequent pause -- ' o god here i be have you be wait for I i have come to enlist and please i forget all mr upton tell I to say but will you forgive I my sin and write my name down in you book in heaven -- edward jame platt be

that god have accept he that scene in the wood when he dedicate himself to the service of the king of king would be stamp on he memory as long as he live and now that the deed be do a great load seem to be lift off he mind he come into the midst of the boy on the green a short time afterwards with a radiant face and take he share in field bowling and batting with such a vigor and will that he prove himself the hero of the hour later in the evening he wander into the dairy where he mother be busy and ask she if he could go and see the rector ` what for sonny ' ` he ask I to come be it too late do you think i should like to go to-night ' mr john look down upon the eager little face lift to hers ` run away then but do not stay long ' and so it be that for the second time that week teddy be a visitor at the rectory ` please sir i have do it ' he exclaim breathlessly as soon as he be usher into the presence of the rector ` eh what have you be do ' and mr upton rouse himself from a reverie into which he have fall as he sit at he study window and watch he favorite beehive then note the disappointed look on the child 's face and recognize who it be he add briskly ` ah it be teddy

self be not it ' ` quite right keep close to you captain we officer always lead and remember -- forward no quarter to the enemy ' then gaze abstractedly out into the garden mr upton add as if to himself ` but i see another law in my member war against the law of my mind and bring I into captivity to the law of sin which be in my member who shall deliver I from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ we lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin ' the next day when at dinner for it be generally at meal-times teddy choose to make he observation he look round the table appealingly -- ` what be the very ugliest name that could be give a boy ' ` sake alive ' ejaculate he grandmother ` and who may you be want to christen ' ` it be not for a baby a boy about as old as I what do you think 's a ugly name ' ' i do not think any name be very ugly ' he mother say ` if you like a person they name always seem to fit i know two

that would describe a very wicked person ' ' i hope you be not go to call any one by it ' observe he grandmother suspiciously teddy lift he blue eye up to she solemnly ' i expect i 'll find one for myself ' he say and nothing more could be get out of he after dinner a half-holiday have be give the school-children teddy steal out to the wood when out of sight he begin a brisk conversation with himself as be he wont and it may give we a insight into he busy brain if we listen ` blackey might do or goggles or grubby or nigger or toad i want to have some name else i sha not be able to talk to he so well i wish mother have help I it be very differcult i can not seem to think of a name quite ugly enough i expect p ` rap mr upton could tell I i 'll wait and ask he i hope i sha not have to wait long for i want it all settle so that i can begin to fight properly with he now i have get to find nancy mr upton say i be to be friend with she and i have get to hold up my banner of love over she i hope she 'll like it she be a horrid -- aha that be my enemy just go to speak a horrid girl you be go to say be you now you just get out nancy be a very nice girl -- at least she soon will be i 'll try and think she nice i will i have get to fight you enemy if you say such thing why i do ` clare there she be climb that tree ' teddy 's conversation come to a end and he stare with open mouth and eye at the nimble way nancy be climb up a old beech-tree he give a shrill whistle which make the little girl look round not a bit disconcerted be she ` aha it be the stupid little button-boy you can not catch I ' it be a challenge instantly teddy strip off he jacket and dart to the tree she have get a good start and even he catch he breath in wonder at she rapid ascent and the fearless way in which she seem to plant she small foot on the most fragile-looking branch up they go pant with the exercise but at length she could go no further and seat herself on a comfortable bough she look mischievously down at he ` you could not catch I you do not know how to climb my father teach I i can go up the rigging as far as any sailor boy and this be my ship but i 'll let you sit down by I if you behave yourself ' teddy swing himself across a bough opposite she and be silent for a moment each child be try to recover breath and teddy be consider how to make peace he do it in he own quaint fashion ' i think we be pretty close to heaven ' he remark presently lift he soft blue eye to the clear sky above ' i wonder if that be the reason bird in they nest agree the angel can not like to hear qualler so close to they ' ` i be not go to quarrel and you do not say that word right ' ` what word ' ` quarrer ' and nancy 's tone be emphatic though a doubt steal into she own mind as to whether she pronunciation be correct but teddy be too intent upon pull something out of he pocket to notice she correction he slowly unroll a large white pocket-handkerchief tie it carefully to a twig which he break off from a adjoining branch and then hold it up in front of she ' i do it myself this morning ' he say with pride ' i ask uncle jake for one of he best handkerchief he give it to I last night and i do it with a pen and ink before breakfast can you read it nancy look at the straggle uneven black letter that occupy the whole width across ` love ' she say curiously ` what do that mean ' ` it be my banner of love that i be go to carry for my captain it mean i have get to love even you ' nancy 's red lip pout ' i do not want you to love I ' she say ` i have get to do it ' ` how be you go to do it ' ` i be -- i be not quite sure i be never go to be angry with you and it be very hard -- ' here a deep-drawn sigh break from he ` it be _ very _ hard but i have get to tell you i be sorry i would not let you cross the bridge first and i be sorry i say i hate you in church ' nancy 's bright dark eye peer inquisitively into the dreamy blue one opposite she ` be you really sorry ' she say ' i think i be at least part of I be my enemy be not but i be ' this be beyond nancy 's comprehension ` and you 'll never get angry or set those horrid boy at I any more ' ` no i never will ' here a big rosy-cheeked apple be produce hastily out of the other pocket and present as a peace offer it be take in silence then as nancy 's white little tooth meet in it she say with one of she beam smile ` and have i get to love you ' ' i think you have better because it will make it easier ' ` well i will then if you 'll do one thing ' ` what be it ' ` give I that old button of yours ' teddy fairly gasp at this audacity ` give you father 's button ' he cry ` never never never i would rather be shoot dead or drownded dead or hung dead or chop into little tiny bit i 'll _ never _ give it up it be go to be on my coat and waistcoat till i be a hundred and then it will be bury in my grave with I suppose i lose my button do you know what i would do ' nancy gaze at the young orator with a little awe ` no ' she say ` what ' ' i would drop down and die my heart would burst and break and if i could not die very quick i would not eat or drink nothing but i would go sadly to my grave and lay my head down and the next morning you would find I stiff and cold with my glassy eye stare up at the sky like a old dog i read about ' teddy 's tone be so intensely tragic that nancy be silent at last she say ` i 'll never love you proper till you give it to I ' ` will you like I a little instead ' ' i might do that ' she reply reluctantly ` and you will not never say you do not believe father 's story ' ' i be not go to promise ' then as the very last bite be take of the apple she add ` i 'll hear some more of you story first i want to hear one now sally white tell I at school you know all about fairy ' teddy nod impressively then say slowly ' i make believe i do but i do not make believe father 's story ' ` tell I a story now ' teddy clasp he hand round a bough and with knit brow consider then he look up and the light sparkle in he eye ` shall i tell you about when i go into a oak-tree and find a little door lead down some step that take I to the goblin 's cave ' this sound enchanting and nancy eagerly prepared herself to listen such a story be then pour out that it hold she spell-bound goblin elf and fairy underground glory thrill adventure and escape be it any wonder that with such a gift for story-telling teddy be the king of the village it come to a end at last and nancy draw a long breath of relief and content when she hear the conclude sentence ` and i quickly open the little door and there i be outside the oak and safe in the wood again ' ` button-boy i do like you ' she assert with a quick little nod of she head ` will you tell I another story soon ' ` p ` rap i will ' say teddy feel a little elated that he be gain supremacy over she ` but i be go home now i only come out to have a think and to make friend with you ' ` what make you come and make it up ' the little maiden ask as after a scramble down they stand at the foot of the tree ` you say something about you captain who be he ' ` jesus christ ' teddy reply reverently ` and he banner be love so i have to love everybody whether i like they or not ' ` why ' ` because he want I to and i be one of he soldier now ' ` have jesus any sailor ' the question be put suddenly and the answer be give with a slight air of superiority ` no only soldier he have ' ` then i do not want to belong to he i believe he have sailor just as well as soldier only you be not tell true ' she tone be get wrathful but teddy shake he head solemnly ` i be sure there be nothing about jesus ' sailor in the bible but i 'll ask mother and then i 'll tell you i must go home now good-bye we be go to be friend ' ` yes we be go to be friend ' she repeat and then away they scamper in different direction nancy call out like a true little woman ` but i sha not really love you till you give I you button ' chapter v first victory ` please sir may i speak to you ' mr upton be come out of church after a choir practice when teddy accost he he smile when he see the boy ` you may walk home with I and speak to I as much as you like ' and so they saunter up the shady lane the old rector with he head bent and he hand cross behind he and the boy all eager excitement and motion with suppress importance in he tone ' i want you to give I a name for my enemy please sir ' mr upton look amuse ` have you have any battle with he yet ' ' i think i have one yesterday may i tell you granny be very angry with I because i have make uncle jake 's best handkerchief into a banner of love i do not really think it be naughty i write love in ink right across it and i take such pain for i want to show it to nancy and when i get home granny be so angry that she take I by the collar and she lock I into the back kitchen and mother be out and i cry i be so miserable granny say i would come to the workhouse she call I the wickedest mischievousest boy she have ever see and say she would like to give I a good whipping and at last i get tire of be miserable and i look about and i see the window be partly open so i climb up and then i think i would jump out and run away across the field till mother come home and i be very happy then and i jump right out and then i remembered but i do not want to go back again ' ` and then the fight begin ' suggest the rector as the boy pause teddy nod ' i ask god to drive my enemy away but i be a awful long time think it out be think fight ' ` very often it be ' ' i do fight hard then and i climb in again be that be a soldier ' ` yes my boy ' ` and granny let I out soon after and i kiss she and say i be sorry but i tell she how nearly i have run away and ask she to see that the window be lock next time so that i should not have to fight so hard ' ` you will have plenty of fight do not shirk the hottest part of the field that be not be brave ' ` will you give I a horrid ugly name please sir ' ' i think you enemy 's name be teddy ' ` no that be mine i must have a name for he -- a different one you know ' ` how do you like ego or ipse ' ` what funny name i think i like ipse best i 'll call he ipse shall i ' but mr upton 's thought be far away by this time and presently he say as if to himself ` the last enemy that shall be destroy be death nay in all these thing we be more than conqueror through he that love we it be a fight with certain victory ahead then why do we fail ' ` shall i fail ' question a soft voice by he side ` without I ye can do nothing that be we captain 's word : if you fight without he you be do for ' ' i think i shall sometimes let ipse have he way will that be desert to the enemy ' ` it will be sure and certain defeat ' ` but then of course my captain will not let I be beat if i stick close to he ' and so they talk a strange couple but the younger of they have a faith which the elder might envy and a grasp of the unseen that the ripest saint could not surpass not long after this teddy and he schoolfellow be have a delightful afternoon in the wood it be Saturday afternoon and they be play they favorite war game teddy of course be prime instigator of the whole affair a few of the more adventurous girl have join they nancy amongst they she respect for teddy be gradually increase though nothing seem to quench she self-assertion and independence of thought and action at length teddy announce he intention of go off on a expedition as a scout and on nancy 's insist that she should come too the two child start make they way out of the wood and down to the bank of the stream which soon join the river ` what have we to do ' ask nancy ` it be great fun you see every one we meet be a enemy and we have to get past they without they see we we must crawl through the long grass or we must climb a tree or get through the bush all kind of adventure we have ' ` and if we do not meet anybody ' ` that be why i come down this way : there be always a lot of people fishing in the river now look out do not you talk loud and step softly just think that the first person who see we will shoot we dead ' ` but they will not ' ` you must make believe they will ' teddy 's tone be stern and nancy be too occupy in hold she hat on she head as they creep through some low bush to advance any more sceptical opinion and then suddenly a short time after they come upon a fisherman it be only a burly farmer who be evidently make a day of it for he sit under the shade of a tree with the remnant of a substantial lunch around he he fishing-rod be in he hand but the line be out of the water and he with head throw back and mouth wide open be fast asleep ` hush ' say teddy in a excited whisper ` if he wake all be up with we now let 's get past he on tiptoe ' this be accomplish safely but have pass he teddy stand still and the spirit of mischief seize hold of he turn to nancy he say with sparkling eye ` what fun to take he prisoner and tie he up to the tree with he own fishing-line he be a enemy i really think it be we duty to do it you stay here and watch I ' deftly and quickly teddy set to work but when he have once pass the line round the farmer 's body and the tree he have no difficulty in finish the work he have begin dance like a elf with the line in he hand he spin round and round the tree till the line be wind round to its very last extremity and the farmer look like some big bluebottle fly entangled in the fine mesh of a spider 's web still he sleep on and with a delighted chuckle teddy speed back to he little companion she eye be dance with mirth and she clap she hand at the successful exploit ` he 'll wake up and will not be able to get away what fun how i should like to see he ' ` come on quick he be farmer green and he be a awful angry man he give sam such a thrashing for tie a old saucepan to one of he pig ' tail he will not know who have do it and i do tie the knot awful tight ' away they run but they have not proceed far before teddy come to a standstill and all the saucy sparkle die out of he eye ` what be the matter ' ask nancy ` have you get a pain ' ` i be afraid i be go to have a fight with ipse ' the word be utter almost in a whisper and nancy look on with wonder ` it be not right ' he say after a long pause ' i do want -- at least ipse want -- to leave he there awfully but mother would say it be very naughty and i think -- i think my captain do not like it i shall have to go back and undo he ' ` oh you must not ' cry nancy ` you 'll wake he up and then you 'll catch it let he undo himself ' teddy shake he head and then steal softly back to the tree nancy follow he at a respectful distance it seem a harder business to untie the knot than to tie they but at length it be do and the unwind process begin alas farmer green 's nap be over and with a hasty start he be rouse to the full use of he faculty when he discover he condition he swear a round oath and turn upon teddy in great wrath as he vainly try to extricate himself ` please sir ' say teddy nothing daunt ` if you keep still i shall undo you very soon and i will not break you line if i can help it ' ` you young scoundrel how dare you show you face after such a audacious piece of impudence you be the plague of the parish and a good thrashing be what you will get sure as my name 's jonathan green ' teddy 's face be hot and red and the spectacle of he try to unwind the line from the struggle and exasperated farmer be so irresistibly comic to nancy that she burst out laugh jonathan green be soon on he foot again and seize hold of teddy by the collar shake he like a terrier would shake a rat then without leave go of he he pull out a piece of cord from he coat pocket ` now i 'll teach you a lesson youngster that you will not forget it be lucky i have get this bit o ' rope ' and in another few minute he have bind the boy securely to the tree tie he hand together with he handkerchief then as nancy step forward indignant at this severe treatment he turn upon she ` there be two of you be there well you shall share the same fate till i think fit to release you i 'll teach you to stop play such impish trick on decent folk ' ` you be the wickedest man that be live i be sure ' cry nancy wrathfully ` why he be undoing you when you wake up which be very kind of he i wish he have leave you tie up i do ' but farmer green with a grim smile of satisfaction soon settle she in the same fashion as he have do the boy and then pick up he fishing-basket stride away call out ` ye 'll bide there my time ye young limb of mischief it be only serve like ye serve ' ` button-boy do he hurt you ' ask nancy anxiously for all this time teddy have not say a word he turn he head and look at she ' i feel shooken up dreadful he be so awful strong but i be not very hurt only i be sorry and i have be tell my captain about it and ask he to forgive I ' ` shall we stay here all the evening and all the night ' ` oh no he 'll come and let we go soon it be not fair on you for you do not do anything ' ' i laugh at he and i want you to leave he tie up but i do not care it do not hurt you have not tell I ever what i ask you about jesus ' sailor tell I now because i want to belong to you captain and i be not go to be a soldier ' ' i do ask mother and she say sailor be soldier they

try to scramble on board ship i sha not never change to soldier sailor be _ much _ nicer and if sailor fight i can be a sailor for jesus ' they conversation be interrupt by voice and step approach and in another moment two lady and a gentleman appear evidently go home after a fishing excursion the path lead past the tree and they stop in astonishment at the sight of the two child teddy be the first to speak he recognize the newcomer to be the squire colonel graham and he wife with a visitor stay with they ` please sir will you undo we ' he ask appealingly the colonel laugh heartily ` ah young fellow you be catch be you lady helen this be one of the young hopeful in we village i have be tell the ringleader in every bit of mischief set go you would not think it to look at he would you ' ` what a angel 's face ' say that lady admiringly ` and who be the little girl she look a regular little gipsy ' neither of the child appreciate these remark but the colonel good-naturedly put down he fishing-basket and cut the piece of rope that bind they ` now then youngster ' he say ` speak up and tell we who bind you in this fashion and what have you be do to merit such punishment ' have get he hand free teddy stand up bravely and tell the story briefly and clearly to the great amusement of he hearer ` and he would never have be catch if he have not go back to undo he ' put in nancy ` so he ought not to have be punish at all ' ` what make you go back my boy ' ask mrs graham gently the color rise in teddy 's cheek but he never hesitate to speak the truth ' i go back when i remember it be

and he lesson at school have never seem so irksome to he but they be over at last and he tear off in search of he new friend find he at length sit under a old yew-tree just outside the churchyard ` granny say will you come to tea with we ' he ask breathlessly as he come up to he the corporal look up he be a fine-looking young man with a frank bright face and he be read a well-worn bible which he put carefully in he pocket before he rise to he foot ` that be very kind of you granny ' he say ` and i 'll come with pleasure i be out of it at the hare and hound ' teddy 's quick eye have spy the bible ` do you like the bible ' he ask gravely ` it be my order book ' the corporal say with a smile ` and my best friend in the world ' ` what be a order book ' ` it give you you daily command -- just what you be to do and where you be to go my captain write my order down in he word for I ' ` he be my captain too ' say teddy with glisten eye ` you mean jesus do not you i have enlist in he army and i be one of he soldier ' ` shake hand little brother then we be comrade after all ' ` be all soldier in jesus christ 's army ' ask teddy as they walk away together the corporal shake he head sadly ` hardly any of they in my regiment ' he say ` we be nearly seven hundred strong and only six man besides myself as far as i can tell belong to the lord a year ago i be a awful blackguard myself : i drink dreadfully and could not give the drink up but that be all a thing of the past since i have belong to the lord he keep I from it and many other bad habit i 'll own i fairly dreaded come to this bit of duty the sight and smell of the beer be very strong to a man that have be such a slave to it and i must be quarter in public-house the whole way along ' ` you 'll have to fight like mr upton tell I to will not you ' say teddy ` but if we captain be with we mr upton say we sha not be beat ' ` no ' say the corporal a light come into he eye ` we shall be more than conqueror ' then after a pause he say ` it be very considerate of you granny to ask I to tea i be just wish that something could be do in this village for the man come after I like we have last year when we march through the country for the maneuver they give we a free tea at several of the place we go through and it keep so many from drink there be a man come along here who i be terrible anxious about he be be a awful drunkard and be quite a old soldier but last new year 's day he sign the pledge and he be keep it ever since : he be just on the point of be convert i hope we have yarn by the hour together but if he be billet in the hare and hound or any other public-house for that matter i do not know what he 'll do there be nothing for they when they come in tired but to sit in the bar or tap-room and drink they can not get away from it ' teddy 's brow be knit with deep thought ' i do not know soldier drink too much ' he say ' i think they never do anything wrong ' the corporal smile ` it be not many that be of you opinion ' he say ` most folk put we down as a bad lot ' that evening remain in he memory for long after : the sweet-scented garden and the long low kitchen with the happy family party gather round the table the clumsy effort of the reticent farmer to make he guest feel at home the short pithy remark make by mr platt and the gentle soft-voiced young mother with the golden-haired boy continually ask quaint question about a soldier 's life -- all this come back to he with a keen sense of pleasure in after year he be only a young fellow after all and be touch and gratify by the kindness show to he for it make he think of he own mother in she village home and when he take he leave he could hardly express he thanks teddy have be allow to sit up beyond he usual bedtime and as he put he little hand into the big brown one of the young soldier he say ` do you mind tell I you name corporal ' ` walter saxby ' be the ready response ` and what be the name of the poor old soldier who sign the pledge on new year 's day ' ` tim stoke he be call bouncer by most of we ' ' i shall remember ' say teddy then turn to he mother and grandmother after corporal saxby have disappear he say solemnly ' i may bring bouncer to tea may not i if i find he corporal tell I he have not properly enlist as jesus ' soldier but he want to do you think mr upton could get he to enlist while he be here or could you granny p ` rap he would do it for you ' ' i do not know what that boy will come to ' say mrs platt later on when teddy be safe in bed ` seem to I he have more the making of a minister in he than a soldier i do not hold with child be too religious it be force and unnatural ' ` he be not too good to live ' put in jake slowly ` no youngster can beat he in play ' ' i often wonder ' mr john say thoughtfully ` whether he will be a soldier after all he be almost too sensitive to lead the hard rough life so many do i doubt if he could stand it ' ` he be not want in pluck and manliness ' mr platt observe for she always have a good word to say for she little grandson when he be not present ' i find he this morning career round the field on that fresh young foal without any saddle or bridle i give he a sharp scolding for it be kick up its hind leg like mad but he only look up in my face and laugh it be my charger granny he say and he smell the battle-field that be why he be so excited i be sorry these soldier be go to fill the place he think and talk quite enough of they as it be we sha not have a moment 's peace now till they be go ' teddy be up very early the next morning to see he friend go off he have another long conversation with he before wish he good-bye and then with thoughtful face he go to school revolve many plan in he active little brain and make innumerable mistake in he lesson in consequence at twelve o'clock when free at last he make he way to the rectory and ask for mr upton who greet he very kindly ` any more trouble to tell I ' ` no sir but i want to tell you about the soldier who be come ' ' i have hear about they it will be a grand time for you will not it ' ` please sir could you have a tea-party for they ' mr upton push up he glass and look very bewildered ' a tea-party do you say ' ` yes the corporal say a clergyman give one hundred tea in a schoolroom last year and speak to they after the corporal say it would keep they from drinking in the public-house he come to tea with we last night but granny will not have a lot of they so i tell he i would tell you about it ' ` it be rather a undertaking ' say mr upton musingly ` but we might do something for they when be they to be here ' ` in two or three day the corporal say ' ' i think i might manage it i will go and see colonel graham and find out if he will help ' ' i know you would be able to do it ' say teddy beam all over ` and p ` rap sir you could tell some of they how to enlist like you do I the corporal say i ought to try to be a recruiting sergeant for my captain but they would not listen to I i be sure i be go to try to enlist nancy i have not try half hard enough but she say she 'll only be a sailor for jesus not a soldier can she be that sir ' mr upton smile ` yes i think she can sailor have to keep watch and learn they drill and take order and fight under they captain just like soldier ' and then teddy go home and electrify he mother by tell she with a air of great importance ` mr upton and i be go to give the soldier a tea-party when they come ' the day pass mr upton be as good as he word a large tea be provide in the village schoolroom colonel and mr graham take a hearty interest in it and when the soldier come in one hot dusty afternoon everything be ready for they teddy and other of the village child crowd round the hare and hound when they arrive and nancy be foremost of the crowd ' i do not think much of soldier ' she say she nose tilted up in disdain ` they be very dirty man and cover with dust and they have no band nor flag fly nor nothing ' if teddy be disappoint in the look of he hero he do not say so but sam remark ' i expect they have leave the band and the flag in the town these be only the lot that they can not put up there ' later in the afternoon teddy make he way to the old elm outside the hare and hound where several of the man be rest on the wooden bench some with pot of beer and round whom some of the admire villager have make a little circle he push he way in with he accustomed fearlessness ` please be mr tim stoke here ' the soldier laugh and bandy a few joke on the comrade allude to ` what do you want with he youngster ' ' i want to speak to he ' ' i guess you 'll find he under one of the table in the tap-room old bouncer be pretty dry after a march like we have have to-day ' there be a roar of laughter at this but teddy do not understand the joke ' i must not go inside the hare and hound ' he say ' i promise mother i never would will you fetch he out for I ' and turn to a good-natured-looking young fellow teddy put he hand coaxingly on he arm the soldier look into the boy 's fair face with a laugh and then a sigh and rise to he foot say ` all right little chap i 'll fetch he out to you ' he be go some time and teddy improve he opportunity by make friend with those around he it be not long before he have acquaint they with the fact of he be a soldier 's son and from that he drift into tell the story of ` father 's button ' there be vociferous applause when he have finish ` here youngster ' say one of the older man hold out he pewter pot to he ` take a drink like a man you deserve it ' ` no thank you ' the boy say ' i never drink beer ' then as a oldish-looking soldier with a heavy moustache already tinge with gray come up to he teddy turn to he in delight -lrb- illustration : ` be you bouncer ' -rrb- ` be you bouncer ' ` that be what i be call ' the man 's face be a unhappy one and he seem to be the butt of he comrade for they pour forth such a volley of good-natured ridicule on he appearance that teddy look from one to the other in complete mystification ` will you come and see my home ' the child ask softly ` corporal saxby tell I he think you would like to come ' the man 's face lighten ` ay that i will if it be not fur off my leg be that stiff and sore i do not want much walking ' ` it be not very far ' then as they move off together teddy slip he little hand confidingly into the big one near he and continue ` do you know there be go to be a splendid tea for you all in we schoolroom to-night -- have you hear ' ` ay the parson be round a hour ago give out ticket there be little to be do in a place like this and we be too tired to tramp into the town so i expect there 'll be a tidy few ' ` the corporal come to tea at we house the other night he be a friend of yours be not he ' ` the best friend i have get ' be the hearty answer ` ay lad there be few of he sort in the army for one that try to help we on a bit there be ten that try to drag we down ' ' i suppose ' say teddy dreamily ` that after all the queen 's army be not so nice to be in as the army i belong to do you captain help you when you be in trouble ' ` he help we to pack-drill or c b or cell ' reply tim stoke with grim humor this need to be explain to teddy who go on after it be make clear to he : ` ah my captain always help I mr upton say when i do wicked thing and get beat by the enemy i must call out to my captain and he will come at once and help I ' ' i reckon i have hear tell of you captain then for that fellow saxby be always din it into I but i can not come to religion nohow -- i can not make head or tail of it i tell you youngster i have be have a awful time lately and i can not keep to it i be certain sure the drink will do for I again i can not keep away from it much longer and this march 'll see the end of my teetotal way i be think ' ` and will not my captain help you ' ` i be not a hand at prayer and psalm-singing ' ' i wish you would talk to mr upton he make I enlist a short time ago and i have be ever so much happier since i do it ' they be walk across the field lead to the farm and as they come to the stile the soldier lean heavily on it turn he face full on the child he say determinedly ` i be not a-goin ' to talk to any mr upton or no one about it i would as lief hear you as a parson you mind I of a little brother of mine that die ten year ago tim he say just afore he go tim will you meet I in heaven he be the only one i ever love and i have live a dog 's life since ' he eye be moist with feeling and for a minute teddy look at he silently in pity wonder then he say ` look here bouncer this be what mr upton say to I he tell I jesus have die for I and how dare i keep from be he soldier when he love I so you know that do not you ' ` ay so saxby tell I but it do not make no difference ' ` no more it do not to I ' continue the boy eagerly ` until i go to god and enlist i do it quite by myself in the wood you do it too bouncer -- you give yourself to god as he soldier and he 'll take you and keep you ' ` i have be too bad it keep I wakeful at night the very thinkin ' of it ' ` but will not god forgive you if you ask he to ' ` saxby say so but i do not know the fact be a soldier can not be a christian in the army ' ' i do not believe you want to be one of god 's soldier ' say teddy in a disappointed tone ` you keep make ` scus ' there be silence then tim stoke heave a heavy sigh ' i will not come no further youngster i be not in a mind to-day to see company but i 'll be at the tea to-night ' ` oh bouncer do come ' and teddy 's eye fill with tear ` you promise you would i do want you to see mother and granny ' but tim wheel round and stride off with something like a sob in he throat teddy have little idea of the mighty conflict in he breast the child 's word have awaken many memory and tim be at that stage now when the power of good and of evil be contend for he soul ` he do not believe i want it for i keep make excuse ' mutter the poor man ` ay i do but i have not get over the longing to be different i would cut off my right hand i do believe if i could be as saxby be i can not bring myself up to the point that be it ' meanwhile poor little teddy creep indoors with a sad face to announce to he mother the failure of he mission ` he be nearly here mother -- just the other side of the hedge outside -- and yet he turn back ' chapter vii uplift and cast down it be a bright cheery gathering a few hour later mr upton have throw he whole heart into the scheme and have be round with he ticket to a few outlying inn where more of the man be billet so that there be altogether over forty redcoat assemble mr john and two other neighbor be in charge of the tea and coffee and teddy and nancy with one or two other child as a special favor be allow to help to wait on the guest the table be decorate with flower meat-pie cold beef and ham sandwich disappear in a marvellous manner and the cake and bread-and-butter with watercress be equally appreciate towards the end of the meal several lady come forward and sing and one or two part-song be also give by some of the guest stay at the hall ` now ' say colonel graham in he brisk hearty tone ` before we have a few word from mr upton i should like to tell you how glad i be to see the redcoat about I once more i know you

mr upton for he untiring zeal and energy in make arrangement we must thank the lady for try to make the evening pleasant by they song but we must thank a little man here i be give to understand for the proposal in the first instance ' and to teddy 's intense surprise the colonel swing he up on the impromptu platform to receive a deafening round of applause he make a pretty picture as the light fall on he golden curl and sparkling blue eye he cheek be flush with excitement but he bear himself bravely and he hold he head erect as he face the crowded room ` he will speak to you better than i can ' the colonel add with a smile ` for i be a poor speaker myself i be the old soldier here to-night and my fighting day be past he be all in the future and he look forward to wear the red coat with

equal to the occasion finger he button he begin in he usual impetuous fashion the very eagerness for he father 's deed to be honor prevent he from any feeling of self-consciousness and he carry he audience by storm the lady be delighted and touch by it and mr john quietly wipe some tear from she eye and then mr upton get up he dreamy manner in speaking be absent now and he speak straightly and forcibly to those in the queen 's service of the battle to be wage with sin touch on they special difficulty and temptation he tell they how absolutely impossible it be for they to be in they own strength a match for the devil with all the power of evil at he back and how the same savior who die for they would keep they and lead they on to certain victory if they would but enlist in he service nothing could exceed the attention with which he be listen to and the evening end by they rise to they foot and singing ` god save the queen ' then a sergeant rise to propose a vote of thanks cheer be give and all depart greatly please with they evening teddy slip up to tim stoke on go out ` shall i see you again ' he ask ' i shall be busy to-morrow we march out at eight in the morning ' ` oh i shall come and see you off ' tim linger then lay he hand heavily on the boy 's fair curl he say ` god bless you little chap i have do it ' teddy 's eye light up at once ` have you -- really and truly ' he nod ` my heart 's full and i can not speak of it but i be away near the wood there by myself before the tea and it be all right with I i only wonder i do not do it before i would not yield that be the fact do not forget to pray for I youngster ' and he dash out after he comrade as if ashamed to show he emotion teddy call he mother to he when in bed that night ` mother i will be a soldier i be certain sure i will but i be very glad i can be one of god 's soldier without wait to grow up and i think i shall be a recruiting sergeant for god now i be sure he want lot more soldier do not he ' ` indeed he do my boy now go to sleep you have have a very exciting day ' ` but the best of all be ' say teddy sleepily ` that bouncer have enlist ' there be quite a crowd of villager and child the next morning round the hare and hound the soldier be draw up outside wait for the approach of they regiment from the town to fall in and march on with they teddy and nancy be of course there the little girl in spite of she alleged disdain of soldier be delighted to be in they vicinity teddy could not get near he friend bouncer but he receive a friendly nod from he in the distance and as for bouncer 's face it be like sunshine itself a marked contrast to the day before as the band be hear approach cheer be give to the man now leave and a tall corporal who have much enjoy he tea the night before stoop to ask of nancy who be stand close to he ` what be the name of that curly-headed youngster who get we the tea ' nancy look up at he mischievously : ` the button-boy that be what i call he and i sha not never call he anything else ' then the corporal 's voice ring out clear and loud -- ` three cheer for the little button-boy ' which be take up enthusiastically by the soldier and teddy hardly know whether he be on he head or heel from excitement and delight but he have to pay a penalty for he prominent position from that day the title of the ` button-boy ' stick to he and it become he nickname in the village by all who know he on come the regiment with the color fly and the band playing in the most orthodox style and teddy be bitterly disappoint when the warning bell of school prevent he from march along the road with they the schoolmaster be very lenient with the boy that morning or else they would have be in dire disgrace for lesson be imperfectly learn and say and never have he find it so difficult to keep they attention but if teddy be inattentive and careless at school he be doubly troublesome at home and for the next few day he mother 's fear be realize the excitement of all that have take place seem to have quite turn he head for the time he jump on kate brown 's back -- the hire girl -- when she be carry two pail of milk to the dairy and the contents of both pail be spill and waste he shut up a fight bantam cock and the stable cat into a barn and leave they fight furiously he lock one of the farm-labourer in a hayloft and pull away the ladder so that he be not release for hour and he prove such a imp of mischief in the house that even he mother meditate hand he over to he uncle to be whip at last it come to a climax in school he bring a lot of young frog in a handkerchief put some of they in the master 's desk and amuse himself at interval by slip the other down the back of the boy seat in front of he he corner be the most unruly one in the room and whilst wait for another class to come down he begin one of he story in a whisper to a most interested audience ' i go to see a goblin once that i hear of he live in a tub on the seashore and he live by gobble up schoolmaster and governess he use to cut they hair off scrape they well like a horse-radish and then begin at they toe and gobble they up till he get to they head -- they head he boil in a saucepan for soup the boy and girl use to bring they master when they do not -- ' ` edward platt ' never have the master 's voice sound so stern the frog be discover -- and he wrath be not appease by see the cluster of head round teddy and catch a few word of the delicious story go on teddy start to he foot ` who put these frog here ' ' i do sir ' the answer be boldly give ` come here ' and amidst the sudden hush that fall on all the boy teddy walk up to the master 's desk with hot cheek and bent head ` edward platt for the last three day you have be incorrigible i have keep you in and give you extra task but neither have have any effect now i shall have to do what i have never yet do to you hold out you hand ' teddy 's head be raise instantly and hold himself erect he bear unflinchingly the three or four sharp stroke with the cane that the master think fit to give he ` now ' say the master ` you can go home i will dispense with you attendance for the rest of this morning ' teddy walk out without a word : he feel the disgrace keenly but it be the means of bring he to himself and rush away to a secluded corner in a field he fling himself down on the ground and sob as if he heart would break half a hour after he uncle happen to pass through that field come across he ` why ted what be the matter ' he inquire as he lift he to he foot teddy 's tear-stained face and quiver lip touch he so that he sit down on a log of wood near and draw he between he knee ` be you feel bad -- be you hurt ' be the next question and then teddy look up and in a solemn voice ask ` what do the queen do when she soldier be beat instead of get a victory ' ` i -- i be sure i doa not know i can not remember the time when we be beat i reckon she be sorry for they ' ` do not she turn they out of she army ' ` why noa ' ` what do god do when he soldier leave off fight and knock under to they enemy ' ' i reckon he be sorry too ' dimly jake platt begin to see the drift of the child 's question teddy shake he curly head mournfully ` i be sure he 'll have to turn soldier out of he army if they give up fight and let the banner drag in the dust and just let the enemy do what they like with they why i have do worse than that ' -- here he clench he little fist and raise he voice excitedly -- ` i have go with the enemy i have join ipse and that be be a deserter and now i sha not never never be able to get back again ' he uncle look sorely puzzle ` why be not you at school what have you be a ` doin '' teddy tell he all in a despairing tone add -- ' i can not meet mother -- i have be cane and -- and i have disgrace my button ' here he tear burst out afresh ` look here ' say he uncle slowly ' i will not say but what you have be a bad boy -- you mother herself have be in sore trouble about you this last day or two but if we get a fall in the mud it be not much good stop there the only thing be to pick ourselves up agen get ourselves clean and then start agen and walk more carefully can not you do that ' ` i be a deserter ' sob the boy ` my captain will not have I back i have disgrace he i have disgrace my banner i have disgrace my button ' ` you captain will pick you up i be thinkin ' if you ask he he 'll clean you up fust-rate and set you on you leg agen ' ` will he ' and hope once more begin to dawn in the dim blue eye ` of course he will i be not good at verse and such like but i do remember this one -- though you sin be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow will not that one fit you ' teddy do not answer he stand look up wistfully into the blue sky as if unconscious of he uncle 's presence and then he sigh ' i think i would rather be alone uncle jake ' jake leave he without a word and go home to prepare mr john for what have happen ' she be much distressed but like a sensible woman take the right view of the case ` he want to be pull up sharp my poor boy be he much hurt ' the caning be such a minor point of teddy 's grief that jake confess to know nothing about it mr platt be incline to be indignant with the schoolmaster ` such a tiny little chap as he be so full of feeling and nerve -- he have not ought to have do it ' yet only that morning she herself have almost give he a sound whipping for one of he mad prank shortly after teddy creep in and shut the door behind he put he back against it ` mother granny ' he say ` i have be a awful boy at school this morning and i be in disgrace i have be cane ' he tone be tragic then he add slowly ` but i be very sorry and i be sorry i have be so naughty at home and i be go to start again because my captain have forgive I ' and then mr john do the wisest thing she could do she ask no question but get some warm water and take he off to wash he face and hand she see the red mark across the little hand but refrain from make much of it and then after put he curly head in order she draw it to she shoulder and put she arm round he she say -- ` my sonny mother be so glad she little son feel he naughtiness she have be pray much for he to-day and now tell I all about it ' chapter viii in the clover field ` please mr platt can i see teddy ' ' i think he be out in the clover field do

look away to the purple hill in the distance and beyond and above they to the soft evening sky with its delicate fleecy cloud flit by and take every imaginable form and shape as they do so the dreamy far-away look come into he eye as he say slowly -- ` it be a Sunday make-believe quite one to myself and i have never tell it to any one i can only tell it to myself out of door when it be still and quiet and then i feel sometimes it be quite real ' ` do tell I ' plead nancy coaxingly ` well it be get to heaven -- after i be get there you know ' nancy 's eye grow big with awe ` shall i tell you

with solemn eye ' i will not promise but i 'll think about belong to the captain i should like to go to heaven ' it be one day soon after this that teddy be stray over the field in he happy careless fashion fond as he be of game with the village boy often there be time when he like he own society best and he wander on talk to himself and gather grass and wild-flower as he go he quick eye soon note some sheep make they way through a gap in the hedge and from thence they be go through a open gate into the high road ` those be farmer green 's sheep ' quoth he to himself ` i be glad of it -- horrid old man he be no ipse be quiet that be not the way to think of he i 'll go and drive they back again ' and he trot off with this intention but it be much more difficult to get sheep into they rightful place than out of it and this teddy find to he cost he face be hot and red he voice hoarse with shout and then to he consternation farmer green appear on the scene ` you young vagabond ' he shout spring towards he a thick stick in hand ` leave my sheep alone how dare you come on my premise you be always after some fresh trick or other ' teddy stand still till he come up to he then look up frankly at he ` indeed sir i be try to drive they back through they hole again look that be where they break through ' ' a likely story much more probable you make the hole yourself ' teddy 's blood rush into he face ' i never tell a lie ' he cry ` and you be a -- ' he stop and hang he head in shame at the word that almost slip from he jonathan green look curiously at he ` now may i ask what the end of that speech be go to be ' he say grimly teddy look up ` ipse be go to say you be a liar yourself but i just stop he in time ' ' i shall believe you have a bee in you bonnet as some folk say ' say the farmer ` pray if the sheep come out of they proper field what business be that of yours ' ' i want to be good to you i be sorry i tie you up that day dreadful sorry and i have get to love you so i think it would be a good plan to send you sheep back again ' ` you have get to love I ' repeat the farmer open he eye in mock surprise ` and when do i ask for any of you love young fellow ' ' i do not suppose you want I to ' observe teddy cheerfully as he see that the stick instead of be brandish over he head be now safely rest on the ground ` but i have get to do it you see because my banner i be hold for my captain be love and i must love everybody ' the farmer do not answer teddy continue earnestly -- ` do you think you could manage to forgive I and let we shake hand it would make it easier for I to love you if you could ' there be such honesty of purpose in the blue eye raise to he such wistful curve to the sensitive little lip that jonathan green for the first time feel the thrall of the child 's power ` come into the house with I ' he say ` and i 'll see what the missus have to say to you ' teddy follow he without the slightest misgiving and he be lead into the farmhouse kitchen where mr green sit knit over the fire and one of she daughter be lay the cloth for tea ` mary ann here be the scamp of the village come to see you keep he here till i come back i be after some stray sheep ' and shut the door with a bang the farmer disappear teddy shake hand with the old lady and the young one and then seat himself in the big chair opposite mr green ` what have you be do ' the latter inquire ` how be it you mother can not keep you out of mischief ' ' i have not be in mischief really i have not ' and poor teddy feel the truth of the say ` give a dog a bad name and hang he ' he try to tell he story and then when that do not seem to be understand he deftly change the subject ` what do farmer green like best in the world ' he ask this astonishing question strike mr green dumb but she daughter natty laugh ` gooseberry pudding ' she say ` now then what be the next question but teddy be silent and not another word do he say till the farmer come in again ` this youngster be on the tack of reform himself mary ann ' say jonathan sit down in the chair that teddy immediately vacate upon he entrance ` do you believe it ' ' i have no faith in boy ' say mr green with a shake of she head ` they be all alike and be always take you unaware ' ` you hear what the missus say you will not get no help from that quarter but i 'll give you a chance would you like to stop to tea with we ' teddy smile ` thank you sir but mother will expect I home to tea may i go now and do you forgive I for what i do the other day ' farmer green stretch out a hard horny hand and take the boy 's small one ` here 's my hand o not ' he say with he grim smile ' i may be a fool for believe you but if you be sorry for the past i will not be the one to rake it up ' teddy 's upward look be so full of innocence that he receive a clap on the shoulder ` run along you have make you peace with I ' and speed away teddy whisper to himself -- ' i shall ask mother to make it and i shall pick the gooseberry myself and then he 'll know i love he ' farmer green be much bewilder a few day after at receive a parcel which be leave at he house by some boy on they way back from school he be still more puzzle when upon open it it prove to be a gooseberry pudding in a basin with a piece of paper attach to it and these word in very shaky write ' i send you my love -- teddy ' but he daughter be able to enlighten he and they have a hearty laugh over teddy 's mode of confirm the treaty of friendship chapter ix lose we little soldier have he up and downs but on the whole he be make steady progress and he mother be thankful to see he increase thoughtfulness and gentleness he be not less merry and joyous he be still the leader of the village sport but he be learn how to control he mischievous propensity and to restrain he hasty word and action nancy be a great trial to he sometimes and yet though the two be ceaselessly involve in argument and difference they could not keep apart for long nancy 's father arrive and teddy have the privilege of be invite to tea and of hear the most wonderful yarn from the big brown-bearded man who though outwardly rough in voice and manner have a very soft corner in he heart for he little daughter teddy listen and admire and satisfied nancy by he evident appreciation of the sea story but when he reach home and be ask about he visit he say emphatically -- ` nancy 's father be very nice but he be nothing like the picture i have get of father with he red coat and sash and sword and he voice be so gruff and hoarse and he shout so loud and i shall never never think sailor be better than soldier ' it be after nancy 's father have leave she and when the bright summer day be begin to close that one afternoon teddy and nancy be fishing together at least that be they intention but any one see they sit on the low stone bridge over the river with they line dangle carelessly in the water and they merry laughter and voice ring out continually would not be surprise if they fishing do not meet with success at last they clamber down and wander along the tow-path and then suddenly nancy draw teddy 's attention to he button ` why it be nearly come off you 'll lose it ' she cry ' i tell mother it be get loose yesterday she say she be always sew it on i think i 'll take it right off and put it in my pocket whatever should i do if i be to lose it ' he be jerk at it as he speak and it slip from he grasp and roll away on the path it be too great a temptation for nancy like lightning she be after it and a moment after stand upright and exultant with the button clench tightly in she little hand ` give it to I at once ' demand teddy quiver all over with excitement nancy 's brown eye sparkle with mischief ` aha little button-boy i have get it at last and i shall take it home and have it sew on _ my _ jacket ' ' i shall fight you ' cry teddy ` if you do not give it up at once it be not yours you would be a thief if you keep it give it to I this minute ' ` shall i throw it into the river ' question the saucy little maiden teddy dart forward and then begin a tussle he try to wrench she hand apart and she exert all she strength to keep they close suddenly with a triumphant cry from teddy as nancy 's finger be begin to yield the button be liberate with such force that it fly violently out and splash into the river it go nancy give a cry but without a word or sound teddy plunge in head foremost after it it be do without a thought he be a good swimmer and for a minute nancy watch he in breathless silence but when he little head rise out of the water he seem half stupefied and cry out in a weak voice ` help i be drown ' then sink again nancy set up a shout then of frantic agony and a carter come over the bridge fortunately hear she and come to the rescue not a moment too soon he throw off he coat and heavy boot and plunge in just as teddy 's curly head rise for the third and last time it do not take long to bring he to shore but he lay in the carter 's arm limp and lifeless and nancy burst into a agony of tear ` he be dead he be dead and i have kill he ' she cry the carter waste no time in try to restore animation to the little frame but all he effort be unavailing and at last he say ` i 'll put he in my cart and drive as fast as i can to the doctor 's it be not more than a mile off if so be that he be at home you go home and fetch he mother as fast as you can ' nancy race off sob as she go and she be in such a state of excitement that when at length she burst open the farmhouse door she seem to have lose she speech mr john see she face and start forwards ` it be teddy ' she cry ` what have happen ' ` he be at -- he be go to the doctor 's dead ' she gasp then fall breathless to the floor without a word mr john snatch up a shawl and with white set face and lip move in agonised prayer she fly along the road to the doctor 's she be show into the room where the doctor be hard at work but teddy lay like a waxen image with the sweetest smile on he lip he fair curl clustering round he brow and only a ugly bump amongst the curl tell the reason of he sink under the water again so suddenly in breathless silence the mother stand and watch ` do not give he up doctor ' she cry as at last the doctor straighten himself and pause look at the mother sorrowfully he shake he head but set to work again try artificial respiration and leave no effort untried to bring back the life that have apparently depart and then there come the moment when he effort meet with success for place he hand against the little heart he feel a feeble throb he redouble he effort the breath begin to appear a faint color tinge the blue lip and at last the heavy eyelid raise and a faint voice say ` mother ' mr john sink on she knee ` thank god ' be all she say and then she faint much later in the evening teddy be place in he own little bed at home but though alive he condition be most critical and he lay in a heavy stupor from which it seem impossible to rouse he the doctor say he must have strike he head against a stone when first he dive into the river and this have produce concussion of the brain nancy have be take home before he come but the news be bring to she that he be still alive though in great danger and that be a great comfort to she poor little sorrowful soul for many day he lay between life and death the inquiry after he from every one of he schoolfellow the hall and the different farm and place round tell he mother how much she little son have be beloved and when on the follow Sunday mr upton give out in a falter voice ` the prayer of this congregation be desire for edward platt who be very dangerously ill ' there be not a dry eye in the church and one or two audible sob come from the boy ' seat in the gallery mr john never leave she boy 's bedside -- night and day she be by he and many wonder at she calm peacefulness after the first great shock she have be able to hand over she child into she father 's loving hand and rest content with the result and so she be able in perhaps the most anxious time of she life to look up and say ` father not my will but thine be do ' the day slowly pass and still no change for the better the doctor come and go with he grave impenetrable face and teddy be still unconscious then doubt begin to rise in he mother 's heart as to whether he reason would ever come back and she stop the doctor as he be leave one morning to ask he the question -- ` if he live doctor will he be a idiot -- my brave bonny boy oh i would rather have death for he than that ' and the doctor could only give she the meager consolation ` he may recover yet i have see worse case than this pull through and be as bright as ever they be ' and then one afternoon when the setting sun be flood the room with a golden glory the little head turn on the pillow ` mother ' the sound of that word not utter since she have see he in the doctor 's house that first terrible day be like the sweetest music in she ear stoop over he she meet the clear conscious gaze of the blue eye ` so tired mother put you hand under my cheek good-night ' the eyelid close and the limb relax in healthy sleep the mother sit down and though she arm become stiff and weary not a muscle of it move the doctor come in just before he wake ` he have speak he know I ' she say and the doctor nod and smile and then a minute after the boy raise he head ` where be i mother ' he ask feebly ` in bed darling you have be ill ' ` where 's my button ' ` he 'll do ' say the doctor contentedly ` keep he quiet and feed he up ' and the glad news go round the village that teddy be get better it be a bright day for the farm when teddy be bring down in a blanket and put in the big easy-chair by the fire he little face and hand look very fragile with the blue vein stand out clearly under the transparent white skin but he large eye shine with light and gladness he mother make he comfortable then leave he in he grandmother 's charge for a short time old mr platt have have she share of suffer during those sad day she heart be wrap up in the boy and perhaps the greatest trial of all be to stand aloof and perform she daily work downstairs whilst she daughter-in-law have the sole charge of he she come across to the chair now and kneel down in front of it say with tear in she eye as she take he two little hand into hers ` granny have sadly miss she pickle all this while ' and then teddy put he little arm round she neck and hug she close crush she cap in the most reckless fashion as he do so ` i be get better every day granny and i love you ever so ' when mr platt release herself he go on more soberly ' i feel very tipsy on my leg i ask mother to let I walk just now but i could not manage very well i do not think i shall be able to run fast for a year shall i ' ` oh we 'll see you about long before that please god ' ` and granny you know about my sorrow ' the blue eye look wistful at the thought ` yes laddie but do not think of that now ' ' i tell mother i do not want ever to get well when i first talk about it i feel i could not live without my button but she tell I that be wrong she say it be not be a good soldier to wish to die directly trouble come and that if i bear my sorrow well god would be please do you think i be bear it well granny ' ` yes yes ' mr platt say soothingly ` look at those lovely flower and grape that mr graham send to you this morning be not that kind of she ' ' i do not never forget it ' pursued teddy refuse to have the subject changed ` but i think this morning that god could give it to I again and so i be go to ask he every day till it come and do you know granny i think he 'll give it to I only mother say i must be patient ' presently he ask ` could i see nancy one day soon ' ` she come on she way to school every day to ask how you be poor little maid she be take on dreadful about you illness and would not eat she food when you be so ill she mother get quite anxious about she we 'll send for she in a day or two if you keep well ' and two day after nancy appear she come up to the big chair very shyly and look with awe upon teddy 's white waste face then she cry impulsively -- ` oh button-boy will you ever ever forgive I if you have die i should have kill you ' ` no you would not ' say teddy put up he face and kiss she ' i be just as naughty i should not have try to fight with you ' ' i go to the river every day ' nancy go on sorrowfully ` and farmer green bring a big net one day and drag up a lot of stone and old tin pan but the button be not there i hope it will be wash ashore one day and so i look along the bank but i have not see a sign of it yet ' ` i be ask god to give it back to I every day ' say teddy with a little decide nod ` and i think he 'll do it you ask he too nancy and perhaps he 'll do it quicker ' ` i have ask god every day to make you better and i promise he if he would do it i would be the captain 's soldier yes i do and i say i would give up be a sailor and be just a soldier like you be ' nancy make this statement with great solemnity and teddy beam with delight ` and be you really enlist ' ' i do not quite know but i be try to be good and i ask jesus to help I every day ' then there be silence nancy sit down on the rug and take the large tabby cat on she lap ` do you think you be go to die ' she ask presently ' i do not think nothing at all till i wake up and see mother cry over I and then i feel dreadful tired and ill i ask she one day where she would bury I for i be sure i be much too ill to get better and she -- well she smile and say god be make I stronger every day i do not feel i be better a bit ' ` would you like to have die and go to heaven ' ` yes ' teddy answer promptly ` of course i should would not you ' nancy shake she head ' i might if i be quite sure the angel would carry I safely all the way without drop I or leave I in the cloud before we get there but i think i like to live here best besides i do not think i be good enough to go to heaven yet ' ' i do not think it be be good get we to heaven jesus die to let we you know like the hymn say -- jesus love I he who die heaven 's gate to open wide he will wash away my sin let he little child come in have you ask he to forgive you nancy ' nancy nod ` yes when you be so ill i feel i have be so wicked that god be punish I ' here revert to more earthly topic nancy hold up the cat array in she sailor hat and jacket ` look this be jack tar do not she make a jolly sailor ' a gleeful hearty peal of laughter come from teddy and be hear in the adjoining room by he grandmother with comfort she call mr john ` hear that now why he be get quite himself again it do he good to have a child to talk to she must come again ' and this nancy do and the rose begin to come back to teddy 's cheek and then other of he playfellow be allow to come and see he certainly no little invalid could have receive greater attention than he do during that time of convalescence every day small offering be present at the door by the village child and very diverse be the gift sometimes a bunch of wild-flowers sometimes bird ' egg marble box of chalk a packet of toffee or barley-sugar a currant bun a tin trumpet a whistle a jam tart a penny pistol and so on till he mother declare she would have to stop take they in as they be get such a accumulation of they ` and how be my little fellow-soldier ' ask mr upton as he come in one day for he first visit to the little invalid after be downstairs ` he 'll soon be out of hospital ' respond teddy brightly ` and be he still fight for he captain ' ' i think sir ipse have be very good while i have be ill ' ` he have be lie low have he if i mistake not you will have a brush with he yet before long so be on the look-out ' and teddy find the good rector 's word come true day come when he try he mother 's patience much by he fractiousness and restlessness and he be more often the vanquish than the conqueror even nancy one day remonstrate with he ` you be nasty and cross to-day no one please you ' ' i want to get out i be tired of this old kitchen ' ` if you can not get out you can not be cross will not take you out ' this logic convinced but do not comfort ' i expect you captain will not come near you when you be cross ' and then teddy burst out cry -- ` i be not a soldier at all i do not know how to stand fire and it be all ipse and i be too tired to fight he ' poor little soldier one above take note of the physical weakness and weariness and in he tenderness pity and forgive chapter x find it be winter time and teddy be back at school full of health and spirit yet through all he boyish mirth the loss of he button be never forget daily he pray for it to be find and he hope and faith in god never fail he ` perhaps god will send it to I for a christmas surprise perhaps i shall find it in my stock on christmas morning ' he use to say to he mother and she tell he to pray on he have come in from school one cold day in the beginning of December and be watch with keen interest the roasting of a apple suspend from a string in front of the fire when there be a sharp knock at the door and the footman from the hall appear ` the master want you to let the youngster come up with I now and speak to he ' ` what about ' question mr john rather alarm at this summons and wonder if teddy have be up to mischief ` he will not keep he long ' then as excited teddy begin pull on he great-coat he whisper something into he mother 's ear which have the effect of completely reassure she and bring a pleased smile about she lip teddy be delighted to go up to the hall and he trot along by the side of the tall young footman keep up a brisk conversation as he go ' i shall never be a footman ' he be assert ' i could not keep my leg so stiff you be always like the soldier when they stand at attention do not you never kick you leg out in the kitchen or have you get stiff knee ' ' i can kick out as much as i like ' respond the young man in rather a offended tone ` do not you think it be nicer to be a soldier would not you like to be one ' ` no they grub be something shocking and they live like cattle ' teddy would not allow this and the discussion begin to get somewhat heat when they arrival at the house put a end to it ' i say just tell I be the colonel angry ' ask teddy as look into the large brightly light hall he suddenly feel he diminutive size ` not he wipe you foot and take you cap off ' teddy step in upon the soft rug almost on tiptoe and the colonel himself come out into the hall to meet he ` come in my little man and do not be frighten ' teddy hold he head erect as he follow the colonel into a bright cheery room where a group of lady and gentleman be round the fire enjoy they cup of five o'clock tea mrs graham come forward and give he a kindly greet ` this be we would-be soldier ' say colonel graham -- ` the button-boy as i hear he be call some of you remember he story tell in we schoolroom to the regiment pass through in the summer and we be not surprise to hear of he narrow escape from death from try to regain he button but perhaps you have forget all about it youngster a button be not worth much sorrow after the first pang of its loss be over ' teddy 's face be a picture : the blood rush up to he forehead he eye flash and with clenched hand he say boldly ` do you think i could ever forget my father 's button sir i would rather have it back than anything else in the world and i be go to get it back too ' ` but it be at the bottom of the river be not it ' ' i do not know where it be but god do and i ask he every day to send it back to I i be quite sure he will and i think it will be this christmas ' the lady exchange glance ` fact be stranger than fiction certainly ' say the colonel ` now my boy come here ' he be stand on the hearthrug with he back to the fire and put he hand into he pocket he draw out a small box and place it in the child 's hand ` open it and tell I if you recognize the contents ' teddy lift the lid and then a gasp and a cry of ecstasy break from he ` oh my button my own button oh sir ' and here the tear well up in the blue eye and utterly regardless of the place he be in he fling himself down on the hearthrug and bury he head face foremost in he arm he lay there so still for a moment that mr graham bent forward to touch he fear that the excitement might be too much for he but he be only try to hide he emotion from those look on in another minute he rise to he foot and with a face perfectly radiant he turn to the colonel ` it be lovely sir it be lovely ' the colonel have have it set in a little gold framework with blue ribbon attach make it look as much like a medal as possible and mr graham now come forward and pin it to he coat ` now my boy i do not think you will ever guess how it come into we possession the other day i bring home a few fish and in prepare one of these for table we cook discover you button inside it -- i wonder the fish have not come to a untimely end before from such a indigestible meal she tell we of it not recognize what a valuable treasure she have bring to light and directly we see it we know it be the redoubtable button that have be the means of cause such interest in we neighborhood ' teddy listen eagerly ` no wonder no one could not find it ' he say finger he adornment proudly ` it be like the fish that bring peter some money once ' then the colonel turn to one of he friend ` now major what do you think of this youngster would you like to take he as a drummer boy into you regiment ' the major scan the boy from head to foot then answer emphatically ' i would not take a boy with a face like that for a good deal ' ` why not ' ask mrs graham ` because it be the ruination of they i shall never forget a pretty boy we have once he be call the cherub and have be a chorister -- sing divinely he be only four year in the regiment and he case be bring to I before he be discharge he come to we a angel and depart a finish young blackguard he drink steal and lie to any extent and be as well verse in vicious sin as any old toper in the regiment when i see a fresh drummer bring in i wonder how long he will keep he innocence and sometimes wish he friend could see the life he be subject to i give they a month generally and then away fly they bloom and all they home training ' ` but major tracy you be give we a shocking idea of the moral in the service ' say one lady he shrug he shoulder ' i grant you on the whole they be better than they be but the service be no place for highly strung boy like this one the rougher harder nature get on best when they get older and have sense and strength enough to stick to they principle then let they enlist ' ` but i have always hear ' say mrs graham ` that the drummer boy be well look after now they have a room to themselves and the chaplain have class for they ' ` that may be i would only ask you to watch a boy as i have from the start and see what kind of a man he grow into after have spend most of he early youth in the service there be exception i know but precious few as far as my experience go ' teddy do not understand this conversation but he gather from the major 's tone that he do not approve of he ` do you think i be too small to be a soldier ' he ask the major laugh ` do not bother you head about you size ' he say ` you 'll grow and there be plenty of time before you ' ' i do not want to be a drummer ' say teddy earnestly ` i would rather wait and be a proper soldier -- a soldier that fight ' ' a capital decision -- stick to it little chap and you have my hearty approval ' ` you have you father 's blood in you vein ' say the colonel laugh ` meanwhile i suppose you try you hand on the village boy to content you fighting propensity ' ` no ' say teddy a grave look come into he sunny blue eye ' i do not fight with anybody but ipse now he keep I always busy ' ` who be ipse ' ask mrs graham ` he be my own enemy mr upton tell I about he you see i belong to god 's army he take very little soldier i have be enlist for month and month and ipse be just another part of I -- the bad part ' there be silence on the little company for a minute then major tracy say with a laugh ` what a original little oddity it be -- quite a character ' and then teddy be dismiss he fly down the avenue home as fast as he could go snow be fall but he heed it not and burst into the kitchen a little later in a breathless state of excitement he mother know already so be prepare for he news but she be not prepare for the handsome adornment now on she boy 's coat and he grandmother and uncle be equally pleased and gratified at the colonel 's kindness teddy 's prayer of thanksgive that night touch he mother greatly ' o god i do thank you i know you would answer I for you know how dreadful it be to live without my button and you know how unhappy my heart be about it though i try to be brave and not talk about it please do help I to take great care of it and never let I lose it again ' the next morning before breakfast teddy run off to tell nancy and to show she the long-lost treasure she be quite as delighted as he be but say a few minute after ` button-boy do you remember tell I you could not live without your-button you say you would pine away and die ' ` yes i think i should but as soon as i begin to pray about it i know it be come back and so i get better ' ` well ' say nancy with a sigh ' i will not ever try to get you button again but if you be to die before I i wonder if you would let I have it then i would take great care of it ' ' i mean it to be bury with I ' say teddy consider ` but i do not mind alter my mind about it and if you promise not to give it to any one else i will let you have it ' ' i promise truly ' vow nancy ` and i tell you i would not love you till you give it to I but i will now because i be try to be good ' ` and we 'll always remember that soldier and sailor be just as good as each other -- they be quite even ' ` yes ' nod nancy ` sailor and soldier be quite even and my father be just as good as you father be ' teddy look a little bit doubtful at this but wisely refrain from make any objection to the assertion and then they part nancy call out after he -- ` and when you die and i get the button i shall wear it as a brooch ' ` mother ' say teddy a few day after this as she be pay he she usual ` good-night ' visit ` it be a very funny thing but do you know i use to wish for a enemy so much to fight and carry on with and now i have get one and have ipse to fight with i be get rather tire of he be that wicked i ask mr upton to-day if i could not ever get rid of ipse -- i mean when i be grow up but he say i never should altogether but that i could keep he well under so that he would not trouble I so he do trouble I a lot now ' ` soldier must never get tire of fight sonny and you have you captain to help you ' ` yes and i suppose when i get bigger and stronger it will be much easier will not it
