unseen the little pilgrim whose story have be tell in another place and who have arrive but lately on the other side among those who know trouble and sorrow no more be one whose heart be always full of pity for the suffering and after the first rapture of she arrival and of the bless work which have be give to she to do and all the wonderful thing she have learn of the new life there return to she in the midst of she happiness so many question and longing thought that they be touch by they who have the care of the younger brethren the simple one of heaven these question do not disturb she peace or joy for she know that which be so often veil on earth -- that all be accomplish by the will of the father and that nothing can happen but accord to he appointment and under he care and she be also aware that the end be as the begin to he who know all and that nothing be lose that be in he hand but though she would herself have willingly bear the suffering of earth ten time over for the sake of all that be now hers yet it pierce she soul to think of those who be struggle in darkness and whose heart be stifle within they by all the bitterness of the mortal life sometimes she would be ready to cry out with wonder that the lord do not hasten he step and go down again upon the earth to make all plain or how the father himself could restrain he power and do not send down ten legion of angel to make all that be wrong right and turn all that be mournful into joy ` it be but for a little time ' say she companion ` when we have reach this place we remember no more the anguish ' ` but to they in they trouble it do not seem a little time ' the pilgrim say and in she heart there rise a great longing oh that he would send I that i might tell my brethren -- not like the poor man in the land of darkness of the gloom and misery of that distant place but a happier message of the light and brightness of this and how soon all pain would be over she would not put this into a prayer for she know that to refuse a prayer be pain to the father if in he great glory any pain can be and then she reason with herself and say ` what can i tell they except that all will soon be well and this they know for we lord have say it but i be like they and i do not understand ' one fair morning while she turn over these thought in she mind there suddenly come towards she one whom she know as a sage of the number of those who know many mystery and search into the deep thing of the father for a moment she wonder if perhaps he come to reprove she for too many questioning and rise up and advance a little towards he with fold hand and a thankful heart to receive the reproof if it should be so -- for whether it be praise or whether it be blame it be from the father and a great honor and happiness to receive but as he come towards she he smile and bid she not to fear ' i be come ' he say ` to tell you some thing you long to know and to show you some thing that be hide to most little sister you be not to be charge with any mission -- ' ` oh no ' she say ` oh no i be not so presuming -- ' ` it be not presume to wish to carry comfort to any soul but it be permit to I to open up to you so far as i may some of the secret the secret of the father be all beautiful but there be sorrow in they as well as joy and pain you know be one of the great angel at the door ' ` be he name pain and i take he for consolation ' the little pilgrim say ` he be not consolation he be the schoolmaster whose face be often stern but i do not come to tell you of he whom you know i be go to take you -- back ' the wise man say ` back ' she know what this mean and a great pleasure yet mingle with fear come into she mind she hesitate and look at he and do not know how to accept though she long to do so for at the same time she be afraid he smile when he see the alarm in she face ` do you think ' he say ` that you be to go this journey on you own charge have you insist as some do to go at all hazard you might indeed have fear and even now i can not promise that you will not feel the thorn of the earth as you pass but you will be care for so that no harm can come ' ` ah ' she say wistfully ` it be not for harm -- ' and could say nothing more he lay he hand upon she arm and he say ` do not fear though they see you not it be yet sweet for a moment to be there and as you pass it bring thought of you to they mind ' for these two understand each other and know that to see and yet not be see be only a pleasure for those who be most like the father and can love without thought of love in return when he touch she it seem to the little pilgrim suddenly that everything change round she and that she be no longer in she own place but walk along a weary length of road it be narrow and rough and the sky be dim and as she go on by the side of she guide she see house and garden which be to she like the house that child build and the little garden in which they sow seed and plant flower and take they up again to see if they be grow she turn to the sage say ` what be -- ' and then stop and gaze again and burst out into something that be between laughing and tear ` for it be home ' she cry ` and i do not know it dear home ' she heart be remorseful as if she have wound the little diminished place ` this be what happen with those who have be live in the king 's palace ' he say with a smile ` but i love it dearly i love it dearly ' the little pilgrim say stretch out she hand as if for pardon he smile at she console she and then he face change and grow very grave ` little sister ' he say ` you have come not to see happiness but pain we want no explanation of the joy for that flow freely from the heart of the father and all be clear between we and he but that which you desire to know be why trouble should be therefore you must think of he and be strong for here be what will rend you heart ' the little pilgrim be seize once more with mortal fear ' o friend ' she cry ' i have do with pain must i go and see other suffer and do nothing for they ' ` if anything come into you heart to do or say it will be well for they ' the sage reply : and he take she by the hand and lead she into a house she know she begin to know they all now as she vision become accustomed to the atmosphere of the earth she perceive that the sun be shine though it have appear so dim and that it be a clear summer morning very early with still the color of the dawn in the east when she go indoors at first she see nothing for the room be darken the window all close and a miserable watch-light only burn in the bed there lay a child whom she know she know they all -- the mother at the bedside the father near the door even the nurse who be flit about disturb the silence she heart give a great throb when she recognize they all and though she have be glad for the first moment to think that she have come just in time to give welcome to a little brother step out of earth into the better country a shadow of trouble and pain envelop she when she see the other and remembered and know for he be they beloved child on all the earth there be nothing they hold so dear they would have give up they home and all they possess and become poor and homeless and wanderer with joy if god as they say would have but spare they child she see into they heart and read all this there and know they she know it without even that insight everything they would have give up and rejoice if but they might have keep he and there he lay and be about to die the little pilgrim forget all but the pity of it and they heart that be break and the vacant place that be soon to be she cry out aloud upon the father with a great cry she forget that it be a grief to he in he great glory to refuse there come no reply but the room grow light as with a reflection out of heaven and the child in the bed who have be move restlessly in the weariness of end life turn he head towards she and he eye open wide and he see she where she stand he cry out ` look mother mother ' the mother who be on she knee by the bedside lift she head and cry ` what be it what be it o my darling ' and the father who have turn away he face not to see the child die come nearer to the bed hope they know not what they face be paler than the face of the die upon which there be light but no light come to they out of the hidden heaven ` look she have come for I ' he say but he voice be so weak they could not hear he nor take any comfort at this the little pilgrim put out she arm to he forget in she joy the poor people who be mourning and cry out ` oh but i must go with he i must take he home ' for this be she own work and she think of she wondering and she question no more some one touch she on the shoulder and she look round and behind she be a great company of the dear child from the better country whom the father have send and not she -- lest he should grieve for those he have leave behind -- to come for the child and show he the way she pause for a moment scarcely willing to give he up but then she companion touch she and point to the other side ah that be different the mother lay by the side of the bed she face turn only to the little white body which she child have drop from he as he come out of he sickness -- she eye wild with misery without tear she feverish mouth open but no cry in it the sword of the angel have go through and through she she do not even writhe upon it but lay motionless cut down dumb with anguish the father have turn round again and lean he head upon the wall all be over -- all over the love and the hope of a dozen lovely year the little sweet companion the daily joy the future trust -- all -- over -- as if a child have never be bear then there rise in the stillness a great and exceed bitter cry ` god ' that be all peal up to heaven to the father whom they could not see in they anguish accuse he reproach he who have do it be he they enemy that he have do it no man be ever so wicked ever so cruel but he would have spare they they boy -- take everything and spare they they boy but god god the little pilgrim stand by and weep she could do nothing but weep weep she heart ache with the pity and the anguish how be they to be tell that it be not god but the father that god be only he common name he name in law and that he be the father this be all she could think of she have not a word to say and the boy have shake he little bright soul out of the sickness and the weakness with such a look of delight he know in a moment but they -- oh when when would they know presently she sit outside in the soft breathing air and little morning breeze and dry she ache eye and the sage who be she companion soothe she with kind word ' i say you would feel the thorn as you pass ' he say ` we can not be free of they we who be of mankind ' ` but oh ' she cry amid she tear ` why -- why the air of the earth be in my eye i can not see oh what pain it be what misery be it because they love he too much and that he draw they heart away ' the sage only shake he head at she smile ` can one love too much ' he say ' o brother it be very hard to live and to see another -- i be confuse in my mind ' say the little pilgrim put she hand to she eye ` the tear of those that weep have get into my soul to live and see another die -- that be what i be say but the child live like you and I tell I for i be confuse in my mind ' ` listen ' say the sage and when she listen she hear the sound of the child go back with a great murmur and ringing of pleasant voice like silver bell in the air and among they the voice of the child ask a thousand question call they by they name the two pilgrim listen and laugh to each other for love at the sound of the child ` be it for the little brother that you be trouble ' the sage say in she ear then she be ashamed and turn from the joyful sound that be ascend ever higher and higher to the little house that stand below with all its window close upon the light it be wrap in darkness though the sun be shine the window close as if they never would open more and the people within turn they face to the wall cover they eye that they might not see the light of day ' o miserable day ' they be say ' o dark hour o life that will never smile again ' she sit between earth and heaven she eye smile but she mouth begin to quiver once more ` be it to raise they thought and they heart ' she say ` little sister ' say he ` when the father speak to you it be not for I nor for another that he speak and what he say to you be -- ' ` ah ' say the little pilgrim with joy ` it be for myself myself alone as if i be a great angel as if i be a saint it drop into my heart like the dew it be what i need not for you though i love you but for I only it be my secret between I and he ' she companion bow he head ` it be so and thus have he speak to the little child but what he say or why he say it be not for you or I to know it be he secret it be between the little one and he father who can interfere between these two many and many be there bear on earth whose work and whose life be ordain elsewhere -- for there be no way of entrance into the race of man which be the nature of the lord but by the gate of birth and the work which the father have to do be so great and manifold that there be multitude who do but pass through those gate to ascend to they work elsewhere but the father alone know whom he have choose it be between the child and he it be they secret it be as you have say ' the little pilgrim be silent for a moment but then turn she head from the bright shine of the sky and the voice of the child which float farther and farther off and look at the house in which there be sorrow and despair she point towards it and look at he who be she instructor and have come to show she how these thing be ` they be to blame ' he say ` but none will blame they the little life be hard the father though he be very near seem far off and sometimes even he word be as a dream it be to they as if they have lose they child can you not remember -- that be what we say we have lose -- ' then the little pilgrim muse begin to smile but weep again as she think of the father and the mother ` if we be to go ' she say ` hand in hand you and i and tell they that the father have need of he that it be not for the little life but for the great and beautiful world above that the child be bear and that he have get great promotion and be go with the prince and the angel accord as be ordain and why should they mourn let we go and tell they -- ' he shake he head ` they could not see we they would not know we we should be to they as dream if they do not take comfort from we lord how could they take comfort from you and I we could not bring they back they child they want they child not only to know that all be well with he -- for they know that all be well with he -- but what they want be they child they be to blame but who shall blame they not any one that be bear of woman how can we tell they what be the father 's secret and the child 's ' ` and yet we could tell they why it must be so ' say the little pilgrim ` for they pray and beseech the lord o brother i have no understanding for the lord say ask and it shall be give you and they ask yet they be refuse ' ` little sister the father must judge between he child and he must first be hear who be most concern while they be pray the father and the child talk together and say what we know not but this we know that he heart be satisfy with that which be say to he must not the father do what be best for the child he love whatever the other child may say nay do not we own father do this on earth and we submit to they how much more he who see all ' the little pilgrim steal softly from he side when he have do speaking and go back into the darkened house and see the mother where she sit weep and refuse to be comfort in she sorrow perceive not heaven nor any consolation nor understanding that she child have go joyfully to he father and she father as he soul have require and as the lord have will yet though she have not joy but only anguish in she faith and though she eye be darken that she could not see yet the woman cease not to call upon god god and to hold by he who have smite she and the father of the child have go into he chamber and shut the door and sit dumb opening not he mouth think upon he delightsome boy and how they have walk together and talk together and should do so again nevermore and in they heart they reproach they god the giver of all and accuse the lord to he face as if he have deceive they yet cling to he still weep and upbraid and would not let he go the little pilgrim weep too and say many thing to they which they could not hear but when she see that though they be in darkness and misery god be in all they thought she bethink herself suddenly of what the poet have say in the celestial city and of the song he sing which be a wonder to the angel and power of the little life and the sorrowful earth where man endure all thing yet overcome by the name of the lord when this come into she mind she rise up again softly with a sacred awe and weep not but do they reverence for without any light or guidance in they anguish they yet waver not die not but endure and in the end would overcome it seem to she that she see the great beautiful angel look on the great soul that be call to love and to serve but not to suffer like the little brethren of the earth and that among the prince of heaven there be reverence and awe and even envy of those who thus have they garment bath in blood and suffer loss and pain and misery yet never abandon they life and the work that have be give they to do as she come forth again comfort she find the sage standing with he face lift to heaven smile still at the sound though faint and distant of the child all call to each other and shout together as they reach the gate ` oh hush ' she say ` let not the mother hear they for it will make she heart more bitter to think she can never hear again she child 's voice ' ` but it be she child 's voice ' he say then very gently ` they be to blame but no one will be find to blame they either in earth or heaven ' the earth pilgrim go far after this yet more softly than when they first leave they beautiful country -- for then the little pilgrim have be glad believe that as all have be make clear to she in she own life so that all that concern the life of man should be make clear but this be more hard and encompass with pain and darkness as that which be in the do be always more hard to understand than that which be accomplish and she learn now what she have not understand though she companion warn she how sharp be those thorn of earth that pierce the wayfarer 's foot and that those who come back can not help but suffer because of love and fellow-feeling and she learn that though she could smile and give thanks to the father in the recollection of she own grief that be past yet those that be present be too poignant and to look upon other in they hour of darkness make he way more hard to comprehend than even when the sorrow be you own while she muse thus there be suddenly reveal to she another sight they have go far before they come to this new scene night have creep over the sky all gray and dark and the sea come in with a whisper which sound to some like the hush of peace and to some like the voice of sorrow and moaning and to some be but the monotony of endless recurrence in which be no soul the sky be dark overhead but open with a clear shine of light which have no color towards the west -- for the sun have long go down and it be night the two traveller perceive a woman who come out of a house all light with lamp and firelight and take the lonely path towards the sea and the little pilgrim know she as she have know the father and mother in the darkened house and would have join she with a cry of pleasure but she remember that the friend could not see she or hear she be wrap still in the mortal body and in a close envelop mantle of thought and care the sage make she a sign to follow and these two tender companion accompany she who see they not walk darkling by the silent way the heart of the woman be heavy in she breast it be so sore by reason of trouble and for all the bitter wound of the past and all the fear that beset she life to come that she walk not weep because of be beyond tear but as it be bleed she thought be in she little way like those of he upon whose brow there once stand drop as it be of blood and out of she heart there come a moan which be without word if word have be possible they would have be as he also who say ` father forgive they for they know not what they do ' for those who have wound she be those whom in all the world she love most dear and the quiver of anguish be in she as she walk seek the darkness and the silence and to hide herself if that might be from she own thought she go along the lonely path with the stinging of she wound so keen and sharp that all she body and soul be as one pain greater grief have no man than this to be slay and tortured by those whom he love when she soul could speak this be what it say ` father forgive they father save they ' she have no strength for more this the heavenly pilgrim see -- for they stand by she as in they own country where every thought be clear and see she heart but as they follow she and look into she soul -- with they heart which be human too wring at the sight of hers in its anguish -- there suddenly become visible before they a strange sight such as they have never see before it be like the rising of the sun but it be not the sun suddenly into the heart upon which they look there come a great silence and calm there be nothing say that even they could hear nor do that they could see but for a moment the throb be still and the anguish calm and there come a great peace the woman in whom this wonder be work be astonish as they be she give a low cry in the darkness for wonder that the pain have go from she in a instant in the twinkling of a eye there be no promise make to she that she prayer would be grant and no new light give to guide she for the time to come but she pain be take away she stand hushed and lift she eye and the gray of the sea and the low cloud that be like a canopy above and the lighten of colorless light towards the west enter with they great quiet into she heart ` be this the peace that passeth all understand ' she say to herself confuse with the sudden calm in all she life it have never so happen to she before -- to be heal of she grievous wound yet without cause and while no change be work yet to be put to rest ` it be we brother ' say the little pilgrim shed tear of joy ` it be the secret of the lord ' say the sage but not even they have see he pass by they walk with she softly in the silence in the sound of the sea till the wonder in she be hush like the pain and talk with she though she know it not for very soon question arise in she heart ` and oh ' she say ` be this the lord 's reply ' with thankfulness and awe but because she be human and know so little and be full of impatience ` oh and be this _ all _ ' be what she next say ' i ask for _ they _ and thou hast give to _ I _ -- ' then the voice of she heart grow louder and she cry with the sound of the pain come back ' i ask one thing and thou givest another i ask no blessing for I i ask for they my lord my god give it to they -- to they ' with disappointment rise in she heart the little pilgrim lay she hand upon the woman 's arm -- for she be afraid lest we lord might be displeased forget -lrb- for she be still imperfect -rrb- that he see all that be in the soul and understand and take no offence -- and say quickly ` oh be not afraid he will save they too the blessing will come for they too ' ` at he own time ' say the sage ` and in he own way ' these thought rise in the woman 's soul she do not know that they be say to she nor who say they but accept they as if they have come from she own thought for she say to herself ` this be what be mean by the answer of prayer it be not what we ask yet what i ask be accord to thy will my lord it be not riches nor honor nor beauty nor health nor long life nor anything of this world if i have be impatient this be my punishment -- that the lord have think not of they but of I but i can bear all o my lord that and a thousand time more if thou wilt but think of they and not of I ' nevertheless she return to she home still and comfort for though she trouble return to she and be not change yet for a moment it have be lift from she and the peace which passeth all understanding have enter she heart ` but why then ' say the little pilgrim to she companion when the friend be go ` why will not the father give to she what she ask for i know what it be it be that those whom she love should love he and serve he and that be he will too for he would have all love he he who love all ' ` little sister ' say she companion ` you ask I why he do not let the child remain upon the earth ' ` ah but that be different ' she cry ` oh it be different when you say that the secret be between the child and the father i know that it be so for it be just that the father should consider we first one by one and do for we what be best but it be always best to serve he it be best to love he it be best to give up all the world and cleave to he and follow wherever he go no man can say otherwise than this -- that to follow the lord and serve he that be well for all and always the best ' she speak so hotly and hastily that she companion could find no room for reply but he be in no haste he wait till she have say what be in she heart then he reply ` if it be even so if the father hear all prayer and put forth he hand and force those who be far off to come near -- ' the little pilgrim look up with horror in she face as if he have blaspheme and say ` force not so not so ' ` yet it must be so ' he say ` if it be against they desire and will ' ` oh not so not so ' she cry ` but that he should change they heart ' ` yet that too against they will ' he say the little pilgrim pause upon the way and she heart rise against she companion who speak thing so hard to be receive and that seem to dishonor the work of the lord but she remember that it could not be so and pause before she speak and look up at he with eye that be full of wonder and almost of fear ` then must they perish ' she say ` and must she heart break ' and she voice sink low for pity and sorrow though she be herself among the bless yet the thorn and brier of the earth catch at she garment and pierce she tender foot ` little sister ' say the sage ` to we who be bear of the earth it be hard to remember that the child belong not first to the parent nor the husband to the wife nor the wife to the husband but that all be the child of the father and he be just he will not neglect the little one because of those prayer which the father and the mother pour forth to he although they cry with anguish and with tear nor will he break he great law and violate the nature he have make and compel he own child to what it will not and love not the woman be comfort in the breaking of she heart but those whom she love be not they also the child of the father who love they more than she do and each be to he as if there be not another in the world nor be there any other in the world -- for none can come between the father and the child ' a smile come upon the little pilgrim 's face yet she tremble ` it be dim before I ' she say ` and i can not see clearly oh if the time would but hasten that we lord might come and all struggle be end and the darkness vanish away ' ` he will come when all thing be ready ' say the sage and as they go upon they way be show she other sight and the mystery of the heart of man and the great patience of we lord it happen to they suddenly to perceive in they way a man return home these be word that be sweet to all who have live upon the earth and know its way but far far be they from that meaning which be sweet the dark hour have pass and man have sleep and the night be over the sun be rise in the sky which be keen and clear with the pleasure of the morning the air be fresh with the dew and the bird awake in the tree and the breeze so sweet that it seem to blow from heaven and to the two traveller it seem almost in the joy of the new day as if the lord have already come but here be one who prove that it be not so he have not sleep all the night nor have night be silent to he nor dark but full of glare light and noise and riot he eye be red with fever and weariness and he soul be sick within he and the morning look he in the face and upbraid he as a sister might have upbraid he who love he and he say in he heart as one have say of old that all be vanity that it be vain to live and evil to have be bear that the day of death be better than the day of birth and all be delusion and love but a word and life a lie he footstep on the road seem to sound all through the sleep world and when he look the morning in the face he be ashamed and curse the light the two go after he into a silent house where everybody sleep the light that have burn for he all night be sick like a guilty thing in the eye of day and all that have be prepare for he repose be ghastly to he in the hour of awake as if prepare not for sleep but for death he heart be sick like the watch-light and life flicker within he with disgust and disappointment for why have he be bear if this be all -- for all be vanity the night and the day have be pass in pleasure and it be vanity and now he soul loathe he pleasure yet he know that be vanity too and that next day he would resume they as before all be vain -- the morning and the evening and the spirit of man and the way of human life he look himself in the face and loathe this dream of existence and know that it be naught so much as it have cost to be bear to be feed and guard and teach and care for and all for this he say to himself that it be better to die than to live and never to have be than to be as these spectator stand by with much pity and tenderness look into the weariness and sickness of this soul there begin to be enact before they a scene such as no man could have see which no one be aware of save he who be concern and which even to he be not clear in its meaning but rather like a phantasmagoria a thing of the mist yet which be great and solemn as be the council of a king in which great thing be debate for the welfare of the nation the air seem in a moment to be full of the sound of footstep and of something more subtle which the sage and the pilgrim know to be wing and as they look there grow before they the semblance of a court of justice with accuser and defender but the judge and the criminal be one then be put forth that indictment which he have be make up in he soul against life and against the world and again another indictment which be against himself and then the advocate begin they pleading voice be there great and eloquent such as be familiar in the court above which sound forth in the spectator ' ear earnest as those who plead for life and death and these speaker declare that sin only be vanity that life be noble and love sweet and every man make in the image of god to serve both god and man and they set forth they reason before the judge and show he mystery of life and death and they take up the counter-indictment and prove to he how in all the world he have seek but himself he own pleasure and profit he own will not the will of god nor even the good desire of humble nature but only that which pleased he sick fancy and he self-loving heart and they beseech he with a thousand argument to return and choose again the better way ` arise ' they cry ` thou miserable and become great arise thou vain soul and become noble take thy birthright o son and behold the face of the father ' and then there come a whispering of lower voice very penetrate and sweet like the voice of woman and child who murmur and cry ' o father o brother o love o my child ' the man who be the accuse yet who be the judge listen and he heart burn and a longing arise within he for the face of the father and the better way but then there come a clang and clamor of sound on the other side and voice call out to he as comrade as lover as friend and remind he of the delight which once have be so sweet to he and of the freedom he love and boast the right of man to seek what be pleasant and what be sweet and flout he as a coward whose aim be to save himself and scorn he as a believer in old wife ' tale and superstition that man have outgrow and they voice be so vehement and full of passion that by time they master the other so that it be as if a tempest rage round the soul which sit in the midst and who be the offender and yet the judge of all the two spectator watch the conflict as those who watch the trial upon which hang a man 's life it seem to the little pilgrim that she could not keep silent and that there be thing which she could tell he which no one know but she she put she hand upon the arm of the sage and call to he ` speak you speak you he will hear you and i too will speak and he will not resist what we say ' but even as she say this eager and strain against she companion 's control the strangest thing ensue the man who be set there to judge himself and he life he who be the criminal yet August upon he seat to weigh all and give the decision he before whom all those great advocate be plead -- a haze steal over he eye he be but a man and he be weary and subject to the sway of the little over the great the moment over the life which be the condition of man while yet the judgment be not give or the issue decide while still the pleading be in he ear in a moment he head drop back upon he pillow and he fall asleep he sleep like a child as if there be no evil nor conflict nor danger nor question more than how best to rest when you be weary in all the world and straightway all be silent in the place those who have be conduct this great cause depart to other court and tribunal have do all that be permit they to do and the man sleep and when it be noon wake and remember no more the sage lead the little pilgrim forth in a great confusion so that she could not speak for wonder but he say ` this sleep also be from the father for the mind of the man be weary and not able to form a judgment it be adjourn until a better day ' the little pilgrim hang she head and cry ' i do not understand will not the lord interfere will not the father make it clear to he be he the judge between good and evil be it all in he own hand ' the sage speak softly as if with awe he say ` this be the burden of we nature which be not like the angel there be none in heaven or on earth that can take from he what be he right and great honor among the creature of god the father respect that which he have make he will force no child of he and there be no haste with he nor have it ever be fathom among we how long he will wait or if there be any end the air be full of the come and go of those who plead before the son of man and sometimes in great misery and trouble there will be a cause win and a judgment record which make the universe rejoice and in everything at the end it be prove that we lord 's way be the best and that all can be accomplish in he name ' the little pilgrim go on she way in silence know that the longing in she heart which be to compel they to come in like that king who send to gather he guest from the highway and the hedge could not be right since it be not the father 's way yet confuse in she soul and full of a eager desire to go back and wake that man and tell he all that have be in she heart while she watch he sit on he judgment-seat but there come recollection waft across she mind as by breeze of the past of scene in she earthly life when she have speak without avail when she have say all that be in she heart and fail and do harm when she have mean to do good and slowly it come upon she that she companion speak the truth and that no man can save he brother but each must sit and hear the pleading and pronounce that judgment which be for life or death ` but oh ' she cry ` how long and how bitter it be for those who love they and must stand by and can give no aid ' then she companion unfold to she the patience of the lord and how he be not discourage nor ever weary but open he great assizes year by year and day by day and how the cause be argue again as she have see it before the soul of man sometimes again and again and over and over till the pleading of the advocate carry conviction and the judge perceive the truth and consent to it he show she that this be the great thing in human life and that though it be not enough to make a man perfect yet that he who sin against he will be different from the man who sin with he will and how in all thing the choice of the man for good or evil be all in all and he lead she about the world so that she could see how everywhere the heavenly advocate be travel enter into the secret place of the soul and plead with each man to he face and the little pilgrim look on with pity and tender eye and it seem to she that the heart of the judge before whom that great question be debate lean mostly to the right and acknowledge that the way of the lord be the best way but either that sleep overpower he and weariness or the other voice deafen he ear or something betray he that he forget the reason of the wise and the judgment of he own soul at first it comfort she to see how something nobler in every man would answer to the pleading and then she heart fail she to perceive that notwithstanding this the judge would leave he seat without a decision and all would end in vanity ` and oh friend ' she cry ` what shall be do to those who see and yet refuse ' -- she heart be wring by the disappointment and the failure but she companion smile still and he say ` they be the child of the father can a woman forget she child that she should not have compassion on the son of she womb she may forget yet will not he forget ' and thus they go on and on but time would not suffice to tell what these two pilgrim see as they wander among the way of man they see poverty and misery and pain which come of the evil which man have do upon the earth and be he punishment and could be cure by nothing but by the return of each to he father and the give up of all self-worship and self-seeking and sin but amid all the confusion and among those who have fall the lowest they find not one who be forsake whose name the father have forget or who be not make to pause in he appointed moment and to sit upon he throne and hear the pleading before he of the great advocate of god reasoning of temperance and righteousness and judgment to come but once before they return to they home a great thing befall they and they behold that court sit and the pleading make for the last time upon earth which be a sight more solemn and terrible than anything they have yet see they find themselves in a chamber where sit a man who have live long and know both good and evil and fulfil many great office so that he be famed and honor among man he be a man who be wise in all the learning of the earth standing but a little way below those who have begin the higher learning in the world beyond and lift up he head as if he would reach the star the traveller stand by he in he beautiful house which be as the palace of wisdom and see he in the midst of all he honor the lamp be light within and the night be sweet without breathing of rest and happy ease and riches and knowledge as if they would endure forever and the man look round on all he have and all he have achieve and everything which he possess to enjoy it for of wisdom and of glory he have he fill and he soul be yet strong to take pleasure in what be he and he look around he like god and say that everything be good so that the little pilgrim gaze and wonder whether this could indeed be one of the brethren of the earth or if he be one who have wander hither from another sphere but as the thought arise she hear and lo the step of the pleader and the sound of they entry they come slowly like a solemn procession more grave and awful in they look than any she have see for they be great and the greatest of all such as come forth but rarely when the last word be to be say the word they say be few but they stand round he remind he of all that have be and of what must be and of many thing which be know but to god and he alone and call upon he yet once more before time should come to a end and life be lose but the sound of they voice in he ear be but as some great strain of music which he have hear many time and know and heed not he turn to the goods which he have lay up for many year and all the knowledge he have store and say to himself ` soul take thine ease ' and to the heavenly advocate he smile and reply that life be strong and wisdom the master of all then there come a chill and a shiver over all as if the earth have be stop in she career or the sun fall from the sky and the little pilgrim look on could see the heavenly pleader come forth with bow head and the door of hope shut to and a whisper which creep about from sea to sea and say ` in vain in vain ' and as they go forth from the gate a icy breath sweep in and the voice of the death-angel say ` thou fool this night thy soul shall be require of thee ' the sound go through she heart as if it have be pierce by a sword and she give a cry of anguish for she could not bear that a brother should be lose but when she look up at the face of she companion though it be pale with the pity and the terror of that which have be thus accomplish there be still upon it a smile and he say ` not yet not yet the father love not less but more than ever ' ' o friend ' she cry ` will there ever come a moment when the father will forget be there any place where he can not go ' then he who be wise turn towards she and a great light come upon he face and he say ` we have search the record and hear all witness from the beginning of time but we have never find the boundary of he mercy and there be no country know to man that be without he presence and never have it be know that he have shut he ear to those who call upon he or forget one who be he the heavenly pleader may be silence but never we lord who plead for all and heaven and earth may forget yet will he never forget who be the father of all and every child of he be to he as if there be none other in the world ' then the little pilgrim lift she face and beheld that radiance which be over all which be the love that light the world both angel and the great sphere above and the little brethren who stumble and struggle and weep and in that light there be no darkness at all but everything shone as in the morning sweet yet terrible but ever clear and fair and immediately ere she be aware the rough road of the earth be leave far behind and she have return to she place and to she peaceful state and to the work which have be give she -- to receive the wanderer and to bid they a happy welcome as the door open and they enter into they inheritance and thus she soul be satisfied though she know now nothing more than she have know always -- that the eye of the father be over all and that he can neither forget nor forsake ii on the dark mountain when the little pilgrim have be thus permit to see the secret workings of god in earthly place and among the brethren who be still in the land of hope -- these be thing which the angel desire to look into and which be the subject of story and of song not only in the little world below but in the great realm above -- she heart for a long time repose and be satisfied and ask no further question for she have see what the dealings of the father be in the heart of man and how till the end come he do not cease to send he messenger to plead in every heart and to hold a court of justice that no man might be deceive but each know whither he step be tend and what be the way of wisdom after this it be permit to she to read in the archive of the heavenly country the story of one who neglect all that the advocate of god could say have find himself when the little life be complete not upon the threshold of a better country but in the midst of the land of darkness -- that region in which the soul of man be leave by god to they own device and the father stand aloof and hide he face and call they not neither persuade they more over this story the little pilgrim have shed many tear for she know well be enlighten in she great simplicity by the heavenly wisdom that it be pain and grief to the father to turn away he face and that no one who have but the little heart of a man can imagine to himself what that sorrow be in the being of the great god and a great awe come over she mind at the thought which seem well-nigh a blasphemy that he could grieve yet in she heart be he child she know that it be true and she own little spirit throb through and through with longing and with desire to help those who be thus utterly lose ` and oh ' she say ` if i could but go there be nothing which could make a child afraid save to see they suffer what be darkness and terror when the father be with you i be not afraid -- if i might but go ' and by reason of she often plead and of the thought that be ever in she mind it be at last say that one of those who know might instruct she and show she by what way alone the traveller who come from that miserable land could approach and be admit on high ' i know ' she say ` that between we and they there be a gulf fix and that they who would come from thence can not come neither can any one -- ' but here she stop in great dismay for it seem that she have thus answer she own longing and prayer the guide who have come for she smile upon she and say ` but that be before the lord have end he work and now all the path be free wherever there be a mountain-pass or a river-ford the road be all bless and they be all open and no barrier for those who will ' ` oh ' she cry ` dear friend be that true for all ' he look away from she into the depths of the lovely air and he reply : ` little sister we faith be without bound but not we knowledge i who speak to you be no more than a man the prince and power that be in high place know more than i but if there be any place where a heart can stir and cry out to the father and he take no heed -- if it be only in a groan if it be only with a sigh -- i know not that place yet many depths i know ' he put out he hand and take hers after a pause and then he say ` there be some who be stumble upon the dark mountain come and see ' as they pass along there be many who pause to look at they for he have the mien of a great prince a lord among man and he face still bear the trace of sorrow and toil and there be about he a awe and wonder which be more than could be put in word so that those who see he understand as he go by not who he be nor what he have be but that he have come out of great tribulation of sorrow beyond the sorrow of man the sweetness of the heavenly country have soothe away he care and take the cloud from he face but he be as yet unaccustomed to smile -- though when he remember and look round he and see that all be well he countenance lighten like the morning sky and he eye wake up in splendor like the sun rise the little pilgrim do not know who she brother be but yet give thanks to god for he she know not why how far they go can not be estimate in word for distance matter little in that place but at the end they come to a path which slope a little downward to the edge of a delightful moorland country all brilliant with the hue of the mountain flower it be like a flowery plateau high among the hill in a region where be no frost to check the glow of the flower or scorch the grass it spread far around in hollow and ravine and softly swell hill with the rush over they of a cheerful breeze full of mountain scent and sound and high above they rise the mountain height of the celestial world veil in those blue breadth of distance which be heaven itself when man 's fancy ascend to they from the low world at they foot all the little earth can do in color and mist and travel shadow fleet as the breath and the sweet steadfast shine of the sun be there but with a ten-fold splendor they rise up into the sky every peak and jagged rock all touch with the light and the smile of god and every little blossom on the turf rejoice in the warmth and freedom and peace the heart of the little pilgrim swell and she cry out ` there be nothing so glorious as the everlasting hill though the valley and the plain be sweet they be not like they they say to we lift up you heart ' she guide smile but he do not speak he smile be full of joy but grave like that of a man whose thought be bent on other thing and he point where the road wound downward by the foot of these triumphant hill she keep she eye upon they as she move along those height rise into the very sky but bear upon they neither snow nor storm here and there a whiteness like a film of air round out over a peak and she recognize that it be one of those angel who travel far and wide with god 's commission go to the other world that be in the firmament as in a sea the softness of these film of white be like the summer cloud that she use to watch in the blue of the summer sky in the little world which none of its child can cease to love and she wonder now whether it might not sometimes have be the same dear angel whose flight she have watch unknow higher than thought could soar or knowledge penetrate watch those float heavenly messenger and the height of the great miraculous mountain rise up into the sky the little pilgrim cease to think whither she be go although she know from the feeling of the ground under she foot that she be descend still softly but more quickly than at first until she be bring to herself by the sensation of a great wind come in she face cold as from a sudden vacancy she turn she head quickly from gaze above to what be before she and start with a cry of wonder for below lay a great gulf of darkness out of which rise at first some shadowy peak and shoulder of rock all fall away into a gloom which eye accustomed to the sunshine could not penetrate where she stand be the edge of the light -- before she foot lay a line of shadow slowly darken out of daylight into twilight and beyond into that measureless blackness of night and the wind in she face be like that which come from a great depth below of either sea or land -- the sweep of the current which move a vast atmosphere in which there be nothing to break its force the little pilgrim be so startle by these unexpected sensation that she catch the arm of she guide in she sudden alarm and clung to he lest she should fall into the terrible darkness and the deep abyss below ` there be nothing to fear ' he say ` there be a way to we who be above there be no danger at all and it be the way of life to those who be below ' ' i see nothing ' she cry ` save a few point of rock and the precipice -- the pit which be below oh tell I what be it be it where the fire be and despair dwell i do not think that be true let I go and hide myself and not see it for i never think that be true ' ` look again ' say the guide the little pilgrim shrink into a crevice of the rock and uncover she eye gaze into the darkness and because she nature be soft and timid there come into she mind a momentary fear she heart fly to the father 's footstool and cry out to he not any question or prayer but only ` father father ' and this make she stand erect and strengthen she eye so that the gloom even of hell could no more make she afraid she guide stand beside with a steadfast countenance which be grave yet full of a solemn light and then all at once he lift up he voice which be sonorous and sweet like the sound of a organ and utter a shout so great and resounding that it seem to come back in echo from every hollow and hill what he say the little pilgrim could not understand but when the echo have die away and silence follow something come up through the gloom -- a sound that be far far away and faint in the long distance a voice that sound no more than a echo when he who have call out hear it he turn to the little pilgrim with eye that be liquid with love and pity ` listen ' he say ` there be some one on the way ' ` can we help they ' cry the little pilgrim she heart bound forward like a bird she have no fear the darkness and the horrible way seem as nothing to she she stretch out she arm as if she would have seize the traveller and drag he up into the light he who be by she side shake he head but with a smile ` we can but wait ' he say ` it be forbid that any one should help for this be too terrible and strange to be touch even by the hand of angel it be like nothing that you know ' ' i have be teach many thing ' say the little pilgrim humbly ' i have be take back to the dear earth where i see the judgment-seat and the pleader who speak and the man who be the judge and how each be judge for himself ' ` you have see the place of hope ' say she guide ` where the father be and the son and where no man be leave to he own way but there be another country where there be no voice either from god or from good spirit and where those who have refuse be leave to do as seem good in they own eye ' ' i have read ' say the little pilgrim with a sob ` of one who go from city to city and find no rest ' she guide bow he head very gravely in assent ` they go from place to place ' he say ` if haply they might find one in which it be possible to live whether it be order or whether it be license it be accord to they own will they try all thing ever look for something which the soul may endure and new city be found from time to time and a new endeavor ever and ever to live only to live for even when happiness fail and content and work be vanity and effort be naught it be something if a man can but endure to live ' the little pilgrim look at he with wistful eye for what he say be beyond she understanding ` for we ' she say ` life be nothing but joy oh brother be there then condemnation ' ` it be no condemnation it be what they have choose -- it be to follow they own way there be no longer any one to interfere the pleader be all silent there be no voice in the heart the father hinder they not nor help they but leave they ' he shiver as if with cold and the little pilgrim feel that there breathe from the depths of darkness at they foot a icy wind which touch she hand and foot and chill she heart she shiver too and draw close to the rock for shelter and gaze at the awful cliff rise out of the gloom and the path that disappear at she foot lead down down into that abyss and she heart fail within she to think that below there be soul that suffer and that the father and the son be not there he the all-love the all-present -- how could it be that he be not there ` it be a mystery ' say the man who be she guide and who answer to she thought ` when i set my foot upon this bless land i know that there even there he be but in that country he face be hide and even to name he name be anguish -- for then only do man understand what have befall they who can say that name no more ' ` that be death indeed ' she cry and the wind come up silent with a wild breath that be more awful than the shriek of a storm for it be like the stifled utterance of all those miserable one who have no voice to call upon god and know not where he be nor how to pronounce he name ` ah ' say he ` if we could have know what death be we have believe in death in the time of all great illusion in the time of the gentle life in the day of hope but in the land of darkness there be no illusion and every man know that though he should fling himself into the furnace of the gold or be cut to piece by the knife or trample under the dancer ' foot yet that it will be but a little more pain and that death be not nor any escape that way ' ` oh brother ' she cry ` you have be there ' he turn and look upon she and she read as in a book thing which tongue of man can not say -- the anguish and the rapture the unforgotten pang of the lose the joy of one who have be deliver after hope be go ' i have be there and now i stand in the light and have see the face of the lord and can speak he bless name ' and with that he burst forth into a great melodious cry which be not like that which he have send into the dark depths below but mount up like the sound of silver trumpet and all joyful music give a voice to the sweet air and the fresh wind which blow about the hill of god but the word he say be not comprehensible to he companion for they be in the sweet tongue which be between the father and he child and know to none but to they alone yet only to hear the sound be enough to transport all who listen and to make they know what joy be and peace the little pilgrim weep for happiness to hear she brother 's voice but in the midst of it she ear be catch by another sound -- a faint cry which tingle up from the darkness like a note of a muffle bell -- and she turn from the joy and the light and fling out she arm and she little voice towards he who be stumble upon the dark mountain and ` come ' she cry ` come come ' forget all thing save that one be there in the darkness while here be light and peace ` it be nearer ' say she guide hearing even in the midst of he triumph song that faint and distant cry and he take she hand and draw she back for she be upon the edge of the precipice gaze into the black depths which reveal nothing save the needle of the awful rock and sheer descent below ` the moment will come ' he say ` when we can help but it be not yet ' she heart be in the depths with he who be come whom she know not save that he be come toiling upward towards the light and it seem to she that she could not contain herself nor wait till he should appear nor draw back from the edge where she might hold out she hand to he and save he some single step if no more but presently she heart return to she brother who stand by she side and who be deliver and with whom it be meet that all should rejoice since he have fight and conquer and reach the land of light ` oh ' she say ` it be long to wait while he be still upon these dark mountain tell I how it come to you to find the way ' he turn to she with a smile though he ear too be intent and he heart fix upon the traveller in the darkness and begin to tell she he tale to beguile the time of wait and to hold within bound the pity that fill she heart he tell she that he be one of many who come from the pleasant earth together out of many country and tongue and how they have go here and there each man to a different city and how they have cross each other 's path come and go yet never find rest for they foot and how there be a little relief in every change and one seek that which another left and how they wander round and round over all the vast and endless plain until at length in revolt from every other way they have choose a spot upon the slope of a hill and build there a new city if perhaps something better might be find there and how it have be build with tower and high wall and great gate to shut it in so that no stranger should find entrance and how every house be a palace with statue of marble and pillar so precious with beautiful work and arch so lofty and so fair that they be better than have they be make of gold -- yet gold be not want nor diamond stone that shine like star and everything more beautiful and stately than heart could conceive ` and while we build and labor ' he say ` we heart be a little appease and it be call the city of art and all be perfect in it so that nothing have ever be see to compare with it for beauty and we walk upon the battlements and look over the plain and view the dweller there who be not as we and we go on to fill every room and every hall with carve work in stone and beaten gold and picture and weave tissue that be like the sun-gleam and the rainbow of the pleasant earth and crowd come around envy we and seek to enter but we close we gate and drive they away and it be say among we that life would now become as of old and everything would go well with we as in the happy day ' the little pilgrim look up into he face and for pity of he pain -lrb- though it be past -rrb- almost wish that _ that _ could have come true ` but when the work be do ' he say and for a moment no more ` oh brother when the work be do ' ` you do not know what it be ' he say ` to be ten time more powerful and strong to want no rest to have fire in you vein to have the craving in you heart above everything that be know to man when the work be do we glare upon each other with hungry eye and each man wish to thrust forth he neighbor and possess all to himself and then we cease to take pleasure in it notwithstanding that it be beautiful and there be some who would have beat down the wall and build they anew and some would have tear up the silver and gold and toss out the fair statue and the adornment in scorn and rage to the meaner multitude below and we who be the worker begin to contend one against another to satisfy the gnawing of the rage that be in we heart for we have deceive ourselves think once more that all would be well while all the time nothing be change and we be but as the miserable one that rush from place to place ' though all this wretchedness be over and past it be so terrible to think of that he pause and be silent awhile and the little pilgrim put she hand upon he arm in she great pity to soothe he and almost forget that there be another traveller not yet deliver upon the way but suddenly at that moment there come up through the depths the sound of a fall as if the rock have crash from a hundred peak yet all muffle by the great distance and echo all around in faint echo and rumbling as in the bosom of the earth and mingle with they be far-off cry so faint and distant that human ear could not have hear they like the cry of lost child or creature waver and stray in the midst of the boundless night this time she who be watch upon the edge of the gloom would have fling herself forward altogether into it have not she companion again restrain she ` one have stumble upon the mountain but listen listen little sister for the voice be many ' he say ` it be not one who come but many and though he fall he will rise again ' and once more he shout aloud bend down against the rock so that they catch he voice and the sweet air from the sky come behind he in a great gust like a summer storm and carry it into all the echo hollow of the hill and the little pilgrim know that he shout to all who come to take courage and not to fear and this time there rise upwards many faint and waver sound that do not stir the air but make it tingle with a vibration of the great distance and the unknown depths and then again all be still they stand for a time intent upon the great silence and darkness which sweep up all sight and sound and then the little pilgrim once more turn she eye towards she companion and he begin again he wonderful tale ` he who have be the first to find the city and who be the most wise of any though the rage be in he like all the rest and the disappointment and the anguish yet would not yield and he call upon we for another trial to make a picture which should be the greatest that ever be paint and each one of we small or great who have be of that art in the dear life take share in the rivalry and the emulation so that on every side there be a fury and a rush each man with he band of supporter about he struggle and swearing that he be the best not that they love the work or the beauty of the work but to keep down the gnawing in they heart and to have something for which they could still fight and storm and for a little forget ' ' i be one who have be among the highest ' he speak not with pride but in a low and deep voice which go to the heart of the listener and bring the tear to she eye it be not like that of the painter in the heavenly city who rejoice and be glad in he work though he be but as a humble workman serve those who be more great but this man have the sorrow of greatness in he and the wonder of those who can do much to find how little they can do ` my vein ' he say ` be fill with fire and my heart with the rage of a great desire to be first as i have be first in the day of the gentle life and i make my plan to be greater than all the rest to paint a vast picture like the world fill with all the glory of life in a moment i have conceive what i should do for my strength be as that of a hundred man and none of we could rest or breathe till it be accomplish but fling ourselves upon this new thing as upon water in the desert oh my little sister how can i tell you what word can show forth this wonderful thing i stand before my great canvas with all those who be of my faction press upon I note every touch i make shout and say he will win he will win when lo there come a mystery and a wonder into that place i have arrange man and woman before I accord to all the device of art to serve as my model that nature might be in my picture and life but when i look i see they not for between they and I have come a face ' the eye of the little pilgrim drop with tear she hold out she hand towards he with a sympathy which no word could say ` often have i paint that face in the other life sometimes with awe and love sometimes with scorn -- for hire and for bread and for pride and for fame it be pale with suffer yet smile the eye have tear in they yet light below and all that be there be full of tenderness and of love there be a crown upon the brow but it be make of thorn it come before I suddenly while i stand there with the man shout close to my ear urge I on and fierce fury in my heart and the rage to be first and to forget where my model be there it come i could not see they nor my group that i have plan nor anything but that face i call out to my man who have do this but they hear I not nor understand I for to they there be nothing there save the figure i have set -- a living picture all ready for the painter 's hand ' i could not bear it the sight of that face i flung my tool away i cover my eye with my hand but those who be about I press on I and threaten they pull my hand from my eye coward they cry and traitor to leave we in the lurch now will the other side win and we be shame rather tear he limb from limb fling he from the wall the crowd come round I like a angry sea they force my pencil back into my hand work they cry or we will tear you limb from limb for though they be upon my side it be for rivalry and not out of any love for I ' he pause for a moment for he heart be yet full of the remembrance and of joy that it be past ' i look again ' he say ` and still it be there o face divine -- the eye all wet with pity the lip all quiver with love and neither pity nor love belong to that place nor any succor nor the touch of a brother nor the voice of a friend paint they cry or we will tear you limb from limb and fire come into my heart i push they from I on every side with the strength of a giant and then i flung it on the canvas cry i know not what -- not to they but to he shrink not from I little sister for i blasphemed i call he impostor deceiver galilean and still with all my might with all the fury of my soul i set he there for every man to see not know what i do everything fade from I but that face i see it alone the crowd come round I with shout and threat to drag I away but i take no heed they be silence and flee and leave I alone but i know nothing nor when they come back with other and seize I and fling I forth from the gate be i aware what i have do they cast I out and leave I upon the wild without a shelter without a companion storm and rave at they as they do at I they dash the great gate behind I with a clang and shut I out and i turn and defy they and curse they as they curse I not know what i have do ' ` oh brother ' murmur the little pilgrim kneel as if she have accompany he all the way with she prayer but could not now say more ` then i see again ' he go on not hear she in the great force of that passion and wonder which be still in he mind ` that vision in the air wherever i turn it be there -- he eye wet with pity he countenance shine with love whence come he what do he in that place where love be not where pity come not ' ` friend ' she cry ` to seek you there ' she companion bow he head in deep humbleness and joy and again he lift he great voice and intone he song of praise the little pilgrim understand it but by fragment -- a line that be more simple that come here and there and it praise the lord that where the face of the father be hide and where love be not nor compassion nor brother have pity on brother nor friend know the face of friend and all succor be stay and every help forbid -- yet still in the depths of the darkness and in the heart of the silence he who could not forget nor forsake be there the voice of the singer be like that of one of the great angel and many of the inhabitant of the bless country begin to appear gathering in crowd to hear this great music as the little sister thought and she herself listen with all she heart wonder and see on the face of those dear friend whom she do not know a expectation and a hope which be strange to she though she could always understand they love and they joy but in the middle of this great song there come again another sound to she ear -- a sound which pierce through the music like lightning through the sky though it be but the cry of one distraught and faint a cry out of the depths not even seek help a cry of distress too terrible to be bear though it be scarcely louder than a sigh she hear it through all the music and turn and fly to the edge of the precipice whence it come and immediately the darkness seem to move as with a pulse in a great throb and something come through the wind with a rush as if part of the mountain have fall -- and lo at she foot lay one who have fling himself forward he arm stretch out he face to the ground as if he have seize and grasp in a agony the very soil he lay there half in the light and half in the shadow grip the rock with he hand burrow into the cool herbage above and the mountain flower cling catch hold despair yet seize everything he could grasp -- the tender grass the rolling stone the little pilgrim fling herself down upon she knee by he side and grasp he arm to help and cry aloud for aid and the song of the singer cease and there be silence for a moment so that the breath of the fugitive could be hear panting and he strong struggle to drag himself altogether out of that abyss of darkness below she think of nothing nor hear nor see anything but the strain of that last effort which seem to shake the very mountain until suddenly there seem to rise all around the hum and murmur as of a great multitude and look up she see every little hill and hollow and the glorious plain beyond as far as eye could see crowd with countless throng and on the high peak above in the full shine of the sun come band of angel and of those great being who be more mighty than man and the eye of all be fix upon the man who lay as one dead upon the ground and from the lip of all come a low murmur of rapture and delight that spread like the hum of the bee like the cooing of the dove like the voice of a mother over she child and the same sound come to she own lip unaware and she murmur ` welcome ' and ` brother ' and ` friend ' not know what she say and look to the other whisper ` hush for he be weak ' -- and all of they answer with tear with ` hush ' and ` welcome ' and ` friend ' and ` brother ' and ` beloved ' and stand smile and weep for joy and presently there come softly into the bless air the ringing of the great silver bell which sound only for victory and great happiness and gain and there be joy in heaven and every world be stir and throughout the firmament and among all the lord and prince of life it be know that the impossible have become true and the name of the lord have prove enough and love have conquer even despair ` hush ' she say ` for he be weak ' and because it be she bless service to receive those who have newly arrive in that heavenly country and to soothe and help they so that like newborn child they should be able to endure and understand the joy she kneel by he on the ground and try to rouse he though with tremble for never before have she stand by one who be newly come out of the land of despair ` let the sun come upon he ' she say ` let he feel the brightness of the light ' -- and with she soft hand she draw he out of the shade of the twilight to where the brightness of the day fall like a smile upon the flower and then at last he stir and turn round and open he eye for the genial warmth have reach he but he eye be heavy and dazzle with the light and he look round he as if confuse from beneath he heavy eyelid ` and where be i ' he say ` and who be you ' ` oh brother ' say the little pilgrim and tell he in he ear the name of that heavenly place and many comforting and joyful thing but he understand she not and still gaze about he with dazzle eye for he face be still towards the darkness and fear be upon he lest this place should prove no more than a delusion and the darkness return and the anguish and pain then he who have be she guide and tell she he tale come forward and stand by the side of the newly come and ` brother ' he say ` look upon I for you know I and know from whence i come ' the stranger look dimly with he heavy eye and he reply ` it be as a dream that i know you and know from whence you come and the dream be sweet to lie here and think that i be at peace deceive I not oh deceive I not with dream that be sweet but let I go upon my way and find the end if there be any end or if any good can be ' ` what shall we do ' cry the little pilgrim ` to persuade he that he have arrive and be safe and dream no more ' and they stand round he wonder and trouble to find how little they could do for he and that the light enter so slowly into he soul and he lay on the bank like one left for death so weary and so worn with all the horror of the way that he heart be faint within he and peace itself seem to he but a illusion he lay silent while they watch and wait then turn himself upon the grass which be as soft to the weary wayfarer as angel ' wing and then the sunshine catch he eye as if he have be a newborn babe awaken to the light he put out he hand to it and touch the ground that be golden with those heavenly ray and gather himself up till he feel it upon he face and open wide he dazzled eye then shaded they with tremble hand and say to himself ` it be the sun it be the sun ' but still he do not dare to believe that the danger and the toil be over nor could he listen nor understand what the brethren say while they all stand around and watch and wait wonder each how the new-comer should be satisfy there suddenly arise a sound with which they be all acquaint -- the sound of one approach the face of the bless be all around like the star in the sky -- multitude whom none could count or reckon but he who come be see of none save he to whom he come the weary man rise up with a great cry then fall again upon he knee and fling he arm wide in the wonder and the joy and ` lord ' he cry ` be it thou lord it be thou thine be the face and thou hast bring I here ' the watcher know not what the other voice say for what be say to each new-comer be the secret of the lord but when they look again the man stand upright upon he foot and he face be full of light and though he tremble with weakness and with weariness and with exceed joy yet the confusion and the fear be go from he and he have no longer any suspicion of they as if they might betray he but hold out he tremble hand and cry ` friend -- you be friend and you speak to I and call I brother and be i here and be i here ' for to name the name of that bless country be not needful any longer now that he have see the lord then a great band and guard of honor of angel and principality and power surround he and lead he away to the holy city and to the presence of the father who have permit and have not forbid what the lord have do and all the company of the bless follow after with wonder and gladness and triumph because the great love of the lord have draw out of the darkness even those who be beyond hope the little pilgrim see they depart from she with love and joy and sit down upon the rocky edge and sing she own song of peace for she fear be go and she be ready to do she service there upon the verge of the precipice as among the flower and the sunshine where she own place be ` from the depths ' she say ` they come they come -- from the land of darkness where no love be for thy love o lord be more than the darkness and the depths and where hope be not there thy pity go ' she sit and sing to herself like a happy child for she heart have fathom the awful gloom which baffle angel and man and she have learn that though hope come to a end and light fail and the foot of the ambassador be stay on the mountain and the voice of the pleader be silence and darkness swallow up the world yet love never fail as she sing the pity in she heart grow so strong and she desire to help the lose that she rise up and step forth into the awful gloom and have it be permit in she gentleness and weakness would have go forth to the deep and have no fear the ground give way under she foot so dreadful be the precipice but though she heart beat with the horror of it and the whirl of the descent and the darkness which blind she eye yet have she no hurt and when she foot touch the rock and that sink sense of emptiness and vacancy cease she look around and see the path by which that traveller have come for when the eye be use to the darkness the horror of the gloom be no longer like a solid thing but move into shades of darker and less dark so that she see where the rock stand and how they sink with edge that cut like sword down and ever down into the abyss and how here a deep ravine be rent between they and there be break and scar as though some one have catch the jagged point with wounded hand or foot struggle up the perpendicular surface towards the little ray of light like a tiny star which shine as on immeasurable height to show where life be as she travel deeper and deeper it be a wonder to see how far that little ray penetrate down and down through gulf of darkness blue and cold like the shimmer of a diamond and even when it could be see no more send yet a shadowy refraction a line of something less black than the darkness a lighten amid the gloom a something indefinable which be hope the rock be more cruel than imagination could conceive -- sometimes pointed and sharp like knife sometimes smooth and upright as a wall with no hold for the climber sometimes move under the touch with stone that roll and crush the bleeding foot and though the solid mass be distinguishable from the lighter darkness of the air yet it could only be in grope that the traveller by that way could find where any foothold be the traveller who come from above and who have the privilege of she happiness sink down as if bear on wing yet need all she courage not to be afraid of the awful rock that rise all above and around she perpendicular in the gloom and the great blast of a icy wind sweep upward like something fly upon great wing so tremendous be the force of it whirling from the depths below suck upward by the very warmth of the life above so that the little pilgrim herself catch at the rock that she might not be sweep again towards the top or dash against the stony pinnacle that stand up on every side she be glad when she find a little platform under she foot for a moment where she could rest and also because she have come not from curiosity to see that gulf but with the hope and desire to meet some one to whom she could be of a little comfort or help in the terror of the way while she stand for a moment to get she breath she become sensible that some living thing be near and put out she hand she feel that there be round she something that be like a bastion upon a fortify wall and immediately a hand touch hers and a soft voice say ` sister fear not for this be the watch-tower and i be one of those who keep the way ' she have start and tremble indeed not that she fear but because the delicate fabric of she being be such that every movement of the wind and even those that be instinctive and belong to the habit of another life betray themselves in she and ` oh ' she say ' i know not that there be any watch-tower or any one to help but come because my heart call I if perhaps i might hold out my hand in the darkness and be of use where there be no light ' ` come and stand by I ' say the watcher and the little pilgrim see that there be a whiteness near to she out of which slowly shape the face of a fair and tender woman whom she know not but love and though they could scarcely see each other yet they know each other for sister and kiss and take comfort together hold each other 's hand in the midst of the awful gloom and the little pilgrim question in low and hushed tone ` be it to help that you be here ' ` to help when that may be but rather to watch and to send the news and make it know that one be come that the bell of joy may be sound and all the bless may rejoice ' ` oh ' say the little pilgrim ` tell I you name that i may do you honor -- for to gain such high promotion can be give only to the great who be make perfect and to those who love most ' ' i be not great ' say the watcher ` but the lord who consider all have place I here that i may be the first to see when one come who be in the dark place below and also because there be some who say that love be idolatry and that the father will not have we long for we own therefore be i permit to wait and watch and think the time not long for the love i bear he for he be mine and when he come i will ascend with he to the dear country of the light and some other who love enough will be promote in my place ' ' i be not worthy ' say the little pilgrim ` it be a great promotion but oh that we might be permit to help to put out a hand or to clear the way ' ` nay my little sister ' say the watcher ` but patience must have its perfect work and for those who be come help be secret they must not see it nor know it for the land of darkness be beyond hope the father will not force the will of any creature he have make for he respect we in we nature which be he image and when a man will not and will not till the day be over what can be do for he he be leave to he will and be permit to do it as it seem good in he eye a man 's will be great for it be the gift of god but the lord who can not rest while one be miserable still go secretly to they for he heart yearn after they and by time they will see he face or some thought of old will seize upon they and some will say to perish upon the dark mountain be better than to live here and i have see ' say the watcher ` that the lord will go with they all the way -- but secretly so that they can not see he and though it grieve he heart not to help yet will he not -- for they have become the creature of they own will and by that must they attain ' she put out she hand to the new-comer and draw she to the side of the rocky wall so that they feel the sweep of the wind in they face but be not drive before it ` and come ' she say ` for two of we together will be like a great light to those who be in the darkness they will see we like a lamp and it will cheer they though they know not why we be here listen ' she cry and the little pilgrim hold fast the hand of the watcher listen and look down upon the awful way and underneath the sweep of the icy wind be a small sharp sound as of a stone rolling or a needle of rock that break and fall like the sound that be in a wood when some creature move though too far off for footstep to sound ` listen ' say the watcher and she face so shone with joy that the little pilgrim see it clearly like the shine of the morning in the midst of the darkness ` he come ' ` oh sister ' she cry ` be it he whom you love above all the rest be it he ' the watcher smile and say ` if it be not he yet be it a brother if it be not he now yet he time will come and in every one who pass i hope to see he face and the more that come the more certain it be that he will come and the time seem not long for the love i bear he and it be for this that the lord have so consider I listen for some one come ' and there come to these watcher the strangest sight for there fly past they while they gaze a man who seem to be carry upon the sweep of the wind in the midst of the darkness they could see the faint white in he face with eye of flame and lip set firm whirl forward upon the wind which would have dash he against the rock but as he whirl past he catch with he hand the needle of the opposite peak and be swing high over a great chasm and land upon a higher height high over they head and for a moment they could hear like a pulsation through the depths the hard panting of he breath then with scarcely a moment for rest they hear the sound of he progress onward as if he do battle with the mountain and he own swiftness carry he like another wind it have take less than a moment to sweep he past quicker than the flight of a bird as sudden as a lightning flash the little pilgrim follow he with she eager ear wonder if he would leap thus into the country of light and take heaven by storm or whether he would fall upon the heavenly hill and lie prostrate in weariness and exhaustion like he to whom she have minister she follow he with she ear for the sound of he progress be with crash of rock and a swift movement in the air but she be call back by the pressure of the hand of the watcher who do not like the little pilgrim follow he who thus rush through space as far as there be sound or sight of he but have turn again to the lower side and be gaze once more and listen for the little noise in the gulf below the little pilgrim remember she friend 's hope and say softly ` it be not he ' and the watcher clasp she hand again and answer ` it be a dear brother i have sound the silver bell for he and soon we shall hear they answer from the height above and another time it will be he ' and they kiss each other because they understand each the other in she heart and then they talk together of the old life when all thing begin and of the wonderful thing they have learn concern the love of the father and the son and how all the world be hold by they and penetrate through and through by thread of love so that it could never fail and the darkness seem light round they and they forget for a little that the wind be not as a summer breeze then once more the hand of the watcher press that of she companion and bid she hush and listen and they sit together hold they breath strain they ear then hear they faint sound which be very different from those make by he who have be drive past they like a arrow from a bow -- first as of something fall but very far away and a faint sound as of a foot which slip the listener do not say a word to each other they sit still and listen scarcely draw they breath the darkness have no voice it could not be but that some traveller be there though hidden deep deep in the gloom only betray by the sound there be a long pause and the watcher hold fast the little pilgrim 's hand and betray to she the longing in she heart for though she be already bless beyond all blessedness know on earth yet have she not forget the love that have begin on earth but be forevermore she murmur to herself and say ` if it be not he it be a brother and the more that come the more sure it be that he will come little sister be there one for whom you watch ' ` there be no one ' the pilgrim say -- ` but all ' ` and so care i for all ' cry the watcher and she draw she companion with she to the edge of the abyss and they sit down upon it low among the rock to escape the rush of the wind and they sing together a soft song ` for if he should hear we ' she say ` it may give he courage ' and there they sit and sing and the white of they garment and of they heavenly face show like a light in the deep gloom so that he who be toiling upward might see that speck above he and be encourage to continue upon he way sometimes he fall and they could hear the moan he make -- for every sound come upwards however small and faint it might be -- and sometimes drag himself along so that they hear he movement up some shelf of rock and as the pilgrim look she see other and other dim whiteness along the ravine of the dark mountain and know that she be not the only one but that many have come to watch and look for the come of those who have be lose time be as nothing to these heavenly watcher but they know how long and terrible be the moment to those upon the way sometimes there would be silence like the silence of long year and fear come upon they that the wayfarer have turn back or that he have fall and lay suffering at the bottom of some gulf or have be sweep by the wind upon some icy peak and dash against the rock then anon while they listen and hold they breath a little sound would strike again into the silence bring back hope and again and again all would be still the little pilgrim hold she companion 's hand and the thought go through she mind that be she watch for one whom she love above the rest she heart would fail but the watcher answer she as if she have speak and say ` oh no oh no for if it be not he it be a brother and the lord give they joy ' but they sing no more they heart be faint with suspense and with eagerness to hear every sound then in the great chill of the silence suddenly and not far off come the sound of one who speak he murmur to himself and say ` who can continue on this terrible way the night be black like hell and there come no morning it be better in the land of darkness for still we could see the face of man though not god ' the muffle voice shake at that word and then be still suddenly as though it have be a flame and the wind have blow it out and for a moment there be silence until suddenly it break forth once more -- ` what be this that have come to I that i can say the name of god it torture no longer it be as balm but he be far off and hear nothing he call we and we answer not now it be we who call and he will not hear i will lie down and die it can not be that a man must live and live forever in pain and anguish here will i lie and it will end o thou whose face i have see in the night make it possible for a man to die ' the watcher loose herself from she companion 's clasp and stand upright upon the edge of the cliff clasp she hand together and say low as to herself ` father father ' as one who can not refrain from that appeal but who know the father love best and that to intercede be vain and longing be in she face and joy for it be he and she know that he could not now fail but would reach to the celestial country and to the shine of the sun yet that it be not hers to help he nor any man 's nor angel 's but the little pilgrim be ignorant not have be teach and she commit herself to those depths though she fear they and though she know not what she could do and once more the dense air close over she and the vacancy swallow she up and when she reach the rock below there lay something at she foot which she feel to be a man but she could not see he nor touch he and when she try to speak she voice die away in she throat and make no sound whether it be the wind that catch it and sweep it quite away or that the well of that depth profound suck every note upward or whether because it be not permit that either man or angel should come out of they sphere or help be give which be forbid the little pilgrim know not -- for never have it be say to she that she should stand aside where need be and surprise which be stronger than the icy wind and for a moment a great dismay take hold upon she -- for she understand not how it be that the bond of silence should bind she and that she should be unable to put forth she hand to help he whom she hear moan and murmur but could not see and scarcely could she foot keep hold of the awful rock or she form resist the upward sweep of the wind but though he see she not nor she he yet could not she leave he in he weakness and misery say to herself that even if she could do nothing it must be well that a little love should be near then she hear he speak again crouch under the rock at she foot and he say faintly to himself ` that be no dream in the land of darkness there be no dream nor voice that speak within we on the earth they be never silent struggle and cry but there -- all blank and still therefore it be no dream it be one who come and look I in the face and love be in he eye i have not see love oh for so long but it be no dream if god be a dream i know not but love i know and he say to I arise and go but to whom must i go the word be word that once i know and the face i know but to whom to whom ' the little pilgrim cry aloud so that she think the rock must be rent by the vehemence of she cry call like the other ` father father father ' as if she heart would burst and it be like despair to think that she make no sound and that the brother could not hear she who lay thus faint at she foot yet she could not stop but go on cry like a child that have lose its way for to whom could a child call but to she father and all the more when she can not understand and she call out and say that god be not he name save to stranger if there be any stranger but that he name be father and it be to he that all must go and all she being thrill like a bird with its song so that the very air stir yet no voice come and she lift up she face to the watcher above and behold where she stand hold up she hand a little whiteness in the great dark but though these two be call and call the silence be dumb and neither of they could take he by the hand nor lift he up nor show he far far above the little diamond of the light but be constrain to stand still and watch see that he be one of those who be beyond hope after she have wait a long time he stir again in the dark and murmur to himself once more say low ' i have sleep and be strong and while i be sleep he have come again he have look at I again and somewhere i will find he i will arise and go i will arise and go -- ' and she hear he move at she foot and grope over the rock with he hand but it be smooth as snow with no holding and slippery as ice and the watcher stand above and the pilgrim below but could not help he he grope and grope and murmur to himself ever say ' i will arise and go ' and they heart be wring that they could not speak to he nor touch he nor help he but at last in the dark there burst forth a great cry ` who say it ' and then a sound of weep and amid the weep word ` as when i be a child as when hope be -- i will arise and i will go -- to my father to my father for now i remember and i know ' the little pilgrim sink down into a crevice of the rock in the weakness of she great joy and something pass she mount up and up and it seem to she that he have touch she shoulder or she hand unaware and that the dumb cry in she heart have reach he and that it have be good for he that a little love stand by though only to watch and to weep and she listen and hear he go on and on and she herself ascend higher to the watch-tower and the watcher be go who have wait there for she beloved for she have go with he as the lord have promise she to be the one who should lead he to the holy city and to see the father 's face and it be give to the little pilgrim to sound the silver bell and to warn all the band of the bless and the great angel and lord of the whole world that from out the land of darkness and from the region beyond hope another have come she remain not there long because there be many who seek that place that they might be the first to see if one beloved be among the traveller by that terrible way and to welcome the brother or sister who be the most dear to they of all the child of the father but it be thus that she learn the last lesson of all that be in heaven and that be in earth and in the height above and in the depths below which the great angel desire to look into and all the prince and power and it be this : that there be that which be beyond hope yet not beyond love and that hope may fail and be no longer possible but love can not fail -- for hope be of man but love be the lord and there be but one thing which to he be not possible which be to forget and that even when the father have hide he face and help be forbid yet there go he secretly and can not forbear but if there be any deep more profound and to which access be not either from the dark mountain or by any other way the pilgrim be not teach nor ever find any knowledge either among the angel who know all thing or among she brother who be the child of man iii the land of darkness i find myself stand on my foot with the tingling sensation of have come down rapidly upon the ground from a height there be a similar feeling in my head as of the whirling and sickening sensation of pass downward through the air like the description dante give of he descent upon geryon my mind curiously enough be sufficiently disengage to think of that or at least to allow swift passage for the recollection through my thought all the ache of wonder doubt and fear which i have be conscious of a little while before be go there be no distinct interval between the one condition and the other nor in my fall -lrb- as i suppose it must have be -rrb- have i any consciousness of change there be the whirling of the air resist my passage yet give way under I in giddy circle and then the sharp shock of once more feeling under my foot something solid which strike yet sustain after a little while the giddiness above and the tingle below pass away and i feel able to look about I and discern where i be but not all at once the thing immediately about I impress I first then the general aspect of the new place first of all the light which be lurid as if a thunder-storm be come on i look up involuntarily to see if it have begin to rain but there be nothing of the kind though what i see above I be a lower canopy of cloud dark threaten with a faint reddish tint diffuse upon the vaporous darkness it be however quite sufficiently clear to see everything and there be a good deal to see i be in a street of what seem a great and very populous place there be shop on either side full apparently of all sort of costly wares there be a continual current of passenger up and down on both side of the way and in the middle of the street carriage of every description humble and splendid the noise be great and ceaseless the traffic continual some of the shop be most brilliantly light attract one 's eye in the sombre light outside which however have just enough of day in it to make these spot of illumination look sickly most of the place thus distinguish be apparently bright with the electric or some other scientific light and delicate machine of every description bring to the greatest perfection be in some window as be also many fine production of art but mingle with the gaudiest and coarsest in a way which strike I with astonishment i be also much surprise by the fact that the traffic which be never still for a moment seem to have no sort of regulation some carriage dash along upset the smaller vehicle in they way without the least restraint or order either as it seem from they own good sense or from the law and custom of the place when a accident happen there be a great shouting and sometimes a furious encounter but nobody seem to interfere this be the first impression make upon I the passenger on the pavement be equally regardless i be myself push out of the way first to one side then to another hustle when i pause for a moment trodden upon and drive about i retreat soon to the doorway of a shop from whence with a little more safety i could see what be go on the noise make my head ring it seem to I that i could not hear myself think if this be to go on forever i say to myself i should soon go mad ` oh no ' say some one behind I ` not at all you will get use to it you will be glad of it one do not want to hear one 's thought most of they be not worth hear ' i turn round and see it be the master of the shop who have come to the door on see I he have the usual smile of a man who hope to sell he wares but to my horror and astonishment by some process which i could not understand i see that he be say to himself ` what a d -- d fool here be another of those curse wretch d -- he ' all with the same smile i start back and answer he as hotly ` what do you mean by call I a d -- d fool fool yourself and all the rest of it be this the way you receive stranger here ' ` yes ' he say with the same smile ` this be the way and i only describe you as you be as you will soon see will you walk in and look over my shop perhaps you will find something to suit you if you be just set up as i suppose ' i look at he closely but this time i could not see that he be say anything beyond what be express by he lip : and i follow he into the shop principally because it be quieter than the street and without any intention of buying -- for what should i buy in a strange place where i have no settle habitation and which probably i be only pass through ' i will look at you thing ' i say in a way which i believe i have of perhaps undue pretension i have never be over-rich or of very elevated station but i be believe by my friend -lrb- or enemy -rrb- to have a inclination to make myself out something more important than i be ' i will look at you thing and possibly i may find something that may suit I but with all the _ atelier _ of pari and london to draw from it be scarcely to be expect that in a place like this -- ' here i stop to draw my breath with a good deal of confusion for i be unwilling to let he see that i do not know where i be ' a place like this ' say the shop-keeper with a little laugh which seem to I full of mockery ` will supply you better you will find than -- any other place at least you will find it the only place practicable ' he add ' i perceive you be a stranger here ' ` well i may allow myself to be so more or less i have not have time to form much acquaintance with -- the place what -- do you call the place -- its formal name i mean ' i say with a great desire to keep up the air of superior information except for the first moment i have not experience that strange power of look into the man below the surface which have frighten I now there occur another gleam of insight which give I once more a sensation of alarm i seem to see a light of hatred and contempt below he smile and i feel that he be not in the least take in by the air which i assume ` the name of the place ' he say ` be not a pretty one i hear the gentleman who come to my shop say that it be not to be name to ear polite and i be sure you ear be very polite ' he say this with the most offensive laugh and i turn upon he and answer he without mince matter with a plainness of speech which startle myself but do not seem to move he for he only laugh again ` be you not afraid ' i say ` that i will leave you shop and never enter it more ' ` oh it help to pass the time ' he say and without any further comment begin to show I very elaborate and fine article of furniture i have always be attract to this sort of thing and have long to buy such article for my house when i have one but never have it in my power now i have no house nor any means of pay so far as i know but i feel quite at my ease about buying and inquire into the price with the greatest composure ` they be just the sort of thing i want i will take these i think but you must set they aside for I for i do not at the present moment exactly know -- ' ` you mean you have get no room to put they in ' say the master of the shop ` you must get a house directly that be all if you be only up to it it be easy enough look about until you find something you like and then -- take possession ' ` take possession ' -- i be so much surprised that i stare at he with mingled indignation and surprise -- ` of what belong to another man ' i say i be not conscious of anything ridiculous in my look i be indignant which be not a state of mind in which there be any absurdity but the shop-keeper suddenly burst into a storm of laughter he laugh till he seem almost to fall into convulsion with a harsh mirth which remind I of the old image of the crackling of thorn and have neither amusement nor warmth in it and presently this be echo all around and look up i see grin face full of derision bent upon I from every side from the stair which lead to the upper part of the house and from the depths of the shop behind -- face with pen behind they ear face in workman 's cap all distend from ear to ear with a sneer and a mock and a rage of laughter which nearly send I mad i hurl i do not know what imprecation at they as i rush out stop my ear in a paroxysm of fury and mortification my mind be so distract by this occurrence that i rush without know it upon some one who be pass and throw he down with the violence of my exit upon which i be set on by a party of half a dozen ruffian apparently he companion who would i think kill I but who only fling I wound bleeding and feeling as if every bone in my body have be break down on the pavement when they go away laugh too i pick myself up from the edge of the causeway ache and sore from head to foot scarcely able to move yet conscious that if i do not get myself out of the way one or other of the vehicle which be dash along would run over I it would be impossible to describe the miserable sensation both of body and mind with which i drag myself across the crowded pavement not without curse and even kick from the passer-by and avoid the shop from which i still hear those shriek of devilish laughter gather myself up in the shelter of a little projection of a wall where i be for the moment safe the pain which i feel be as nothing to the sense of humiliation the mortification the rage with which i be possess there be nothing in existence more dreadful than rage which be impotent which can not punish or avenge which have to restrain itself and put up with insult shower upon it i have never know before what that helpless hideous exasperation be and i be humiliate beyond description bring down -- i whose inclination it be to make more of myself than be justifiable -- to the aspect of a miserable ruffian beat in a brawl soil cover with mud and dust my clothes tear my face bruise and disfigure -- all this within half a hour or there about of my arrival in a strange place where nobody know I or could do I justice i keep look out feverishly for some one with a air of authority to whom i could appeal sooner or later somebody must go by who see I in such a plight must inquire how it come about must help I and vindicate I i sit there for i can not tell how long expect every moment that be it but a policeman somebody would notice and help I but no one come crowd seem to sweep by without a pause -- all hurry restless some with anxious face as if any delay would be mortal some in noisy group intercept the passage of the other sometimes one would pause to point I out to he comrade with a shout of derision at my miserable plight or if by a change of posture i get outside the protection of my wall would kick I back with a coarse injunction to keep out of the way no one be sorry for I not a look of compassion not a word of inquiry be waste upon I no representative of authority appear i see a dozen quarrel while i lay there cry of the weak and triumphant shout of the strong but that be all i be draw after a while from the fierce and burn sense of my own grievance by a querulous voice quite close to I ` this be my corner ' it say ` i have sit here for year and i have a right to it and here you come you big ruffian because you know i have not get the strength to push you away ' ` who be you ' i say turn round horror-stricken for close beside I be a miserable man apparently in the last stage of disease he be pale as death yet eat up with sore he body be agitate by a nervous tremble he seem to shuffle along on hand and foot as though the ordinary mode of locomotion be impossible to he and yet be in possession of all he limb pain be write in he face i draw away to leave he room with mingled pity and horror that this poor wretch should be the partner of the only shelter i could find within so short a time of my arrival i who -- it be horrible shameful humiliating and yet the suffering in he wretched face be so evident that i could not but feel a pang of pity too ' i have nowhere to go ' i say ' i be -- a stranger i have be badly use and nobody seem to care ' ` no ' he say ` nobody care do not you look for that why should they why you look as if you be sorry for _ I _ what a joke ' he murmur to himself -- ` what a joke sorry for some one else what a fool the fellow must be ' ` you look ' i say ` as if you be suffer horribly and you say you have come here for year ' ` suffering i should think i be ' say the sick man ` but what be that to you yes i have be here for year -- oh year that mean nothing -- for longer than can be count suffering be not the word it be torture it be agony but who care take you leg out of my way ' i draw myself out of he way from a sort of habit though against my will and ask from habit too ` be you never any better than now ' he look at I more closely and a air of astonishment come over he face ` what d'ye want here ' he say ` pity a man that be something new here no i be not always so bad if you want to know i get better and then i go and do what make I bad again and that be how it will go on and i choose it to be so and you need not bring any of you d -- d pity here ' ' i may ask at least why be not you look after why do not you get into some hospital ' i say ` hospital ' cry the sick man and then he too burst out into that furious laugh the most awful sound i ever have hear some of the passer-by stop to hear what the joke be and surround I with once more a circle of mocker ` hospital perhaps you would like a whole red cross society with ambulance and all arrange ' cry one ` or the _ misericordium _ ' shout another i spring up to my foot cry ` why not ' with a impulse of rage which give I strength be i never to meet with anything but this fiendish laughter ` there be some authority i suppose ' i cry in my fury ` it be not the rabble that be the only master here i hope ' but nobody take the least trouble to hear what i have to say for myself the last speaker strike I on the mouth and call I a accursed fool for talking of what i do not understand and finally they all sweep on and pass away i have be as i think severely injure when i drag myself into that corner to save myself from the crowd but i spring up now as if nothing have happen to I my wound have disappear my bruise be go i be as i have be when i drop giddy and amaze upon the same pavement how long -- a hour -- before it might have be a hour it might have be a year i can not tell the light be the same as ever the thunderous atmosphere unchanged day if it be day have make no progress night if it be evening have come no nearer -- all be the same as i go on again presently with a vex and angry spirit regard on every side around I the endless surge of the crowd and feel a loneliness a sense of total abandonment and solitude which i can not describe there come up to I a man of remarkable appearance that he be a person of importance of great knowledge and information could not be doubt he be very pale and of a worn but commanding aspect the line of he face be deeply draw he eye be sink under high arched brow from which they look out as from cave full of a fiery impatient light he thin lip be never quite without a smile but it be not a smile in which any pleasure be he walk slowly not hurry like most of the passenger he have a reflective look as if ponder many thing he come up to I suddenly without introduction or preliminary and take I by the arm ` what object have you in talk of these antiquated institution ' he say and i saw in he mind the gleam of the thought which seem to be the first with all that i be a fool and that it be the natural thing to wish I harm just as in the earth above it be the natural thing profess at least to wish well -- to say good-morning good-day by habit and without think in this strange country the stranger be receive with a curse and it wake a answer not unlike the hasty ` curse you then also ' which seem to come without any will of mine through my mind but this provoke only a smile from my new friend he take no notice he be dispose to examine I to find some amusement perhaps -- how could i tell -- in what i might say ` what antiquated thing ' ` be you still so slow of understand what be they -- hospital the pretence of a world that can still deceive itself do you expect to find they here ' ' i expect to find -- how should i know ' i say bewilder -- ` some shelter for a poor wretch where he could be care for not to be leave there to die in the street expect i never think i take it for grant -- ' ` to die in the street ' he cry with a smile and a shrug of he shoulder ` you 'll learn better by and by and if he do die in the street what then what be that to you ' ` to I ' i turn and look at he amaze but he have somehow shut he soul so that i could see nothing but the deep eye in they cave and the smile upon the close-shut mouth ` no more to I than to any one i only speak for humanity 's sake as -- a fellow-creature ' my new acquaintance give way to a silent laugh within himself which be not so offensive as the loud laugh of the crowd but yet be more exasperating than word can say ` you think that matter but it do not hurt you that he should he in pain it would do you no good if he be to get well why should you trouble yourself one way or the other let he die -- if he can -- that make no difference to you or I ' ' i must be dull indeed ' i cry -- ` slow of understanding as you say this be go back to the idea of time beyond knowledge -- before christianity -- ' as soon as i have say this i feel somehow -- i could not tell how -- as if my voice jar as if something false and unnatural be in what i say my companion give my arm a twist as if with a shock of surprise then laugh in he inward way again ` we do not think much of that here nor of you modern pretence in general the only thing that touch you and I be what hurt or help ourselves to be sure it all come to the same thing -- for i suppose it annoy you to see that wretch writhe it hurt you more delicate highly-cultivated consciousness ' ` it have nothing to do with my consciousness ' i cry angrily ` it be a shame to let a fellow-creature suffer if we can prevent it ' ` why should not he suffer ' say my companion we pass as he speak some other squalid wretched creature shuffling among the crowd whom he kick with he foot call forth a yell of pain and curse this he regard with a supreme contemptuous calm which stupefy I nor do any of the passer-by show the slightest inclination to take the part of the sufferer they laugh or shout out a gibe or what be still more wonderful go on with a complete unaffected indifference as if all this be natural i try to disengage my arm in horror and dismay but he hold I fast with a pressure that hurt I ` that be the question ' he say ` what have we to do with it you fictitious consciousness make it painful to you to I on the contrary who take the view of nature it be a pleasurable feeling it enhance the amount of ease whatever that may be which i enjoy i be in no pain that brute who be ' -- and he flick with a stick he carry the uncovered wound of a wretch upon the roadside -- ` make I more satisfied with my condition ah you think it be i who be the brute you will change you mind by and by ' ` never ' i cry wrenching my arm from he with a effort ` if i should live a hundred year ' ' a hundred year -- a drop in the bucket ' he say with he silent laugh ` you will live forever and you will come to my view and we shall meet in the course of age from time to time to compare note i would say good-by after the old fashion but you be but newly arrive and i will not treat you so badly as that ' with which he part from I wave he hand with he everlasting horrible smile ` good-by ' i say to myself ` good-by why should it be treat I badly to say good-by -- ' i be startle by a buffet on the mouth ` take that ' cry some one ` to teach you how to wish the worst of torture to people who have do you no harm ' ` what have i say i mean no harm i repeat only what be the commonest civility the merest good manners ' ` you wish ' say the man who have strike I -- ' i will not repeat the word : to I for it be i only that hear they the awful company that hurt most that set everything before we both past and to come and cut like a sword and burn like fire i 'll say it to yourself and see how it feel god be with you there it be say and we all must bear it thanks you fool and accurse to you ' and then there come a pause over all the place a awful stillness -- hundred of man and woman stand clutch with desperate movement at they heart as if to tear they out move they head as if to dash they against the wall wring they hand with a look upon all they convulse face which i can never forget they all turn to I cursing I with those horrible eye of anguish and everything be still the noise all stop for a moment the air all silent with a silence that could be feel and then suddenly out of the crowd there come a great piercing cry and everything begin again exactly as before while this pause occur and while i stand wonder bewildered understanding nothing there come over I a darkness a blackness a sense of misery such as never in all my life -- though i have know trouble enough -- i have feel before all that have happen to I throughout my existence seem to rise pale and terrible in a hundred scene before I -- all momentary intense as if each be the present moment and in each of these scene i see what i have never see before i see where i have take the wrong instead of the right step in what wantonness with what self-will it have be do how god -lrb- i shudder at the name -rrb- have speak and call I and even entreated and i have withstand and refuse all the evil i have do come back and spread itself out before my eye and i loathe it yet know that i have choose it and that it would be with I forever i see it all in the twinkling of a eye in a moment while i stand there and all man with I in the horror of awful thought then it cease as it have come instantaneously and the noise and the laughter and the quarrel and cry and all the commotion of this new bewildering place in a moment begin again i have see no one while this strange paroxysm last when it disappear i come to myself emerge as from a dream and look into the face of the man whose word not careless like mine have bring it upon we we eye meet and he be surround by curve and line of anguish which be terrible to see ` well ' he say with a short laugh which be force and harsh ` how do you like it that be what happen when -- if it come often who could endure it ' he be not like the rest there be no sneer upon he face no gibe at my simplicity even now when all have recover he be still quiver with something that look like a nobler pain he face be very grave the line deeply draw in it and he seem to be seek no amusement or distraction nor to take any part in the noise and tumult which be go on around ` do you know what that cry mean ' he say ` do you hear that cry it be some one who see -- even here once in a long time they say it can be see -- ' ` what can be see ' he shake he head look at I with a meaning which i could not interpret it be beyond the range of my thought i come to know after or i never could have make this record but on that subject he say no more he turn the way i be go though it matter nothing what way i go for all be the same to I ` you be one of the new-comer ' he say ` you have not be long here -- ' ` tell I ' i cry ` what you mean by _ here _ where be we how can one tell who have fall -- he know not whence or where what be this place i have never see anything like it it seem to I that i hate it already though i know not what it be ' he shake he head once more ` you will hate it more and more ' he say ` but of these dreadful street you will never be free unless -- ' and here he stop again ` unless -- what if it be possible i will be free of they and that before long ' he smile at I faintly as we smile at child but not with derision ` how shall you do that between this miserable world and all other there be a great gulf fix it be full of all the bitterness and tear that come from all the universe these drop from they but stagnate here we you perceive have no tear not even at moment -- ' then ` you will soon be accustom to all this ' he say ` you will fall into the way perhaps you will be able to amuse yourself to make it passable many do there be a number of fine thing to be see here if you be curious come with I and i will show you or work -- there be even work there be only one thing that be impossible or if not impossible -- ' and here he pause again and raise he eye to the dark cloud and lurid sky overhead ` the man who give that cry if i could but find he he must have see -- ' ` what could he see ' i ask but there arise in my mind something like contempt a visionary who could not speak plainly who break off into mysterious inference and appear to know more than he would say it seem foolish to waste time when evidently there be still so much to see in the company of such a man and i begin already to feel more at home there be something in that moment of anguish which have work a strange familiarity in I with my surroundings it be so great a relief to return out of the misery of that sharp and horrible self-realization to what have come to be in comparison easy and well known i have no desire to go back and grope among the mystery and anguish so suddenly reveal i be glad to be free from they to be leave to myself to get a little pleasure perhaps like the other while these thought pass through my mind i have go on without any active impulse of my own as everybody else do and my latest companion have disappear he see no doubt without any need for word what my feeling be and i proceed on my way i feel better as i get more accustomed to the place or perhaps it be the sensation of relief after that moment of indescribable pain as for the sight in the street i begin to grow use to they the wretched creature who stroll or sit about with sign of sickness or wound upon they disgust I only they no longer call forth my pity i begin to feel ashamed of my silly question about the hospital all the same it would have be a good thing to have have some receptacle for they into which they might have be drive out of the way i feel a inclination to push they aside as i see other people do but be a little ashamed of that impulse too and so i go on there seem no quiet street so far as i could make out in the place some be smaller meaner with a different kind of passenger but the same hubbub and unresting movement everywhere i see no sign of melancholy or seriousness active pain violence brutality the continual shock of quarrel and blow but no pensive face about no sorrowfulness nor the kind of trouble which bring think everybody be fully occupy push on as if in a race pause for nothing the glitter of the light the shout and sound of continual go the endless whirl of passer-by confuse and tire I after a while i go as far out as i could go to what seem the out-skirt of the place where i could by glimpse perceive a low horizon all lurid and glowing which seem to sweep round and round against it in the distance stand up the outline black against that red glow of other tower and house-top so many and great that there be evidently another town between we and the sunset if sunset it be i have see a western sky like it when there be storm about and all the color of the sky be heighten and darken by angry influence the distant town rise against it cut the firmament so that it might have be tongue of flame flickering between the dark solid outline and across the waste open country which lay between the two city there come a distant hum like the sound of the sea which be in reality the roar of that other multitude the country between show no greenness or beauty it lay dark under the dark overhang sky here and there seem a cluster of giant tree scathe as if by lightning they bare bough stand up as high as the distant tower they trunk like black column without foliage opening here and there with glimmer light look like the mouth of mine but of passenger there be scarcely any a figure here and there fly along as if pursue imperfectly see a shadow only a little darker than the space about and in contrast with the sound of the city here be no sound at all except the low roar on either side and a vague cry or two from the opening of the mine -- a scene all draw in darkness in variation of gloom derive scarcely any light at all from the red and gloomy burning of that distant evening sky a faint curiosity to go forwards to see what the mine be perhaps to get a share in what be bring up from they cross my mind but i be afraid of the dark of the wild uninhabited savage look of the landscape though when i thought of it there seem no reason why a narrow stretch of country between two great town should be alarming but the impression be strong and above reason i turn back to the street in which i have first alight and which seem to end in a great square full of people in the middle there be a stage erect from which some one be deliver a oration or address of some sort he stand beside a long table upon which lay something which i could not clearly distinguish except that it seem alive and move or rather writhe with convulsive twitching as if try to get free of the bond which confine it round the stage in front be a number of seat occupy by listener many of whom be woman whose interest seem to be very great some of they be furnish with note-book while a great unsettled crowd come and go drift round -- many arrest for a time as they pass proceed on they way when the interest flag as be usual to such open-air assembly i follow two of those who push they way to within a short distance of the stage and who be strong big man more fit to elbow the crowd aside than i after my rough treatment in the first place and the agitation i have pass through could be i be glad besides to take advantage of the explanation which one be give to the other ` it be always fun to see this fellow demonstrate ' he say ` and the subject to-day 's a capital one let 's get well forward and see all that be go on ' ` which subject do you mean ' say the other ` the theme or the example ' and they both laugh though i do not seize the point of the wit ` well both ' say the first speaker ` the theme be nerve and as a lesson in construction and the calculation of possibility it be fine he be very clever at that he show how they be all string to give as much pain and do as much harm as can be and yet how well it be all manage do not you know to look the reverse as for the example he be a capital one -- all nerve together lie if you like just on the surface ready for the knife ' ` if they be on the surface i can not see where the fun be ' say the other ` metaphorically speak of course they be just where other people 's nerve be but he be what you call a highly organize nervous specimen there will be plenty of fun hush he be just go to begin ' ` the arrangement of these thread of be ' say the lecturer evidently resume after a pause ` so as to convey to the brain the most instantaneous message of pain or pleasure be wonderfully skilful and clever i need not say to the audience before I enlighten as it be by experience of the most striking kind that the message be less of pleasure than of pain they report to the brain the stroke of injury far more often than the thrill of pleasure though sometimes that too no doubt or life could scarcely be maintain the power that be have find it necessary to mingle a little sweet of pleasurable sensation else we miserable race would certainly have find some means of procure annihilation i do not for a moment pretend to say that the pleasure be sufficient to offer a just counterbalance to the other none of my hearer will i hope accuse I of inconsistency i be ready to allow that in a previous condition i assert somewhat strongly that this be the case but experience have enlighten we on that point we circumstance be now understand by we all in a manner impossible while we be still in a condition of incompleteness we be all convinced that there be no compensation the pride of the position of bear everything rather than give in or make a submission we do not feel of preserve we own will and individuality to all eternity be the only compensation i be satisfy with it for my part ' the orator make a pause hold he head high and there be a certain amount of applause the two man before I cheer vociferously ` that be the right way to look at it ' one of they say my eye be upon they with no particular motive and i could not help start as i see suddenly underneath they applause and laughter a snarl of cursing which be the real expression of they thought i feel disposed in the same way to curse the speaker though i know no reason why he go on a little farther explain what he mean to do and then turn round approach the table a assistant who be wait uncovered it quickly the audience stir with quicken interest and i with consternation make a step forwards cry out with horror the object on the table writhe twitch to get free but bind down by every limb be a living man the lecturer go forwards calmly take he instrument from they case with perfect composure and coolness ` now lady and gentleman ' he say and insert the knife in the flesh make a long clear cut in the bind arm i shriek out unable to restrain myself the sight of the deliberate wound the blood the cry of agony that come from the victim the calmness of all the lookers-on fill I with horror and rage indescribable i feel myself clear the crowd away with a rush and spring on the platform i could not tell how ` you devil ' i cry ` let the man go where be the police where be a magistrate let the man go this moment fiend in human shape i 'll have you bring to justice ' i hear myself shout wildly as i flung myself upon the wretched sufferer interpose between he and the knife it be something like this that i say my horror and rage be delirious and carry I beyond all attempt at control through it all i hear a shout of laughter rise from everybody round the lecturer laugh the audience roar with that sound of horrible mockery which have drive I out of myself in my first experience all kind of mock cry sound around I ` let he a little blood to calm he down ' ` let the fool have a taste of it himself doctor ' last of all come a voice mingle with the cry of the sufferer whom i be try to shield ` take he instead curse he take he instead ' i be bend over the man with my arm outstretch protect he when he give vent to this cry and i hear immediately behind I a shout of assent which seem to come from the two strong young man with whom i have be stand and the sound of a rush to seize I i look round half mad with terror and rage a second more and i should have be strap on the table too i make one wild bind into the midst of the crowd and struggle among the arm stretch out to catch I amid the roar of the laughter and cry -- flee -- flee wildly i know not whither in panic and rage and horror which no word could describe terror wing my foot i fly think as little of whom i meet or knock down or tread upon in my way as the other do at whom i have wonder a little while ago no distinct impression of this headlong course remain in my mind save the sensation of mad fear such as i have never feel before i come to myself on the edge of the dark valley which surround the town all my pursuer have drop off before that time and i have the recollection of fling myself upon the ground on my face in the extremity of fatigue and exhaustion i must have lie there undisturbed for some time a few step come and go pass I but no one take any notice and the absence of the noise and crowd give I a momentary respite but in my heat and fever i get no relief of coolness from the contact of the soil i might have fling myself upon a bed of hot ash so much be it unlike the dewy cool earth which i expect upon which one can always throw one 's self with a sensation of repose presently the uneasiness of it make I struggle up again and look around I i be safe at least the cry of the pursuer have die away the laughter which make my blood boil offend my ear no more the noise of the city be behind I soften into a indefinite roar by distance and before I stretch out the dreary landscape in which there seem no feature of attraction now that i be nearer to it i find it not so unpeopled as i think at no great distance from I be the mouth of one of the mine from which come a indication of subterranean light and i perceive that the fly figure which i have take for traveller between one city and another be in reality wayfarer endeavor to keep clear of what seem a sort of press-gang at the opening one of they unable to stop himself in he flight adopt the same expedient as myself and throw himself on the ground close to I when he have get beyond the range of pursuit it be curious that we should meet there he fly from a danger which i be about to face and ready to encounter that from which i have flee i wait for a few minute till he have recover he breath and then ` what be you run from ' i say ` be there any danger there ' the man look up at I with the same continual question in he eye -- who be this fool ` danger ' he say ` be you so new here or such a cursed idiot as not to know the danger of the mine you be go across yourself i suppose and then you 'll see ' ` but tell I ' i say ` my experience may be of use to you afterwards if you will tell I yours now ' ` of use ' he cry stare ` who care find out for yourself if they get hold of you you will soon understand ' i no longer take this for rudeness but answer in he own way cursing he too for a fool ` if i ask a warning i can give one as for kindness ' i say ' i be not look for that ' at this he laugh indeed we laugh together -- there seem something ridiculous in the thought and presently he tell I for the mere relief of talk that round each of these pit-mouth there be a band to entrap every passer-by who allow himself to be catch and send he down below to work in the mine ` once there there be no tell when you may get free ' he say ` one time or other most people have a taste of it you do not know what hard labor be if you have never be there i have a spell once there be neither air nor light you blood boil in you vein from the fervent heat you be never allow to rest you be put in every kind of contortion to get at it you limb twist and you muscle strain ' ` for what ' i say ` for gold ' he cry with a flash in he eye -- ` gold there it be inexhaustible however hard you may work there be always more and more ' ` and to whom do all that belong ' i say ` to whoever be strong enough to get hold and keep possession -- sometimes one sometimes another the only thing you be sure of be that it will never be you ' why not i as well as another be the thought that go through my mind and my new companion spy it with a shriek of derision ` it be not for you nor you kind ' he cry ` how do you think you could force other people to serve _ you _ can you terrify they or hurt they or give they anything you have not learn yet who be the master here ' this trouble I for it be true ' i have begin to think ' i say ` that there be no authority at all -- for every man seem to do as he please you ride over one and knock another down or you seize a living man and cut he to piece ' -- i shudder as i thought of it -- ` and there be nobody to interfere ' ` who should interfere ' he say ` why should not every man amuse himself as he can but yet for all that we have get we master ' he cry with a scowl wave he clinched fist in the direction of the mine ` you 'll find it out when you get there ' it be a long time after this before i ventured to move for here it seem to I that for the moment i be safe -- outside the city yet not within reach of the danger of that intermediate space which grow clearer before I as my eye become accustomed to the lurid threatening afternoon light one after another the fugitive come fly past I -- people who have escape from the armed band whom i could now see on the watch near the pit 's mouth i could see too the tactic of these band -- how they retire veil the light and the opening when a greater number than usual of traveller appear on the way and then suddenly widen out throw out flanking line surround and draw in the unwary i could even hear the cry with which they victim disappear over the opening which seem to go down into the bowels of the earth by and by there come fly towards I a wretch more dreadful in aspect than any i have see he scanty clothes seem singe and burn into rag he hair which hang about he face unkempt and uncared for have the same singed aspect he skin be brown and baked i get up as he approach and catch he and throw he to the ground without heed he struggle to get on ` do not you see ' he cry with a gasp ` they may get I again ' he be one of those who have escape out of the mine but what be it to I whether they catch he again or not i want to know how he have be catch and what he have be set to do and how he have escape why should i hesitate to use my superior strength when no one else do i keep watch over he that he should not get away ` you have be in the mine ' i say ` let I go ' he cry ` do you need to ask ' and he curse I as he struggle with the most terrible imprecation ` they may get I yet let I go ' ` not till you tell I ' i cry ` tell I and i 'll protect you if they come near i 'll let you go who be they man i must know ' he struggle up from the ground clear he hot eye from the ash that be in they and put aside he singed hair he give I a glance of hatred and impotent resistance -lrb- for i be stronger than he -rrb- and then cast a wild terrify look back the skirmisher do not seem to remark that anybody have escape and he become gradually a little more compose ` who be they ' he say hoarsely ` they be curse wretch like you and I and there be as many band of they as there be mine on the road and you would better turn back and stay where you be you be safe here ' ' i will not turn back ' i say ' i know well enough : you can not you have get to go the round like the rest ' he say with a laugh which be like a sound utter by a wild animal rather than a human voice the man be in my power and i strike he miserable as he be it seem a relief thus to get rid of some of the fury in my mind ` it be a lie ' i say ' i go because i please why should not i gather a band of my own if i please and fight those brute not fly from they like you ' he chuckle and laugh below he breath struggle and cursing and cry out as i strike he again ` you gather a band what could you offer they where would you find they be you better than the rest of we be you not a man like the rest strike I you can for i be down but make yourself a master and a chief -- you ' ` why not i ' i shout again wild with rage and the sense that i have no power over he save to hurt he that passion make my hand tremble he slip from I in a moment bound from the ground like a ball and with a yell of derision escape and plunge into the street and the clamor of the city from which i have just fly i feel myself rage after he shake my fist with a consciousness of the ridiculous passion of impotence that be in I but no power of restrain it and there be not one of the fugitive who pass however desperate he might be who do not make a mock at I as he dart by the laughing-stock of all those miserable object the sport of fate afraid to go forwards unable to go back with a fire in my vein urge I on but presently i grow a little calmer out of mere exhaustion which be all the relief that be possible to I and by and by collect all my faculty and impel by this impulse which i seem unable to resist i get up and go cautiously on fear can act in two way : it paralyze and it render cunning at this moment i find it inspire I i make my plan before i start how to steal along under the cover of the blighted brushwood which break the line of the valley here and there i set out only after long thought seize the moment when the vaguely perceive band be scour in the other direction intercept the traveller thus with many pause i get near to the pit 's mouth in safety but my curiosity be as great as almost greater than my terror i have keep far from the road drag myself sometimes on hand and foot over broken ground tear my clothes and my flesh upon the thorn and on that farther side all seem so silent and so dark in the shadow cast by some disused machinery behind which the glare of the fire from below blaze upon the other side of the opening that i could not crawl along in the darkness and pass which would have be the safe way but with a breathless hot desire to see and know drag myself to the very edge to look down though i be in the shadow my eye be nearly put out by the glare on which i gaze it be not fire it be the lurid glow of the gold glowing like flame at which countless miner be work they be all about like fly -- some on they knee some bent double as they stoop over they work some lie cramped upon shelf and ledge the sight be wonderful and terrible beyond description the workman seem to consume away with the heat and the glow even in the few minute i gaze they eye shrink into they head they face blacken i could see some try to secret morsel of the glowing metal which burn whatever it touch and some who be be search by the superior of the mine and some who be punish the offender fix they up against the blaze wall of gold the fear go out of my mind so much absorb be i in this sight i gaze see farther and farther every moment into crevice and seam of the glowing metal always with more and more slave at work and the entire pantomime of labor and theft and search and punishment go on and on -- the baked face dark against the golden glare the hot eye take a yellow reflection the monotonous clamor of pick and shovel and cry and curse and all the indistinguishable sound of a multitude of human creature and the floor below and the low roof which overhung whole myriad within a few inch of they face and the irregular wall all breach and shelve be every one the same a pandemonium of gold -- gold everywhere i have love many foolish thing in my life but never this which be perhaps why i gaze and keep my sight though there rise out of it a blast of heat which scorch the brain while i stooped over intent on the sight some one who have come up by my side to gaze too be catch by the fume -lrb- as i suppose -rrb- for suddenly i be aware of a dark object fall prone into the glowing interior with a cry and crash which bring back my first wild panic he fall in a heap from which he arm shot forth wildly as he reach the bottom and he cry be half anguish yet half desire i see he seize by half a dozen eager watcher and pitch upon a ledge just under the roof and tool thrust into he hand i hold on by a old shaft tremble unable to move perhaps i cry too in my horror -- for one of the overseer who stand in the center of the glare look up he have the air of order all that be go on and stand unaffected by the blaze command the other wretched official who obey he like dog he seem to I in my terror like a figure of gold the image perhaps of wealth or pluto or i know not what for i suppose my brain begin to grow confused and my hold on the shaft to relax i have strength enough however -lrb- for i care not for the gold -rrb- to fling myself back the other way upon the ground where i roll backwards downwards i know not how turn over and over upon sharp ash and metallic edge which tear my hair and beard -- and for a moment i know no more this fall save I i come to myself after a time and hear the press-gang search about i have sense to lie still among the ash throw up out of the pit while i hear they voice once i give myself up for lose the glitter of a lantern flash in my eye a foot pass crash among the ash so close to my cheek that the shoe graze it i find the mark after burn upon my flesh but i escape notice by a miracle and presently i be able to drag myself up and crawl away but how i reach the end of the valley i can not tell i push my way along mechanically on the dark side i have no further desire to see what be go on in the opening of the mine i go on stumble and stupid scarcely capable even of fear conscious only of wretchedness and weariness till at last i feel myself drop across the road within the gateway of the other town and lay there with no thought of anything but the relief of be at rest when i come to myself it seem to I that there be a change in the atmosphere and the light it be less lurid paler gray more like twilight than the stormy afternoon of the other city a certain dead serenity be in the sky -- black paleness whiteness everything faint in it this town be walled but the gate stand open and i see no defence of troops or other guardian i find myself lie across the threshold but push to one side so that the carriage which go and come should not be stop or i injure by they passage it seem to I that there be some thoughtfulness and kindness in this action and my heart spring up in a reaction of hope i look back as if upon a nightmare on the dreadful city which i have leave on its tumult and noise the wild racket of the street the wounded wretch who seek refuge in the corner the strife and misery that be abroad and climax of all the horrible entertainment which have be go on in the square the unhappy be strap upon the table how i say to myself could such thing be be it a dream be it a nightmare be it something present to I in a vision -- a strong delusion to make I think that the old fable which have be tell concern the end of mortal life be true when i look back it appear like a allegory so that i might have see it in a dream and still more like a allegory be the gold mine in the valley and the myriad who labor there be it all true or only a reflection from the old life mingle with the strange novelty which would most likely elude understanding on the entrance into this new i sit within the shelter of the gateway on my awakening and think over all this my heart be calm -- almost in the revulsion from the terror i have be through happy i persuade myself that i be but now begin that there have be no reality in these latter experience only a curious succession of nightmare such as might so well be suppose to follow a wonderful transformation like that which must take place between we mortal life and -- the world to come the world to come i pause and think of it all until the heart begin to beat loud in my breast what be this where i lay another world -- a world which be not happiness not bliss oh no perhaps there be no world of bliss save in dream this on the other hand i say to myself be not misery for be not i seat here with a certain tremulousness about I it be true after all the experience which suppose they even to have be but dream i have come through -- a tremulousness very comprehensible and not at all without hope i will not say that i believe even what i try to think something in I lay like a dark shadow in the midst of all my theory but yet i succeed to a great degree in convincing myself that the hope in I be real and that i be but now begin -- begin with at least a possibility that all might be well in this half conviction and after all the trouble that be over -lrb- even though they might only have be imaginary trouble -rrb- i feel a certain sweetness in rest there within the gateway with my back against it i be unwilling to get up again and bring myself in contact with reality i feel that there be pleasure in be leave alone carriage roll past I occasionally and now and then some people on foot but they do not kick I out of the way or interfere with my repose presently as i sit try to persuade myself to rise and pursue my way two man come up to I in a sort of uniform i recognize with another distinct sensation of pleasure that here be people who have authority representative of some kind of government they come up to I and bid I come with they in tone which be peremptory enough but what of that -- better the most peremptory supervision than the lawlessness from which i have come they raise I from the ground with a touch for i could not resist they and lead I quickly along the street into which that gateway give access which be a handsome street with tall house on either side group of people be move about along the pavement talk now and then with considerable animation but when my companion be see there be a immediate moderation of tone a sort of respect which look like fear there be no brawling nor tumult of any kind in the street the only incident that occur be this : when we have go some way i see a lame man drag himself along with difficulty on the other side of the street my conductor have no sooner perceive he than they give each other a look and dart across convey I with they by a sweep of magnetic influence i think that prevent I from stay behind he make a attempt with he crutch to get out of the way hurry on -- and i will allow that this attempt of he seem to I very grotesque so that i could scarcely help laugh the other lookers-on in the street laugh too though some put on a aspect of disgust ` look the tortoise ' some one say ` do he think he can go quicker than the orderly ' my companion come up to the man while this commentary be go on and seize he by each arm ` where be you go where have you come from how dare you make a exhibition of yourself ' they cry they take the crutch from he as they speak and throw they away and drag he on until we reach a great grated door which one of they open with a key while the other hold the offender -lrb- for he seem a offender -rrb- roughly up by one shoulder cause he great pain when the door be open i see a number of people within who seem to crowd to the door as if seek to get out but this be not at all what be intend my second companion drag the lame man forwards and push he in with so much violence that i could see he fall forwards on he face on the floor then the other lock the door and we proceed on we way it be not till some time later that i understand why in the mean time i be hurry on meet a great many people who take no notice of I to a central building in the middle of the town where i be bring before a official attend by clerk with great book spread out before he here i be question as to my name and my antecedent and the time of my arrival then dismiss with a nod to one of my conductor he lead I back again down the street take I into one of the tall great house open the door of a room which be number and leave I there without a word i can not convey to any one the bewildered consternation with which i feel myself deposit here and as the step of my conductor die away in the long corridor i sit down and look myself in the face as it be try to make out what it be that have happen to I the room be small and bare there be but one thing hang upon the undecorated wall and that be a long list of print regulation which i have not the courage for the moment to look at the light be indifferent though the room be high up and the street from the window look far away below i can not tell how long i sit there think and yet it could scarcely be call think i ask myself over and over again where be i be it a prison be i shut in to leave this enclosure no more what be i to do how be the time to pass i shut my eye for a moment and try to realize all that have happen to I but nothing save a whirl through my head of disconnect thought seem possible and some force be upon I to open my eye again to see the blank room the dull light the vacancy round I in which there be nothing to interest the mind nothing to please the eye -- a blank wherever i turn presently there come upon I a burning regret for everything i have leave -- for the noisy town with all its tumult and cruelty for the dark valley with all its danger everything seem bearable almost agreeable in comparison with this i seem to have be bring here to make acquaintance once more with myself to learn over again what manner of man i be needless knowledge acquaintance unnecessary unhappy for what be there in I to make I to myself a good companion never i know could i separate myself from that eternal consciousness but it be cruelty to force the contemplation upon I all blank blank around I a prison and be this to last forever i do not know how long i sit rapt in this gloomy vision but at last it occur to I to rise and try the door which to my astonishment be open i go out with a throb of new hope after all it might not be necessary to come back there might be other expedient i might fall among friend i turn down the long echo stair on which i meet various people who take no notice of I and in whom i feel no interest save a desire to avoid they and at last reach the street to be out of door in the air be something though there be no wind but a motionless still atmosphere which nothing disturb the street indeed be full of movement but not of life -- though this seem a paradox the passenger pass on they way in long regulate line -- those who go towards the gate keep rigorously to one side of the pavement those who come to the other they talk to each other here and there but whenever two man in uniform such as those who have be my conductor appear silence ensue and the wayfarer shrink even from the look of these person in authority i walk all about the spacious town everywhere there be tall house everywhere stream of people come and go but no one speak to I or remark I at all i be as lonely as if i have be in a wilderness i be indeed in a wilderness of man who be as though they do not see I pass without even a look of human fellowship each absorb in he own concern i walk and walk till my limb tremble under I from one end to another of the great street up and down and round and round but no one say how be you whence come you what be you do at length in despair i turn again to the blank and miserable room which have look to I like a cell in a prison i have wilfully make no note of its situation try to avoid rather than to find it but my step be draw thither against my will i find myself retrace my step mount the long stair pass the same people who stream along with no recognition of I as i desire nothing to do with they and at last find myself within the same four blank wall as before soon after i return i become conscious of measure step pass the door and of a eye upon I i can say no more than this from what point it be that i be inspect i can not tell but that i be inspect closely scrutinize by some one and that not only externally but by a cold observation that go through and through I i know and feel beyond any possibility of mistake this recur from time to time horribly at uncertain moment so that i never feel myself secure from it i know when the watcher be come by tremor and shivering through all my being and no sensation so unsupportable have it ever be mine to bear how much that be to say no one can tell who have not go through those region of darkness and learn what be in all they abyss i try at first to hide to fling myself on the floor to cover my face to burrow in a dark corner useless attempt the eye that look in upon I have power beyond my power i feel sometimes conscious of the derisive smile with which my miserable subterfuge be regard they be all in vain and what be still more strange be that i have not energy to think of attempt any escape my step though watch be not restrain in any way so far as i be aware the gate of the city stand open on all side free to those who go as well as to those who come but i do not think of flight of flight whence should i go from myself though that horrible inspection be from the eye of some unseen be it be in some mysterious way connect with my own thinking and reflection so that the thought come ever more and more strongly upon I that from myself i could never escape and that reflection take all energy all impulse from I i might have go away when i pleased beyond reach of the authority which regulate everything -- how one should walk where one should live -- but never from my own consciousness on the other side of the town lay a great plain traverse by road on every side there be no reason why i should not continue my journey there but i do not i have no wish nor any power in I to go away in one of my long dreary companionless walk unshared by any human fellowship i see at last a face which i remember it be that of the cynical spectator who have speak to I in the noisy street in the midst of my early experience he give a glance round he to see that there be no official in sight then leave the file in which he be walk and join I ` ah ' he say ` you be here already ' with the same derisive smile with which he have before regard I i hate the man and he sneer yet that he should speak to I be something almost a pleasure ` yes ' say i ' i be here ' then after a pause in which i do not know what to say ` it be quiet here ' i say ` quiet enough do you like it better for that to do whatever you please with no one to interfere or to do nothing you please but as you be force to do it -- which do you think be best ' i feel myself instinctively glance round as he have do to make sure that no one be in sight then i answer falter ' i have always hold that law and order be necessary thing and the lawlessness of that -- that place -- i do not know its name -- if there be such a place ' i cry ' i think it be a dream ' he laugh in he mock way ` perhaps it be all a dream who know ' he say ` sir ' say i ` you have be longer here than i -- ' ` oh ' cry he with a laugh that be dry and jar upon the air almost like a shriek ` since before you forefather be bear ' it seem to I that he speak like one who out of bitterness and despite make every darkness blacker still a kind of madman in he way for what be this claim of age -- a piece of bravado no doubt like the rest ` that be strange ' i say assent as when there be such a hallucination it be best to do ` you can tell I then whence all this authority come and why we be oblige to obey ' he look at I as if he be think in he mind how to hurt I most then with that dry laugh ` we make trial of all thing in this world ' he say ` to see if perhaps we can find something we shall like -- discipline here freedom in the other place when you have go all the round like I then perhaps you will be able to choose ' ` have you choose ' i ask he only answer with a laugh ` come ' he say ` there be amusement to be have too and that of the most elevated kind we make research here into the moral nature of man will you come but you must take the risk ' he add with a smile which afterwards i understand we go on together after this till we reach the center of the place in which stand a immense building with a dome which dominate the city and into a great hall in the center of that where a crowd of people be assemble the sound of human speech which murmur all around bring new life to my heart and as i gazed at a curious apparatus erect on a platform several people speak to I ` we have again ' say one ` the old subject to-day ' ` be it something about the constitution of the place ' i ask in the bewilderment of my mind my neighbor look at I with alarm glancing behind they to see what official might be near ` the constitution of the place be the result of the sense of the inhabitant that order must be preserve ' say the one who have speak to I first ` the lawless can find refuge in other place here we have choose to have supervision nuisance remove and order keep that be enough the constitution be not under discussion ' ` but man be ' say a second speaker ` let we keep to that in which we can mend nothing sir you may have to contribute you quota to we enlightenment we be investigate the rise of thought you be a stranger you may be able to help we ' ' i be no philosopher ' i say with a panic which i could not explain to myself ` that do not matter you be a fresh subject ' the speaker make a slight movement with he hand and i turn round to escape in wild sudden fright though i have no conception what could be do to I but the crowd have press close round I hem one in on every side i be so wildly alarm that i struggle among they push backwards with all my force and clear a space round I with my arm but my effort be vain two of the officer suddenly appear out of the crowd and seize I by the arm force I forwards the throng disperse before they on either side and i be half drag half lift up upon the platform where stand the strange apparatus which i have contemplate with a dull wonder when i come into the hall my wonder do not last long i feel myself fix in it stand support in that position by band and spring so that no effort of mine be necessary to hold myself up and none possible to release myself i be catch by every joint sustained support expose to the gaze of what seem a world of upturned face among which i see with a sneer upon it keep a little behind the crowd the face of the man who have lead I here above my head be a strong light more brilliant than anything i have ever see and which blaze upon my brain till the hair seem to singe and the skin shrink i hope i may never feel such a sensation again the pitiless light go into I like a knife but even my cry be stop by the framework in which i be bind i could breathe and suffer but that be all then some one get up on the platform above I and begin to speak he say so far as i could comprehend in the anguish and torture in which i be hold that the origin of thought be the question he be investigate but that in every previous subject the confusion of idea have bewilder they and the rapidity with which one follow another ` the present example have be find to exhibit great persistency of idea ' he say ` we hope that by he mean some clearer theory may be arrive at ' then he pull over I a great movable lens as of a microscope which concentrate the insupportable light the wild hopeless passion that rage within my soul have no outlet in the immovable apparatus that hold I i be let down among the crowd and exhibit to they every secret movement of my be by some awful process which i have never fathom a burning fire be in my brain flame seem to run along all my nerve speechless horrible incommunicable fury rage in my soul but i be like a child -- nay like a image of wood or wax -- in the pitiless hand that hold I what be the cut of a surgeon 's knife to this and i have think _ that _ cruel and i be powerless and could do nothing -- to blast to destroy to burn with this same horrible flame the fiend that surround I as i desire to do suddenly in the rage fever of my thought there surge up the recollection of that word which have paralyze all around and myself with they the thought that i must share the anguish do not restrain I from my revenge with a tremendous effort i get my voice though the instrument press upon my lip i know not what i articulate save ` god ' whether it be a curse or a blessing i have be swing out into the middle of the hall and hang amid the crowd expose to all they observation when i succeed in gain utterance my god my god another moment and i have forget they and all my fury in the torture that arise within myself what then be the light that rack my brain once more my life from its begin to its end rise up before I -- each scene like a spectre like the harpy of the old fable rend I with tooth and claw once more i see what might have be the noble thing i might have do the happiness i have lose the turning of the fate road which i might have take -- everything that be once so possible so possible so easy but now possible no more my anguish be immeasurable i turn and wrench myself in the strength of pain out of the machinery that hold I and fall down down among all the curse that be be hurl at I -- among the horrible and miserable crowd i have bring upon they the evil which i share and they fall upon I with a fury which be like that which have prompt myself a few minute before but they could do nothing to I so tremendous as the vengeance i have take upon they i be too miserable to feel the blow that rain upon I but presently i suppose i lose consciousness altogether be almost tear to piece by the multitude while this last it seem to I that i have a dream i feel the blow rain down upon I and my body struggle upon the ground and yet it seem to I that i be lie outside upon the ground and above I the pale sky which never brighten at the touch of the sun and i think that dull persistent cloud waver and break for a instant and that i see behind a glimpse of that blue which be heaven when we be on the earth -- the blue sky -- which be nowhere to be see but in the mortal life which be heaven enough which be delight enough for those who can look up to it and feel themselves in the land of hope it might be but a dream in this strange world who could tell what be vision and what be true the next thing i remember be that i find myself lie on the floor of a great room full of people with every kind of disease and deformity some pale with sickness some with fresh wound the lame and the maim and the miserable they lay round I in every attitude of pain many with sore some bleeding with broken limb but all struggle some on hand and knee drag themselves up from the ground to stare at I they rouse in my mind a loathing and sense of disgust which it be impossible to express i could scarcely tolerate the thought that i -- i should be force to remain a moment in this lazar-house the feeling with which i have regard the miserable creature who share the corner of the wall with I and who have curse I for be sorry for he have altogether go out of my mind i call out to whom i know not adjure some one to open the door and set I free but my cry be answer only by a shout from my companion in trouble ` who do you think will let you out ' ` who be go to help you more than the rest ' my whole body be rack with pain i could not move from the floor on which i lay i have to put up with the stare of the curious and the mockery and remark on I of whoever choose to criticise among they be the lame man whom i have see thrust in by the two officer who have take I from the gate he be the first to jibe ` but for he they would never have see I ' he say ' i should have be well by this time in the fresh air ' ` it be he turn now ' say another i turn my head as well as i could and speak to they all ' i be a stranger here ' i cry ` they have make my brain burn with they experiment will nobody help I it be no fault of mine it be they fault if i be to be leave here uncared for i shall die ' at this a sort of dreadful chuckle run round the place ` if that be what you be afraid of you will not die ' somebody say touching I on my head in a way which give I intolerable pain ` do not touch I ' i cry ` why should not i ' say the other and push I again upon the throbbing brain so far as my sensation go there be no covering at all neither skull nor skin upon the intolerable throbbing of my head which have be expose to the curiosity of the crowd and every touch be agony but my cry bring no guardian nor any defense or soothing i drag myself into a corner after a time from which some other wretch have be roll out in the course of a quarrel and as i find that silence be the only policy i keep silent with rage consume my heart presently i discover by means of the new arrival which keep come in hurl into the midst of we without thought or question that this be the common fate of all who be repulsive to the sight or who have any weakness or imperfection which offend the eye of the population they be toss in among we not to be heal or for repose or safety but to be out of sight that they might not disgust or annoy those who be more fortunate to whom no injury have happen and because in they sickness and imperfection they be of no use in the study of the place and disturb the good order of the street and there they lay one above another -- a mass of bruised and broken creature most of they suffer from injury which they have sustain in what would have be call in other region the service of the state they have serve like myself as object of experiment they have fall from height where they have be place in illustration of some theory they have be tortured or twisted to give satisfaction to some question and then that the consequence of these proceedings might offend no one 's eye they be fling into this receptacle to be release if chance or strength enable they to push they way out when other be bring in or when they importunate knock weary some watchman and bring he angry and threatening to hear what be want the sound of this knock against the door and of the cry that accompany it and the rush towards the opening when any one be bring in cause a hideous continuous noise and scuffle which be agony to my brain every one push before the other there be a endless rise and fall as in the change of a feverish dream each man as he get strength to struggle forwards himself thrust back he neighbor and those who be nearest to the door beat upon it without cease like the beating of a drum without cadence or measure sometimes a dozen passionate hand together make a horrible din and riot as i lay unable to join in that struggle and move by rage unspeakable towards all who could i reflect strangely that i have never hear when outside this horrible continual appeal of the suffering in the street of the city as i now reflect quiet reign i have even make comparison on my first entrance in the moment of pleasant anticipation which come over I of the happy stillness here with the horror and tumult of that place of unrule which i have leave when my thought reach this point i be answer by the voice of some one on a level with myself lie helpless like I on the floor of the lazar-house ` they have take they precaution ' he say ` if they will not endure the sight of suffer how should they hear the sound of it every cry be silence there ' ' i wish they could be silence within too ' i cry savagely ' i would make they dumb have i the power ' ` the spirit of the place be in you ' say the other voice ` and not in you ' i say raise my head though every movement be agony but this pretence of superiority be more than i could bear the other make no answer for a moment then he say faintly ` if it be so it be but for greater misery ' and then he voice die away and the hubbub of beating and cry and cursing and groan fill all the echo they cry but no one listen to they they thunder on the door but in vain they aggravate all they pang in that mad struggle to get free after a while my companion whoever he be speak again ` they would rather ' he say ` lie on the roadside to be kick and trodden on as we have see though to see that make you miserable ' ` make I miserable you mock I ' i say ` why should a man be miserable save for suffering of he own ' ` you think otherwise once ' my neighbor say and then i remember the wretch in the corner of the wall in the other town who have curse I for pity he i cursed myself now for that folly pity he be he not better off than i ' i wish ' i cry ` that i could crush they into nothing and be rid of this infernal noise they make ' ` the spirit of the place have enter into you ' say that voice i raise my arm to strike he but my hand fall on the stone floor instead and send a jar of new pain all through my battered frame and then i master my rage and lay still for i know there be no way but this of recover my strength -- the strength with which when i get it back i would annihilate that reproachful voice and crush the life out of those groan fool whose cry and impotent struggle i could not endure and we lay a long time without move with always that tumult rage in we ear at last there come into my mind a longing to hear speak word again i say ` be you still there ' ' i shall be here ' he say 'till i be able to begin again ' ` to begin be there here then either begin or end go on speak to I it make I a little forget my pain ' ' i have a fire in my heart ' he say ' i must begin and begin -- till perhaps i find the way ' ` what way ' i cry feverish and eager for though i despise he yet it make I wonder to think that he should speak riddle which i could not understand he answer very faintly ' i do not know ' the fool then it be only folly as from the first i know it be i feel then that i could treat he roughly after the fashion of the place -- which he say have get into I ` poor wretch ' i say ` you have hope have you where have you come from you might have learn better before now ' ' i have come ' he say ` from where we meet before i have come by the valley of gold i have work in the mine i have serve in the troops of those who be master there i have live in this town of tyrant and lain in this lazar-house before everything have happen to I more and worse than you dream of ' ` and still you go on i would dash my head against the wall and die ' ` when will you learn ' he say with a strange tone in he voice which though no one have be listen to we make a sudden silence for a moment it be so strange it move I like that glimmer of the blue sky in my dream and rouse all the sufferer round with a expectation -- though i know not what the cry stop the hand beat no longer i think all the miserable crowd be still and turn to where he lay ` when will you learn -- that you have die and can die no more ' there be a shout of fury all around I ` be that all you have to say ' the crowd burst forth and i think they rush upon he and kill he for i hear no more until the hubbub begin again more wild than ever with furious hand beat beat against the lock door after a while i begin to feel my strength come back i raise my head i sit up i begin to see the face of those around I and the group into which they gather the noise be no longer so insupportable -- my rack nerve be regain health it be with a mixture of pleasure and despair that i become conscious of this i have be through many death but i do not die perhaps could not as that man have say i look about for he to see if he have contradict he own theory but he be not dead he be lie close to I cover with wound but he open he eye and something like a smile come upon he lip a smile -- i have hear laughter and see ridicule and derision but this i have not see i could not bear it to seize he and shake the little remain life out of he be my impulse but neither do i obey that again he remind I of my dream -- be it a dream -- of the opening in the cloud from that moment i try to shelter he and as i grow stronger and stronger and push my way to the door i drag he along with I how long the struggle be i can not tell or how often i be balk or how many dart through before I when the door be open but i do not let he go and at last for now i be as strong as before -- stronger than most about I -- i get out into the air and bring he with I into the air it be a atmosphere so still and motionless that there be no feeling of life in it as i have say but the change seem to I happiness for the moment it be freedom the noise of the struggle be over the horrible sight be leave behind my spirit spring up as if i have be bear into new life it have the same effect i suppose upon my companion though he be much weaker than i for he rise to he foot at once with almost a leap of eagerness and turn instantaneously towards the other side of the city ` not that way ' i say ` come with I and rest ' ` no rest -- no rest -- my rest be to go on ' and then he turn towards I and smile and say ` thanks ' -- look into my face what a word to hear i have not hear it since -- a rush of strange and sweet and dreadful thought come into my mind i shrink and tremble and let go he arm which i have be hold but when i leave that hold i seem to fall back into depths of blank pain and longing i put out my hand again and catch he ' i will go ' i say ` where you go ' a pair of the official of the place pass as i speak they look at I with a threatening glance and half pause but then pass on it be i now who hurry my companion along i recollect he now he be a man who have meet I in the street of the other city when i be still ignorant who have convulse I with the utterance of that name which in all this world where we be be never name but for punishment -- the name which i have name once more in the great hall in the midst of my torture so that all who hear I be transfix with that suffer too he have be haggard then but he be more haggard now he feature be sharp with continual pain he eye be wild with weakness and trouble though there be a meaning in they which go to my heart it seem to I that in he touch there be a certain help though he be weak and totter and every moment seem full of suffer hope spring up in my mind -- the hope that where he be so eager to go there would be something better a life more livable than in this place in every new place there be new hope i be not wear out of that human impulse i forget the nightmare which have crush I before -- the horrible sense that from myself there be no escape -- and hold fast to he arm i hurry on with he not heed where we go aside into less frequented street that we might escape observation i seem to myself the guide though i be the follower a great faith in this man spring up in my breast i be ready to go with he wherever he go anywhere -- anywhere must be better than this thus i push he on hold by he arm till we reach the very outmost limit of the city here he stand still for a moment turn upon I and take I by the hand ` friend ' he say ` before you be bear into the pleasant earth i have come here i have go all the weary round listen to one who know : all be harder harder as you go on you be stir to go on by the restlessness in you heart and each new place you come to the spirit of that place enter into you you be better here than you will be farther on you be better where you be at first or even in the mine than here come no farther stay unless -- ' but here he voice give way he look at I with anxiety in he eye and say no more ` then why ' i cry ` do you go on why do you not stay ' he shake he head and he eye grow more and more soft ' i be go ' he say and he voice shake again ' i be go -- to try -- the most awful and the most dangerous journey -- ' he voice die away altogether and he only look at I to say the rest ' a journey where ' i can tell no man what he eye say i understand i can not tell how and with tremble all my limb seem to drop out of joint and my face grow moist with terror i could not speak any more than he but with my lip shape how the awful thought make a tremor in the very air around he shake he head slowly as he look at I he eye all circle with deep line look out of cave of anguish and anxiety and then i remember how he have say and i have scoff at he that the way he seek be one he do not know i have drop he hand in my fear and yet to leave he seem drag the heart out of my breast for none but he have speak to I like a brother have take my hand and thank I i look out across the plain and the road seem tranquil and still there be a coolness in the air it look like evening as if somewhere in those far distance there might be a place where a weary soul might rest and i look behind I and think what i have suffer and remember the lazar-house and the voice that cry and the hand that beat against the door and also the horrible quiet of the room in which i live and the eye which look in at I and turn my gaze upon myself then i rush after he for he have turn to go on upon he way and catch at he clothes cry ` behold I behold I i will go too ' he reach I he hand and go on without a word and i with terror creep after he tread in he step follow like he shadow what it be to walk with another and follow and be at one be more than i can tell but likewise my heart fail I for fear for dread of what we might encounter and of hear that name or enter that presence which be more terrible than all torture i wonder how it could be that one should willingly face _ that _ which rack the soul and how he have learn that it be possible and where he have hear of the way and as we go on i say no word for he begin to seem to I a being of another kind a figure full of awe and i follow as one might follow a ghost where would he go be we not fix here forever where we lot have be cast and there be still many other great city where there might be much to see and something to distract the mind and where it might be more possible to live than it have prove in the other place there might be no tyrant there nor cruelty nor horrible noise nor dreadful silence towards the right hand across the plain there seem to rise out of the gray distance a cluster of tower and roof like another habitable place and who could tell that something better might not be there surely everything could not turn to torture and misery i drag on behind he with all these thought hurry through my mind he be go -- i dare to say it now though i do not dare then -- to seek out a way to god to try if it be possible to find the road that lead back -- that road which have be open once to all but for I i tremble at the thought of that road i fear the name which be as the plunging of a sword into my inmost part all thing could be bear but that i dare not even think upon that name to feel my hand in another man 's hand be much but to be lead into that awful presence by awful way which none know -- how could i bear it my spirit fail I and my strength my hand become loose in he hand he grasp I still but my hold fail and ever with slower and slower step i follow while he seem to acquire strength with every wind of the way at length he say to I look back upon I ' i can not stop but you heart fall you shall i loose my hand and let you go ' ' i be afraid i be afraid ' i cry ` and i too be afraid but it be better to suffer more and to escape than to suffer less and to remain ' ` have it ever be know that one escape no one have ever escape this be we place ' i say ` there be no other world ' ` there be other world there be a world where every way lead to one who love we still ' i cry out with a great cry of misery and scorn ` there be no love ' i say he stand still for a moment and turn and look at I he eye seem to melt my soul a great cloud pass over they as in the pleasant earth a cloud will sweep across the moon and then the light come out and look at I again for neither do he know where he be go all might end in despair and double and double pain but if it be possible that at the end there should be find that for which he long upon which he heart be set he say with a falter voice ` among all whom i have question and see there be but one who find the way but if one have find it so may i if you will not come yet let I go ' ` they will tear you limb from limb they will burn you in the endless fire ' i say but what be it to be tear limb from limb or burn with fire there come upon he face a smile and in my heart even i laugh to scorn what i have say ` if i be drag every nerve apart and every thought turn into a fiery dart -- and that be so ' he say -- ` yet will i go if but perhaps i may see love at the end ' ` there be no love ' i cry again with a sharp and bitter cry and the echo seem to come back and back from every side no love no love till the man who be my friend falter and stumble like a drunken man but afterwards he recover strength and resume he way and thus once more we go on on the right hand be that city grow ever clearer with noble tower rise up to the sky and battlements and lofty roof and behind a yellow clearness as of a golden sunset my heart draw I there it spring up in my breast and sing in my ear come and come myself invite I to this new place as to a home the other be wretched but this will be happy -- delight and pleasure will be there and before we the way grow dark with storm and there grow visible among the mist a black line of mountain perpendicular cliff and awful precipice which seem to bar the way i turn from that line of gloomy height and gaze along the path to where the tower stand up against the sky and presently my hand drop by my side that have be hold in my companion 's hand and i see he no more i go on to the city of the evening light ever and ever as i proceed on my way the sense of haste and restless impatience grow upon I so that i feel myself incapable of remain long in a place and my desire grow stronger to hasten on and on but when i enter the gate of the city this longing vanish from my mind there seem some great festival or public holiday go on there the street be full of pleasure-party and in every open place -lrb- of which there be many -rrb- be band of dancer and music playing and the house about be hang with tapestry and embroidery and garland of flower a load seem to be take from my spirit when i see all this -- for a whole population do not rejoice in such a way without some cause and to think that after all i have find a place in which i might live and forget the misery and pain which i have know and all that be behind I be delightful to my soul it seem to I that all the dancer be beautiful and young they step go gayly to the music they face be bright with smile here and there be a master of the feast who arrange the dance and guide the musician yet seem to have a look and smile for new-comer too one of these come forwards to meet I and receive I with a welcome and show I a vacant place at the table on which be beautiful fruit pile up in basket and all the provision for a meal ` you be expect you perceive ' he say a delightful sense of well-being come into my mind i sit down in the sweetness of ease after fatigue of refreshment after weariness of pleasant sound and sight after the arid way i say to myself that my past experience have be a mistake that this be where i ought to have come from the first that life here would be happy and that all intrude thought must soon vanish and die away after i have rest i stroll about and enter fully into the pleasure of the place wherever i go through all the city there be nothing but brightness and pleasure music playing and flag wave and flower and dancer and everything that be most gay i ask several people whom i meet what be the cause of the rejoice but either they be too much occupy with they own pleasure or my question be lose in the hum of merriment the sound of the instrument and of the dancer ' foot when i have see as much as i desire of the pleasure out of door i be take by some to see the interior of house which be all decorate for this festival whatever it be light up with curious variety of lighting in tint of different color the door and window be all open and whosoever would could come in from the dance or from the laden table and sit down where they pleased and rest always with a pleasant view out upon the street so that they should lose nothing of the spectacle and the dress both of woman and man be beautiful in form and color make in the finest fabric and afford delightful combination to the eye the pleasure which i take in all i saw and hear be enhance by the surprise of it and by the aspect of the place from which i have come where there be no regard to beauty nor anything lovely or bright before my arrival here i have come in my thought to the conclusion that life have no brightness in these region and that whatever occupation or study there might be pleasure have end and be over and everything that have be sweet in the former life i change that opinion with a sense of relief which be more warm even than the pleasure of the present moment for have make one such mistake how could i tell that there be not more discovery await I that life might not prove more endurable might not rise to something grander and more powerful the old prejudice the old foregone conclusion of earth that this be a world of punishment have warped my vision and my thought with so many add faculty of be incapable of fatigue as we be incapable of death recover from every wound or accident as i have myself do and with no foolish restraint as to what we should or should not do why might not we rise in this land to strength unexampled to the highest power i rejoice that i have drop my companion 's hand that i have not follow he in he mad quest sometime i say to myself i would make a pilgrimage to the foot of those gloomy mountain and bring he back all rack and tortured as he be and show he the pleasant place which he have miss in the mean time the music and the dance go on but it begin to surprise I a little that there be no pause that the festival continue without intermission i go up to one of those who seem the master of ceremony direct what be go on he be a old man with a flow robe of brocade and a chain and badge which denote he office he stand with a smile upon he lip beat time with he hand to the music watch the figure of the dance ' i can get no one to tell I ' i say ` what the occasion of all this rejoicing be ' ` it be for you come ' he reply without hesitation with a smile and a bow for the moment a wonderful elation come over I ` for my come ' but then i pause and shake my head ` there be other come besides I see they arrive every moment ' ` it be for they come too ' he say with another smile and a still deeper bow ` but you be the first as you be the chief ' this be what i could not understand but it be pleasant to hear and i make no further objection ` and how long will it go on ' i say ` so long as it please you ' say the old courtier how he smile he smile do not please I he see this and distract my attention ` look at this dance ' he say ` how beautiful be those round young limb look how the dress conceal yet show the form and beautiful movement it be invent in you honor all that be lovely be for you choose where you will all be yours we live only for this all be for you ' while he speak the dancer come nearer and nearer till they circle we round and dance and make they pretty obeisance and sing ` all be yours all be for you ' then break they line float away in other circle and procession and endless group singing and laugh till it seem to ring from every side ` everything be yours all be for you ' i accept this flattery i know not why for i soon become aware that i be no more than other and that the same word be say to every new-comer yet my heart be elated and i throw myself into all that be set before I but there be always in my mind a expectation that presently the music and the dancing would cease and the table be withdraw and a pause come at one of the feast i be place by the side of a lady very fair and richly dress but with a look of great weariness in she eye she turn she beautiful face to I not with any show of pleasure and there be something like compassion in she look she say ` you be very tired ' as she make room for I by she side ` yes ' i say though with surprise for i have not yet acknowledge that even to myself ` there be so much to enjoy we have need of a little rest ' ` of rest ' say she shake she head ` this be not the place for rest ' ` yet pleasure require it ' i say ` as much as -- ' i be about to say pain but why should one speak of pain in a place give up to pleasure she smile faintly and shake she head again all she movement be languid and faint she eyelid droop over she eye yet when i turn to she she make a effort to smile ' i think you be also tire ' i say at this she rouse herself a little ` we must not say so nor do i say so pleasure be very exacting it demand more of you than anything else one must be always ready -- ' ` for what ' ` to give enjoyment and to receive it ' there be a effort in she voice to rise to this sentiment but it fall back into weariness again ' i hope you receive as well as give ' i say the lady turn she eye to I with a look which i can not forget and life seem once more to be rouse within she but not the life of pleasure she eye be full of loathing and fatigue and disgust and despair ` be you so new to this place ' she say ` and have not learn even yet what be the height of all misery and all weariness what be worse than pain and trouble more dreadful than the lawless street and the burning mine and the torture of the great hall and the misery of the lazar-house -- ' ` oh lady ' i say ` have you be there ' she answer I with she eye alone there be no need of more ` but pleasure be more terrible than all ' she say and i know in my heart that what she say be true there be no record of time in that place i could not count it by day or night but soon after this it happen to I that the dance and the music become no more than a dizzy maze of sound and sight which make my brain whirl round and round and i too loathe what be spread on the table and the soft couch and the garland and the fluttering flag and ornament to sit forever at a feast to see forever the merrymaker turn round and round to hear in you ear forever the whirl of the music the laughter the cry of pleasure there be some who go on and on and never seem to tire but to I the endless round come at last to be a torture from which i could not escape finally i could distinguish nothing -- neither what i hear nor what i saw and only a consciousness of something intolerable buzz and echo in my brain i long for the quiet of the place i have leave i long for the noise in the street and the hubbub and tumult of my first experience anything anything rather than this i say to myself and still the dancer turn the music sound the bystander smile and everything go on and on my eye grow weary with see and my ear with hear to watch the new-comers rush in all pleased and eager to see the eye of the other glaze with weariness work upon my strained nerve i could not think i could not rest i could not endure music forever and ever -- a whirl a rush of music always go on and on and ever that maze of movement till the eye be feverish and the mouth parched ever that mist of face now one gleam out of the chaos now another some like the face of angel some miserable weary strain with smile with the monotony and the endless aimless never-changing round i hear myself call to they to be still -- to be still to pause a moment i feel myself stumble and turn round in the giddiness and horror of that movement without repose and finally i fall under the foot of the crowd and feel the whirl go over and over I and beat upon my brain until i be push and thrust out of the way lest i should stop the measure there i lay sick satiate for i know not how long -- loathing everything around I ready to give all i have -lrb- but what have i to give -rrb- for one moment of silence but always the music go on and the dancer dance and the people feast and the song and the voice echo up to the sky how at last i stumble forth i can not tell desperation must have move I and that impatience which after every hope and disappointment come back and back -- the one sensation that never fail i drag myself at last by interval like a sick dog outside the revel still hear they which be torture to I even when at last i get beyond the crowd it be something to lie still upon the ground though without power to move and sick beyond all think loathing myself and all that i have be and see for i have not even the sense that i have be wrong to keep I up but only a nausea and horror of movement a giddiness and whirl of every sense i lay like a log upon the ground when i recover my faculty a little it be to find myself once more in the great vacant plain which surround that accursed home of pleasure -- a great and desolate waste upon which i could see no track which my heart faint to look at which no longer rouse any hope in I as if it might lead to another beginning or any place in which yet at the last it might be possible to live as i lay in that horrible giddiness and faintness i loathe life and this continuance which bring I through one misery after another and forbid I to die oh that death would come -- death which be silent and still which make no movement and hear no sound that i might end and be no more oh that i could go back even to the stillness of that chamber which i have not be able to endure oh that i could return -- return to what to other misery and other pain which look less because they be past but i know now that return be impossible until i have circle all the dreadful round and already i feel again the burning of that desire that prick and drive I on -- not back for that be impossible little by little i have learn to understand each step print upon my brain as with red-hot iron : not back but on and on -- to greater anguish yes but on to fuller despair to experience more terrible -- but on and on and on i arise again for this be my fate i could not pause even for all the teaching of despair the waste stretch far as eye could see it be wild and terrible with neither vegetation nor sign of life here and there be heap of ruin which have be village and city but nothing be in they save reptile and crawl poisonous life and trap for the unwary wanderer how often i stumble and fall among these ash and dust-heap of the past through what dread moment i lay with cold and slimy thing leave they trace upon my flesh the horror which seize I so that i beat my head against a stone -- why should i tell these be nought they touch not the soul they be but accident of the way at length when body and soul be low and worn out with misery and weariness i come to another place where all be so different from the last that the sight give I a momentary solace it be full of furnace and clank machinery and endless work the whole air round be aglow with the fury of the fire and man go and come like demon in the flame with red-hot melting metal pour it into mould and beat it on anvil in the huge workshop in the background there be a perpetual whir of machinery of wheel turn and turn and piston beat and all the din of labor which for a time renew the anguish of my brain yet also soothe it -- for there be mean in the beating and the whirling and a hope rise within I that with all the force that be here some revolution might be possible -- something that would change the feature of this place and overturn the world i go from workshop to workshop and examine all that be be do and understand -- for i have know a little upon the earth and my old knowledge come back and to learn so much more fill I with new life the master of all be one who never rest nor seem to feel weariness nor pain nor pleasure he have everything in he hand all who be there be he workman or he assistant or he servant no one share with he in he council he be more than a prince among they he be as a god and the thing he plan and make and at which in army and legion he workman toil and labor be like live thing they be make of steel and iron but they move like the brain and nerve of man they go where he direct they and do what he command and move at a touch and though he talk little when he see how i follow all that he do he be a little move towards I and speak and explain to I the conception that be in he mind one rise out of another like the leaf out of the stem and the flower out of the bud for nothing pleased he that he do and necessity be upon he to go on and on ` they be like live thing ' i say ` they do you bidding whatever you command they they be like another and a stronger race of man ' ` man ' he say ` what be man the most contemptible of all thing that be make -- creature who will undo in a moment what it have take million of year and all the skill and all the strength of generation to do these be better than man they can not think or feel they can not stop but at my bidding or begin unless i will have man be make so we should be master of the world ' ` have man be make so you would never have be -- for what could genius have do or think -- you would have be a machine like all the rest ' ` and better so ' he say and turn away for at that moment watch keenly as he speak the action of a delicate combination of movement all make and balance to a hair 's breadth there have come to he suddenly the idea of something which make it a hundredfold more strong and terrible for they be terrible these thing that live yet do not live which be he slave and move at he will when he have do this he look at I and a smile come upon he mouth but he eye smile not nor ever change from the set look they wear and the word he speak be familiar word not he but out of the old life ` what a piece of work be a man ' he say ` how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and move how express and admirable and yet to I what be this quintessence of dust ' he mind have follow another strain of thought which to I be bewilder so that i do not know how to reply i answer like a child upon he last word ` we be dust no more ' i cry for pride be in my heart -- pride of he and he wonderful strength and he thought which create strength and all the marvel he do ` those thing which hinder be remove go on go on you want but another step what be to prevent that you should not shake the universe and overturn this doom and break all we bond there be enough here to explode this gray fiction of a firmament and to rend those precipice and to dissolve that waste -- as at the time when the primeval sea dry up and those infernal mountain rise ' he laugh and the echo catch the sound and give it back as if they mock it ` there be enough to rend we all into shred ' he say ` and shake as you say both heaven and earth and these plain and those hill ' ` then why ' i cry in my haste with a dreadful hope pierce through my soul -- ` why do you create and perfect but never employ when we have army on the earth we use they you have more than army you have force beyond the thought of man but all without use as yet ' ` all ' he cry ` for no use all in vain -- in vain ' ' o master ' i say ` great and more great in time to come why -- why ' he take I by the arm and draw I close ` have you strength ' he say ` to bear it if i tell you why ' i know what he be about to say i feel it in the quiver of my vein and my heart that bound as if it would escape from my breast but i would not quail from what he do not shrink to utter i could speak no word but i look he in the face and wait -- for that which be more terrible than all he hold I by the arm as if he would hold I up when the shock of anguish come ` they be in vain ' he say ` in vain -- because god rule over all ' he arm be strong but i fall at he foot like a dead man how miserable be that image and how unfit to use death be still and cool and sweet there be nothing in it that pierce like a sword that burn like fire that rend and tear like the turn wheel o life o pain o terrible name of god in which be all succor and all torment what be pang and torture to that which ever increase in its awful power and have no limit nor any alleviation but whenever it be speak penetrate through and through the miserable soul o god whom once i call my father o thou who gavest I be against whom i have fight whom i fight to the end shall there never be anything but anguish in the sound of thy great name when i return to such command of myself as one can have who have be transfix by that sword of fire the master stand by I still he have not fall like I but he face be draw with anguish and sorrow like the face of my friend who have be with I in the lazar-house who have disappear on the dark mountain and as i look at he terror seize hold upon I and a desire to flee and save myself that i might not be draw after he by the longing that be in he eye the master give I he hand to help I to rise and it tremble but not like mine ` sir ' i cry ` have not we enough to bear be it for hatred be it for vengeance that you speak that name ' ' o friend ' he say ` neither for hatred nor revenge it be like a fire in my vein if one could find he again ' ` you who be as a god who can make and destroy -- you who could shake he throne ' he put up he hand ' i who be he creature even here -- and still he child though i be so far so far -- ' he catch my hand in he and point with the other tremble ` look you eye be more clear than mine for they be not anxious like mine can you see anything upon the way ' the waste lay wild before we dark with a faintly-rising cloud for darkness and cloud and the gloom of death attend upon that name i think in he great genius and splendor of intellect he have go mad as sometimes may be ` there be nothing ' i say and scorn come into my soul but even as i speak i saw -- i can not tell what i saw -- a move spot of milky whiteness in that dark and miserable wilderness no bigger than a man 's hand no bigger than a flower ` there be something ' i say unwillingly ` it have no shape nor form it be a gossamer-web upon some bush or a butterfly blow on the wind ' ` there be neither butterfly nor gossamer here ' ` look for yourself then ' i cry fling he hand from I i be angry with a rage which have no cause i turn from he though i love he with a desire to kill he in my heart and hurriedly take the other way the waste be wild but rather that than to see the man who might have shake earth and hell thus turn turn to madness and the awful journey for i know what in he heart he think and i know that it be so it be something from that other sphere can i tell you what a child perhaps -- o think that wring the heart -- for do you know what manner of thing a child be there be none in the land of darkness i turn my back upon the place where that whiteness be on on across the waste on to the city of the night on far away from maddening thought from hope that be torment and from the awful name \* \* \* \* \* the above narrative though it be necessary to a full understanding of the
