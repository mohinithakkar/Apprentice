family house in a respectable middle-class road of the little north-county town of sidon midway between the tree of wealth upon the hill and the business quarter that end in squalor on the bank of the broad and busy river -- a house boast a few shabby tree of its own in its damp little rockeried slip of front and back garden -- on a may evening some ten or twelve year ago a momentous crisis of contrast have be reach the house be still as for a battle it be hold its breath to hear what be go on in the front parlor the door of which seem to wear a expression of be more than usually close a mournful half-light fall through a little stained-glass vestibule into a hat-racked hall on the wall of which hang several picture of those great steamship know as atlantic liner in big gilt frame -- picture of a significance presently to be note a beautiful old eight-day clock tick solemnly to the flickering of the hall lamp from below come occasionally a furtive creaking of the kitchen stair the two servant be half way up they listen the stair a flight above the hall also creak at interval two young girl respectively about fourteen and fifteen be crane neck out of nightdress over the baluster in a shadowy angle of the staircase on the floor above they three other little girl of gradually diminish age sleep unconscious of the issue be decide between they big brother and they eldest sister on the one side and they father and mother on the other in the front parlor below that parlor a room of good size be unostentatiously furnish with good bourgeois mahogany a buxom mahogany chiffonier a large square dining-table a black marble clock with two dial one be a barometer three large oil landscape of exceedingly umbrageous tree and glassy lake inoffensively uninterest more atlantic liner and a large bookcase apparently fill with serried line of bind magazine and a excellent brussels carpet of quiet pattern be mainly responsible for a general effect of middle-class comfort in which indeed if beauty have not be include it have not be wilfully violate but merely unthought of the young people for whom these familiar object mean a symbolism deep-rooted in they earliest memory could hardly in fairness have declare anything positively painful in that room -- except perhaps those atlantic liner they charge against furniture which be unconsciously to they accumulate memory that would some day bring tear of tenderness to they eye could only have be negative beauty have be leave out but at least ugliness have not be ostentatiously call in there be no bad taste in fact whatever the individual character of each component object there be include in the general effect a certain indefinable dignity which have doubtless nothing to do with the mahogany but be probably one of those subtle atmospheric impression which a room take from the people who habitually live in it have you enter that room when it be empty you would instinctively have feel that it be accustom to the occupancy of calm and refined people there be something almost religious in its quiet some one often sit there who whatever he commonplace disguise as a provincial man of business however inadequate to he power the work life have give he to do provincial and humiliating as be the formula with which narrowing condition have supply he for expression of himself be in he central be a aristocrat -- though that be the very last word jame mesurier would have think of apply to himself he be a man of business serve god and he employer with stern uprightness and bring up a large family with something of the puritan severity which have mark he own early training and as in he own case no such allowance have be make make no allowance in he rigid abstract code for the diverse temperament of he child -- child in whom certain quality and need of he own nature dormant from he birth be awaken supplement by the fuller-fed intelligence and richer nature of the mother into expansive and rebellious individuality it be now about eleven o'clock and the house be thus light and alive half-an-hour beyond the rigorously enforce bed-time a hour before jame mesurier have be peacefully engage on the task which have be nightly with he at this hour for twenty-five year -- the writing of he diary in a shorthand which he write with a neatness almost a daintiness that always mark he use of pen and ink and give to he merely commercial correspondence and he quite exquisitely keep account a certain touch of the scholar -- again a air of distinction in excess of and unaccounted for by the nature of the interest which it dignified he somewhat narrow range of reading have you follow it by he careful marking through those bind volume of sermon in the bookcase bear the same evidence of inherit and inadequately occupy refinement he life from boyhood have be too much of a struggle to leave he much leisure for reading and such as he have enjoy have be divert into evangelical channel by the influence of a certain pious old lady with whom as a young man he have board and for whose memory all he life he cherish a reverence little short of saint-worship the name of mr quiggin whose portrait have still a conspicuous niche among the _ lare _ of the household -- a little thin silvery old widow-lady suggest great sadness much gentleness and a little severity -- have thus become for the family of jame mesurier a symbol of sanctity with which a properly accredit saint of the calendar could certainly not in that protestant home have compete it be she who have give he that little well-worn bible which lay on the table with he letter and papers as he write under the lamplight and than which a world full of sacred relic contain none more sacred a business-like elastic band encircle its cover as a precaution against page become loose with much turning and inside you would have find scarcely a chapter unpencilled -- text underline and sermon of special helpfulness note by date and preacher on the margin -- the itinerary of a devout human soul on its way through this world to the next the bible and the sermon of a certain famous nonconformist divine of the day be jame mesurier 's favorite and practically he only reading at this time though as a young man he have pick up a fair education for himself and have take a certain interest in modern history for novel he have not merely disapproval but absolutely no taste once in a specially genial mood he have undertake to try ivanhoe to please he favorite daughter -- this night in revolt against he -- and in half-an-hour he have be surprise with laughter sound asleep the sermon that would send he to sleep have never be write at all event by he favorite theologian whose sermon he read every Sunday afternoon and annotated with that same loving appreciation and careful pencil with which a scholar annotate some classic so true be it that it be we who dignify we occupation not they we similarly jame mesurier preside over the destiny of a large commercial undertaking with the air of one who have be call rather to direct a empire than a business you would say as he go by there go one accustomed to rule accustomed to be regard with great respect but that air have be he long before the authority that once more inadequately account for it thus this night as he sit write he handsome rather small iron-grey head bent over he papers he face somewhat french in character he short beard slightly point distinguished refine severe he have the look of a marshal of france engross with document of state the mother who sit in a armchair by the fire reading be a woman of about forty-five with a fine blonde aquiline face distinctively english and radiate intelligence from its large sympathetic line she be in some respects so different from she husband as at time to make child precociously wise -- but nevertheless far from know everything -- wonder why she have ever marry they father for whom at that time it would be hypocrisy to describe they attitude as one of love to they he be not so much a father as the policeman of home -- a personification of stern negative decree a systematic thwarter of almost everything they most care to do he be a sort of embody thou shalt not only to be win into acquiescence by one influence -- that of the mother whose married life as she look back on it seem to consist of little else than bring child into the world with a christian-like regularity and intercede with the father for they vary temperament when there though it might have be regard as certain beforehand that seven child would differ each from each other in at least as many way it never seem to have occur to the father that one inflexible system for they all could hardly be wise or comfortable but indeed like so many parent similarly train and circumstance it be questionable whether he ever realize they possession of separate individuality till they be plead for by the mother or make as on this evening surprising assertion of themselves though this system of mediation have be responsible for the only disagreement in they married life there have never be any long or serious difference between husband and wife for in spite of nature so different they love each other with that love which be give we for the very purpose of such situation the love that no strain can snap the love that reconcile all such disparity though mary mesurier have also be bring up among nonconformist and though the condition of she youth like she husband 's have be far from adequate to the demand of she nature yet she religion have be of a gentler character broaden instead of narrow in its effect and have concern itself less with divinity than humanity she home life if humble have be genial and rich in love and there have come into it generous influence from the outer world -- book with more of the human beat in they than be to be find in sermon and particularly a old travel grandfather who have be regard as the roll stone of he family but in whom at all event failure and travel have develop a great gentleness and understanding of the human creature which in long walk and talk with he little grand-daughter somehow pass over into she young character and prove the best legacy he could have leave she through he too be encourage a native love of poetry of which in she childhood she memory acquire a stock which never fail she and which have often cheer she lonely hour by successive cradle she have a fine natural gift of recitation and in evening hour when the home be particularly unite in some glow of visitor or birthday celebration she would be persuade to recall some of those old song and simple apologue with such charm that even she husband to whom verse be naturally a incomprehensible triviality be visibly softened and perhaps deep in the sadness of he silent nature move to a pass realisation of a certain something kind and musical in life which he have strangely miss this greater breadth of temperament and training enable mary mesurier to understand and make allowance for the narrower and harder nature of she husband whom she learn in time rather to pity for the bleakness of he early day than to condemn for they effect upon he character he be strong good clever and handsome and exceptionally all those four good reason for love he and the intellectual sympathy the sharing of broader interest which she sometimes miss in he she have for some three or four year come to find in she eldest son who to he father 's bewilderment and disappointment have reincarnate he own strong will in connection with literary practice and dream which threaten to end in he become a poet instead of the business man expect of he for which development that love of poetry in one parent and a certain love of book in both be no doubt to some degree guiltily responsible jame mesurier as we have say be no judge of poetry and have he be so a reading of he son 's early effusion would have make he still more obdurate in the choice for he of a commercial career but on general principle he be quite sufficiently firm against any but the most non-committing leisure-hour flirtation with the muse the mother while agree with the father 's main proposition of the undesirability nay impossibility of literature as a livelihood -- have not the great and successful sir walter himself describe it as a good walking-stick but a poor crutch a stick apply since its first application as a image to the shoulder of how many generation of youthful genius -- be naturally more sympathetic towards she son 's ambition and encourage it to the extent of help from she housekeeping money the formation of he little library even occasionally prove successful in win sum of money from the father for the purchase of some book specially as the young man would declare necessary for he development as this little library have outgrow the accommodation of the common room a daring scheme have be conceive between mother and son -- no less than that he should have a small room set apart for himself as a study when first broach to the father this scheme have meet with a absolute denial that seem to promise no hope of further consideration but the mother accept defeat at the time have try again and again with patient dexterity at favourable moment till at last one proud day the little room with its bookshelf a cast of dante and a strange picture or two be a beautiful significant fact -- all ready for the possible visitation of the muse in such way have the mother negotiate the need of all she child though the youth of the rest -- save the eldest girl whose music lesson have mean a battle and whose grow attractiveness for the boy of the district and one in particular be presently to mean another -- make as yet but small demand in one question however periodically fruitful of argument even the youngest be become interested -- the question of the visit to the household of the various friend and playmate of the child to these it must be admit jame mesurier be apt to be hardly less of a figure of fear than to he own child for apart from the fact that such inroad from without be apt to disturb he few quiet evening hour with rollicking and laughter he be entirely unsocial in he own nature have a curious idea that the family should be sufficient to itself and that the desire for any form of entertainment outside it be a sign of dissatisfaction with god 's gift of a good home and generally a frivolity to be discourage as a boy he have grow up without companion and as a man have remain lonely till he have meet in he wife the one comrade of he day what have be good enough for they father should be good enough for he child be a formulum which he apply all round to they bring up curiously forgetful for a man at heart so just of the pleasure one would have expect it to be to make sure that the error of he own training be not repeat in that of he offspring but indeed there be in he constitutionally something of the puritan suspicion of and aversion from pleasure which it have never occur to he to consider as the end of or indeed as a considerable element of existence life be somehow too serious for play spiritually as well as materially and much work and a little rest be the eternal and on the whole salutary lot of man such be some of the condition among which the young mesurier find themselves and of which they impatience have become momentously explosive this February evening for some day there have be a energetic simmer of rebellion among the four elder child against a new edict of early rising which be surely somewhat arbitrary early rising be one of jame mesurier 's article of faith and he be always up and dress by half-past six though there be no breakfast till eight and absolutely no necessity for he rise at that hour beyond he own desire there be still less indeed none at all for he child to rise thus early but nevertheless he have recently decree that such for the future must be the rule the rule fall heaviest upon the sister for the elder brother have always enjoy a certain immunity from such edict he sense of justice however kindle none the less at this final piece of tyranny he blaze and fume indignantly on behalf of he sister in the sanctuary of that little study -- a spot where the despot seldom set foot and out of this comparatively trivial cause have spring a mighty resolution which he and she whom he proudly honor as sister and friend have after some gird of the loin repair to the front parlor this evening to communicate they have enter somewhat abruptly and stand rather dramatically by the table on which the father be write -- the son with dark set face in which could be see both the father and mother and the daughter timid and close to he resolutely keep back she tear a slim young copy of the mother well my dear say the father look up with a keen rather surprised glance and in a tone which qualify with some severity the my dear the son have have some exceedingly fine beginning in he head but they flee ignominiously with the calm that be necessary for they successful delivery and he blurt at once to the point we have come to say that we be no longer comfortable at home and have decide to leave it henry exclaim the mother hastily what do you mean how can you be so ungrateful mary my dear interrupted the father please leave the matter to I then turn to the son : what be this you be say i be afraid i do not understand i mean that esther and i have decide to leave home and live together because it be impossible for we to live here any longer in happiness -- on what do you propose to live my salary will be sufficient for the present sixty pound a year yes and may i ask what be wrong with you home you have every comfort -- far more than you mother or father be accustom to yes indeed echo the mother yes we know you be very good and kind and mean everything for we good but you do not understand other need of we nature and you make no allowance for we individuality -- indeed individuality -- i should like you to have hear what my father would have say to talk about individuality a rope 's end would have be he answer to that -- it would have be a very silly one and no argument it would have be effective at all event not with I -- well please do not bandy word with I sir if you particularly address he son wish to go -- then go but remember that once you have leave you father 's roof you leave it for ever as for you sister she have no power to leave she mother and father without my consent and that i shall certainly withhold till she be of a proper age to know what be best for herself -- she will go then without you consent defiantly answer the son oh henry for shame exclaim mr mesurier mother dear i be sorry -- we do not mean to be disrespectful or undutiful -- but father 's petty tyranny be more than we can bear he object to the friend we care for he deny we the theater -- most certainly and shall continue to do so i have never be inside a theater in my life nor with my consent shall any child of mine enter one of they you can evidently know little about they then and you would be a much finer man if you have flash out the son you sit in judgment on you father be certainly very pretty i must say -- answer the father -- very pretty and i can only hope that you will not have cause to regret it some future day but i can not allow you to disturb I for with something of a pang henry notice sign of agitation amid the severity of he parent though the matter be too momentous for he to allow the indulgence of pity you have be a source of much anxiety to you mother and I a child of many prayer the father continue whether it be the book you read or the friend you associate with that be responsible for you strange and to my think impious opinion i do not know but this i know that you influence on you sister have not of late be for good and for she sake and the sake of you young sister it may perhaps be well that you influence in the home be remove -- oh jame exclaim the wife mary my dear you must let I finish if henry will go go he shall but if he still stay he must learn that i be master in this house and that while i remain so not he but i shall dictate how it be to be carry on it be at this point that esther venture to lift the girlish tremor of she voice but father if you 'll forgive my say so i think it would be best for another reason for we to go there be too many of we we have not room to grow we get in each other 's way and then it would ease you it would be less expense -- when i complain of have to support my child it will be time to speak of that -- but you have complain hotly interrupt the son you have reproach we many a time for what we cost you for clothes and food -- yes when you have show yourselve ungrateful for they as you do to-night -- ungrateful for what should we be grateful that you do you bare duty of feeding and clothing we and even for that expect in my case at all event that i shall prove so much business capital invest for the future be it we who ask to come into the world do you consult we or do you beget we for anything but you own selfish pleasure without a thought -- henry get no further he father have grow white and with terrible anger point to the door leave the room sir he say and to-morrow leave my house for ever the son be not cow he stand with a unflinching defiance before the father in whom he forget the father and see only the tyrant for a moment it seem as if some unnatural blow would be strike but so much of pain be spare the future memory of the scene and say only it be true for all that he turn and leave the room the sister follow he in silence and the door close mother and father look at each other they have bring up child they have suffer and toil for they -- that they should talk to they like this mr mesurier come over to she husband and put she arm tenderly on he shoulder never mind dear i be sure he do not mean to talk like that he be a good boy at heart but you do not understand each other mary dear we will talk no more of it to-night he reply i will try and put it from I you go to bed i will finish my diary and be up in a few minute when he be alone he sit still a little while with a great lonely pain on he face and almost visibly upon it too the smart of the wounded pride of he haughty nature never in he life have he be speak to like that -- and by he own son the pang of it be almost more than he could bear but presently he have so far master himself as to take up he pen and continue he write when that be finish he open he bible and read he wonted chapter it be just the simple twenty-third psalm : the lord be my shepherd i shall not want it be he favorite psalm and always have a remarkable tranquillising effect upon he jame mesurier 's faith in god be very great then he kneel down and pray in silence -- pray with a great love for he disobedient child and when he rise from he knee anger and pain have be wash away from he face and a serenity that be not of this world be there instead chapter ii concern those atlantic liner and a old desk of all battle in this complicate civil warfare of human life none be more painful than that be constantly wage from generation to generation between young and old and none it would appear more inevitable or indeed necessary the good god sigh for the cost and pain and as grow older ourselves we become spectator of such a conflict with eye able to see the real goodness and truth of both combatant how often must we exclaim : oh just for a little touch of sympathetic comprehension on either side and yet after all it be from the older generation that we have a right to expect that if that vaunted experience with which they be accustom to extinguish the voice of the young means anything it should surely include some knowledge of the need of expand youth and be prepare to meet they not in a spirit of despotic denial but in that of thoughtful provision the young can not afford to be generous even if they possess the necessary insight it would mean they lose they battle -- a battle very necessary for they to win sometimes it would seem that a very little kindly explanation on the part of the elder would set the younger at a point of view where greater sympathy would be possible the great demand of the young be for some form of poetry in they life and surroundings and it be largely the fault of the old if the poetry of one generation be almost invariably the prose of the next those atlantic liner be a illustration of my mean to the young mesurier they be hideous chromo-lithograph in vulgar gilt frame arbitrary defacement of home but undoubtedly even they would have find a tolerant tenderness for they have they realize that they represent the poetry -- long since renounce and put behind he -- of jame mesurier 's life he have come of a race of sea-captain two of he brother have be sailor and deep down in he heart the spirit of romance answer with voice fresh and young as ever to any breath or association of the sea but he seldom if ever speak of it and only in a anecdote or two be it occasionally bring to mind sometimes he wife would tease he with the vanity which on holiday by the sea would send he forth on bluster tempestuous night clothe in a greatcoat of blue pilot-cloth and a sealskin cap and tell how proud he be on one occasion as he stand on the wharf at be address as captain and ask what ship he have bring into port even the hard heart of youth must soften at such a reminiscence then scatter about the house be many a prosaic bit of furniture which be musical with memory for the parent -- memory of they first little home and they early struggle together this side-board now relegate to the child 's play-room have once be they _ pièce de resistance _ in such and such a street twelve year ago before they child have rise up and -- not call they bless a few year and the light of poetry will be upon these thing for they child too but meanwhile can we blame they that they can not accept the poetry of they elder in exchange for that of they own which they be impatient to make and when that poetry be make and resident in similar concrete object of home -- how will it seem one wonder to they child this old desk which esther have be allow to appropriate and in a secret drawer of which be already accumulate certain love-letter and lavender will it ever one wonder turn to lumber in younger hand for a little while she lean she sweet young bosom against it and write scented letter in a girlish hand to a little red-headed boy who have these past week begin to love she can it be possible that the desk on which esther once write to she little mike will ever hear itself speak of as this ugly old thing let we hope not chapter iii of the love of henry and esther father and son have both mean what they say and even the mother for whom it would be the cruellest wrench of all know that henry be go to leave home not literally on the morrow for the follow evening he have appear before he father to apologise for the manner -- carefully for the manner not _ the matter _ -- in which he have speak to he the evening before and ask for a day or two in which to make he arrangement for departure jame mesurier be too strong a man to be resentful and he accept he son 's apology with a gentleness that as each know detract nothing from the resolution which each have come to my boy he say you will never have such good friend as you father and mother but it be best that you go out into the world to learn it there be something terribly win and unnerve to the blackest resolution when the severity of the strong dissolve for a brief moment into tenderness the rare kind word of the stern explain it as we will and unjust as the preference must surely be one value beyond the frequent forgiveness of the gentle mary mesurier would have lay down she life in defense of she son 's greatest fault and jame mesurier would as readily have court-martialle he for he smallest and yet somehow a kind word from he bring the tear to he son 's eye he have no longer the heart to stimulate the rebellion of esther as he feel it he duty to do and to she disappointment he announce that on the whole it would perhaps be best for he to go alone it would almost kill poor mother he say and father mean well after all he add i be afraid it would break father 's heart say esther so these two young people agree to spare they parent though -- let it not be otherwise imagine -- at a great sacrifice the little paper on which they have carefully work out they housekeeping skilfully allot so much for rent butcher 's meat milk coal and wash and make everything come most optimistically to _ # 59 17 9d _ a year would be of no use now at all event for the present they little charle and mary lamb dream must be lay aside -- for of course they have think of charle and mary lamb and indeed out beyond this history of a few youthful year they friendship be to prove itself far from unworthy of its famous model yet at this time it be of no great antiquity for but a very few year back henry have be a miniature tyrant too and rule it over he kingdom of six sister with all the hideous egoism of a pampered son and heir although in the very middle class of society into which henry mesurier be bear the dignity of eldest son be one but very contingently connect with tangible inheritance it be none the less vigorously keep up and no doubt without any consciousness of partiality henry mesurier from he childhood have be bring up to regard himself as a sort of young prince for whom all the privilege of home be by divine right reserve for example he take he meal with he parent fully five year before any of he sister be allow to do so and for retention of this privilege when at length the democratic measure of its extension to he two elder sister be propose he fight with the bitterest spirit of caste indeed few oligarch have be more wildly hate than henry mesurier up to the age say of fourteen that be the age of he last thrashing and it be in the gloomy dusk of that momentous occasion as he lay alone with smart back in the twilight of a unusually early bed-time that a possible new view of woman -- as a creature of like passion and privilege -- present itself to he he thrashing have be so unjustly severe that even the granite little heart of he sister have be soften and esther managing to secrete a cake that he love from the tea that be lose to he steal with it to the top of the house where he writhe amid lonely echo and shadow she have bring it to he awkwardly by no means sure of its reception but sure in she heart that she would hate he for ever if he miss the meaning of the little solatium but fortunately he back be far too sore and he spirit too broken to remember he pride and he accept the offering with gratitude and tear kiss I esther he have say and a wonderful thrill have go through the little girl at this strange softness in the mighty while the dawn of a wonderful pity for the lot of woman have unconsciously break in the soul of the boy kiss I again esther he have say and with the tear that mingle in that kiss a eternal friendship be baptize henry rise on the morrow a change be the grosser pretension of the male have fall from he for ever and there be at first something almost awe-inspiring to he sister in the gentle solicitude for they and they rights and pleasure which replace the old despotism from that time esther and he become closer and closer companion and as they more and more form a oligarchy of two a rearrangement of party in the little parliament of home come about to be upset again as dot and mat qualify for admission into that exclusive little circle so soon as henry have a new dream or a new thought he share it with esther and freely as he have receive from carlyle or emerson or thoreau freely he pass it on to she for the gloomiest occasion he have some strengthen text and one of the last thing he do before he leave home be to make for she a little book which he call faith for cloudy day consist of energise and sustain phrase from certain great writer -- as it be a bottle of philosophical phosphate against season of spiritual cowardice or debility there one open and read : _ sudden the worst turn best to the brave _ or thoreau 's _ i have yet to hear a single word of wisdom speak to I by my elder _ or again matthew arnold 's _ task in hour of insight will may be through hour of gloom fulfil _ jame mesurier know nothing of all this but if he have he might have understand that after all he child be not so far from the kingdom of heaven chapter iv of the profession that choose and mike laflin however we may hint at its explanation by theory of inheritance it still remain curious with what unerr instinct a child of character will from the first and when it be so evidently ignorant of the field of choice select out of all life 's occupation and distinction one special work it hunger to do one special distinction that to it seem the most desirable of earthly honor that mary mesurier love poetry and jame mesurier sermon in face of the fact that so many mother and father have do the same with no such result hardly seem adequate to account for the peculiar glamour which almost before he could read there be for henry mesurier in any form of print while book be still be read to he there have already come into he mind unaccountably as by outside suggestion that there could be nothing so splendid in the world as to write a book for one 's self to be either a soldier a sailor a architect or a engineer would doubtless have its fascination as well but to make a real print book with you name in gilt letter outside be real romance at that early day and for a long while after the boy have no preference for any particular kind of book it be a entirely abstract passion for print and paper to have be the author of the iliad or of beeton 's book of household recipe would have give he almost the same exaltation of authorship and the thrill of worship which come over he when one early day a man who have actually have a article on the sugar bounty accept by a commercial magazine be point out to he in the street be one he never forget nor in after year do he ever encounter that transfigured contributor without a involuntary recurrence of that old feeling of awe no subsequent acquaintance with editorial room ever lead he into materialistic explanation of that enchanted piece of work -- a newspaper the editor might do they best -- and succeed surprisingly -- in look like ordinary mortal you might even know the leader-writer and with the very public gaze through grating into the subterranean printing-room -- the mystery none the less remain no exposure of editorial staff or other machinery could destroy the sense of enchantment as no amount of anatomy or biology can destroy the mystery of the human miracle so i suppose nature first make we in love with the tool we be to use long before we have a think upon what we shall use they perhaps the first desire of the bear writer be to be a compositor out of the love of mere type quickly evolve a love of mere word for they own sake but whether we shall make use of they as a historian novelist philosopher or poet be a secondary consideration a mere afterthought to henry mesurier have already come the time when the face of life begin to wear a certain aspect the peculiar attraction of which for himself he long to fix a certain mystical importance attach to the commonest every-day object and circumstance a certain ecstatic quality in the simplest experience but even so far as it have be reveal this dawn vision of the world seem only to have come to he not so much to find expression as to mock he with he childish incapacity adequately to use the very tool he love he would hang for hour over some scene in nature catch in a woodland spell like a nympholept of old but when he try to put in word what he have see what a poor piece of ornamental gardening the thing be there be tree and bird and grass to be sure but there be nothing of that meaning look which they have wear that look of be tiptoe with revelation which be one of the most fascinating trick of the visible world and which even a harsh town full of chimney can sometimes take on when see in give moment and light and it be astonishing to see into what lifeless imitative verse he most original and passionate moment could be transform still some unreasonably indulgent spirit of the air that have evidently not read he manuscript whisper he to be of good cheer : the lifeless word would not always be lifeless some day the bird would sing in he verse too this sense of failure do not it must be say immediately follow composition for for a little while the original expression of the thing see reinforce with reflect significance its pale copy it be only some week after when the write copy be leave to do all the work itself that its foolish inadequacy be expose however there be one consolation they be not worse than keat and shelley write at the same age he say to himself as he look through a bundle of the poor thing the evening before he room be to be dismantle indeed they could not be he add with a smile fortunately he be but nineteen as yet would he venture on a like comparison be he twenty-five yes he little room be to be dismantle on the morrow -- this first little private chapel of he spirit this fair order of shelf this external harmony answering to a inner harmony of he spirit be to be break up for ever often as he have sit in the folioed lamplit nook which be as it be the very chancel of the little church and gaze in a ecstasy at the book each with a great shine name of fame upon its cover it have seem as though he have put he very soul outside he externalise it in this little corner of book and picture he soul shiver as one who must go houseless awhile at the think that to-morrow its home would be no more when and how would be its reincarnation more magnificent maybe but never this again it be sacrilege -- be it not ingratitude too when once more the book and the picture begin to form into a new harmony there would be no mother 's love to help the work go on but as he muse in this no doubt sentimental fashion the door open and the little red-headed mike enter he be a little flibbertigibbet of a face already line with the practice of mimicry and there be in it a very attractive blending of tenderness and humor mike be also one of those whom life at the beginning have impress with the delight of one kind of work and no other when a mere imp of a boy the heartless tormentor of a large and sententious stepmother the despair of schoolmaster the most ingenious of truant a humorous ragamuffin invulnerable to punishment it be already reveal to he that he mission in life be to be the observation and reproduction of human character particularly in its humorous aspect to this end nature have gifted he with a face that be capable of every form of transformation and at a early age he hasten to put it in train all day long he be pull face as a artist will sketch everything he come across so mike would endeavor to imitate any characteristic expression or attitude animate or inanimate in the world around he dog little boy and grotesque old man be he special delight and of all he elder he have it go without say a private gallery of irreverently faithful portrait in addition to he plastic face nature have give he a larynx which be capable of imitate every human and inhuman sound to squeak like a pig bark like a dog low like a cow and crow like a cock be the veriest juvenilium of he attainment and he could imitate the buzz of a fly so cunningly that fly themselves have often be deceive it be this delight in imitation for its own sake and not so much that he have be catch by the usual allurement of the theater that he look upon the career of a actor as he natural and ultimate call it be already privately whisper in the little circle that mike would some day go on the stage but do not tell that as yet to old mr laflin whatever you do there be a good deal more in mike than pull face as esther recently and henry before she have discover he acting be some day to stir the heart of audience because he have instinct for know human nature inside as well as out know the secret spring of tear as well as the open secret of laughter and it be rather on this common ground of a rich many-veined humanity that these two have meet and become friend rather than on any real community of taste and idea yet mike loved book too and have a excellent taste in they though perhaps he have hardly love they have not henry and esther love they first and it be quite certain and quite proper that he never find a page of any book so fascinating as the face of some line and batter human be over that write he be never find asleep there be one other literary matter on which he hold a very personal and unshakable opinion -- henry mesurier 's future as a poet and on this he come just in the nick of time to cheer he this evening the next move will be to london old fellow he say and then you 'll soon see my prophecy come true my opinion may not be worth much but you know what it be you 'll be a great writer some day never fear thank you dear old boy and you know what i think about you act do not you then it be that esther appear and henry make some transparent excuse to leave they awhile together you dear old thing say esther kiss he now do not stay away too long chapter v of the love of esther and mike and the mesurier law in regard to sweetheart i be afraid esther be little more than fourteen when she have first see and fall in love with mike she have hear much of he from she brother but for one reason or another he have never be to the house one evening however at a concert henry have tell she to look in a certain direction and she would see mike i do not suppose you 'll call he good look he say so esther have look round and see the pretty curly red hair and the eager little wistful humorous face for the first time why he be get a lovely little face she say blush deeply for no reason at all -- except perhaps that there have seem something plead and shelter-seek in that little face something that cry out to be mother and that instantly there have well up in she heart a great warm wish that some day she might be that for it and more and at the same instant it have occur to the boy that the face thus turn to he for a moment be the loveliest face he have ever see the only lovely face he would ever care to see but with that think too have come a curious pang of hopelessness into he heart for esther mesurier be one of those girl who be the prize of man with all those pretty tall fellow about she it be unlikely indeed that she would care for a little red-headed face-pulling ragamuffin like he and yet if she never could care for he -- never never at all what a lonely place the world would be when after the concert henry look round to introduce mike to he sister he have somehow slipped away and be nowhere to be see however it be not long after this that mike pay a visit to henry 's study one evening and come ostensibly to look at he book once more see he sister and speak to she a brief introductory word he interest in literature become positively remarkable from this time and the enthusiasm with which he actor 's mind reflect and no doubt in all good faith mimic the various philosophical and literary enthusiasm of he friend be though neither realize it a sure earnest of he future more and more frequent visit to that study become necessary for its gratification and in the course of one of they mike confess to henry that he love he sister previously pile upon himself many anticipatory term of ignominy for daring to do so presumptuous a thing henry however be so take with the idea that in he singleness of mind he suffer no pang of retrospective suspicion of he friend 's love for himself pend esther 's decision -- and of she mind in the matter he have something more than a glimmer -- he welcome mike with gladness as a prospective brother-in-law and as soon as he find a opportunity leave they alone together return quite a long time afterwards -- to find they extraordinarily happy it would appear at he safe return esther and mike have thus be fortunate enough to get that important question of a mate settle quite early in life and to be save from those arduous and desolating experiment in be fit with a heart which so many less happy people have to go through but this happy fact be as yet a secret beyond this strict circle of three for strange as it may sound the beautiful attraction of a girl for a boy the beautiful worship of a boy for a girl be matter not even mentionable as yet in the mesurier household for a child particularly a girl under twenty to speak of have a sweetheart be a offence which have a strong savor of disgust in it even for mr mesurier broad-minded as in most matter she be so far as the only decent theory of the relation of the sex be involuntarily explicit by virtue of certain explosion on the subject it be something like this : that at a certain age say twenty-one or for leniency twenty as it be on the striking of a clock the young girl who previously have be profoundly and inexpressibly unconscious that the male be exist would suddenly sit up wide awake in a attitude of attention to offer of marriage and that similarly the young man who have meanwhile live with he eye shut and he sens asleep would jump up also at the striking of a clock and as it be with hilarity say it be high time i choose a wife and thereupon begin to look about among the street and tennis-party know to he for that impossible paragon -- a wife to satisfy both he parent one or two of henry 's earliest trouble and most drastic punishment have come of a propensity to sweetheart develop at a indecorously early age and in fact at the time of which i write he could barely recall the name of miss this or miss the other by the association of ancient physical pang suffer for they sake the greatest danger to such contraband passion be undoubtedly the post for in the mesurier household a more than russian censorship be exercise over the incoming and -- as far as it could be control -- the outgoing mail one old morning at family breakfast which the subsequent event of the evening be to fix on he mind henry mesurier have grow white with fear as the stupid maid have hand he a fat letter address in a sprawling school-girl 's hand who be you letter from henry ask the father henry blush and boggle pass it over to I resistance be worse than useless as in war-time a woman will see she husband set up against a wall and shot before she face as a conspirator see the hand of the police close upon papers of the most terrible secrecy so do henry watch that scented little package pass with a sense of irrevocable loss into the cold hand of he father the father open it place a little white enclosure by the side of he coffee-cup for further inspection and then read the letter -- full of darling and for ever -- with the severe attention he would have give a business letter then he hand it across to the mother without a word but with the look one doctor give another in discover a new and terrible symptom in a patient on whom they be consult while the mother read the father open the little packet and out roll a tiny plait of silky brown hair tie into a loop with a blue ribbon disgust exclaim the father and mother simultaneously to each other as though the boy be not there i be shock at you henry say the mother i shall certainly write to the forward little girl 's parent say the father oh do not do that father exclaim the boy in terror and half wonder if so sweet a thing could really be so criminal do not dare to speak to I say the father leave the breakfast-table i will see you again this evening henry know too well what the verb to see signify under the circumstance and the day pass in such apprehensive gloom that it be a positive relief when evening have at last come to feel a walking-cane about he at once more snaky and more notch than any previously apply to he stubborn young frame not to cry be of course a point of honor and as the infuriating absence of tear inflamed the righteous anger of the parent the stick splintered and break with a crash in which accident henry learn he be responsible for a double offence i would not have break that stick for five pound say the father he interest suddenly withdraw from he son it be give to I by my old friend tarporley which as can be imagine be a mighty satisfaction to the sad small soul smart not merely from the stick but from the sense that life hold something stupid in its injustice in that he be thus be maul for the most beautiful exalted feeling that have ever visit he young heart those dark age of oppression be long since pass for henry and esther when mike begin to steal in of a evening to see esther and they be only refer to now and again anecdotally as the nineteenth century look back at the day of the holy inquisition but still it be wise to be cautious for a interdict against mike 's come to the house be quite within possibility even in this comparatively enlighten epoch and that would have be even more effective than jame mesurier 's old friend tarporley 's stick of sacred memory chapter vi the beginning of the end of home recall for another moment or two the ancient affair of the heart describe in the last chapter it may pertinently be add that jame mesurier fulfil he threat on that occasion and have in fact write to the forward little girl 's parent could he have see the rather amuse reception of he letter he would have realize with sorrow that a age of parental leniency little short of degeneration be in certain quarter unmistakably supplant the stern age of which he be in a degree a anachronistic survival that forward little girl 's parent chance to know jame mesurier enough by sight and reputation to respect he while they smile across to each other at he rather quaint disciplinarianism could henry mesurier have see that smile he would not only have feel reassure as to the fate of he little sweetheart but have understand that there be temperate zone of childhood as well as arctic when young life wax gaily to the sound of laughter and other musical accompaniment this revelation however be defer some few year till he become acquaint with the merry family of which mike laflin be the characteristic expression old mr laflin be a little jolly bald-headed gentleman bubble over with mirth who like to have young people about he and in he quip and crank be as young as and much cleverer than any of they it almost startle henry on he first introduction to this family of two daughter and two brother where the father be rather like a brother grow prematurely bald and the stepmother supply with monumental dignity that element of solemnity without which no properly regulate household be complete to notice the _ camaraderie _ which prevail amongst they all joke be fly about from one to another all the time and the father make a point of cap they all this be home in a liberal sense which the word have never mean to henry doubtless it have its own individual restriction and censorship but its surface be at all event debonair and it be serviceable to henry as reveal the existence of more genial social climate than that in which he have be nurture -- though in make the comparison with he own atmosphere he realize that this _ bonhomie _ be nothing more important than a grace perhaps nay very surely the seriousness even the severity of he own training have be among the very condition need to make he what he some day hope to be though they have seem so purposely inimical have jame mesurier 's religion be more free and easy a matter less personally assure and momentous he son 's almost oppressive sense of the spiritual significance of existence have be less radiant and constantly support life might have gain in superficial liveableness but it would have lose in intensity in real importance and with that loss would have go too henry 's chance of be a poet the poet in a golden clime be bear -- once and again maybe but more often he come from a land of iron and tear it be in the nature of thing that henry should begin to appreciate the service of he home to he development at the moment when he be leave it and the mere pang of the parting from it when one day the hour for parting have surely come be much more deep and complicated than he could have dream as in we body we become conscious of certain vital centre certain dependency of relation and harmony only when they have suffer shock so often in life we may go along unconscious of the vital dependency of we human relationship till the moment come to strain or sever they then a thousand hidden nerve quiver at the discover touch of the knife henry 's leave home though it have be originally the suggestion of violent feeling be not to be a actual severance he father 's leave my house for ever have owe something to the rhetoric of anger and the expulsion and cut off which it have imply have since be so soften as practically to have disappear henry be certainly not leave he father 's house for ever but merely go into lodgings with a friend with full privilege to visit he own home as often as he choose still he be all the same leave home and he be the first to leave it the mother at all event know that this be the beginning of the end know that with she first-born 's departure -lrb- desertion she may have call it -rrb- a new era have commence for the home -- the era of disintegration for twenty year and more it have be all building and building now it would be all just pull down again and there be a dreary sound as of demolition and wind-driven rain in she ear oh tragic love of mother of no love be the final loss and doom so inevitably destine the husband may desert the wife but the son be sure to desert he mother -- must for nature demand the desertion put not you trust in prince -- and yet put it rather in prince oh fond and doting parent than in the blue-eyed flower of childhood for which year after year with labor infinite you would buy all the sunshine of the world henry 's pang at leave home be mainly the pang of parting with he mother it seem more than a mere physical parting it be he childhood that be parting from she for ever when he come to see they he would be something different -- a man a independent be as long ago physically now spiritually the umbilical cord have be cut with esther and dot and mat the parting be hardly a parting as it be rather a promise of they all meeting together some day in a new place of freedom which there be a sense of he go out to prepare for they they way would be he way as the mother 's could not for theirs be the highway of youth which sooner or later they would all take together singing in the morning sun the three younger sister the as yet unopened bud of the family flower take henry 's departure with the surface tear and the central indifference of childhood when a family be so large it practically include two generation in itself and these three girl be really to prove a generation so different in characteristic from they four elder as to demand a separate chronicle to themselves thus as henry drive away amid he trunk from the home of he father -lrb- genealogical poverty deny we the romantic grandiloquence of the plural -rrb- it be he mother 's farewell arm and farewell tear and he farewell promise to she of which he be mainly conscious he have promise to take care of himself and particularly to beware of damp sheet and then he too have burst into tear indeed it be generally a tearful business after which everybody be glad to retire into corner to subside privately and dry themselves henry crouch in the corner of he cab with fully half he cry to finish out and curiously all the time a sad little story from a old holiday in the country keep haunt he it be at once a fact and a fable concern a happy little family of swallow whose sudden tragedy he have see with he own boyish pity eye in a little vinery attach to a old country house which the mesurier have rent for a month or so for certain successive summer two swallow have build they nest and in due course there be three young swallow to keep they company it be understand that the door of the vinery must be leave open that the parent swallow might fly to and fro for food but by some accident it chance that the door be one day close and the vinery not visit again for several day when at last the door be open again the sight that meet young eye be one henry have never forget three little starve swallow hardly bigger than butterfly lay upon the floor and from the nest above hang the long horse-hair with which the parent have vainly seek to anchor they safely to the home but still sadder detail be forthcoming when the child who have be wonder what have become of the parent have suddenly discover they waste body in the grass a yard or two away from the vinery door a few day ago this have be a happy thrive home and now it be absolutely desolate do away with for ever it need no exceptional imagination or sympathy to conceive the agonised longing of the parent as they have dash themselves again and again upon that cruel unyielding door hear the piteous cry of they young one within and the anguish in which they exhaust little life have at last go out the young swallow have die for lack of food but the old one have die -- for love have some other hand bring they food would the young one have miss the old one like that chapter vii a link with civilisation on the afternoon follow henry 's departure esther go out for a walk and she come presently to a pretty little house half hide in its big garden a well-kept lawn richly bath in sunlight flash through the tree and open the gate and follow the tree-shaded path along one side of the house esther presently mount to a small terrace where as she have hope she come upon a dainty little lady water she flower why esther it be you how sweet of you i be just die to see you exclaim the little lady turn a pretty but somewhat worn and brilliantly sad face from she gardening just let I finish this thirsty bed and then you must give I a kiss there then the two embrace and as mr myrtilla williamson hold esther at arm 's length and look at she admiringly -- how pretty you look to-day she exclaim generously that new hat 's a great success do not i tell you mauve be you color turn round yes dear you look charming where in the world i wonder do you all get that grand look of yours from -- i do not mean you good look merely but that look of distinction you father and mother have it too but where do _ they _ get it from you be a puzzle-family -- all of you but would not you like a cup of tea come in and she lead the way indoors to a tiny sweet-smelling boudoir on the left of the hall of which a dainty glimpse with its book and water-colour and bibelot be to be catch from the terrace everything about myrtilla williamson be scrupulously determinedly dainty from the flowered tea-gown about she slim girlish figure -- she predilection for that then novel and suspect garment be regard as a sure mark of a certain parisian levity by she neighbor -- to she just a little precious enunciation in france in the seventeenth century she would almost certainly have be a visitor at the hotel rambouillet and to-day she be mysteriously and disapprovingly speak of as aesthetic she have a look as if she have trip out of a japanese fan and sleep at night in a pot-pourri jar and she have brain those good thing -- brain she name be very like she life one-half of which might be describe as myrtillum the other half as williamson she be myrtillum during the day dabble with she water-colour she flower or she book but at six o'clock each afternoon with the sound of aggressive masculine boot in the hall she life suddenly change with a sigh to williamson the williamson half of she life be so clumsily so grotesquely ill-matched with the myrtillum half that it be and probably will always remain a mystery why she have ever attempt so tasteless and inconvenient a addition -- a mystery however far from unique in the history of those mysteriously stupid unhappy marriage with evident boor which refine and charming woman will it be to be fear go on make to the end of the human chapter it be perhaps a day hardly less interesting for myrtillum than for the young people themselves when she have first meet henry and esther mesurier before in the dull bourgeois society into which williamson have transplant she from london she have find none with whom she dare be she natural myrtillum there she be expect to be williamson to the bone henry and esther however be only too grateful for myrtillum through whom be to come to they the revelation of some minor grace of life for which they have the instinct but on which they have lack instruction and who still more important at least for henry be to be they first fragile link with certain strenuous new northern writer translation of whom in every tongue have just then descend gothlike upon europe to the great energising of its various literature she it be too who first hand they the fret golden key to the enchanted garden of the pre-raphaelite and the striking head of the young dante in sepia which have hang in a sort of shrine-recess in henry 's study have be copy for he from rossettus 's sketch by myrtillum 's own hand she have too one of the most precious gift for friendship the gift of unselfish and diligent and progressive appreciation of all a friend 's good point she never flatter but she never miss the smallest opportunity for praise she be one of those rare people who make you feel happy in yourself who send you away somehow dignified profitably raise in you own esteem just as other have a mysterious power of deject you in you proudest moment if you have any charm however shy myrtillum williamson would find it and send you away with a great gush of gratitude to she because it have be find at last this be perhaps the greatest charm of she clever letter they be all about you -- not of course that you do not want to hear about she but frequently all she tell you of herself be she name perhaps she would write in the half-hour that remain between say a visit from esther and the arrival of williamson to fix in a few intimate vivid word the charm of they afternoon together and tell esther in some new gratifying way what she be to she and why and how she be it or when henry have be there -- even more carefully in the absence of williamson -- to read she he new poem she would write he a long letter of literary criticism just perceptibly vibrate with the emotion she might have feel for the romantic young poet whom she allow to call himself she cavaliere servente have she not be williamson as well as myrtillum and have she not as she somewhat unscientifically declare be old enough to be he mother well she say as they sip they tea so henry 's really go he slip round to bid I a sort of good-bye yesterday and tell I the whole story on the whole i be glad though i know how you 'll miss each other but i be sorriest for you mother yes yes i be sorry for she you must try to make it up to she dear child i think just that above all thing would make I fear to be a mother one can do without child and there be a certain implication in the conversational atmosphere that child of the name of williamson have be mercifully spare the world but when once they have come into one 's life it must be terrible to see they go out again i should like to come round and have a little talk with you mother i wonder if she would care to see I so long as you do not come in you tea-gown say esther with a laugh cruel child and then with a way she have of suddenly find something she want to hear of among the interest of she friend now she say tell I something about mike i suppose the course of true love run as smoothly as ever happy child give he my love when you see he will not you esther tell all there be to tell about mike up-to-date and wish she could have repay she friend 's sympathetic interest with a request for something similar about williamson but it be tacitly understand that there be nothing further to be say on that subject and that the news of myrtillum 's life could hardly again take any more excitingly personal form than the bric-a-brac excitement of art or literature -- though indeed art and literature be to be just to they far more than bric-a-brac in the life of myrtillum williamson they be indeed it be easy to see a very sustain religion for the lonely little woman who have no child to study and have complete she study of williamson be drive a good deal upon the study and development of herself the williamson half of the day provide she fully with opportunity for the practice of all the philosophy she be likely to acquire from writer ancient and modern and for the absorption of all the consolation history and biography be likely to afford in the story of woman similarly circumstance it be to be fear that myrtillum not only wear tea-gown in advance of she time but be also somewhat prematurely something of a new woman but this be a subject on which she really do very little to poison esther 's young mind esther 's young mind in common with those of she two subsequent sister be little in need of poisoning from outside on such subject indeed it be a curious phenomenon to observe how all these young mind spring from a stock of such ancient unquestioning faith have so to say be bear poison or to state the matter less metaphorically have all be bear with instinct for the most pitiless and effortless reasoning on all subject human and divine as the hour approach when poor myrtillum must change back to williamson esther rise to say good-bye come again soon dear girl you do not know the good you do I the good dear woman be entirely do by she unwearied sympathetic discussion of the affair and dream of esther mike and henry oh here be a wonderful new book i intend to talk to you about you can take it with you i have finish it come next week and tell I what you think of it as esther walk down the path myrtillum watch she and as she pass out of the gate wave she a final kiss of parting and turn indoors there seem something ever so sad about she dainty back as it disappear into the doorway poor little woman say esther to herself as she look to see the title of the book she be carry it include a curious russian name the correct pronunciation of which she foresee she must ask myrtillum on they next meeting it be the journal of marie bashkirtseff chapter viii a rhapsody of tyre sidon the stage of the move event so far record though it make much of possess a separate importance be really a cross-river residential suburb of tyre the great seaport in which all the ship of the world come to and fro during the day sidon be virtually empty of its men-folk and be give up to perambulator and feminine activity generally for the man have stream across the ferry that bridge the sunny boisterous river to the dock and office of tyre though tyre be not a very old city it be not so new as to be deny a few of those association know as historical tyre have once the honor to be take by prince rupert and long before that its nucleus have exist as a monk 's ferry by which traveller be row across the river to the monastery and posting-house at sidon sometimes of a evening henry and mike would think of those far-off time as they look over the ferry-boat at the long line of river light with they restless heaving reflection and sometimes they could picture to themselves the green sloping bank of the virgin field and hear the priory bell call to they out of the darkness but such be the faintest of they vision and they love the river bank best as they be to-day with they egyptian wall and swarm light and tangled ship and whoso should think that that sordid commercial city give up to all the prose of trade day by day be not a poet at heart have never see she strange smile at evening when the shop be shut and the office empty and the man who know she not go home for then across the crowded roof softly come a strange sweetness and deep down among the gloomy wynd of desert warehouse still as temple sudden fairy of sunset dance and dazzle and touch the grimy wall with soft hand in lonely back room full of desk and dust haunt light of evening stand like splendid apparition and sometimes if you linger at the top of high street beneath the dark old church and the moon be out on the left of the steeple and the sunset die on the right die beyond the tangled mast and fading from the river you would forget you be a city clerk and you would wonder why the world be so beautiful why the moon be make of pearl and what it be that call to you out of yonder golden sea and you heart would fill with a strange gladness and you would call back to those unearthly voice i be yours yours all yours thus would this town of bale and merchant of office-desk and stool make poet at evening that she might stone they at noon for of course she would have forget it all in the morning and it be well not to remind she with you dream eye of she last night 's softness she will look back at you with stony misunderstanding and she new lover reality will sharply box you ear it be no use remind the exchange that it look like a scene from romeo and juliet in the moonlight it dare not admit it but wait patiently till the evening tyre will be yours again with the sunset she pretend all day that it be the mayor in the gilded coach and the pursy merchantman she care for but it be really you a poor shabby poet she love all the time for you only do she wear she gauzy silk at evening chapter ix a penitentiary of the mathematics yes mike be some day to be another kean and henry be to prove a serious rival to shakespeare but meanwhile they be clerk in the office of tyre of the rigor and therefore too the truancy and humor of the lot official mike be comparatively so comfortably circumstance as to have little knowledge he father be the king of a little flourishing prison of desk and mike be one of the heirs-apparent consequently he lot though dull be seldom bitter and many mitigation of it be within he privilege with henry it be different he be a humble unit among twenty other slave chained to that modern substitute for the galley the desk and in a wicked bargain he have contract to give he life-blood from nine in the morning till six in the evening for sixty pound a year with a occasional rise which after thirty year ' service might end in you have reach a proud annual three hundred for the rest of you maim and narrow day henry have come to the office straight from school at the age of sixteen and though classroom breathe a air sufficiently frigid and suggestive of inhuman interest and unmeaning discipline the icy air of that office have at first almost take he breath the place be so ridiculously serious there might conceivedly be interest in the world worthy of so abject a absorption so bleach a obeisance of the individual but henry with the dew of certain classic still upon he remember that anything really olympian in its importance be always strong enough to smile it be a lesser strength that must make the muscular effort of severity true dignity as often as possible stand at ease but here indeed be no true strength and dignity -- only prison-strengths and prison-dignity here the majesty the occupation the offence be alike frivolity fantastically change about into solemnity that first impression of abject bow head and chain rattle beneath desk be roughly correct for all that be human in a man this be a prison these man who bent over foolish papers be evidently convict of the most desperate character so at all event you would judge when occasionally one or other of the prison-governor know as partner pass among they with the lash of he eye such faint human twittering as may have grow up amongst even these poor exile would suddenly die into a silence white with fear as when the shadow of a hawk fall across the song of smaller bird no human relation be acknowledge here outside you may be a husband wonderfully beloved and tragically important you may be a man whose courage have be-medalled you brave breast you may be a passionate and subtle musician in you private hour you may even on sunday be a much appreciate vessel of the divine : but all such distinction be not current here here they be foreign coin diploma unacknowledged in this barbarous realm of ink and steel the more ignorant the more narrow the more mean the more unnatural you can contrive to be the better will be you lot in this sad monastery of mammon when the door hiss behind you with that little patent pneumatic device you cease to be a human being and begin to be -- the human machine all the vitality you have store within that pale body you be expect to exhaust here -- you have sell it do not you remember for sixty or three hundred pound a year you be not expect to have any leave over for pleasure that will be robbery master suffer much from peculation indeed in this way but a machine be in course of invention which shall put a end to this by the application of which to you heart the task-master will know whether or not you have spend every available heart-beat in he slavery during the day or whether you be endeavor you miserable thief to steal home with a little remnant of it for you child at night this be the theory of the office as henry once hear it express with a cynicism more brief and direct from the lip of one of he task-master but it must be admit that in certain respects he experience be extreme there be office which be the ear and eye of activity absorbingly and even romantically human to be in a shipping-office be not perhaps to be the rose but it be to live near it -- the great rose of the sea you be so to say a land-sailor a supercargo leave on shore you office-window be lash with hurricane you talk be frequently of cyclone the name of far romantic isle be constantly on you lip and you bill of lading be threepenny romance in themselves strange produce of distant land be you daily concern and the four wind meet at you counter with a savor of tar for all you know a pirate may claim you attention any minute of the day or again to be say in a corn-merchant 's a clearing-house of the fruitful earth there at you telephone you may hear the corn-fields whispering to you hear the wheat wave in the wind and the thin chatter of oats or you may sell butter and cheese in a office that smell of farm however remove you be a indirect agent of the earth a humble go-between of the season and the eternal need of man or once more you may be one of the thousand clerk of a great manufacturer and be humbly related to one of the art or craft that gladden the eye or add to the comfort of man or even though you may be deny so close a association with the element or the art you may be the pen to some subtle legal confidante of human nature you office may be store with record of human perversity and whimsicality you may be the witness to fantastic will or assist in the administration of the estate of lunatic at all event you will come within hearing of the human passion miser will visit you at time and beautiful lady in mourn deep as they distress and from you desk you will catch a glimpse of the sombre pageantry of litigious man though it be true that a certain far-off flavor of these legal excitement occasionally enliven the business to which henry have be sacrificially indenture for the most part it be a abstract parasitical thing which have succeed in persuade other business more directly feed from the human spring of its oblige usefulness in relieve they of detachable burden in fact it have no activity or interest of its own to account for so it propose in default of any such original reason for existence to look after the account of other as a self-constituted body of financial police for those engage in it except those who have be bear mentally deform or those who have become unnaturally pervert by long usage it be a sort of penitentiary of the mathematics chapter x the grass between the flag-stone yes it be a curiously unreal world and for the first day or two as henry bent lonely and bewildered over he desk study it furtively with question eye it seem to he as though he have stray into some asylum for the insane where fantastic interest and mock honor take the place of the real interest and honor of sane human being part of the business of the firm consist in the collection of house-rent frequently entail visit from tenant and question of repair a certain mr smith a wiry little grey-headed man with a keen face and a decisive manner look after this branch and the gusto with which he do it be one of henry 's earliest and most instructive amazement house-repair be quite evidently he poetry and he never seem so happy as when passionately wrangle with a tenant on some question of drain the word cesspool and wet-trap -- word to which i do not pretend to attach any meaning -- seem to be particular favorite of he in fact a hour seldom pass without they fall from he lip but mr smith 's great opportunity be a gale for that always mean a exciting harvest of dislodge chimney-pot fly slate and smash skylight which would impart a energetic interest to he life for day again in henry 's department -- for the office be cut into two half with about ten clerk in each the partner have of course they own private office from which they might dart out at any moment -- there be a certain little fussy chief clerk who be obviously a person of very mysterious importance he be frequently away evidently on mission of great moment for always on he return he would be closet immediately with one or other of the partner who in turn seem to consider he important too and would sometimes treat he almost like one of themselves actually condescend to laugh with he now and again over some joke evidently as mysterious as all the rest this mr perkin seldom notice the junior in he department though occasionally he would select one of they to accompany he on one of he mission to client of the firm and they would start off together as you may see a plumber and he apprentice sometimes in the street -- the proud master-plumber in front and the little apprentice plumber behind carry the lead pipe and the iron smelting-pot now do mr smith really take such a heart-interest in cesspool and wet-trap as he appear to do and do mr perkin really think he matter all that these be two of the earliest question which henry ask himself and as time bring the answer to they and kindred question there be unexpected element of comfort for the heart of the boy longing so desperately in that barren place for any hint of the human touch one day mr smith startle he by mention dickens and even charle lamb it be a kindly recognition of mesurier 's rumor interest in literature henry look at he in amazement oh you read then he exclaim of anything so human as read he have suspect no one in that office then as to the great mr perkin the time come when he be to prove very human indeed for die suddenly one day he various work have to pass into other hand and bit by bit it begin to leak out that those mission have not be so industriously devote to the interest of the firm nor be so carefully execute as have be imagine for mr perkin it transpire have be fond of he pleasure could appreciate wine and like a occasional informal holiday so posthumously he begin to wear for henry a faint halo of humanity indeed it do not take henry many day to realize that as grass will force its way even between the flag-stone in a prison-yard no little humanity contrived to support its existence even in this dead place by degree he realize that these apparently colourless and frigid figure about he have each they separate individuality engage or otherwise that they interest be by no means centre on the dull page before they and that for the most part they be very much in a like case with himself although thus immure from the world of reality they still maintain in vigorous activity many healthy outdoor interest and be quite keen in they enthusiasm for and remarkably instruct in the latest development of horse-racing football and prize-fighting likewise they have retain a astonishingly fresh and unimpaired interest in woman and still enjoy the simple earth-born pleasure of the glass and the pipe as he understand this henry begin to feel more at home and as the character of he associate reveal themselves he begin to see that there be amongst they several pleasant and indeed merry fellow and that after all fortune might have throw he into much worse company they on they side make like discovery in he he presently find himself admit to they freemasonry and initiate into they many secret way of mitigate they lot and shorten they long day thus this chill stern world of automaton which on first sight look as if no human word or smile or jest could escape the detection of its iron law reveal when you be once inside it a under-world of pleasant escape and exciting truancy of which as you grow accustomed to the risk and general condition of the life you be able skilfully to avail yourself the main principle of these be to seem to spend twice as much time on each task as it need that you might have the other half for such private use as be within you reach -- to elongate dinner-hour at both end so adroitly and on such carefully select propitious occasion that the elongation or at least the whole extent of it would pass unobserved and in general to gain time any waste end of five minute or quarter hour on all possible occasion if the reader call this shirk and robbery he must technically no doubt it be but these clerk without so formulate it merely exercise the right of all oppressed being liberally to interpret to they own advantage where possible the term of a unjust contract which grind economic condition have compel they to make they have be force to promise too much in exchange for too little and they equalise the disparity where they could whether they spend the time thus hoard in a profitable fashion be a question of personal definition it be usually expend in company of two or three with a pipe and a pot of beer and much spirited talk in the warm corner of adjacent tavern and so long as you do not drink too much there have perhaps be invent none pleasanter than that old-fashioned way of spend a hour certainly it be the way for ale to taste good and a pipe to seem the most satisfying of all earthly consolation it be almost worth the bondage to enjoy the keen relish of the escape by degree though the youngest there henry come to be allow a certain leadership in these sortie of the human element he make it he business to stimulate these unthrifty instinct and to fan the welcome spark of natural idleness and so successfully that at time there seem to have enter with he into that gloomy place a certain bacchic influence which now and again would prompt he comrade to such daring clutch of animated release that the spirit of it even pervade the penetralium of the senior partner 's office with the result that some mishap of truancy would undo the genial work of month and precipitate upon they for a while the rigor of a ten-fold discipline it be after such a occasion that in write to jame mesurier as to the progress of he son old mr septimus lingard have pay henry one of the proudest compliment of he young day i fear that we shall make little of you son henry he write he head seem full of literature and he be so idle that he be demoralise the whole office it take henry more than a year to win that testimonial but the odds have be so great against he that the wonder be he be ever able to win it at all mr lingard write demoralise it be he way of say humanise chapter xi humanity in high place one day however henry be to make the still more surprising discovery that not only be the clerk human being but that one of the partner -- only one of they -- be also human he make this discovery about the senior partner whose old-world figure and quaint name septimus searle lingard have in spite of he severity attract he by a certain musty distinction a stranger figure than septimus searle lingard have seldom walk the street of any town though not actually much over sixty you would have say he must be a thousand he abnormally long narrow shaven face be so thin and gaunt and hollowed and he tall upright figure be so painfully fragile that he black broadcloth seem almost too heavy for the worn frame inside it and nothing in the world else be ever so piercingly solemn as he keen weary old eye with he tall silk hat he thin white hair he long white face long black frock-coat and black trousers he look for all the world like a distinguished skeleton henry could never be quite sure whether he be to be class as a character or as a genuine personality one thing be certain that sometime or other or many time in he life he have do something or many thing which have win for he a respect as deep as he solemnity of aspect and certainly if gravity of demeanor go for anything all the owl of all the age in collaboration could not have produce a expression of time-honoured wisdom so convincing sometimes he old lantern-jaw would emit a uncanny cackle of a laugh and a ghastly flicker of humor play across he parchment feature but these only deepen the general sense of solemnity as the hoot of a night-bird deepen the loneliness of some desolate hollow among the hill it be this strange old ghost of a man that be to be the next to turn human and it come about like this right away at the top of the building be a lonely room where the sun never shine in which be store away the old account-book diary and various dead-and-done-with document of the firm and here too be deposit from time to time various wreckage of the same kind from other business whose last office have be do by the firm and whose record be still preserve in the unlikely event of any chance resurrection of claim upon or interest in they long forget name here crumble the last relic of many a ambitious enterprise -- great ledger with they cover still fresh lay like slab from which if you wipe away the dust the gilded name of founder company would flash as from gaudy tombstone letter-book burst with letter that no eye would read again so long as the world last yellow title-deed from which all the virtue have long since exhale and to which no dangling of enormous seal could any longer lend a convincing air of importance here everything be dead and dusty as a old shoe the dry bone in the valley of askelon be as child skip in the morning sun compare with the dusty death that moulder and moulder in this lonely locked-up room -- this catacomb of dead business it be seldom necessary to visit this room but occasionally henry would find a excuse to loiter a hour there for there be a certain dreary romance about the place and the almost choke smell of old leather seem to promise all sort of bury secret it can not be say that the place ever adequately gratify the sense of mystery it excite but after all to excite the sense of mystery be perhaps better than to gratify it and consider its poor material this room be quite a clever old mysteriarch one day however henry come upon some write that do greatly interest he though it be almost contemporary it be old mr septimus lingard 's diary for the year precede which he have get hold of -- not he private diary but the entirely public official diary in which he keep account of the division of he day among he various client -- for the most part a unexciting record but at the end of the book on one of the general memorandum page henry notice a square block of write which to he surprise prove to be a long quotation from a book which the old man have be read -- on the immortality of the soul have old mr septimus lingard a soul too a soul that trouble he maybe a soul that have its move memory and its immortal aspiration yes somewhere hide in that strange legal document of a body there be evidently a soul mr lingard have a soul but wait a moment here be a addition of the old man 's own the passage quote have be of death and its possible significance and it be just a sigh a fear the old man have breathe after it : _ how high have the winding-sheet encompass my own bosom _ solemn as be the word in themselves they seem doubly so in that lonely room and henry be glad to lock the door and return to the comparatively living world downstairs but from that moment old mr lingard be transfigure in he eye beneath all the sternness of he exterior the grimness of the business interest which seem to absorb he henry have discover the bless human spring and he come too to wear a certain pathos and sanctity in henry 's eye as he remember how old a man he be and that secretly all this time while he seem so busy with this public company and another he be quietly prepare to die from this moment task do for he come to have a certain joy in they for he sake as it be he begin to understand how you might take a pride in do well something that in you opinion be not worth do and one day when the old man well satisfy with some work he have do pat he kindly on the back and say we 'll make a business man of you after all the tear start to he eye and for a moment he almost hope that they would chapter xii damon and pythia by a odd coincidence the night which have see henry and esther confront they father have see in another household in which the young people count another member of they secret society of youth a similar but even less seemly clash between the generation ned hazell would be a poet too and a painter as well and perhaps a romantic actor but he father 's taste for he son 's future lay in none of these direction and ned be for the present in cotton now the elder mr hazell be a man of violently convivial habit and the _ bonhomie _ with which he be accustom to enliven bar-parlour up till eleven of a evening be apt to suffer a certain ungenial transformation as he reach he own front door there the wit would fail upon he lip the twinkle die out of he glance and a unaccountable ferocity towards the household that be wait up for he take they place when possible he would fix upon some trivial reason to give a air of plausibility to this curious change in he but if that be not forthcoming he would it appear fly into a violent rage for just that very reason however on this particular night heaven have provide he with a heroic occasion he son he discover be for once out later than he father in what haunt of vice or low place of drinking he be at the moment ensnare no one better than he father could imagine the opportunity be one not to be miss the outraged parent at last realize that he have bear with he long enough bear long enough with he folderol of art and nonsense and so determine be he on the instant that he would have no more of it that with a quite remarkable energy he have thereupon repair to he son 's room open the window and begin vigorously to throw he pretty edition he dainty water-colour he drawer full of letter he cast of the venus of milo out on to the lawn upon which at the moment a heavy rain be also fall in the very whirlwind of he righteous vandalism he son have return and be a muscular hot-blooded lad have take he father by the throat call he a drunken beast and hurl he to the floor where he pin he down with a knee on he chest and might conceivably have make a end of he but for the interference of mother and sister who succeed at last in get the daze and somewhat sober parent to bed have rake together from the sodden _ débris _ beneath he window some disfigured remains of he poor treasure ned hazell have leave the house in the early hour of the morning in good earnest for ever when he confide the excitement of the night to henry at lunch next day and hear in return he friend 's news nothing could be more plain than that they should set up lodgings together and it be therefore to the room of which ned be already in possession that henry 's cab have topple with he various belongings after those tearful farewell at he father 's door esther follow presently to help make the place straight and dainty for the two boy and have leave they late that evening with flower in all the jar and the curtain as they should be they be fairly launch on they new life together in mike henry have a stanch friend and a admirer against all comer and in henry mike have a friend and admirer no less loyal but they friendship be one for which a on-looker might have find it less easy to give reason than for that of henry and ned mike and henry love each other it would appear less for any correspondence in disposition or taste as just because they be mike and henry right away down in they nature there be evidently some central affinity which operate even in spite of surface contradiction there be much of this intrinsic quality in the affection of henry and ned also but it be much more to be account for by evident mutual sympathy it be largely the impassioned fellowship of two craftsman in love with the same art both have they literary ambition but irrespective of those they both love poetry yes how they love it ned be perhaps particularly a bear appreciator and it be worth see how the tear would come into he fine eye as he voice shake with tenderness over a fine phrase or a noble passage they have discover some of the most thrilling thing in english literature together at that impressionable age when such thing mean most to we together they have read keat for the first wonderful time together learn shakespeare 's sonnet by heart together roll out over tavern-table the sumptuous cadence of de quincey wonderful indeed and never to be forget be those evening when the day at last over they would leave they office behind they and while the sunset be turn the building of tyre into enchanted tower and a clemency of release breathe upon its street steal to the quiet corner of they favorite tavern to drink port and share they last new author or they own latest rhyme and then to emerge again with high calm heart and eloquent eye beneath the splendid star all the art within they reach they thus share together -- picture music theater -- in a fine comradeship together they have bravoe the great tragedian and together hopelessly worship the beautiful face ensky and saint of famous actress in fact they be the damon and pythia of tyre chapter xiii damon and pythia at the theater once long before the beginning of this story damon and pythia be sit in a theater together with the wonderful overture just begin to steal through they sens ah violin whither would you take they soul you call to they like the voice of one wait by the sea bath in sunset what be these wonderful thing you be whisper to they soul you promise -- ah what thing you promise strange voice of the string oh siren have pity they heart be pure they body sweet as apple oh be faithful betray they not beautiful voice of the wondrous world the overture have succeed they soul have follow it over the footlights and float in the limelight shine there await the fulfilment of the promise the play be pygmalion and galatea and at the appearance of galatea they know that the overture have not lie there in dazzling white flesh be all it have promise and when she call pyg-ma-lion how they heart thump -- for they know it be really they she be call pyg-ma-lion pyg-ma-lion it be as though cleopatra call they from the tomb they hand meet they could hear each other 's blood singing and be not the play itself a allegory of they come life do not galatea symbolise all the sleep beauty of the world that be to awaken warm and fragrant at the kiss of they youth and somewhere too shroud in enchanted quiet such a white white woman wait for they kiss in a vision they see life like the treasure cave of the arabian thief and they say to they beat heart that they have the secret of the magic word that the open sesame be youth no fall of the curtain could hide the vision from they young eye it transfigure the face of they fellow-playgoer crowd from the pit it make another stage of the ember of the sunset a distant bridge of silver far down the street then they take it with they to the tavern and to write of the solemn libation of that night would be to laugh or cry only youth can be so radiantly ridiculous they have find they own corner turn down the gas the fire play at day and night with they face imagine they in one of the flash solemnly raise they glass hand clasp across the table earnest gleaming eye hold each other above it old man some day somewhere a woman like that but there be still a sequel at home at last and in bed how could damon sleep it seem as if he have get into a rosy sunset cloud in mistake for he bed the candle be out and yet the room be full of roll light it be no use he must get up so strike a light he be presently deep in the composition of a fiery sonnet it be evidently that which have cause all the phosphorescence but a sonnet be a mere pill-box it hold nothing a mere cockle-shell -- and oh the rage sea it could not hold besides be confessedly a art-form duly licence to lie it be apt to be misunderstand it could not say in plain word meet I at the pier to-morrow at three in the afternoon it could make no assignation nearer than the isle of the blest after life 's fitful fever therefore it seem well to add a postscript to that effect in prose but then how be she to receive it there be nothing to be hope from the post and damon 's home in sidon be three mile from the ferry likewise it be now near three in the morning just time to catch the half-past three boat run up to the theater a mile away and meet the return boat so down down through the creaking house carefully as though he be a jason pick he way among the coil of the sleep dragon and soon he be shoot through the phantom street like mercury on a message through hade at last the river come in sight grow slate-colour in the earliest dawn he could see the boat nuzzle up against the pier and snore in its sleep he say to himself that this be styx and the fare a obolus as he jump on board with hot face and hotter heart charon click he signal to the engine the boat slowly snuffle itself half awake and shove out into the sleepy water as they cross the light grow and the gas-lamp of tyre beacon with fading gleam overhead begin a restlessness in the cloud as of a giant drowsily shuffling off some of he bedclothes but as yet he sleep and only the silver bosom of he spouse the moon be uncover when they land the street of tyre be already light but empty as though they have get up early to meet some one who have not arrive damon speed through they like a sea-gull that have the harbor to itself and be not long in reach the theater how desolate the play-bill look that have be so companionable but three or four hour before and there be she photograph surely it be a omen ah my angel see i be bring you my heart in a song ` all my heart in this my singing ' he drop the letter into the box but as he turn away momentarily glance up the long street he catch sight of a approach figure that could hardly be mistaken good heaven it be pythia and he too be carry a letter chapter xiv contribution towards a genealogy the egregious miss bashkirtseff do not greatly fascinate esther she egotism be too hard too self-bounded even for egotism and there be generally about she a lack of sympathy she passion for fame have something provincial in its eagerness and she broadest ideal seem to become limit by she very anxiety to compass they even she love of art seem a form of snobbery in all these young mesurier there be implicit -- partly as a bye-product of the sense of humor and partly as a unconscious mysticism -- a surprising instinct for allow the success of this world they proper value and no more even esther who be perhaps the most worldly of they all and whose ambition be largely social as become a bonny girl whom nature have mark out to be popular and on whom some day when mike be a great actor -- and have a theater of he own -- would devolve the care of populous at home day bright after-the-performance supper and all the various diplomacy of the popular wife of fame -- even esther however brilliant she life might become would never for a moment imagine that such success be a thing worth win at the expense of the smallest loss to such human reality as the affection she feel for mike and henry to love some one well and faithfully to be one of a little circle vow to eternal fidelity one to the other -- such be the initial success of these young life and it be to make they all they day safe from the danger of more meretricious success all the same though the chief performer in marie bashkirtseff 's confession interested she but little the stage on which for a little while she have scold and whimper do interest she -- for should it not have be she stage too and henry 's stage and dot 's stage father 's and mother 's stage too you have only to look at father to realize that nature have really mean he for the great stage here in sidon what be he but a god in exile bend great power and a splendid character upon ridiculously unimportant interest indeed be not he destiny more or less they destiny as a family henry would escape from it through literature and she through mike but what of dot what of mat not yet to speak of the child all she envy marie bashkirtseff be she opportunity great goddess opportunity so much have come to marie in the cradle and come daily to a hundred thousand insignificant aristocratic babe to approach which for the mesurier even ten year too late mean convulsion of the home and to attain which in any satisfactory degree be probably impossible french for example and music why if so disposed marie bashkirtseff might have read old french romance at ten and to play chopin at a earlier age be not surprising in the opportunitied so-called aristocratic infant oh why have they not be bear like the other sidonian whose nature and ideal have be mercifully calculate to the meridian of sidon why do not they think the proudfoot and the wilkinson and the wagstaff and other local nobody-somebodies people of importance and why do they think the mayor a ludicrous upstart and the adjacent jp a sententious old idiot far better to have rest content in that state of life to which god have call they to talk french or to play chopin what do it matter in one sense nothing but in another it matter like other convenient facility of life to the immortal soul it matter nothing but to the mortal social unit it make life the easier make the passage of idea the intercourse of individuality the readier and in general facilitate spiritual and intellectual as well as social communication to be first-rate in you instinct in all you fiber and third-rate in you opportunity -- that be a bitter indignity of circumstance this sub-conscious sense of aristocracy -- it must be observe lest it should have be insufficiently imply -- be almost humorously dissociate in the mind of the young mesurier from any record family distinction in so far as it be conscious it be defiantly independent of genealogy have the mesurier possess a coat-of-arms jame mesurier would probably have keep it lock up as a frivolity to be ashamed of for it be a part of he puritanism that such earthly distinction be foolishness with god but as a matter of fact between adam and the immediate great-grandparent of the young mesurier there be a void which the herald 's office would have find a difficulty in fill this it never occur to they to mind in the least it be one of henry 's deep-sunken maxim that a distinguished product imply a distinguished process and that at all event the genealogical process be only illustratively important it would have be interesting to know how they the mesurier come to be what they be in the dark night of they history a family portrait or two or a occasional reference in history would have be a entertaining illumination -- but such not be forthcoming they be documentally so much the less indebted to they progenitor yet if they have only be able to claim some ancestor with a wig and a degree for the humanities or some beautiful ancestress with a romantic reputation one 's own present be so much more interesting for develop or even repeat some one else 's past and yet how much better it be to be as they be than as most scion of aristocratic lineage whose present be so often nothing and they past everything how humiliating to be so pathetically inadequate a outcome of such long and elaborate preparation -- the mouse of a genealogical mountain yes it be immeasurably more satisfactory to one 's self-respect to be something out of nothing than nothing out of everything here so little have make so much here so much have make -- hardly even a lord it be better for you circumstance to be inadequate for you than you to be inadequate for you circumstance henry have amuse himself one day in make a list of all they ancestor to whom any sort of worldly or romantic distinction could attach and it run somewhat as follow : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- a great-grandmother on the father 's side fabled to live in some sort of a farm-house château in guernsey who once a year up till two year ago when she die have send they a hamper of apple from channel island orchard say château believe by he child to descend to jame mesurier but the latter indifferent to the matter and relative on the spot probably able to look after it -lrb- 2 -rrb- a great-grandfather on the mother 's side give to travel a rolling-stone fond of book and talk and rich in humanity survive still in a high-nosed old silhouette -lrb- 3 -rrb- a grand-uncle on the father 's side who be one of napoleon 's guard at st helena -lrb- 4 -rrb- a grandfather on the mother 's side who use to design and engrave little wooden block for pattern on calico-stuff and whose little box of delicate instrument evidently make for the trace of line and flower be one of the few family heirloom -lrb- 5 -rrb- a grandmother on the father 's side of whom nothing be know beyond the beautiful fact that she be irish -lrb- 6 -rrb- a grandfather on the father 's side who be a sea-captain sailing he own ship -lrb- barque the lucretium -rrb- to the west indy and who die of yellow fever and be bury in the odour of romance on the isthmus of panama -lrb- 7 -rrb- a uncle who have also be a sea-captain and who in rescue a wreck crew from a australian reef be himself capsize and after a long swim finally eat by a shark -- say shark be capture next day and find to contain he head entire two gold ring still in he ear which he wear for near-sightedness after the manner of common sailor and one of which after its strange vicissitude have find a resting-place in the secretaire of he brother jame mesurier such be the only accessible ancestry of the mesurier and it be to be fear that the last state of the family be socially worse than the first jame mesurier be unapproachably its present summit its alpine peak and he be make to suffer for it no little by humble and impecunious relative still whatever else they lack henry mesurier love to insist that these various connection be rich in character one or two of they inexhaustible in humor and they rare and somewhat timorous visit to the castle of they exalted relative jame mesurier be occasion of much mirthful embarrassment to the young people here the reader be request to excuse a brief parenthetical chapter by way of illustration which if he please he may skip without any loss of continuity in the narrative or the least offence in the world to the writer this present chapter will be find continue in chapter sixteen chapter xv merely a humble interruption and illustration of the last some peaceable afternoon when mr mesurier be enjoy a little doze on the parlor sofa and she three elder daughter be snatch a hour or two from housework -- they have already leave school -- for a little private read the drowsy house would suddenly be awaken by one loud wooden knock at the door now whoever can that be the three girl would impatiently exclaim and presently the maid would come to miss esther to say that there be a old man at the door ask for mr mesurier what be he name jane he would not give it miss he say it would be all right mr mesurier would know he well enough whoever can it be what be he like jane he look like a workman miss -- very old and rather dotey who can it be go and ask he he name again esther would then arouse she mother and the maid would come in to say that at last the old man have be persuade to confide he name as clegg -- samuel clegg tell the missus it be samuel clegg the old man have say with a certain amusing conceit she 'll be glad enough to see samuel clegg why say mr mesurier it be you father 's poor old uncle mr clegg now girl you must not run away but try and be nice to he he be a simple good old man mr mesurier be no more interested in mr clegg than she daughter but she have a great fund of humanity and a inexhaustible capacity for suffer bore brilliantly why i never she would say adapt she idiom to make the old man feel at home as he be presently usher in chuntering and triumphant you do not mean to say it be uncle clegg well we be glad to see you i be just have a little nap and so you must excuse my keep you wait ay mary it be right nice of you to make I so welcome i get a bit misdoubtful at the door for the young maid seem somehow a little frightened of I but when i tell the name it be all right ` samuel clegg ' i say ` she 'll be glad enough to see samuel clegg ' i say glad indeed murmured mr mesurier i should think so find a chair for you uncle esther ay the name do it chuckle the old man who as a matter of fact be anything but a humble old person and to whom the bare fact of existence and the name of clegg seem warrant enough for think quite a lot of yourself i be afraid you do not remember you old uncle say the old man to esther look dimly round and rather bewilder by the fine young lady actually he be only a remote courtesy uncle have marry they father 's mother 's sister oh of course uncle clegg say esther a true daughter of she mother but you see it be a long time since we see you and this be dorcas come and kiss you uncle dorca and this be matilda say mr mesurier ay say the old man and you be all grow up such fine young lady deary I mary but they must make you feel old we be just go to have some tea say esther would not you like a cup uncle i daresay you uncle would rather have a glass of beer say mr mesurier ay you be right there mary answer the old man right there a glass of beer be good enough for samuel clegg a glass of beer and some bread and cheese as the old saying be be good enough for a king but bread and cheese and water be not fit for a beggar all laugh obligingly and the old man turn to a bulge pocket which have evidently be on he mind from he entrance i have get a little present here from esther he say -- esther be the aunt after whom mike 's esther have be name -- bring out a little newspaper parcel but i must tell you from the begin well you know mary he continue i be feel rather low yesterday and esther say to I ` why not take a day off to-morrow samuel and see mary it 'll shake you up a bit and i 'll be bind she be right glad to see you ' ` why lass ' i say ` it be the very thing see if i do not go in the morning ' so this morning he continue she tidy I up -- you know she way -- and send I off but before i start she say ` here samuel you must take this with my love to mary ' i have keep it wrap up in this drawer for thirty year and only the other day we mary elizabeth say ` mother you might give I that old jug it would look nice in we little parlor ' but no i say mary elizabeth if any one 's to have that jug it be you aunt mary how kind of she murmured mr mesurier sympathetically yes those be she word mary say the old man unfold the newspaper parcel and reveal a ugly little jug of metallically glisten earthenware such as be turn out with strange pride from certain english pottery about seventy year ago it seem make in imitation of metal -- a sort of earthenware pewter and evidently it have be a great aesthetic treasure in the eye of mr clegg mr mesurier receive it accordingly how pretty she say and how kind of aunt esther they do not make such thing nowadays no it be a vallyble relic say the old man but you be worthy of it mary i would rather see you have it than any of they my word but i be glad i have get it here safely esther would never have forgive I ' now samuel ' she say as i leave ` mind you get home before dark and do not sit on the jug whatever you do ' meanwhile the young lady be in imminent danger of convulsion and at that moment further to enhance the situation a old lady of the neighborhood who occasionally drop in for a gossip be announce she be a prim little lady with cranford curl and a certain old-world charm and old-world vanity about she and very deaf she too be a character in she way but so different from old mr clegg that the entertainment to be expect from they conjunction be irresistible even to anticipate this be mr clegg a uncle of mr mesurier say poor mr mesurier by way of introduction howd ` ye do marm say mr clegg without rise mr turtle bow primly be you sure my dear i do not interrupt she say to mr mesurier shall i not call in some other day oh dear no say mr mesurier esther get mr turtle a little whisky and water oh my dear exclaim mr turtle only the least little drop in the world esther dear my heart you know my dear even so short a walk as this tire I out mr mesurier respond sympathetically and then by way of make himself pleasant mr clegg suddenly break in with such a extraordinary amenity of old-world gallantry that everybody be hair stand on end how old do you be he say bow to the new-comer i beg you pardon say mr turtle put she hand to she ear but i be slightly deaf how old do you be shout the old man though not unnaturally take aback at such a unwonted conception of conversational intercourse mr turtle recover herself with considerable humor and bridle with a old-world shake of she head say -- what would you take I for i should say you be seventy if you be a day promptly answer the old man oh dear no reply mr turtle with some pique i be only sixty last January well you carry you age badly retort the old man not to be beat what do he say my dear say the poor old lady turn to mr mesurier you carry you age badly shout the determine old man she should see we esther should not she mary the silence here of the young people be positively electric with suppress laughter two of they escape to explode in another room and esther and she mother be leave to save the situation but on such occasion as these mr mesurier grow positively great and the manner in which she contrived to turn the conversation and smooth over the terrible hiatus be a feat that admit of no worthy description presently the old man rise to go as the clock near five he have promise to be home before dark and esther would think he benighted if he should be late he evidently have be to america and back in that short afternoon well mary good-bye he say one never know whether we shall meet again i be get a old man eh uncle clegg you be worth twenty dead one yet say mr mesurier reassuringly what a strange old gentleman say mr turtle somewhat bewildered as this family apparition leave the room good-bye uncle clegg esther be hear singing in the hall good-bye be careful of the step good-bye give we love to aunt esther then the door would bang and the whole house breathe a gigantic sigh of humorous relief -lrb- this be the kind of thing girl at home have to put up with -rrb- well mother do you ever see such a funny old person say esther on she return to the parlor you must not laugh at he mr mesurier would say laugh herself he be a good old man no doubt he be good enough mother dear but he be unmistakably funny esther would reply with a whimsical thought of the family tree yes they be a distinguished race chapter xvi chapter fourteen conclude no the mesurier have absolutely nothing to hope for from they relation -- nothing to look back upon less to look forward to most family however poor and even _ bourgeois _ have some memory to dignify they or some one possible contingency of pecuniary inheritance at the very least they have a ghost-story in the family you seldom read the biography of writer or artist without find reference however remote to at least one person of some distinction or substance to have have even a curate for a ancestor or a connection would have be something some frail link with gentility now if instead of be a rough old sea-captain of a trading ship grandfather mesurier have only be a charming old white-headed admiral living in london and glad now and again to welcome he little country granddaughter to stay with he he would probably have be very dull but then he would have look distinguished and take one for walk in the park or buy one present in the burlington arcade at least old admiral always seem to serve this indulgent purpose in story at all event he would have be something some possible link with a existence of more generous opportunity dot and mat would then at least have see a nice boy or two occasionally and in time get marry as they deserve to be and thus escape from this little provincial theater of sidon who could look at dot and think that anything short of a miracle -- a miracle like esther 's own meeting with mike -- be go to find she a worthy mate in sidon and suppose the miracle happen once more in she case what of mat and all the rest to be the wife of a sidonian town-councillor at the highest -- what a fate henry and she have often discuss this inadequate outlook for they younger sister quite in the manner of those whose position of enlargement be practically achieve the only thing to be do be for henry to make haste to win a name as a writer and mike to make he fortune as a actor then another society would be at once open to they all yes what wonder be to take place then particularly when mike have make he fortune -- for the financial prospects of the young people be mainly centre in he literature seldom make much money -- except when it be not literature henry hope to be too good a writer to hope to make money as well but that would be a mere detail when mike be a flourishing manager for when that have come about have not henry promise he that he would not be too proud to regard he as he patron to the extent of accept from he a allowance of say a thousand a year no he positively would not agree to more than a thousand and mike have to be content with he promise to take that meanwhile what could girl at home do but watch and wait and make home as pretty as possible and by the aid of book and picture reflect as much light from a larger world into they life as might be on henry 's go away the three girl have promptly bespeak the reversion of he study as a little sitting-room for themselves here they concentrate they book and some few picture that appeal to taste in revolt against atlantic liner but not yet develop to the appreciation of those true classic of art -- to which indeed they have yet to be introduce such half-way master as leighton alma-tadema sant and dicksee be as yet to they something of what rossettus and burne-jone and certain old italian master be soon to become in book they have already learn from henry a truer or at all event a more strenuous taste and they would grapple manfully with carlyle and browning and presently meredith long before they life have use or understanding for such tremendous nourishment one evening as they be all three sit cosily in henry 's study -- as they still faithfully call it -- esther be read pride and prejudice aloud while dot and mat busy themselves respectively with macramé work and a tea-cosy against a come bazaar esther 's task in the house be somewhat illustrate by she part in the trio this evening she energy be mainly devote to the higher night of housekeeping to the aesthetic activity of the home -- arrange flower dust vase and picture and so on -- and the lightness of these employment be it be to be admit a occasionally raise grievance among the sister to dot and mat fall much more arduous and manual sphere of labor yet all be none the less grateful for the decorative innovation which esther act on occasional hint from she friend myrtillum williamson be able to make and if it be true that she hardly take she fair share of bed-making and pastry-cooking it be equally undeniable that to she be due the introduction of liberty silk curtain and cushion in two or three room she too -- alas for the mistake of young taste -- have also introduce paint tambourine and swathe the lamp in wonderful turban of puffed tissue paper be she to receive no credit for these service then it be she who have dare to do battle with she mother 's somewhat old-fashioned taste in dress and whenever the mesurier sister come out in something specially pretty or fashionable it be due to esther well on this particular evening she be as we have say take she share in the housework by read jane austen aloud to dot and mat when the door suddenly open and jame mesurier stand there a little aloof -- for it be seldom he enter this room which perhaps have for he a certain painful association of he son 's rebellion perhaps too the picture of this happy little corner of he child -- a world evidently so complete in itself and daily develop more and more away from the parent world in the front parlor -- give he a certain pang of estrangement perhaps he too feel as he look on they that same dreary sense of disintegration which have overtake the mother on henry 's departure and perhaps there be something of that in he voice as look at they with rather a sad smile he say -- you look very comfortable here child i hope that be a profitable book you be read esther oh yes father it be ` jane austen ' you know well i be sorry to interrupt you but i want a few word with dorca she can join you again soon so dot wonder what be in store for she rose and accompany she father to the front parlor where mr mesurier be peacefully knit in the lamplight dorca my dear he say when the door be close you mother and i have have a serious talk this evening on the subject of you join the church you be now nearly sixteen and of a age to think for yourself in such matter and we think it be time that you make some profession of you faith as a christian before the world the church jame mesurier refer to be that branch of the english nonconformist know as baptist and the profession of faith be the curious rite of baptism by complete immersion the importance claim for which by this sect be perhaps from a christian point of view make the less disproportionate by another condition attach to it -- the condition that not till year of individual judgment have be reach be one eligible for the sacred rite with that rationalism which religious sect be so skilful in apply to some unimportant point of ritual and so careful not to apply to vital question of dogma the baptist reasonably argue that to baptise a unthinking infant and by a external rite which have no significance except as the symbol of a internal decision declare he a christian be nothing more than a idolatrous mummery wait till the child be of age to choose for he or herself to understand the significance of the christian revelation and the nature of the profession it be call upon to make then if by the grace of god it choose aright let he or she be baptise and for the manner of that baptism if symbol be to be make use of by the christian church -- and it be hold wise among the baptist to make use of few and those the most central -- should they not be design as nearly after the fashion set forth in the bible itself as be possible the ordinance of the lord 's supper -- as it be call amongst they -- follow the procedure of the last supper as record in the gospel should not therefore the rite of baptism be in its detail similarly faithful to authority now in scripture as be well know baptism be complete immersion symbolic alike of the wash away of sin and also of the die to this world and the resurrection to the life eternal in christ jesus so much theology be breed in the bone of all the young mesurier and the youngest of they could as readily have capitulate these article of belief as they father who once more briefly summarise they to-night for the benefit of he daughter he end with something of a personal appeal it have be one of the grief of he life that henry and esther have both refuse to join they father 's church though esther always dutifully attend it every Sunday morning and it be think of they though without name they that he say -- i meet mr trotter yesterday -- mr trotter be the local baptist minister and dot remark to herself that she father be able to pronounce he name without the smallest suspicion that such a name as belong to a minister of divine mystery be rather ludicrous though indeed baptist minister seem always to have name like that -- and he ask I when some of my young lady be go to join the church i confess the question make I feel a little ashamed for you know my dear out of we large family not one of you have yet come forward as a christian no father say dot at last i hope my dear you be not go to disappoint I in this matter no indeed father say dot whose nature be pliable and sympathetic as well as fundamentally religious but i be afraid i have not think quite as much about it as i should like to and if you do not mind i should like to have a few day to think it out of course my dear that be a very right feeling for the step be a solemn one and should not be take without reverent thought you can not do better than to talk it over with mr trotter if you have any difficulty you can tell he and i be sure he would be delighted to help you be not it so mother well dear he continue you can run away now but bear in mind what i have say and i shall hope to hear that you have make the right choice before long kiss I dear and so with something of a lump in she throat dot return to the interrupted jane austen whatever do father want ask the two girl look up as she enter the room what do you think say dot he want I to be baptise chapter xvii dot 's decision now in thus appeal to dot she father have appeal to just the one out of all he child who be least likely to disappoint he to dot and henry have unmistakably be transmit the largest share of they father 's spirituality esther be not actively religious any more than she be actively poetic hers be one of those composite admirably balanced nature which include most quality and faculty but no one in excess of another such make those engage good woman of the world who be able to understand and sympathise with the most diverse interest and temperament as it be the characteristic of a good critic to understand all those various product of art which it would be impossible for he to create thus esther could have delight a saint with she sympathetic comprehension as she could have heal the wound of a sinner by she comprehensive sympathy but it be certain she would never be in sufficient excess spiritually work or sensually rebellious to be one or the other she be beautifully buoyantly normal with a happy expansive enjoy nature glad in the sunlight brave in the shadow optimistically look forward to blithe year of life and love with mike and she friend and not feel the necessity of be anxious about she soul or any other world but this she be not shallow but she merely realize life more through she intelligence than through she feeling to have become a baptist would have offend she intelligence without bring any satisfaction to spiritual instinct not in any event clamorous as for henry it be not only activity of intelligence but activity of spirituality that make it impossible for he to embrace any such narrow creed as that propose to he and for the present that spiritual activity find ample scope for itself in poetry dot 's however be a intermediate case with a intelligence active too she unite a spirituality torturingly intense but for which she have no such natural creative outlet as henry with she loss of the old creed -- in discard which these three sister have follow the lead of they brother with a curious instinctiveness almost it would seem independent of reasoning -- she spirituality have be leave somewhat bleakly houseless and she have often long for some compromise by which she could reconcile she intelligence to the acceptance of some established home of faith whose kindly enclose wall should be more genially habitable to the soul than the cold star-lit space which henry declare to be sufficient temple perhaps esther 's commiseration of she sister ' narrow opportunity be so far as it related to dot a little unnecessary for indeed dot 's ambition be not social by nature shy and meditative and with she religious bias have she be bear into a catholic family she might not improbably have find the world well lose in a sisterhood the puritan conscience have a uncomfortable preponderance in the deep place of she nature and far down in she soul like she father she would ask herself if pleasure could be the end of life -- be there not something serious each of we could and ought to do to justify he place in the world be we not all under some mysterious solemn obligation to do something however little in return for life mat on the other hand have no such scruple she be more like esther in nature with a touch of cynicism curl she dainty lip arise perhaps from a early divination that she be to lack esther 's opportunity perhaps it be because she be the pessimist -- the quite cheerful pessimist -- of the family that she be by far the cleverest and most industrious at the housework if it be she fate to be cinderella she might as well make the best of it with a cynical endurance and good-humour and be cinderella with a good grace probably the only glass slipper in the family have already fall to esther never mind though she good look might fade with be a good girl at home year by year what do it matter after all nothing matter in the end and thus out of a great indifference mat develop a great unselfishness and if you could name one special angel in the house of the mesurier she be unmistakably mat in addition to she religious prompting dot have lately develop a great sympathy for she father stand a little aside from the conflict between he and henry she be able to divine something of the feeling of both and she have now and again catch a look of loneliness on she father 's face that make she ready to do almost anything to please he of course the question be one for general consultation she know what henry would say it do not much matter anyhow he would say but it be a pity how be intellectual freedom to be win if those who have see the light should thus deliberately forego it time after time from such merely sentimental reason and when she see henry that be just what he do say but she say it would make father so happy yes i know he answer and it would be very beautiful of you besides of course in one way it be only a matter of symbolism but then on the other hand it be symbolism harden into dogmatism that have do all the mischief do it dear if you like i hardly know what to say as you say it will make father happy and i shall quite understand dot be one of those nature that like to seek and be liable to take advice so after see henry she think she would see what mr trotter have to say for in spite of he unfortunate name mr trotter be a gentle cultivate mind and be indeed somewhat incongruously perhaps in a mild way jesuitically circumstance as a baptist minister henry and he be great friend on literary matter and dot and he have have many talk greatly helpful to she on spiritual thing in fact chrysostom trotter be one of those numerous half-way man between the old belief and they new modification which the continuous advance of scientific discovery and philosophical speculation on the one hand and the obstinate survival of christianity on the other necessitate -- if man of spiritual intuition who be not poet and artist be to earn they living there be nothing you could say to chrysostom trotter provide you say it reverently that would startle he he know all that long ago and far more for though oblige to trade in this backwater of belief he be in many respects a very modern mind you be hardly likely to know you herbert spencer as intimately as he and all the most exquisite literature of doubt be upon he shelf though you might declare he superficially disingenuous you could not unless you be some commonplace atheist or materialist gainsay the honest logic of he position you believe that the world that life be a spiritual mystery he would say yes you do not for a moment think that any materialistic science have remotely approach a adequate explanation of its meaning certainly not you believe too that however it come about and whatever it mean there be a eternal struggle in man between what for sake of argument we will call the higher and lower nature yes well then this spiritual mystery this struggle be hint at in various media of human expression in a ever-changing variety of human symbol art chiefly concern itself with the sexual mystery with the wonderful love of man and woman in its explanation of which alone science be so pitifully inadequate literature more fully concern itself with the mystery of man 's indestructibly instinctive relation to what we call the unseen -- that be the whole the cosmos god or whatever you please to call it but more than literature religion have for century concern itself with these consideration have consciously and industriously seek to make itself the science of what we call the soul it have throw its observation just as poetry and art have throw they observation into symbolic form of which christianity be incomparably the most important you do not reject the revelation of human love because hero and leander be probably creation of the poet 's fancy will you reject the revelation of divine love because it chance for its greater efficiency in win human heart to have find expression in a similar human symbolism personally i hold that christ actually live and be literally the son of god but be the human literalness of he divine story discredit the eternal verity of human degeneration and a mysterious regeneration would be no whit disprove externally christianity may be a symbol essentially it be a science of spiritual fact as really as geology be a science of material fact and as for its miraculous supernatural side -- be the law of nature so easy to understand that we should find such a difficulty in accept a few divergency from they he who can make law for so vast a universe may surely be capable of invent a few comparatively trivial exception not perhaps in so many word but in some such spirit would chrysostom trotter argue and it be in some such fashion that he talk in he charmingly sympathetic way with dorca mesurier one afternoon as she have tea with he in a study breathing on every hand the man of letter rather than the minister of a somewhat antiquated sect my dear dorca he say you know I well enough -- you know I perhaps better than you father know I -- know I well enough to believe that i would not urge you to do this thing if i do not think it be right _ for you _ -- as well as for you father and I but i know it be right and for this reason you be a deeply religious nature but you need some outward symbol to hold on to -- you need so to say the magnetising association of a religious organization henry can get along very well as many poet have with he bird and he sunset and so forth but you need something more authoritative it happen that the church i represent the church of you father be nearest to you you might with all the goodwill in the world so far as i be concerned embrace some other modification of the christian faith but here be a church so to say ready for you familiar by long association endear to you father you believe in god you believe in the spiritual meaning of life you believe that we poor human being need something to keep we eye fix upon that spiritual meaning -- well dear dorca he end abruptly what do you think i 'll do it say dot good girl say the minister sometimes it be a form of righteousness to waive we doubt for those who be at once so dear and good as you father and do not for a moment think that it will leave you just where you be these outward act be great energiser of the soul dear dorca i welcome you into one of god 's many church so it be that dot come to be baptise and to witness the ceremony all the mesurier assemble at the chapel that Sunday evening -- even henry who could hardly remember when he use to sit in this still-familiar pew and scribble love-verse in the back of he hymn-book during the sermon to the mere mocker the rite of baptism by immersion might well seem a somewhat grotesque antic of sectarianism but to any one who must need find sympathy for any observance into which in whatsoever forget and supersede time have pass the prayerful enthusiasm of man the rite could hardly fail of a move solemnity as chrysostom trotter order it it be certainly make to yield its fullest measure of impressiveness to begin with the chapel be quite a comely edifice inside and out and its ministerial end with its singer ' gallery back by great organ pipe and front by a handsome pulpit which mr trotter have dare to garnish with chrysanthemum on each side of he bible have a modest sacerdotal effect beneath the pulpit on ordinary occasion stand the communion-table but on evening when the rite of baptism be prepare this table and a board on which it stand be remove reveal a tiled baptistry -- that be a tiled tank about eight foot long and six wide with step on each side descend into about four foot of water towards the close of the service the minister would leave he pulpit and during the singing of a hymn would presently emerge from he vestry in a long waterproof garment as the hymn end some sister or brother that night to be admit into the church would timidly join he at the baptistry side and together they would go down into the water hold the hand of the new communicant the minister in a solemn voice would say sister or brother on confession of you faith in we lord and savior jesus christ i baptise thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost then the organ would strike up a triumphant peal and to the accompaniment of its music and the mellow plashing of the water the sister or brother would be plunge beneath the symbolic wave great be the excitement needless to say in the mesurier pew as little dot at last come forth from the vestry and steal down into the water take the minister 's out-stretched hand there she be there be dot pass round the pew and the hardest young heart whoever it belong to stop beat to hear the minister 's word they seem to come with a special personal tenderness -- sister on confession of you faith in we lord and savior jesus christ i baptise thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost once more the organ triumphant and the mellow splashing of the water dear little dot she have do it do you see father 's face esther whisper to henry yes perhaps none of they would ever do such a beautiful thing as dot have do that night at least there be one of jame mesurier 's child who have not disappointed he chapter xviii mike and he million pound the most exquisite compliment a man have ever pay to he be word something like this : well dear you certainly know how to make love and this compliment be always the reward not of passion however sustain or sentiment however refine but of humor whimsically fantasticate and balance both it be the gentle laugh not violate but just humanise that very solemn kiss the quip that just save passion from topple over the brink into bathos that mark the skilful lover no lover will long be successful unless he be a humourist too and be able to keep the heart of love amuse a lover should always be something of a actor as well not of course for the purpose of feign what he do not feel but so that he may the better dramatise he sincerity mike have therefore many advantage over those merely pretty fellow whose rivalry he have once be modest enough to fear he be a master of all the child 's play of love and to attempt to describe the fancy which he find to vary the game of love would be to run the risk of expose the limitation of the literary medium no word can pull those whimsical face or put on those heart-breaking pathetic expression with which he love to meet esther after some short absence sometimes he would come into the room a little forlorn sparrow of a creature signify by a dejection in which he very clothes take part that he be out in the east wind of circumstance and no one in the world care a shabby feather for he he would stand shiver in a corner and look timorously from side to side till at last he would pretend she have warm he with she kiss and generally make he welcome to the world sometimes he would come in with he collar dismally turn up and a old battered hat upon he head and pretend that he have not have a meal -- of kiss -- for a whole week and occasionally he would come blow out he cheek like a king 's trumpeter to announce that mike laflin might be at any moment expect but for the most part these impersonation be in a minor key as mike have soon discover that the more pathetic he be the more he be hug and call a weenty which be one of he own sad little name for himself one of he long-run fairy-tale as he would call they be that each morning as he go to business he really start out in search of a million pound which be somewhere await he and which he might break he shin over at any moment it might be here it might be there it might come at any hour of the day the next post might bring it it might be in yonder parcel delivery van -- nothing more probable or at any moment it might fall from heaven in a parachute or be at that second pass through the dock-gates wearily home from the island of sugar and spice you never could tell well mike say esther one evening as he come in hop in a pitifully wounded way and explain that he have be one of the three raven sit on a bough which the cruel huntsman have shoot through the wing etc have you find you million pound to-day no not my million pound say mike i be tell i shall find they to-morrow who tell you the weenty you silly old thing give I a kiss be you a dear tell I be not you a dear no-p i be only a poor little houseless roofless windowless chimney-less esther-less brainless out-in-the-wind-and-the-snow-and-the-rain mike you be the biggest dear in the world no i be not i be the littlest suppose you find you million pound mike suppose do not i tell you i be sure of it to-morrow well when you find it to-morrow what will you do with it i 'll buy the moon the moon yes as a present for henry would not it be rather dear not at all twenty thousand would buy it any time this last hundred year but the worst of it be no one want it but the poet and they can not afford it yet if only a poet could get hold of it why what a literary property it would be you silly old thing no but you do not seem to realize that i be quite serious think of the money there would be for any poet who have acquire the exclusive literary rights in the moon within a week i would have it placard all over ` literary trespasser will be prosecute ' and then i have no doubt henry would lend I the man in the moon for my christmas pantomime after all it be not a bad idea say esther of course it be not say mike but be careful not to mention it to henry just yet i should not like to disappoint he -- for of course before we take any final step in the purchase we would have to make sure that it be not as some people think make of green cheese but never mind about the moon tell we how you get on with the sothern the sothern be a amateur dramatic club in tyre which take itself very seriously and to which mike be seek admission as a first step towards london management he have that day pass a examination before three of the official member solemn and important as though they have be the honorable director of drury lane and have be admit to membership in the club with the promise of a small part in they forthcoming performance oh that be good say esther what be they like oh they be all right -- rather humorous they give I ` eugene aram ' to read -- I read ` eugene aram ' -- and a scene out of ` london assurance ' which be of course better naturally not one of the man be the remotest bit like himself one be a queer kind of irve another a sad sort of arthur robert and the other be -- shall we say a tyrian wyndham actor like poet have provincial parodist of they style in even greater number so adoringly imitative be humanity some day mike would have he imitator -- boy who pull face like he and pride themselves on have the laflin wrinkle just as it be once the fashion for girl to look like burne-jones picture or young poet to imitate mr swinburne yes i have get my first part i have get it in my pocket say mike oh really that be splendid exclaimed esther with delight wait till you see it say mike bring out a french 's act edition of some forget comedy yes guess how many word i have get to say just exactly eleven and such word well never mind dear it be a begin certainly it be a beginning -- the very beginning of a begin come let I see it mike what be you suppose to be at last mike be persuade to confess the humble little _ rôle _ for which the eminent actor who have consent to be he colleague have cast he he be to be the comic boy of a pastry-cook 's man and he distinguished part in the action of the piece be to come in at a certain moment with the pie that have be order and as he deliver it he be to remark that be a pie as be a pie be that there pie oh mike what a shame exclaim esther how absurd why you be a better actor with you little finger than any one of they with they whole body ah but they do not know that yet you see any one could see it if they look at you face half-a-minute i want to play the part of snodgrass but they could not think of give I that of course so do you know what i pretend to comfort myself i pretend i be edward kean wait in the passage at drury lane with all the other fine fellow look down at the shabby little gloomy man from the province that be conceit for you be not it the pathos of this be of course irresistible to esther and mike be thereupon hug and kiss as he expect never mind he say you 'll see if i do not make something of the poor little part after all and thereupon he describe what he laughingly call he conception and how he propose to dress and make up so vividly that it be evident that the pastry-cook 's boy be already to he a personality whose action and interest be by no means limit to he brief appearance on the stage but who though accidentally he have but few word to speak before the audience be a very voluble and vital little person in scene where the audience do not follow he yes you see i 'll do something with it the best of a small part say mike speaking as one of experience be that it give you plenty of opportunity for make the audience wish there be more of it from that point of view you certainly could not have a finer part laugh esther then for a moment mike skip out of the room and presently knock and put in a funny face enter carry a cushion with alacrity that be a pie as be a pie be that there pie he fool throw the cushion into esther 's lap where presently he little red head find its way too how can you love such a silly little creature he say look up into esther 's blue eye i do not know i be sure say esther but i do and bend down she kiss the wistful boy 's face be it because esther be in a way he mother as well as he sweetheart that she seem to do all the kissing thus be mike 's first part rehearse and reward chapter xix on certain advantage of a backwater though from a maritime point of view tyre be perhaps the chief center of conjunction for all the main stream of the world from the point of view of literature and any other art it be a admit backwater take what art you pleased tyre be a dunce even to music the most persuasive of the art it be deaf surely of all city it have not be build to music it possess indeed one private-spirited town-councillor who insist on present it with nude sculpture and mysterious painting which it furiously decline if tyre be to be artistically great it must certainly be with a greatness reluctantly thrust upon it still henry and ned have sense enough to be glad that they have be bear there it be from no mere recognition of a inexpensively effective background perhaps they hardly know why they be glad till later on but meanwhile they instinctively lay hold of the advantage of they limitation have they be london-born and oxford-bred they would have be much more fashionable in they taste but they very isolation happily save they from the pass superstition of fashion and they be thus able to enjoy the antiquity of beauty with the same freshness of appetite as though they have be novelty if henry be to meet ned some evening with the announcement that he have a wonderful new book to share with he it be just as likely to be sir philip sidney 's astrophel and stellum as any more recent publication -- though indeed they contrived to keep in touch with the literary development of the day with a remarkable instinct and perhaps a juster estimate of they character and value than those who be take part in they for it be seldom that one can be in the movement and at the center as well as a matter of fact there be little that interested they or which at all event do not disappoint and somewhat bewilder the novel be groan under the thraldom of realism poetry with one or two exception be give up to bric-a-brac and metrical ingenuity to young man for whom french romanticism be still alive who be still content to see the world through the spiritual eye of shelley and keat and who have not yet learn to belittle carlyle there seem a strange lack of generosity and indeed vitality in the literary ideal of the hour the novel particularly seem barren and unprofitable to they more and more a instrument of science than a branch of literature laughter have desert it as clearly as romance or pathos and more and more it be become the vehicle of cynical biology on the one hand and unitarian theology on the other besides strangest of all man be praise for lack those very quality which to these boy have seem essential to literature the excellence praise be the excellence of science not literature in fact there seem to be but one excellence namely accuracy of observation and to write a novel with any eye to beauty of language be to err as the writer of a scientific treatise would err who endeavor to add charm and grace to the sober record of he investigation dull sociological analyst reign in the once laughing domain of cervante of fielding and thackeray of duma and dickens of hugo and gautier and george sand be they bear too late be they anachronism from the forget age of romanticism or be they just bear in time to assist at the birth of another romantic idealistic age would dream and love and beautiful writing ever come into fashion again would the poet be again a creature of passion and the novelist once more make you laugh and cry and would there be essayist any more whose page you would mark and whose phrase you would roll over and over again on you tongue with delight at some mysterious magic in the word history may be hold to have answer these question since then much in favor of those young man or at all event be engage in answer they but meanwhile what a miraculous refreshment in a dry and thirsty land be the new book henry mesurier have just discover and have eagerly bring to share with ned in they tavern corner one summer evening in 1885 ned be late but when henry have sip a little at he port and turn to the new-born exquisite page he hardly notice how the minute be go by as he read presently he have come to the end of the first volume the only one he have with he and he raise he eye from the closing page with that exquisite exaltation that beatific satisfaction of mind and spirit -- even almost one might say of body -- which for the lover of literature nothing in the world like a fine passage can bring he turn again to the closing sentence : _ yes what be want be the heart that would make it impossible to witness all this and the future would be with the force that would beget a heart like that he favorite philosophy have say trust the eye strive to be right always regard the concrete experience never falsify you impression and its sanction have be at least effective here in say : it be what i may not see surely evil be a real thing and the wise man want in the sense of it where not to have be by instinctive election on the right side be to have fail in life _ the passage refer to the roman gladiatorial show and to the philosophic detachment by which marcus aurelius be able to see and yet not to see they and the whole book be the spiritual story of a young roman 's soul a priestlike artistic temperament bear in the haunt twilight between the setting sun of pagan religion and philosophy and the dawn of the christian idea the theme present many fascinating analogy to the present time and in the hero 's sensation and idea henry find many correspondence with he own nature in he too be unite that same joy in the sensuous form that same adoration of the spiritual mystery the temperament in one of artist and priest he too in a dim fashion indeed and under condition of culture less favourable have speculate and experiment in a similar manner upon the literary art over which as yet he have acquire -- how crushingly this exquisite book teach he -- such pathetically uncertain mastery that impassion comradeship in book beautiful be it not to-day ned 's and he as all those year before it have be that of marius and flavian and where in the world _ be _ ned how he would kindle at a passage like this : _ to keep the eye clear by a sort of exquisite personal alacrity and cleanliness extend even to he dwelling-place to discriminate ever more and more exactly select form and color in thing from what be less select to meditate much on beautiful visible object on object more especially connect with the period of youth -- on child at play in the morning the tree in early spring on young animal on the fashion and amusement of young man to keep ever by he if it be but a single choice flower a graceful animal or sea-shell as a token and representation of the whole kingdom of such thing to avoid jealously in he way through the world everything repugnant to sight and should any circumstance tempt he to a general converse in the range of such object to disentangle himself from that circumstance at any cost of place money or opportunity : such be in brief outline the duty recognize the rights demand in this new formulum of life _ and again what gleam single phrase whole counsel of existence in a dozen word he must copy out some of they for esther this for example : _ not pleasure but fulness completeness of life generally _ or this : _ to be able to make use of the flower when the fruit perhaps be useless or poisonous _ or again this : _ to be absolutely virgin towards a direct and concrete experience _ -- and there be a hundred more then for the young craftsman what a insight into what a compassionate childish remembrance of the mood and the little foolish accident of creation : _ he dilettanteism he assiduous preoccupation with what might seem but the detail of mere form or manner be after all bent upon the function of bring to the surface sincerely and in they integrity certain strong personal intuition certain vision or apprehension of thing as be with important result in this way rather than that -- apprehension which the artistic or literary expression be call upon to follow with the exactness of wax or clay clothing the model within it flavian too with he fine clear mastery of the practically effective have early lay hold of the principle as axiomatic in literature : that ` to know when one 's self be interested be the first condition of interesting other people ' _ and once more : _ as it oftenest happen also with nature of genuinely poetic quality those piecemeal beginning come suddenly to harmonious completeness among the fortunate incident the physical heat and light of one singularly happy day _ and over all what a beauty a beauty at once so sensuous and so spiritual -- the beauty of flowering laurel the beauty of austerity aflower here the very sens pray surely this be the most beautiful prose book ever write it have be compare he see with gautier 's mademoiselle de maupin but be not the beauty of that masterpiece in comparison with the beauty of this as the beauty of a leopard-skin to the beauty of a statue of minerva withdraw in a grove of ilex still ned delay and meanwhile the third glass of port have come and go and at length reluctantly henry emerge from he tavern-cloister upon the warm brilliancy of the street all around he the light beacon and the woman call with bright eye but to-night there be no temptation for he in these thing they but recall another exquisite quotation from he new-found treasure which he stop under a lamp to fix in he memory : _ and as the fresh rich evening come on there be hear all over rome far above a whisper the whole town seem hush to catch it distinctly the living reckless call to ` play ' from the son and daughter of foolishness to those in whom they life be still green _ -- donec virentus canity abest donec virentus canity abest _ marius could hardly doubt how cornelius would have take the call and as for himself slight as be the burden of positive moral obligation with which he have enter rome it be to no wasteful and vagrant affection such as these that he epicureanism have commit he _ but what could have happen to ned chapter xx the man in possession one morning two or three month after henry have leave home old mr lingard come to he as he sit bent drearily industrious over some account and say that he wish he in half-an-hour 's time to go with he to a new client and presently the two set out together henry wonder what it be to be and welcome anything that even exchange for a while one prison-house for another i be take you say the old man as they walk along together to a firm of carrier and carter whose affair have just come into we hand there be a dispute arise between the partner we represent certain interest as i shall presently explain to you and you be to be _ we _ representative -- we man in possession and the old gentleman laugh uncannily you never expect to be a man in possession do you henry thrill with a sense of awful intimacy thus walk and even jest with he August employer it may very likely be a long business the old man continue and i fear may be a little dull for you for you must be on the spot all day long you lunch will be serve to you from the manager 's house i will see to that actually there will be very little for you to do beyond look over the day-book and receipt for the day the main thing be for you to be there -- so to say the moral effect of you presence -- and the old gentleman laugh again then with a amuse sympathy that seem almost exquisite to henry he chuckle out look at he from one corner of he eye like a roguish skeleton -- you 'll be able to write as much poetry as you like i see you have get a book with you well it will keep you awake i do not mind that -- or even the poetry -- so long as you do not forget the day-book thank you sir say henry almost hysterically i suppose the old man continue presently and in all he say there be a tone of affectionate banter that quite win henry 's heart that you be still as set on literature as ever well well far be it from I to discourage you but my dear boy you 'll find out that we can not live on dream -lrb- henry think but do not dare to say that it be dream alone that make it possible to live at all -rrb- i suppose you think i be a dried-up old fellow enough well well i have have my dream too yes i have have my dream -- henry thought of what he have discover that day in the old man 's diary -- and i have write my verse to my lady 's eyebrow in my time too ah my boy we be all young and foolish once in we life and it be evident what a narrow and desperate escape from be a poet the old man have have they have some distance to walk for the stable to which they be bind be situate in a old and rather disreputable part of the town it be not a nice quarter say mr lingard not particularly salubrious or refine as bad smell and dirty woman begin to cross they path but they be nice people you have get to deal with and the place itself be clean and nice enough when you once get inside here we be he say presently as they stop short of a old-fashioned house set in a high red-brick wall which seem to enclose quite a considerable area of the district in the wall a yard or two from the house be set a low door with a brass bell-pull at the side which answer to mr lingard 's summons with a far-off clang soon be hear the sound of hob-nailed boot evidently over a paved yard and a big carter admit they to the enclosure which immediately impress they with its sense of country stable-yard cleanliness and its country smell of horse and provender the stone of the courtyard seem to have be individually wash and scour and a small space in front of a door evidently lead to the house be chalk over in the prim old-fashioned way be mr flower about ask mr lingard and as he ask the question a handsome broad-shouldered man of about forty-five come down the yard it be a massive country face a little heavy a little slow but exceptionally gentle and refined good-morning mr lingard good-morning mr flower this be we representative mr mesurier of whom i have already speak to you i be sure you will get on well together and i be sure he will give you as little trouble as possible henry and mr flower shake hand and as man sometimes do take to each other at once in the grasp of each other 's hand and the glance which accompany it then the three walk further up the yard to the little office where henry be to pass the next few week and as mr lingard turn over book and explain to henry what he be expect to do the sound of horse kick they stall and rattle chain in they manger come to he from near at hand with a delightful echo of the country when mr lingard have go mr flower ask henry if he would care to look at the horse henry sympathetically consent though he knowledge of horse-flesh hardly equal he knowledge of account but with the healthy animal in whatever form one always feel more or less at home as one feel at home with the green earth or that simple creature the sea mr flower lead the way to a long stable where some fifty horse protrude brown and dappled haunch on either hand it be all wonderfully clean and sweet and the cobble pavement the straw bed the hay tumble in sweet-scented bunch into the stall from the loft overhead make you forget that around this bucolic enclosure swarm and rot the foulest slum of the city garret where coiner ply they amateur mint and cellar where murderer lay hide in the dark it be like a breath of the country say henry unconsciously strike the right note you be right there say mr flower at the same moment heartily slapping the shine side of a big chestnut mare after the approve manner of man who love horse to thus belabor a horse on its hinder-part would seem to be equivalent among the horse-breeding fraternity to chuck a buxom milkmaid under the chin you be right there he say and here be a good derbyshire lass for you once more administer a sound caress upon he sleek favorite the horse turn its head and whinny softly at the attention and it be evident it love the very sound of mr flower 's voice have you ever be to derbyshire asked mr flower presently and henry immediately scented a idealism in the question no he answer but i believe it be a beautiful county beautiful 's no name for it say mr flower it be just a garden and as henry catch a glance of he eye he realize that derbyshire be mr flower 's poetry -- the poetry of a countryman imprison in the town -- and that when he die he just hope to go to derbyshire ah there be place there -- place like miller 's dale for instance -- i would rather take my hat off to than any bishop -- and henry eagerly scented something of a thinker for god make they for sure and bishop -- well -- and mr flower wisely leave the rest unsaid thus they make the tour of the stable and though henry 's remark on the subject of slap horse-flesh have be anything but those of a expert it be tacitly agree that mr flower and he have take to each other nor as he presently find be mr flower 's interest limit to horse you be a reader i see he say presently when they have return to the office well i do not get much time to read nowadays but there be nothing i enjoy better when i have get a pipe light of a evening than to sit and listen to my little daughter reading thackeray or george eliot of course henry be interested now there be a woman who know country life mr flower continue ` sila marner ' or ` adam bede ' how wonderfully she get at the very heart of the people and not only that but the very smell of country air and mr flower draw a long breath of longing for miller 's dale henry mentally furbished up he george eliot to reply and ` the mill on the floss ' he say and ` scene from clerical life ' say mr flower there be some rare stroke of nature there and so they go on compare note till a little blue-eyed girl of about seventeen appear carry a dainty lunch for henry and tell mr flower that he own lunch be ready this be my daughter of whom i speak say mr flower she who read thackeray and george eliot to you say the man in possession and when they have go he say to himself what a bright little face chapter xxi little miss flower little miss flower continue to bring henry he lunch with great punctuality each day and each day he find himself more and more interested in its arrival though when it have come he eat it with no special haste indeed sometimes it almost seem that it have serve its purpose in merely have be bring judge by the moment of reverie in which henry seem to have forget it and to be think of something else yes he have soon begin to watch for that bright little face and it be hardly to be wonder at for particularly come upon against such a background the face have something of the surprise of a apparition it seem all make of light and when one o'clock have come and henry hear the expect footstep of he little waiting-maid and the tinkle of the tray she carry come up the yard she entrance be as though some one have carry a lamp into the dark office surely it be more like the face of a spirit than that of a little human girl and you would almost have expect it to shine in the dark when you get use to the light of it you realize that the radiance pour from singularly even disproportionately large blue eye set beneath a broad white brow of great purity and that what at first have seem ray of light around she head be a mass of sunny gold-brown hair which glint even in shadow strange indeed be the vagary of the spirit of beauty from how many high place will she turn away yet delight to waste herself upon a slum like this how fantastic the accident that have bring such a face to flower in such a spot -- and yet hardly more fantastic he reflect than that which have sow he own family haphazard where they be be it the ironic fate of power to be always a god in exile turn mean wheel with mighty hand and be cinderella the fable of the eternal lot of beauty in this capriciously order world yes what chance wind blow all the way from derbyshire have set down mr flower with he little garden of girl in this uncongenial spot for by this henry have make the acquaintance of the whole family : mr and mr flower and four daughter in all -- all pretty girl but not one of the other with a face like that -- which be another puzzle how be it that out of one family one will be choose by the spirit of beauty or genius and the other so unmistakably leave there could be no doubt as to whom have be choose here one day the step come up the yard at one o'clock seem to be different and when the door open it be another sister who have bring he lunch that day she eldest sister be ill she explain and in bed and it be so for the next day and again the next could it be possible that henry have watch so eagerly for that little face that he miss it so much already the next morning he buy some rose on he way through town and beg that they might be allow to brighten she room and the next day surely it be the same light little tread once more come up the yard joy she be better again she look pale he say anxiously and venture to say too that he have miss she as she blush and look down he see that she wear one of he rose in she bosom he have already begin to lend she book which she return always with some clever little criticism often girlishly naïve but never merely conventional there be brain under she bright hair one day henry have run out of literature and ask she if she could lend he a book anything -- some novel he have read before it do not matter oh yes he have not read george eliot for ever so long have she the mill on the floss yes it have be a present from she father she would bring that as she linger a moment while henry look at the book he eye fall upon a name on the title-page : angel flower be that you name miss flower he say yes father write it there my real name be angelica but they call I angel for short she answer smile be you surprise say henry suddenly blush like a girl as though he have never venture on such a small gallantry before angelica how do you come to get such a beautiful name father love beautiful name and he grandmother be call angelica i wonder if i might call you angelica presently venture henry in a low voice do you think you know I well enough say angelica with a little gasp which be really joy in she breath henry do not answer but they eye meet in a long still look in each heart behind the stillness be a storm of indescribable sweetness henry lean forward he face grow very pale and impulsively take angelica 's hand -- i think after all i would rather call you angel he say chapter xxii mike 's first laurel the garden of sidon have a curious habit of grow laurel-tree laurel and rhododendron be the only wear in shrub rhododendron one can understand they be to the garden what mahogany be to the front parlor -- the _ bourgeoisie _ of the vegetable kingdom but the laurel -- what use could they have for laurel in sidon possibly they supply it to the rest of the world -- market-gardener so to say to the temple of fame it could hardly be for home consumption well at all event it be a peculiarity fortunate for esther 's purpose as one morning soon after breakfast she go about the garden cut the glossiest branch of the distinguished tree as she fill she arm with they she recall with a smile the different purpose for which drag at the heel of one of henry 's enthusiasm she have gather they several year before at that period henry have be a mighty entomologist and as the late summer come on he and all available sister would set out arm with butterfly-net and other paraphernalia just before twilight to the nearest woodland where they would proceed to daub the tree with a intoxicating preparation of honey and rum -- a temptation to which moth be declare in text-book to be incapable of resistance then as night fall henry would light he bull 's - eye and cautiously visit the various snare it be a sight worth see to come upon those little night-club of drunken and bewildered moth hang on to the sweetness with tragic gluttony -- a easy prey for henry 's eager finger which as greedy of they as they of the honey would seize and thrust they into the lethal chamber in the form of a cigar-box loosely fill with bruised laurel leave which hang by a strap from he shoulder it be for such exciting employment that esther have once gather laurel leave and once again she remember gather they one shakespeare 's birthday to crown a little bust in henry 's study the sacred head have wear they proudly all day and they all have a feeling that somehow shakespeare must know about it and appreciate the little offering just as even to-day one might bring rose and myrtle or the blood of a maiden dive to venus and expect she to smile upon we affair of the heart but it be for a dearer purpose that esther be gather they this morning that come evening mike be to utter he first stage-word in public the laurel be to crown the occasion on which mike be to make that memorable utterance : that be a pie as be a pie be that there pie now while esther be busily weave this laurel into a wreath henry be busily weave the best word he could find into a sonnet to accompany the wreath when angel duly bring he he lunch it be finish and lay about on he desk in rag and tatters of composition angel be go to the performance with she sister -- for all these young people be fond of advertising each other and he have soon tell she about mike -- so she be interested to hear the sonnet whatever other quality poetry may lack the presence of generous sincerity will always give it a certain value to all but the merely supercilious and this sonnet boyish in its touch of grandiloquence have yet a certain pathos of strong feeling about it not unto he alone whom loud acclaim declare the victor do the meed belong for other stand silent in the throng may well be worthier of a nobler fame and so dear friend although unknown thy name unto the shout herd we would give tongue to we deep thought and the world 's great among by this symbolic laurel thee proclaim and if perchance the herd shall find thee out in come time and many a nobler crown to one they love to honor gladly throw wilt thou not turn thee from they eager shout and whisper o'er these leaf then sere and brown : ` thou ` rt late o world love know it long ago ' the reader will probably agree with angel in consider the last line the best but of course she think the whole be wonderful how wonderful it must be to be able to write she say with a look in she face which be worth all the book ever write and how wonderful even to have something write to one like that surely that must have happen to you say henry slyly you be only laugh at I no i be not you do not know what may have be write to you poem may quite well have be write to you without you have hear of they the poet may not have think they worthy of you what nonsense why i do not know any poet oh say henry i mean except you and how do you know that i have not write a whole book full of poem to you i have know you -- how long now two month next Monday say angel with that chronological accuracy on such matter which seem to be a special gift of woman in love man in love be nothing like so accurate well that be long enough be not it and i have have nothing else to do you know but you do not care enough about I you never know but tell I really have you write something for I ah you would like to know now would not you of course i would tell I it would make I very happy it really would you know it would but why it would but you could not care for the poetry unless you care for the poet oh i do not know poetry 's poetry be not it whoever make it but what if i do care a little for the poet do you mean you do angel ah you want to know now do not you tell I do tell I i 'll tell you when you read I my poem and as angel prepare to run off with a laugh henry call after she -- you will really it be a bargain yes it be a bargain she call back as she trip off again down the yard \* \* \* \* \* mike 's _ début _ be as great a success as so small a part could make it and the main point about it be the excitement of know that this be a actual beginning he have make they all laugh and cry in drawing-room for ever so long but to-night he be on the stage the real stage -- real at all event for he for mike could never be a amateur esther 's eye fill with glad tear as the well-loved little figure pop in with a baker 's paper hat on he head and deliver the absurd word and if you have look at henry 's face too you would have be at a loss to know which love the little pastry-cook 's boy best when mike return to he dressing-room a mysterious box be await he he open it and find esther 's wreath and henry 's sonnet god bless they he say no doubt it be very childish and sentimental and old-fashioned but these young people certainly love each other as mike have leave the stage henry have turn round and smile at some one a few seat away esther have notice he and look in the same direction who be that you bow to henry i 'll tell you another time he say for he have a good deal to tell she about angel flower chapter xxiii the mother of a angel the man in possession be become more and more a favorite at mr flower 's one day mr flower take pity on he loneliness suggest that he might possibly prefer to have he lunch in company with they all down at the house henry gladly embrace the proposal and thus become the daily honor guest of a family each member of which have some simple human attraction for he he have already win the heart of simple mr flower few and brief as have be he encounter with she and that heart she have several time coin in unexpected cake and other dainty of she own making but when he thus become partially domicile with the family she be he slave outright there be a reason for this which will need and may perhaps excuse a few line entirely devote to mr flower who on she own peculiar merit deserve they perhaps to introduce eliza flower in this way be to take she more seriously than any of she affectionate acquaintance be able to do for somehow people have a bad habit of laugh at mr flower though they admit she be the hardest-working best-hearted little housewife in the world housewife in fact she be _ in excelsis _ not to say _ ad absurdum _ no little woman who work herself to skin-and-bone to keep thing straight and the home comfortable be ever a more typical squaw whatever she religious opinion which one may be sure be inflexibly orthodox there can be no question that mr flower be she god and as the hymn say heaven be she home to serve god and mr flower be to she the same thing and there can be little doubt that a god who have no sock to darn or linen to keep spotless be a god whom mr flower would have find it impossible to conceive a more complete and delighted absorption in the physical comfort and nourishment of the human creature than mr flower 's it would be impossible for dreamer to imagine such a absolute adjustment between a being of presumably infinite aspiration and immortal discontent and its environment be a happiness seldom encounter by philosopher to think of death for poor mr flower be to conceive a homelessness peculiarly pathetic unless indeed there be kitchener to superintend bed to make room to turn out and four spring-cleaning a year in heaven of what use else be the bewildering gift of immortality to one who be touchingly mortal in all she taste indeed henry use to say that mr flower be the most convincing argument against the immortality of the soul that he have ever meet yet though it be quite evident that there be nothing in the world else she care so much to do and though indeed it be equally evident that she be one of the best-natured little creature in the world she do not deny herself a certain more or less constant asperity of reference to occupation which keep she on she foot from morning till night and make she the slave of the whole house in spite of four big idle daughter and she with rheumatism too so bad that she could hardly get up and down stair probably nothing so much as henry 's respectful sympathy for this immemorial rheumatism have contribute to win mr flower 's heart as to the precise amount of rheumatism from which mr flower suffer henry soon realize that there seem to be a irreverent scepticism in the family nothing short of heartless for rheumatism so poignantly expressive so movingly dramatise he never remember to have meet mr flower could not walk across the floor without grimace of pain or piteous indrawing of she breath and yet demonstration that you might have think would have soften stone leave she unfeeling audience not only unmoved but apparently even unobservant from sheer decency henry would flute out something to show that she suffering be not lose on he but it be to be fear the young one would only wink at each other at this sign of unsophistication oh you unfeeling child mr flower would exclaim as sometimes she catch they exchange comment in this way and you father there be just as bad she would say impatient to provoke somebody this remark would probably prompt mr flower to the indulgence of a form of matrimonial banter which be not unlike the endearment he bestow upon he horse and which when you know that he love the little quaint woman with all he heart you be able to translate into more customary mode of affection yes indeed he would say it be evidently time i be look out for some active young woman eliza -- when you begin limp about like that it be a pity but the best of we must wear out some day -- this superficially heartless pleasantry he would deliver with a sweeping wink at henry and he four girl but mr flower would see nothing to laugh at for humor be not she strong point you ought to be ashamed of yourself ralph she say before the child i be once young and active enough to take you fancy anyhow mr mesurier will not you have a little more spinach do it be fresh from the country this morning you must not mind mr flower he be fond of he joke and whatever he like to say he would get on pretty badly without he old eliza gracious no mr flower would retort do not flatter yourself old girl i have get my eye on two or three fine young woman who 'll be glad of the job i assure you but this perhaps prove too much for poor mr flower whose tear be never far away and apt to require smelling-salt he would change he tone in a instant and say drop into he derbyshire thous -- nonsense lass can not thee take a bit of a joke come now come do not be silly thou knowest well enough what thou art to I and so do the girl see let 's have a drive out to livingstone cemetery this afternoon thou ` rt a bit out o ' sort it 'll cheer thee up a bit and so mrs flower would recover and harmony would be restore and nobody would wink for a quarter of a hour certainly it be a quaint little mother for a angel chapter xxiv a ancient theory of heaven when be you go to read I my poem say angelica one day when be you go to tell I what i ask reply henry whenever you read I my poem retort angelica all right when would you like to hear it now but i have not get it with I to-day can not you remember it no not to-day when will you bring it i 'll tell you what come with I to woodside meadow on Saturday afternoon you father will not mind oh no father like you i be glad because i be very fond of he yes he be a dear and he be get far more in he than perhaps you think under he country way if you could see he in the country it would make you cry he love it so yes i could tell that by the way he talk of derbyshire the first day we meet but you 'll come on Saturday yes i 'll come \* \* \* \* \* angel yes it be the face of a angel but bright as it have seem on that dark background it seem almost brighter still as it move by henry 's side among the green lane he have never know angel till then never know what primal ecstasy she nature be capable of in the town she soul be like a flame in a lamp of pearl here in the country it be like a star in a vase of dew to be near tree to touch they rough bark to fill one 's hand with green leaf to hear bird to listen to run water to look up into the sky -- oh this be to come home -- and angel 's joy in these thing be that of some wood-spirit who you might expect any moment like undine to slip out of you hand in some laughing brook or change to a shower of blossom over you head oh how good the country be i wish father be here i could eat the grass and i just want to take the sky in my arm as she sweep across meadow and through woodland with the eagerness of a child greedily hasten from room to room of some inexhaustible palace she little tense body seem like a transparent garment flutter round the fly foot of she soul at length she fling herself down almost breathless at the grassy foot of a great tree i suppose you think i be mad she say and really i think i must be for why should mere green grass and blue sky and a few bird make one so happy why should anything make we happy or sad but now you be go to read my poem she say presently yes but something have to happen before i can read it say henry grow unaccountably serious for it be in the nature of a prophecy or at all event of a anticipation you have to fulfil that prophecy first it seem to I a very mysterious poem but what have i to do i do not know whether you can do it well what be it try I oh angel i care nothing about poem can not you see how i love you that be all poetry will ever mean to I just to say over and over again ' i love angel ' just to find new and wonderful way of say that -- listen henry i have love you from the first moment i see you that day talk to father and i shall love you till i die dear dear angel henry then henry 's arm enfold angel with wonderful love and she fresh young lip be on he and the world fade away like a dream within a dream \* \* \* \* \* now perhaps you can read I you poem say angel after a while and she notice a curious something different in she way of speak to he as in he way of speak to she -- something blissfully homelike as it be as though they have sit like this for ever and ever and be quite use to it though at the same time it remain thrillingly new it be only a silly little childish rhyme say henry some day i 'll write you far better then come close to angel he whisper -- this be angelica fall from heaven fall from heaven into my arm will you go back again little angelica back up to heaven out of my arm no say angelica here be my heaven here be my heaven here in you arm not out of heaven but into my heaven here have i fall here in you arm chapter xxv the last continue after a brief interval after the long happy silence which follow henry 's recitation of he verse angel at length speak -- shall i tell _ you _ something now she say i be almost ashamed to for i know you 'll laugh at I and call I superstitious go on little child say henry you remember the day say angel in a hushed little impressive voice i first saw you in father 's office henry be able to remember it well that be not the first time i have see you really angel why do not you tell I before where be it then in the street or where no it be much stranger than that say angel do you believe the future can be foretell to we oh it be in a dream you funny angel be that it say henry whose rationalism at this period be the chief danger to he imagination no not a dream something stranger than that oh well i give it up it be like this angel continue there be a strange old gipsy woman who live near we -- oh i see you hand -- palmistry say henry with a touch of gentle impatience henry dear i say you would laugh at I i will not tell you now if you be go to take it in that spirit henry promptly lock up he reason for the moment with apology and profess himself open to conviction well mother sometimes help this poor old woman and one day when she happen to call alice and edith and i be in the kitchen help mother ` god bless you lady ' she say -- you know how they talk -- ` you have get a kind heart and how be all the young lady it be time i be think they have they fortune tell ' ` oh yes ' we all say ` tell we we fortune mother ' -- we always call she mother ` i 'll tell you yours my dear ' she say take hold of my hand ` you fortune be too young yet lady ' she say to alice and edith ` come to I in a year 's time and maybe i 'll tell you all about he ' you dear say henry by way of interruption then continue angel she take I aside and look at my hand and she tell I first what have happen to I and then what be to come what she tell I of the past -- as if dear angel whose life be as yet all future could as yet have have any past to speak of -- be so true that i could not help half believe in what she say of the future now you be laugh again no indeed i be not say henry perfectly solemn she tell I that just before i be twenty i would meet a young man with dark hair and blue eye very unexpectedly -- i shall be twenty in six week -- and that he would be my fate but the strangest be yet to come ` would you like to see he face ' she say she make I a little frightened but of course i say ` yes ' and then she bring out of she pocket a sort of glass egg and tell I to look in it and tell she what i see so i look but for a long time i could see nothing but suddenly there seem to be something move in the center of the glass like cloud break when the sun be come out and presently i could see a lamp burning on a table and then round the lamp shelf of book begin to grow out of the mist then i see a picture hanging in a recess a bow head with a strange sort of head-dress on it a dark thin face very sad-looking -- why that must have be my dante say henry astonished in spite of himself the exclamation be a score for angel and she continue with greater confidence and then i seem to see some one sit there but though i try and try i could not catch sight of he face i tell the old woman what i see ` wait a minute ' she say ` then try again ' so i wait and presently try again this time i have not so long to wait before i see a room again but it be quite different a big desk run along in front of a window and there be two tall office-stool ` why it be father 's office ' i say ` go on look ' say the old woman ` and tell I what you see ' in a moment or two i see some one sit on one of the stool first dimly and then clearer and clearer ` why ' i almost cry out for i feel more and more frightened ' i see a young man sit at a desk with a pen behind he ear ' ` can you see he clearly ' ` yes ' i say ` he be get dark curly hair and blue eye ' ` you be sure you will not forget he face you would know he if you see he again ' ` indeed i would ' i say ` all right ' say the old woman ` you can give I back the crystal you keep a look out for that young man -- you will see he some day mark my word and that young man will be you fate ' now surely you will not deny that be strange will you ask angel in conclusion and i shall never forget the start it give I that day when i come in quite unsuspecting with you lunch-tray and see you talk to father with you pen behind you ear and you blue eye and dark hair now be not it strange how can one help be superstitious after a thing like that be you quite sure it be i henry ask quizzically it appear to I that any presentable young man with a pen behind he ear would have answer nearly enough to the vision you would hardly have be quite sure of the color of the eye would you now if the old woman have not mention it first as she look at you hand you be horrid say angel i wish i have not tell you now but it be not merely the color of the eye it be the look in they look again and see if you have not make a mistake look very carefully say henry i will not say angel i think you be cruel angel if you 'll only look and say you be quite sure i 'll believe every word the old woman say at last angel be persuade to look and to look again and the old woman 's credit rise at each look yes henry whatever happen i know it be true my life be in you hand those be solemn word for one human be to hear utter by another and a shiver of new responsibility involuntarily run through henry 's vein may the hand be always strong and clean enough to hold so precious a gift he answer gravely be you sad dear ask angel presently with a sort of divination not sad dear but serious he answer have i turn to a responsibility so soon you strange wise child i believe you be a witch oh i be right then right in one way but perhaps wrong in another do not you know that some responsibility be the most dearly covet of mortal honor but then we should not be worthy of they if they do not make we feel a little serious can not you imagine that to hear another say that she life be in one 's hand make one feel just a little solemn but be not you life in mine henry ask angel simply of course it be dear answer henry and then the moon begin to rise through the tree pour enchantment over the sleep wood and the meadow half-submerged in lake of mist angel draw close to henry and watch it with big eye what a wonderful world it be how beautiful and how sad she say half to herself yes there be nothing in the world so sad as beauty answer henry if only to-night could last forever if only we could die now sit just like this with the moon rise yonder but we shall have many night like this together say henry no we shall never have this night again we may have other wonderful night but they will be different this will never come again henry instinctively realize that here be a mystical side to angel 's nature which however it might charm he be not to be indiscriminately encouraged and he try to rally she out of she sadness but she feeling be too much he own for he to persist and as the moonlight move in its ascension from one beautiful change to another now weave by branch and leave into weird tapestry of light and darkness now hang like some golden fruit from the bough and now uplift like a lamp in some window of space they sit together alike hold by the ancient spell and presently henry so far lose himself in it as to quote some line entirely in angel 's mood : she dwell with beauty -- beauty that must die and joy whose hand be ever at he lip bidding adieu and ache pleasure nigh turn to poison while the bee-mouth sip : ay in the very temple of delight veil melancholy have she sov ` run shrine though see of none save he whose strenuous tongue can burst joy 's grape against he palate fine he soul shall taste the sadness of she might and be among she cloudy trophy hang what wonderful line say angel who write they be they you own ah angel what would i give if they be no they be by john keat you must let I give you he poem presently the moonlight begin to lose its lustre it grow pale and as it be anxious dark billow of cloud threaten to swallow up its silver coracle and presently the world grow suddenly black with its submergence the wood and meadow disappear and henry and angel begin playfully to strike match to see each other 's face thus they suddenly flare up to each other out of the darkness like rembrandt see by lightning and then they be lose again and be only voice fumble for each other in the dark yet even so lip and arm find each other without much difficulty and when they begin to think of the last train and fear they would miss it but wait for just one last good-night kiss under they sacred tree the world suddenly light up again for the moon have triumph over its enemy and come out just in time to give they its blessing chapter xxvi concern the best kind of wife for a poet we be apt sometimes to complain that so much of importance in we life be at the dispensation of accident yet how often too be we compel to confess that some of the happiest and most fruitful circumstance of we life be due to the far-seeing diplomacy of chance among no set of circumstance be this more true than in the fateful relation of man and woman while in a blind sort of way we may be say to choose for ourselves the man or woman with whom we be to share the joy and sorrow of we year yet the choice be only superficially ours frequently we brain we antecedent plan have no part in the decision the woman we choose appear at the wrong time in the wrong place in a undesirable environment with hair and eye and general complexion different in color from what we have predestine for ourselves short when we have make up we mind for tall and tall when we have hope for short yet in in spite of all we preconception we choose she this be not properly a choice in which the intelligence confessedly submit to violence it be the compulsion of mysterious instinct that know better than we brain or we taste now have she be ask beforehand esther might not have sketch out a mike as the ideal of she maiden dream nor indeed might henry have describe a angelica any more than perhaps mike a esther or angelica a henry yet chance have only to place esther and mike and angelica and henry in the same room together for less than a minute of time and they fly into the arm of each other 's soul with a instant recognition this be a mystery which it will take more than biology to explain a young man 's dream of the woman he will some day marry be apt to be meretricious or at all event conventional a young poet especially be likely to err in the direction of paragon of beauty or fame or romance perhaps he dream of a great singer or a illustrious beauty ignorant of the natural law which make great singer and illustrious beauty in common with all artist incapable of loving really any one but themselves or perhaps it will be some woman of great and exquisite culture but chance know that woman of great and exquisite culture be usually being lack in those plastic elemental quality which a poet above all man need in the woman he shall love they very culture while it may seem to broaden really narrow they limit they to a caste of mind and for a infinite suggestiveness substitute a few finite accomplishment critic without understand have wonder now and again at attachment such as that of heine for he mathilde yet in some way mathilde be the type of wife best suit for a poet she be just a wonder child a bit of unspoiled chaos she mean as little intellectually and as much spiritually as a wave of the sea a bird of the air a star in the sky another great poet always keep in he room a grow plant in a big tub of earth and another tub full of fresh water with the fire go he use to say that he have the four element within he four wall and to people unaccustomed to talk with the element these no doubt seem dull and even remarkable companion -- like heine 's mathilde now angel though far more than a goose intellectually have indeed a very keen and subtle mind be only secondarily intellectual be primarily something far more important you no more ask of she to be intellectual than you expect a spirit to be mathematical she be just a dream-child thrilling with wonder and love before the strange world in which she have be mysteriously place -- a dream-child and a excellent housewife in one as full of common-sense on the one hand as she be fill with fairy nonsense on the other she be just in fact the wife for a poet the interest take in each other by angel and the man in possession have not be unobserved by angel 's family she sister have tease she considerably on the subject why have you change the way of wear you hair angel they would say do mr mesurier like it that way or my word we be get smart and particular now a certain gentleman have come into the office or again how small you writing be nowadays angel what have you change it for i like you big old writing best but i suppose -- and then they would retreat to a safe distance to finish -- mr mesurier be not of the same opinion sometimes esther would start in pursuit and playful scrimmage would ensue the hilarious uproar of which would turn poor mr flower 's brain mr flower have certainly not be unobservant and one may perhaps suspect that those cake and other delicacy which she have so often send up the yard have not be send entirely without those ulterior design which every thoughtful mother may becomingly cherish for she daughter after angel and henry 's excursion to the country together henry feel that some official announcement of the state of he heart be demand of he and lose no time in find mr flower alone for that tremulous purpose however it be soon over there be no question of _ dot _ and marriage settlement to discuss genealogically both side be about equally distinguish and socially belong to that large undefined class call respectable -- though it must not be suppose that when so mind family of that respectable zone do not occasionally make nice distinction do you know what you be ask for once say a retired tradesman 's wife in sidon to she daughter 's suitor do you know that both katie 's grandfather be mayor but there be no traditional mayoralty to keep these two young heart asunder it be understand on both side that they have nothing to bring but each other and they ask nothing better angel be go to marry a poet and henry a fairy and not only they themselves but the whole family be more than satisfied mr flower be undisguisedly pleased and the tear stand in he eye as he grip henry 's hand i have like you he say since the first time we shake hand there be something honest about you grip i like and i go a good deal by these thing it be not many man i would trust with my little angel for when you take she you take she father 's great treasure guard she well dear lad guard she well chapter xxvii the book of angelica the first duty of a poet 's wife be to inspire he when she cease to do that -- but that be a consideration which need not occupy we in this unsophisticated story we have already see that angelica in this respect early begin she wifely duty towards henry and that little song he read in chapter twenty-five be but one of many he have write to she in he capacity of man in possession the feminine inspiration of he early youth have be numerous but mediocre in quality even in love as in all else he opportunity have be second and even third-rate he have break he boy 's heart time after time for some commonplace little provincial miss who know not the god 's wonder or he woe but at last in circumstance so unforeseen the maiden of the lord have be reveal to he and with the revelation a great impulse of metrical expression have come upon the young poet all day long rhythm and fancy be effervesce within he till at length he have quite a publishable mass of verse for which it be to be fear angelica must be count responsible of these he be busily make a surreptitious fair copy one morning when old mr septimus lingard suddenly visit he seclusion with the announcement that he task there be at a end so that he might now return to he regular office though of course henry have realize that the present happy arrangement could not go on for ever the news bring temporary desolation to the two young lover for four month they day have be spend within a few yard of each other and though angel 's excursion up the yard to henry 's desk could not be many or long each day yet each be conscious that the other be near at hand when angel sing at she housework it be from the secure sense that henry be close by they separation be little more than that of a husband and wife working in different room of the same house but now they meeting would have to be arrange out somewhere in a cold world little considerate of the convenience of lover and for whole day of warm proximity they would have to exchange occasional snatch precarious hour well the only thing to do be for henry to work away at they dream of a home together -- home together however little just four wall to love each other in away from the gaze of prying eye none daring to make they afraid how that home be to be compass be far from clear in either of they mind but vaguely it be feel that it would be bring about by the powerful enchantment of literature henry have recently have one of angel 's poem accept by a rather good magazine and the trance of joy in which for fully two hour he have sit gaze at that he first proof-sheet be hardly less rapturous than that into which he have fall after see angel for the first time -- so dear be the emblem of he craft to the artist at the beginning and still at the end of he career so henry have to finish the fair copy of he poem at home in he lodgings of a evening for so ambitious a private enterprise could not be carry on in he own office without perilous interruption he be make the copy with especial care in the form of a real book and when it be make he daintily bind it in vellum with he own hand then he wrap it lovingly in tissue paper and keep it by he two or three day in readiness for angel 's birthday on the morning of which day he hide it in a box of flower and send it to angel the sympathetic reader can imagine she delight as she discover among the flower a dainty little white volume bear the title-page the book of angelica by henry mesurier tyre 1886 edition limit to one copy now this little book presently begin to enjoy a certain very carefully limited circulation among angel 's friend of course they be not allow to take it away they be only allow to look at it now and again for a few minute angel anxiously stand by to see that they do not soil she treasure sometimes mr flower would ask angel to show it to one of the family friend and thus one evening it come beneath the eye of a little scotch printer who have a great love for poetry and some taste in it the man 's a genius he say with all that authority with which a strong scotch accent mysteriously endow the humblest scot the man 's a genius he repeat he poem must be print henry have already find that this be easier say than do for he have already try several london publisher who profess they willingness to publish -- at he expense this little scotch printer however be to prove more venturesome he forthwith communicate a proposal to henry through the flower if henry would provide he with a list of a certain number of friend he could rely on for subscription he would take the risk of print a edition and give henry half the profit -- a proposal as generous as it be rash angel communicate the offer in a excited little letter with the result that mr leith and henry meet one morning in the bar-parlour of the green man still and part a hour or so after in a high state of friendship and deeply pledge together to a mutual adventure of three hundred copy of a book to be call the book of angelica and to be print in so dainty a fashion that the mere outside should attract buyer mr leith work under difficulty for he business small as it be be much saddle with pecuniary obligation which it but inadequately support he printing of henry 's poem be really a work of sheer idealism which none but a scotsman or perhaps a irishman would have undertake and it be a work that might at any moment be interrupt by bailiff empower to carry away the press and the very type over which henry love to hang in he spare hour try to read in the line of mysteriously carve metal he madrigal to angelica singing or he sonnet on first beholding angelica then mr leith be of a convivial disposition and henry and he must have spend more hour drink to the success of the little book than would have suffice to print it twice over however the day do at last come when it be a living breathing reality and when angel and henry sit with tear of joy over the little new-born book of angelica be it not they tell each other the little spirit-child of they love how wonderful it all be how wonderful they future be go to be what do it feel like say henry playfully recall they old talk to have a book write all about one 's self it be to feel the happiest and proudest girl in the world that all the other young people be hardly less happy and excited about the little book go without say mike spend quite a large sum in copy and for a while employ he luncheon-hour in ask at book-shop with a nonchalant air as though he have barely hear of the author if they sell a little book call the book of angelica mr mesurier seem to see she faith in she boy begin to be justified and when jame mesurier open he local paper one morning and find a long and appreciative article on a certain fellow-townsman he cut it out to paste in he diary perhaps the lad would prove right after all chapter xxviii what come of publish a book it be only just to tyre to acknowledge that it behave quite sympathetically towards the young poet thus discover in its midst its newspaper review he with marked kindness -- a kindness which in a few year ' time when he have long since grow out of he baby volume he be oblige to set to the credit of the general goodness of human nature rather than to the poetic quality of he own verse in many unexpected quarter also he meet with recognition which if not always intelligent be at least gratify for praise or at least some form of notice be breath in the nostril of the young poet he hunger to feel that he personality count for something though it be merely to anger he fellow-men it be perhaps no very culpable vanity on he part to be please that people begin to point he out in the street and whisper that that be the young poet and that distant acquaintance seem more ready to smile at he than before now and again one of these would stop he to say how pleased he have be to see the kind article about he in _ the tyrian daily mail _ and that he intend to buy the work as soon as possible henry smile to himself to hear he frail little flower of a volume speak of as a work as though it have be the encyclopedia britannica and he rather wonder what that would-be purchaser would make of it as he turn over page of which so large a proportion be reserve for a spotless frame of margin no doubt he would decide that the margin have be leave for the purpose of make note -- make note on those abstruse rose-petal of boyish song even in far-away london -- which be as yet merely a sound name to these young people -- hard-worked reviewer contemptuously dispose of batch of new poetry in a few line find a kind word or two to say for the little provincial volume and through one agency or another mr leith within six week of the publication be able to announce that the edition be exhaust and that there be something like forty pound profit to share between they that poetry could be exchange for real money henry have hear but have never hope to work the miracle in he own case it be like sell moonlight or angelica 's smile be it not indeed angelica 's smile turn from one kind of gold into another one more change they should undergo and then return to she from whom they have come from mint gold of the realm they should change into the gold of a ring and thus angel should wear upon she finger the ornament of she own smile set aside a small proportion of he gain to buy esther and mike dot and mat and he mother a little memorial present each he then spend the rest on angel 's ring angel pretend to scold he for he extravagance but as no woman can resist a ring she remonstrance be not convincing and then as henry say be it not they betrothal ring and therefore one of the legitimate expense of love three other acknowledgment he poem bring he the first be a delightful letter from myrtilla williamson how much man of talent owe to the letter of woman have never be sufficiently acknowledge as the debt can never be adequately repay of the many branch of woman 's unselfishness this be perhaps the most important to the world always behind the flaming renown of some great soldier statesman or poet there be a woman 's hand or the hand maybe of many woman pour unseen the nutritive oil of praise this letter henry in the gladness of he heart ingenuously show to angel with the result that it provoke they first quarrel with the charm of a child angel it now appear unite also the fault she have it in she to be bitterly and unreasonably jealous she read the letter coldly you seem very proud of she praise she say be it so very valuable i value it a good deal at all event answer henry oh i see retorted angel i suppose my praise be nothing to hers angel dear what _ do _ you mean oh nothing of course but i be sure you must regret care for a ignorant girl like I when there be such clever talented woman in the world as you mr williamson i hate you learn woman angel i be surprised you can talk like that because we love each other be we to have no other friend have as many as you like dear do not think i mind but i do not want to see they letter very well angel answer henry quietly he be make one of those discovery of temperament which have to be make and have to be accept in all close relationship this be evidently one of angel 's fault he must try to help she with it as he must try and let she help he with he the second be a letter forward care of he printer by one of the london review which have notice he verse it be from a rise young london publisher who it appear from a envelope enclose have already try to reach he direct at tyre henry mesurier esqre author of ` the book of angelica ' tyre the address have run but the post-office of tyre have return it to the sender with the word not know officially stamp upon it he be as yet not know even in tyre in another five year he shall try again say henry savagely to himself and we shall see whether it will be ` not know ' then the letter express the writer 's pleasure in the extract he have see from mr mesurier 's book and hope that when he next book be ready he would give the writer a opportunity of publish it fortune be begin already to smile but the third acknowledgment be something more like a frown and be at all event by far the most momentous outcome of henry 's first publication one morning soon after mr leith have pay over to he he twenty pound profit he find himself unexpectedly request to step into the private office there at mr lingard 's table he find the three partner seat in solemn conclave as for a court-martial mr lingard as senior partner be the spokesman mr mesurier he begin the firm have be have a very serious consultation in regard to you and have be oblige very reluctantly i would have you believe to come to a painful conclusion we gladly acknowledge that during the last few month you work have give we more satisfaction than at one time we expect it to give but unfortunately that be not all you attention to you duty we admit have be very satisfactory it be not a sin of omission but one of commission of which we have to complain what we have to complain of as business man be a matter which perhaps you will say do not concern we though on that point we must respectfully differ from you mr mesurier you have recently publish a book henry draw himself up haughtily surely that be nothing to be ashamed of it be quite a pretty little book continue mr lingard with one of he grim smile it contain some quite pretty verse oh yes i have see it and henry notice a copy of the offend little volume lie like a rose among some legal papers at mr lingard 's left hand but its excellence as poetry be not to the point here we difficulty be that you be now brand so unmistakably as a poet that it be no use we any longer pretend to we client that you be a clerk so long as you be only suspect of be a poet and the old man smile again it do not so much matter but now that all tyre know you by you own act and deed as a poet the case be different we can no longer without risk of lose confidence with we client send a acknowledged poet to inspect they book -- though personally we may have every faith in you capacity no doubt they will be glad enough to buy you book in the future but they will be nervous of trust you with theirs at the moment and the old man laugh heartily at he own humor you mean then sir that you will have no further need for my service say henry look somewhat pale for it be one thing to hate the means of one 's livelihood and another to exchange it for none i be afraid my dear lad that that be what it come to we be i hope you will believe exceedingly sorry to come to such a conclusion both for we own sake and yours as well as that of you father -- who be a old and value friend of ours but we be able to see no other way out of the difficulty of course you will not leave we this minute but take what time you need to look round and arrange you future plan and so far as we be concern we shall part from you as good friend and sincere well-wisher the old man hold out he hand and henry take it with a grateful sense of the friendly manner in which mr lingard have perform a painful task and a certain recognition that after all a poet must be something of a nuisance to business-man when he return to he desk he sit for a long time thoughtful divide in mind between exultation that he be soon to be free to take the adventurous highway of literature and anxiety as to where in a month 's time he preliminary meal be to come from yet after all the main thing be to be free of this servitude out of freedom all thing might be hope still as henry look round at the familiar face of he fellow-clerk and realize that in a month 's time he comradeship with they would be at a end he be surprise to feel a certain pang of separation mere custom have so great a part in we affection that though a routine may have be dull and distasteful if it have any extenuate circumstance at all we change it with a certain irrational regret after all he office-life be associate with much contraband merriment and unconsciously he associate have take a valuable part in he training humanise he in certain direction as he have humanise they in other they have save he from dilettanteism and whatever he write in future would owe something warm and kindly to the year he have spend with they he very desk take on a pathetic expression as of a place that be so soon to know he no more for ever and mr smith wrangle over wet-trap and cesspool at the counter just as on the first day he have hear he almost move he to tear perhaps in ten year ' time be he to come back he would find he still at he post fervidly engage in the same altercation with only a little additional greyness at the temple to mark the lapse of time and jenkin would still be sit in the little screened-off cupboard with cashier paint on the glass window as three o'clock approach he would still be hear loudly count he cash and shovel the gold into wash-leather bag and the silver into little paper-bags marked # 5 apiece in a wild rush to reach the bank before it close and would the same good fellow a little more serious because long since marry be crack joke and loaf near the fire-guard in some rare safe hour of the afternoon when all the partner be out to make a spring for the desk as the carefully learn tread of one or another of those partner follow the opening of the front door the very work that he hate seem to wear a unwonted look of tenderness who would keep the book he have keep -- with something of he father 's neatness who would look after the account of the rev thoma salthouse or take charge of ex ` or jame shuttleworth esqre of course it be absurd -- absurd perhaps just because it be human for be he not go to be free free to fulfil he dream free to follow those voice that have so often call he from beyond the sunset soon he would be able to cry out to they with literal truth i be yours yours -- all yours and in those ten year which be to pass so invariably for mr smith and for jenkin and the rest what various and dazzling change might be must be in store for he long before the end of they he must have write masterpiece and become famous and angel and he be long settle together in they paradise of home henry be please to find that he chum be to miss he no less than he be to miss they as a unofficial master of they pale revel he place would not be easy to fill and he be much touch when a day or two before the end of the month which be the time mutually agree upon for henry to look round they intimate they desire to give a little dinner in he honor at the jovial clerk tavern henry be nothing loth and the evening come and go with no little emotion and no little wine on either side he have bid good-bye to he employer in the afternoon and mr lingard have shake he hand and admonish he as to he future with something of paternal affection toward the close of the dinner bob cherry who act as chairman rise with a unaccustomed blush upon he cheek to propose the toast of the evening they have have the honor and pleasure he say to be associate for several year past with a gentleman to whom that evening they be to say good-bye no better fellow have ever grace the office of lingard and field and he would be a real loss to the gaiety of they little world they understand that he be a poet and indeed have he not already publish a charming volume with which they be all acquaint -- still this make no difference to they certain high power might object but they like he none the less and whether he be a poet or not he be certainly a jolly good fellow and wherever he new career might take he the good wish of he old chum would certainly follow he the chairman conclude he speech by request he acceptance of a copy of the work of lord macaulay as a small remembrance of the day they have spend together the toast have be second and drunk with resounding cordiality henry respond in a speech of mingled playfulness and emotion assure they on he part that though they might not be poet he think no worse of they for that but should always remember they as the best fellow he have ever know the talk then become general and tender with reminiscence after all what a lot of pleasant thing those hard year have give they to remember so they keep the evening go and it be not till a early hour of the follow day that this important volume of henry 's life be finally close chapter xxix mike 's turn to move while henry have be busily engage in win angelica and write and print he little book mike 's fortune have not be idle meanwhile the sothern dramatic club have give two more performance in which he part have be considerable and be play by he with such success as to make the former pieman 's apprentice one of the chief member of the club mike and he friend therefore become more and more eager for he to try he talent on the great stage but this be a experiment not so easy to make however unknown a writer may be he can still at least write he book in he obscurity and when do bring it to market with a reasonable hope of its find a publisher moreover though he may remain for year unappreciated he writings still go on fight for he till he due recognition be win he have not to find he publisher before he begin to write yet it be actually such a disability under which the unproved and often the prove actor must labor unless some one engage he to act and provide a audience for he he have no opportunity of show he power and such opportunity be difficult to find unless you be a dissolute young lord or belong to one of the traditional theatrical family -- whose member be bring up to the stage as the son of a lawyer be bring up to law for the avenue to the stage be block by perhaps more frivolous incompetent than any other profession any idle girl with good look and any idle gentleman with something of a good carriage deem themselves qualify for one of the most arduous of the art mike 's plan have be to try every considerable actor that come to tyre who might possibly have a vacant place in he company but he have try many in vain while one or two be unable to see he at all most of they treat he with a kindness remarkable in man daily besiege by the innumerable hopeless they give he good advice they wish he well but already they have long list of experienced applicant wait they turn for the coveted vacancy at last however there come to tyre a famous romantic actor who be say to be more sympathetic towards the youthful aspirant than the other head of he profession and as too he be rumor to be vulnerable on the side of literature mike and henry agree to make a joint attack upon he mike should write a brief note ask for a interview and henry should follow it up with another letter to the same effect and at the same time send he a copy of the book of angelica the plan be carry out both letter and the book be send and the young man await with impatience the result henry have adopt a very lofty tone in grant my friend a interview he have say you may be give he first chance to a actor of genius of course you may not but at least you will have have the satisfaction of give to possible genius that benefit of the doubt which we have a right to expect from the creator of -- and he name one of the actor 's most famous rôles a cordial answer come by return enclose two stall for the follow evening when say the great actor he would be glad to see mr laflin during or after the performance the two young man be in they place as the curtain rise and it go without say that they enthusiasm be unequalled in the audience between the third and fourth act there be a considerable interval and early in the performance it have be notify to mike that the great actor would see he then so when the time come with a whisper good luck from henry he leave he place and be lead through a little mysterious iron door at the back of the box on to the stage and into the great man 's dressing-room opening suddenly out of the darkness at one side of the stage it be more like a brilliantly light cave hang with mirror than a room mirror and light and laurel wreath with card attach and many photograph with huge signature scrawl across they and a magnificent be read a book while he dresser lace up some high boot he be to wear in the follow act -- make mike 's first impression then the magnificent be look up with a charming smile good-evening mr laflin i be delighted to see you i hope you will excuse my rise he say mr laflin with a captivating familiarity of intonation as though mike be something between a old friend and a distinguished stranger so you be think of join we profession i hope you like the performance i see you in front or at least i think it be you and you friend i hope he will come and see I some other time i have be delighted with he poem there be something dazzling and disconcerting to a average layman about a actor 's dressing-room even though the dressing-room be that of a intimate friend he feel like a be on the confines of two world and belong to neither awkwardly suspend ` twixt fact and fancy the actor for a while have lay aside he part and forget he wig and he make-up as he talk to you he be think of himself merely as a private individual whereas he visitor can not forget that in appearance he be a king or a eighteenth-century dandy or -- though you know he well enough as a clean-shaven young man of thirty -- a bow and wrinkle greybeard the visitor 's voice ring thin and hestitate it can not strike the right pitch and generally he do himself no sort of justice perhaps however it be because mike have be bear for this world in which now for the first time he find himself that he suffer from none of this embarrassment perhaps too it be some half-conscious instinct of he own gift that make he quite self-contained in the presence of acknowledged distinction so self-contained that you might have think he have no reverence as he have pass across the stage he have eye that mysterious behind-the-scenes rather with the eye of a future stage-manager than of a youth all whose dream converge at this point and at this moment one touch of the poetry of contrast catch he eye of which custom would probably have make he unobservant in a alcove of the stage a scene-dock as mike know already to call it a beautiful spirit in gauze and tights be silently rehearse to herself a dance which she have to perform in the next act softly and silently she dance absorb in the evolution of she lithe young body pay as little heed to the rough stage-hand who hurry scenery about she on every side as those harden stage-hand pay to she dancing henry or ned would probably have fall madly in love with she on the spot to mike she be but a part of the economy of the stage and have she be cleopatra herself eye fill to overflow with the beauty of esther would have take no more intimate note of she so it be say painter and sculptor regard they model with cold artistic eye this self-possession enable mike to show to the best advantage and while they talk the great actor with a eye accustom to read face soon make up he mind about he i believe you and you friend be right mr laflin he say i be much mistaken if you be not a bear actor but if you be that you will not need to be tell that the way be long and difficult nor will you mind that it be so every true artist rather love than fear the drudgery of he art it be one of the test of he be a artist art be undoubtedly the pleasantest of all work but it be work for all that and none of the easiest perhaps it be the pleasantest because it be the hardest so if you really want to be a artist you will not object to begin you journey to the top right away at the bottom anywhere at all sir say mike he heart beat at this hint of what be come well in that case continue the other i can perhaps do something though a very little for you mike eagerly murmur he gratitude i be sorry to say i have no vacancy in my own company at present but would you be willing to take a part in my christmas pantomime i may say that i myself begin life as harlequin i will gladly take anything you can offer I say mike shall we call it settle then but i sha 'n' t need you for another four month meanwhile i will have a contract make out and send to you -- curtain rise for fourth act sir cry the call-boy put he head in at the door at that moment you see i shall have to say good-bye say the good-natured manager rise and move towards the door but i shall look forward to see you in October my good wish to you friend and so the happiest person in that theater slip back to he seat by the side of a friend who be surely as happy at he good news as though it have be he own meanwhile esther have be count the hour till ten when she make a pretence of go to bed with the rest but there be no sleep for she till she have hear mike 's news she bedroom look out from the top of the house into the front garden and she have arrange to have a lamp burning at the window so that mike on he way home should understand that all be safe for a snatch five minute ' talk in the porch she sit try to read till about midnight when through she half-opened window come the soft whistle she have be wait for turn down the lamp to show that she have hear she steal down through the quiet house and cautiously open the front door fasten it seem with a hundred bolt and chain be that you mike for answer two arm which she do not mistake for a burglar 's be throw round she esther i have find my million pound oh mike he be really go to help you and here there be no further necessity for eaves-drop all person except mike and esther will please leave the porch chapter xxx unchartered freedom on the morning after the dinner with which he bid farewell to messr lingard and field henry awake at he usual hour to a very unusual feeling for the first time in he life he could stay in bed as long as he please on the other side of the room ned hazell lay sleep the deep sleep of the unpunctual clerk and henry when he have for a moment or two dwelt upon he own happiness take a malicious joy in arouse he ned he shout get up you 'll be late for the office ned give out a deep sound something between a snore a moan and a imprecation ned he tormentor persist draw the clothes warmly round he in a luxury of indifference to the time of day ned presently begin rub he head vigorously which be one of he preliminary of awakening and then mournfully raise himself in bed a pillar of somnolence you might let a fellow have he sleep out he say why do not you get up yourself -- oh i remember you be a literary gentleman from to-day that be why you be so mighty ready to root I out and he aim a pillow at henry 's bed in derision yes henry be free a independent gentleman of time and space the clock might strike itself hoarse yet if he wish he might go on stay in bed he be free he late task-master have no jurisdiction here it would even be in he power here to order mr field out of the room and if he refuse forcibly to eject he into the street why do not mr field appear to gratify he in this matter so he indulge he imagination while ned dress in haste with the fear of the tyrant evident upon he poor fellow he would have to choose between two cup of coffee and two egg and five minute late probably he would split the difference bolt one cup of coffee and one egg and arrive two and a half minute late henry watch he with compassion and when he have go he way himself rise languidly and dress indolently as with the aid of a invisible valet at length he saunter down to breakfast and send out for a morning paper which he on no account ever read he could imagine no more insulting waste of time he look it through but find no reference to the real significance of the day breakfast over he wonder what he should do with himself how he should spend the day he clear duty be to begin be a great man on the spot and work at be a great man every day punctually from nine till six but where should he begin should he sit down in a business-like way and begin he long romantic poem or should he write a essay or again should he make a start on he novel romantic poem he feel however be only well begin on special day not easy to define essay be only write on day when we have determine to be idle -- and this after the opening flirtation with indolence must be a busy day -- and it be not every day that one can begin a novel he might arrange he book but really they be very well arrange already or suppose he go out for a walk walk quicken the brain he might go and look in at the art gallery where he have not be for a long while and see the new picture the morning paper be talk about it be by a painter whose poem he already know and love that might inspire he so by a accident of idleness he presently find himself stand rapt before the most wonderful picture he have ever see -- a picture to see which he say to himself man would make pilgrimage to tyre when tyre be a moss-grown ruinous seaport from which the traffic of the world have long since pass away henry at this time have visit none of the great gallery and except in a few reproduction know nothing of the great italian master therefore to he this picture be italy the renaissance and catholicism all concentrate into one enthralling canvas but it be something greater than that it be the terrible meeting of youth and love and death in one tremendous moment of infinite loss infinite passion and infinite loss be here picture in a medium which combine all that be spiritual and all that be sensual in a harmony of beauty that be in the same moment delirium and peace the irresistible cry of the color to the sens the spheral call of the theme and its agony to the soul beatrice dead and dante take in a dream across the strew poppy of she death-chamber to look he last on the sleep face yet a little smile in the after-glow of life she soul already carry by angel far over the curved and fluted roof of the florentine house on its way to paradise little beatrice not till they meet again in paradise shall he see again that holy face in a dream of loss he gaze upon she as the angel lift up the flower-garnished sheet and not only she face but every detail of that room of death be etch in tear upon he eye -- the distant wind stair the pallid death-lamp the intrude light of day all passion and all loss all youth all love and all death meet together in a everlasting requiem of tragic color henry sit long before this picture envelop as it be in its rich gloom as the paint profundity of a church absorb one in its depths and with the impression of its solemn beauty be blent a despairing awe of the artist who of a little colored earth have create such a masterpiece of vitality throw on to a thin screen of canvas so enduringly palpable so sumptuous and so poignantly dominate a reflection of he vision what a passionate energy of beauty must have be in this man 's soul what a constant fury of meditation upon thing divine when henry come back to himself he first thought be to share it with angel little soul how she face would flame how she body would tremble with the wonder of it in the minutiae the technicality of appreciation angel like henry himself might be lack but in the motive fervor of appreciation who be like she it be almost painful to see the joy which certain simple wonder give she anything intense or prodigal in nature any splendidly fluent outpouring of the element -- the fierce life of streaming fire water in glide or tumultuous mass the vivid gold of crocus and daffodil spout up through the earth in spring the exquisite liquidity of a bird singing -- these as with all elemental poetic nature give she the same keen joy which we fable for those who in the intense morning of the world first hear they fable indeed for why should we suppose that because ear deaf a thousand year hear the nightingale too it should therefore be less new for those who to-night hear it for the first time rather shall it be more than less for we by the memory transmit in we blood from all the generation who before have listen and go they way so henry seek out angel and they both stand in front of the great picture for a long while without a word presently angel put the feeling of both of they into a single phrase -- henry dear we have find we church and indeed for many month henceforth this picture be to be they altar they place of prayer often hereafter when they hope be overcast or life grow mean with little care they would slip singly or together into that gallery and -- let the beauty of eternity smooth from they brow the little fret of time thus henry 's first day of freedom have begin auspiciously with the unexpected discovery of a inalienable possession of beauty yet the little care be not far off wait they time and that night henry lay long awake ask himself what he be go to do whence be to come the material gold and silver by which this impetuous spirit be to be sustain a sum not exceed five pound represent he accumulate resource and they would not last longer than -- five pound he need little but that little he need emphatically soon a new book and other literary project would keep he go but -- meanwhile how be the next two or three month to be bridge return to he father 's house he neither would nor perhaps indeed could so he lay awake a long while fruitlessly think but just before he sleep a thought that make he laugh himself awake suggest itself : why not go and ask aunt tip to take pity on you so he go to sleep resolve if only for the fun of it to pay a visit to aunt tipping on the morrow chapter xxxi a preposterous aunt no doubt it have be surmise from what have go before that when henry say to himself that he would go and see aunt tip he do not propose to himself a visit to the country seat of some quaint old lady of quality baronial tower and stately avenue of ancestral elm do not make a picturesque background for he thought as he recall aunt tip poor kind aunt tip it be a shame to banter she memory even in so obvious a fashion for if ever there be a kind heart it be hers in fact she possess in a degree that amount to genius one of the rarest of human quality -- unconditional pity for the unhappy human creature within she narrow and squalid sphere she be never know to fail of such succor as be hers to give to misfortune however well-merited or misery however self-made no religion or philosophy have ever yet be merciful enough to human weakness matilda tip repair the lack so far as she go in fact she have unconsciously realize that weakness _ be _ human nature it would be difficult to fix upon a offence that would disqualify you for aunt tipping 's pity to the prodigality of the passion and the appetite disastrously indulge she be accustom by a long succession of those sad and shady lodger to whom it be part of she precarious livelihood to let she room and not infrequently to forgive they they rent that man and woman should drink too much and love too many be she experience tell she one of those law of nature that seem to make a good deal of unnecessary inconvenience in mortal affair but against which mere preaching or punishment avail nothing all that be to be do be so far as possible to repair they ravages in particular instance and heal the wound of human passion with simple human kindness of two vessel one for honor and the other for dishonor surely nature never make so complete a contrast as matilda tipping and she sister mary mesurier both country girl bear in a humble though defiantly respectable stratum of society the way of the two sister have already part in childhood mary be studious neat and religious matilda be tomboyish impatient of restraint and fond of unedifying associate you aunt never aspire mr mesurier would say of aunt tipping sometimes to she child and while still a child she have often reproach she with she fondness for gossip with companion beneath she matilda could never be persuade to care for book she be naturally illiterate and even late in life have a fix aversion to write she own letter whereas at the age of seven mary have be public scrivener for the whole village but with these regrettable instinct from the first matilda have also manifest a whimsical liveliness a unconquerable lightheartedness which make you forgive she anything and for which poor soul she have use enough before she be do with life at seventeen add to good look of which at fifty there be scarcely a trace in the thin and meanly worn face this vivacity have prove a tragic snare a certain young capitalist -- know as a great gentleman -- of that countryside have pounce down on the gay and careless young matilda and have at once provide she life with its formative tragedy and its deathless romance even at fifty hopelessly bury among the back street and pawnshop of life heaven still open in the heart of matilda tipping at the mention of the name of william allsopp for several year she have live with the mesurier as general help to she sister between whom and she in spite of surface disparity there be a indissoluble bond of affection till at thirty-five or so she have suddenly win the heart of a sad old widower of fifty-five name samuel tipping samuel tip be no ordinary widower as you look at he severe thoughtful face surmount by a shock of beautiful white hair you instinctively respect he and when you hear that he live by cobble shoe by day and play a violin in the theater royal orchestra by night occasionally put off he leather apron to give a music lesson in the front parlor of a afternoon you respect he all the more there have be but one thing against mr tipping 's eligibility for marriage matilda tip would tell you even year after with a lowering of she voice : he be say to be a atheist and a reader of strange book yet he seem a quiet manageable man and likely -- again in mr tip 's phrase -- to prove a good provider so she have risk he heterodoxy which indeed be a somewhat fanciful objection on she part and make he as he declare with he die breath the best of wife it chance that when henry in pursuance of he over-night resolve make he way the follow afternoon through a dingy little street and knock on the door of a dingy little house bearing upon a brass plate the legend boot neatly repair mr tip be engage in give one of those very music lesson a dingy little maid-of-all-work open the door and say that mr tip be out shopping but would be back soon from the front parlor come the lifeless tum-tumming of the piano and mr tipping 's voice gruffly count time to the cheerless five-finger exercise of a very evident beginner one -- two -- three one -- two -- three one -- two -- three go mr tipping 's voice with a occasional infusion of savagery but mr tipping be at home say henry i will wait till he be disengage i will make myself comfortable in the kitchen -lrb- henry know he way about at aunt tipping 's and remember there be only one front parlor -rrb- add with something of pride i be mr tip 's nephew you know presently the torture in the front parlor be at a end and as mr tipping be about to turn upstairs to the little back room where he mend he shoe henry emerge upon he from the kitchen they have have some talk on book and the general misgovernment of the universe -- for mr tip really be something of a atheist -- on henry 's occasional visit and be no stranger to each other why henry lad whoever expect to see you you aunt 's out at present but she 'll be back soon come into the parlor if you do not mind uncle tipping i would rather come upstairs with you i love the smell of the leather and the sight of all those sharp little knife and the black shiny ` dubbin ' do you call it and we can have a talk about book till aunt come home all right lad but it be a dusty place and there be hardly a corner to sit down in so up they go to a little room where in a chaos of boot mend on one hand and boot to mend on the other sheet of leather lie about in one corner a great tubfull of water in which the leather be soak -- a old boyish fascination of henry 's -- mr tip spend the greater part of he day he sit on a low bench near a window along which run a broad sill full of tool on this too lay a open book into which mr tip would dip now and again when he could safely leave the boot he be engage upon to the mechanical skill of he hand at one end of the tool-shelf be a small collection of book a dozen or so shabby volume though these be far from constitute mr tipping 's complete library mr tip belong to that pathetic army of book-lover who subsist on the refuse of the stall which he hunt not for rare edition but for the sheer bread of life or rather the stale crust of knowledge he taste be not literary in the special sense of the word for belles-lettres he have no fancy and fine passage except in so far as they be controversial leave he cold he mind be primarily scientific secondarily philosophic and occasionally historic travels and book of physical science be the find for which mainly he rummage the stall at the moment he pet study be astronomy and a curious apparatus in one of the corner which henry have notice as he enter be he sad attempt to rig up a telescope for himself it be not so bad as it look he say point it out but then he add with a smile half sad and half humorous there be not many star to be see from tichborne street it be a touching characteristic of the type of bookman to which mr tip belong that the astronomy from which he be read by no means embody the latest discovery in fact it narrowly escape be eighteenth-century science for it be date very early in the eighteen hundred but a astronomy be a astronomy to mr tipping and have copernicus be bear late enough he would most certainly have imbibe ptolemaic doctrine with grateful unsuspicion indeed have it be put to he : this astronomy after copernicus at half-a-crown and this after ptolemy for sixpence he means alone would have leave he no choice it be so the old clothes of the mind like the old clothes of the body -- supersede science forget philosophy -- find a market and a book remain a book with the power of comforting or divert some indigent poor soul so long as the stitch hold it together presently there be a knock at the front door there be you aunt say mr tipping and as the door open the little maid-of-all-work be to be hear whisper she mistress that a young gentleman who say he be she nephew have come and be upstairs with the master well i never exclaim mr tip immediately start upstairs towards the open door of the cobblery henry be stand on the threshold and the warm-hearted little woman give he a hearty hug of welcome well i _ be _ glad to see you and how be they all at home and she run over the list name for name we must not forget you father but he be a hard ` un and no mistake say the aunt put on a mimic expression of severity he be a upright man be james mesurier say mr tip rather severely oh yes yes we know that crosspatch i be say nothing against he he be good at heart i know but he be a little hard on the surface -- like some other folk i know make a face at she husband but you must come down and talk to I a bit lad you 'll have have enough of he and he old book you never see the like of he here he sit day after day over he musty book and you can hardly get he away for he meal he be no company for any one talk of something you can understand lass retort the husband in a voice that take any unkindness from the word rather like a father than a husband you do not ail much for lack of company i be sure now if it be only a good novel he wife persist but nothing but travel geography and such like last thing he be take up with be the star i suppose he be be tell you about they -- and she say this half as though it be a new form of lunacy mr tipping have develop and half as though he have be open up new realm of knowledge -- original but useless she be far indeed from understand that lonely mind and its tragedy thirst so hopelessly for knowledge and to die athirst she hear he knock knock all day upstairs but the knock tell she nothing of he loneliness he be just a good hard-working rather cross old man unaccountably fond of print matter whom she like to be good to and if in she time that knock upstairs should stop for ever -- well she be not one to meet trouble half way but she would miss it a good deal old man as he be she be herself near fifty but she slim little wiry body and she elfish wrinkled face never still but ever alive with the same vivacity that year ago have attract william allsopp make she seem younger than she year and she husband treat she as though she be still a child a wilful child eh matilda he say you be just a child no more nor less -- just a child the year have not tame you one bit -- get out with you and you old star she say laughing henry come along and have a talk with you old aunt though invincibly cheerful through it all aunt tip be always in trouble if not for herself for somebody else to-day it be for herself though it be but a minor reverse in the guerilla warfare of she life a distressed lodger who have just leave have beg she to accept in lieu of rent the pawn-ticket of a handsome clock which have be hers in happier day and mr tip move as she always be by any tale of woe however elaborate have consent nor in she world be such a way of settle account very exceptional for pawn-ticket be there look upon as legitimately negotiable security indeed aunt tip be seldom without a selection of such security upon she hand and if a neighbor should chance to be in need say of a new set of chimney ornament as likely as not aunt tipping have in she purse a pledge for the very thing this she would sell at a reasonable profit which would probably amount to but a small proportion of the original debt for which she have accept it it be not a lucrative business though there be occasional bargain in it in that word bargain all the active romance of aunt tipping 's life be now centre in all department of the cast-off and the second-hand she be a daring speculator and a spirited auction now and again exhilarate she as much as a fortnight by the sea that house which she fight so desperately to keep tidy and respectable have be furnish almost entirely in this way there be hardly a article in it that have not already live other life in other house before it have be pick up dirt cheap by aunt tipping but this afternoon she confidence in human nature have receive a cruel wound when after a hour 's weary drag to a remote end of the town she have arrive at the pawnshop where be preserve the handsome clock of the distressed lady and have confidently present the ticket and the necessary money the man have look awhile perplexed they have no such clock he say and then as he further examine the ticket a light break in upon he my dear lady he say look here the year on this ticket have be change so indeed it have and poor aunt tip be at least a year too late do you ever hear of such treatment she say to henry and such a nice lady she be ' i shall never forget you goodness to I mr tip ' she say as she go away ` never if i live to be a hundred ' i 'll ` goodness ' she if ever i catch she cheating honest folk like that such people ought not to be allow i do not know how people can behave so aunt tipping 's indignation seldom outlive a few plaintive word of this sort and have the offend lady of the clock appear next moment and give some arabian night ' explanation there be little doubt that aunt tip would have forgive she on the spot a tendency to do so be already active in she next remark -- well poor soul we must not be too hard on she we never know what we may be bring to ourselves for it be aunt tipping 's unformulated axiom that whatever cock-and-bull story misfortune may tell there be always some truth in human misery when henry have tell aunt tip he story and venture to hint a suggestion that if it should not be inconvenient for she he would like to take sanctuary with she for a month or two till he get he hope into work order she little sharp face fairly gleam with delight you would have think that he be bring she some great benefit instead of propose to take something from she that he should have think of _ she _ such a little humble aunt that add to the love she have for any one with any tincture of she family 's blood running in they vein plus she general weakness for any one in trouble bring tear to she eye that make she look quite young again i should think so indeed she say the best you poor old auntie 's get be yours with all she heart -- ah you father never understand you you have get too much of we side of the family in you you be a bit wild you know lad but you be none the worse for that eh there be no need to say that aunt tipping 's understanding of the taste and ambition which have drive henry momentarily to take refuge with she be of the vaguest but all she need to know of such a situation be that : here on the one hand be something somebody very much want to do and here on the other be certain stern power rank against he do it that be enough for she she sympathy with all form of revolt be instantaneous for law and order as such she have a instinctive antipathy as in all contest whatsoever she one general rule be : side with the weaker and it can not but have be perceive that so much sympathy with weakness could hardly have be in the gift of weakness no aunt tip be entirely impersonal in these charity of feeling and it be because there be so much sterling honesty and strength hide in she little wiry frame that she could afford so much succor to those who be neither honest nor strong well it be nice of you to think of you poor old aunt she repeat again and again and then she remark on the good fortune which have cause the vacation of the front room over the parlor she grievance against the lady of the handsome clock quite forget it be a nice airy room she say and then she begin plan how she might best arrange it for he comfort dear little aunt say henry take the little wisp of a woman into he arm you be the salt of the earth \* \* \* \* \* why ever do not i think of it before exclaim aunt tip presently i have get the very gentleman to help you with you write indeed say henry somewhat sceptical yes he be down there in the back parlor they say he be a great writer continue aunt tipping but he be not very well the last day or two and do not see anybody to tell the truth poor gentleman she confide lower she voice he be just a little too fond of he glass but he be as good and kind a gentleman as ever step and always regular with he rent every Monday morning there be usually something mysterious about aunt tipping 's lodger at they best she have know they as elaborately wrong bye-product of aristocracy many of they be lawful expectant of illegally delay fortune and at the very least they always drink romantically thus it be that to the somewhat amuse surprise of he family henry come to take up he abode for a while with aunt tipping and that he book and the cast of dante and the sketch of the young dante do in sepia by myrtillum williamson 's own fair hand come to find themselves in the incongruous environment of tichborne street chapter xxxii the literary gentleman in the back parlor aunt tip prove not so ludicrously out of it after all in regard to the literary gentleman in the back parlor henry have hardly know what to expect but certainly he have picture no one so interesting as ashton gerard prove to be for a dark den smell strongly of whisky and water and some slovenly creature of the under-world crouch in a dirty armchair over the fire he find instead a pleasant little room very neatly keep with book two or three good picture and general evidence of cultivate taste and on mr gerard 's refined sad face which be shaven and surmount by a tuft of vigorous curly hair once black but now curiously splash with vivid flake of white retain something of boyish beauty even at forty you look in vain for the mark of one who be in the grip of a imperious vice only by the marked dimness and weariness of he blue eye which give the face a rather helpless dreamy expression might the experienced observer have understand so to speak the ocular will have go out of they they no longer grasp the visible but glide listlessly over it nor do they seem to be look on thing invisible they be the eye of the drowned mr gerard have exceedingly gentle manners it be easy to understand that a landlady would worship he he give little trouble ask for the most necessary service as though it be a courtesy and never forget a interest in aunt tipping 's affair on bright day he reveal a vein of quite boyish gaiety and in he talk with henry he flash out a strange paradoxical humor too often morbid in its theme which as usually the case with such humor be really sadness come to the surface in a jest it soon transpire that a favorite subject of he talk be that very weakness which most man would have be at pain to hide so you be go to be a poet mr mesurier he say well so be i once so be i -- but he continue all too early another muse take hold of I a terrible muse -- yet a muse who never forsake you -- and he lay he hand on a decanter which stand near he on the table -- yes mr mesurier the terrible muse of drink you may be surprise to hear I talk so yet be this laudanum instead of brandy there would seem to you a certain element of the poetic in the service of such a muse drink with oriental or unfamiliar name have a romantic sound thus alfr de musset as the slave to absinthe sound much more poetic than say alfred de musset as a slave to rum or gin or even this brandy here yet this too be no less the stuff that dream be make of and the opium-eater the absinthe-sipper the brandy-drinker be all member of the same great brotherhood of tragic idealist -- he talk deliberately but there be a smile playing at the corner of the mouth which take from he talk the sense of a painful self-revelation and give it the air of a playful fantasia upon a paradox that for the moment amuse he idealist yes he continue for what few understand be that drink be a idealism -- and he presently add with a laugh and of course like all idealism it have its danger with a monomaniac conversation be apt to limit itself to monologue so while henry be greatly interested in this odd talk it leave he but little to say i be afraid i shock you a little mr mesurier perhaps even -- disgust you say mr gerard indeed no exclaimed henry but both the subject and you way of treat it be i confess a little new to I you be surprise to find one who be what be popularly know as a drunkard not so much ashamed of as interested in himself be not that it well that come of the introspective literary temperament it be only the oyster fascinate by the pearl that be kill it you should write some ` confession ' after the manner of de quincey say henry indeed i have often think of it for there be so much that need say on the subject there be nothing with which we be at once so familiar and of which we know so little for example -- and now he be quite plainly off again -- for example the passion for i might say the dream of drink be usually regard as a sensual appetite a physical indulgence no doubt in its first crude stage it often be so but soon it become something much more strange and abstract it become a mysterious command issue we know not whence it be hardly a desire and it be not so much a joyless as a quite colourless obedience to a imperious necessity decree by some unknown will you might well imagine that i like the taste of this brandy there as a child be greedily fond of sweetstuff but it would be quite a mistake for my own personal taste there be no drink like a cup of tea it be the demon the strange will that have impose itself upon I that have a taste for brandy i sometimes wonder whether we poor drunkard be not the victim of disembodied power of the air who by some chance have contract a craving for earthly liquor and can only satisfy that craving by fasten themselves upon some unhappy human organism at time there come a intermission of the command as mysterious almost as the command itself for week together we give no thought to we tyrant we grow gay and young and innocent again we be free -- so free we seem to have forget that we be ever enslave then suddenly one day we hear the call again we cry for mercy we throw ourselves on we knee in prayer we clutch sacred relic we conjure the aid of holy memory we say over to ourselves the name of the dead we have love : but it be all in vain -- surely we be drag to the foot of that inexorable will surely we submit ourselves once more to the dark dominion henry listen fascinate and a little frightened the longer i live the more i grow convinced that this be no mere fancy but actual science mr gerard continue for again you might well imagine that one drink for the dream or other illusory effect it be say to produce at first perhaps yes but such effect speedily pass away they pass away indeed before the tyranny have establish itself while it would still be possible to shake it off no the dream of drink be poor thing not worth have at the best indeed there be no dream worth have believe I but those of youth and health and spring-water and mr gerard pass for awhile in silence into some hidden country of he lost dream henry gaze at he with a curious wonder here be a man evidently of considerable gift a man of ideal of humor a man witty and gentle who surely could have easily make he mark in the world and yet he have throw all away for a mechanical habit which he himself do not pretend to be a passion -- a mere abstract attraction : as though a man should say i care not for the joy or success of this world my destiny be to sit alone all day and count my finger and toe count they over and over and over again there be not much pleasure in it and i should be glad to break off the habit -- but there it be it be impose upon I by a will stronger than mine which i must obey it be my destiny yes idealist say mr gerard presently come back from he dream to he great subject with a laugh that remind I of a story a business friend of mine tell I the other day a clerk in he office be a incorrigible drunkard he be quite alone in the world and have no one dependent upon he the firm have be lenient to he and again and again forgive he outbreak but one morning they call he in and say : ` look here jone we have have a great deal of patience with you but the time have come when you must choose between the drink and the office ' to they surprise jone instead of eagerly promising reform look up gravely and reply ` will you give I a week to think it over sir it be a very serious matter ' drink be all the poor fellow have outside he drudgery be it to be expect that he should thus lightly sacrifice it -- but to talk about something else you aunt mr tip who have a great idea of my literary importance have a notion that i may be of some help to you mr mesurier well i 'll tell you the whole extent of my present literary engagement and you be perfectly at liberty to laugh at the present time i do the sport note for the _ tyrian daily mail _ and i write the theological review for _ the fleet street review _ these apparently incongruous occupation be the relic of a old taste for sport which as a boy in the country i have ample opportunity for indulge and of a interrupted training for the church -- ` twixt then and now there be a eventful gap which if you do not mind we will not sadden each other by fill -- let we fill we glass and we pipe instead and have fail so entirely myself i will give you minute direction how to succeed in literature mr gerard 's discourse on how to succeed in literature be partly practical and partly ironical and probably too technical to interest the general reader who have no intention of be a great or a little writer and who perhaps have already find mr gerard 's previous discourse a little too special in its character suffice it that henry hear much to remember and much to laugh over and that mr gerard conclude with a practical offer of kindness i do not know how much use it may be to you he say but if you care to have it i should be very glad to give you a letter to the editor of _ the fleet street review _ he have i think a certain regard for I and he might send you a book to do now and again at all event it would be something henry embrace the offer gratefully and it occur to he that in a day or two 's time there be a five day ' excursion run from tyre to london and back for half-a-guinea why not take it and expend he last five pound in a stimulate glimpse of the city he some day hope to conquer he could then see he friend the publisher present he letter to the editor and perhaps bring home with he some little work and a renew stock of hope so before they part that night mr gerard write he the letter chapter xxxiii this be london this be life thus it be that all unexpectedly henry find himself set down one autumn morning at the homeless hour of a quarter-to-seven in euston station he be go to stay in some street off the strand and charter a hansom to take he there few great city be impressive in the neighborhood of they railway terminus you enter they so to speak by the back door and london wave no banner of bright welcome to the stranger who first enter it by the euston road but there be a interesting church presently and on a dust-cart close by henry read vestry of st pancra can that be the st pancra ' church he say to himself where mary wollstonecraft lie bury and brown be marry then as they drive along through bloomsbury the name great coram street catch he eye and he exclaim with delight : why that be where thackeray live for a time great coram street be little accustomed to create such excitement in the breast of the passer-by but to the stranger london be necessarily first a museum till he begin to love it as a home and in addition to dead man 's association begin to people it with memory of he own when you have live awhile in gray 's inn you grow to forget that bacon 's ghost be you fellow-tenant and it be the kind-hearted provincial who from time to time lay those flower on goldsmith 's tomb when you be catch in a block on westminster bridge with only five minute to get to waterloo you forget to say to yourself : ah this be the bridge on which wordsworth write he famous sonnet you usually say something quite different the mere name of the street -- how laden with immemorial poetry they be chancery lane how wonderful yet the poor wretch standing outside the public-house at the corner seem to derive small consolation from the fact that he be starve in chancery lane but to henry as yet london be a extended westminster abbey and every other street be poet 's corner he have hardly patience to breakfast so eager be he to be out in the street and while he eat he eye be out of the window all the time and he ear drink in all the london morning sound like music at the foot of the street run the thame he have catch a thrilling glimpse of it as he step from he cab and have have a childish impulse to rush down to it before enter he hotel at last free of food and baggage light of heart and brimming over with youth he step into the street it be but little past eight o'clock he have just hear the hour chime in various tone of sweetness and solemnity from several mellow clock evidently hide high in the air in he near vicinity for two or three hour there would be no editor or publisher to be see and meanwhile he have london to himself he step out into it as into a garden -- a garden of those old-time flower in which antiquity have become a perfume full of picture yes there be the thame sweet themme run softly till i end my song he quote to himself chaucer 's spenser 's elizabeth 's thame it be a bright morning and the river gleam to advantage the tall tower of westminster glitter richly in the sun and the long front of somerset house wear a lordly smile the embankment garden sparkle and rustle in morning freshness henry draw in the air of london as though it have be a rose here be the thame at the foot of the street and there at the head be the strand a stream of omnibus and cab and city-faring man and woman the temple must be somewhere close by of course it be here to he left but he would first walk quietly by the thame side to westminster and then come back by the strand as he walk he step lightly and gently as though reverent to the very stone of so sacred a city and all the time from every prospect and every other street-corner come streaming like strain of music magnetic memory -- street with the name of old king strong earl and warrior saint if for no other reason how important for the future of a nation be it to preserve in such ancient city as london and oxford the energise spectacle of a noble and strenuous antiquity for there be no such inspirer of young man as these old place so much strength and youth go into they long ago that even yet they have strength and youth to give and from they as from the strong hill pour out a inexhaustible potency of brace influence at last henry find himself back at the top-end of he street he have walk the strand with deliberate enjoyment fleet street he still reserve but as accord to the tower of clement dane it be only just ten o'clock it seem still a little early to attack he business a florist 's close by suggest a charming commonplace way of fill the time he would buy some flower and carry they to goldsmith 's grave why goldsmith 's grave should thus be specially honor he a little wonder he be conscious of loving several writer quite as well but it be a johnsonian tradition to love goldy and the accessibility of he resting-place make sentiment easy he repent this momentary flippancy of think as he stand in the cloistered corner where goldsmith sleep under the eye of the law and when he lay he little wreath on the worn stone it be a genuine offering from it he turn away to he own personal dream by eleven he have find he friend the publisher in a dainty little place of business cram with pottery rowlandson and book and more like a curiosity-shop than a publishing-house for the publisher prove a enthusiast in everything that be beautiful or curious and have indeed take to publish from that rare motive in a publisher -- the love of book rather than the love of money he be aim to make he little shop the rallying-point of all the young talent of the day and as young talent have never too many publisher on the look-out for it he task be not difficult though it be one of those real service to literature which such publisher and bookseller have occasionally do in we literary history with but scant acknowledgment henry be please to find that he look upon he to make one of he little band of youth and as the publisher understand the art of encouragement henry already feel it have be worth while to come to london just to see he he know the editor to whom henry have a letter and volunteer he another the afternoon would be the best time meanwhile they must lunch together he smile when henry suggest the cheshire cheese henry have a sort of vague idea that literary man could hardly think of take they meal anywhere else there have be a attempt to bring it into fashion again the publisher say but it have come to nothing -- though he for one love those old chop-house with they tankard and they sanded floor so to the cheshire cheese they repair and drink to a long friendship in foam pewter of porter alas say henry we be fall on smaller time once it be ` the poet 's pint of port ' now we must be content with the poetaster 's half-a-pint of porter you must come to my room to-night say the publisher and be introduce to some of we young man i have one or two of we older critic come too henry 's fortune be evidently make he find the editor in a dim back room at the top of a high building so lose in a world of book and dust that at first henry could hardly make he out write by a window with he back to the door then a alert head turn round to he and a rather peevish gesture bid he be seat while the editor resume he work this hardly come up to henry 's magnificent dream of the editorial dignity perhaps he have a vague idea that editor live in palace and sit on throne presently the editor put down he pen with a exclamation of satisfaction and the first impression of peevishness vanish in the cordiality with which he now turn to he visitor you must excuse my absorption it be a rather tough piece of proof-reading a subject i be rather interested in -- new welsh dictionary do not suppose it be in you line eh eh -- and the tall spare man laugh a boyish laugh like a mischievous bird and toss he head at the jest he face be small and sallow and tired but the dark eye be full of fun and kindness presently he rise and begin to walk up and down the room with a curious prance walk roll himself a cigarette and talk away in a rapid jerky fashion with he continual eh eh come in all the time poor gerard so you know he how be he now and he lower he voice with the suggestion of a mutual confidence and stop in he walk till henry should answer poor gerard and he might have be -- well well -- never mind we be together at king 's brilliant fellow so you know gerard dear I dear I then he turn to the subject of henry 's visit well my poor boy nothing will satisfy you but literature you be determine to be a literary man eh eh then he stop in front of henry and lay he hand kindly on he shoulder be it too late to say ` go back while there be yet time ' perhaps -- of course -- you be go to be a very great man and he break off into he walk again with one of he mischievous laugh but unless you be take my word it be a poor game -- yet i suppose it be no use talk i know waste breath waste breath -- well now what can you do and by the way you will not grow fat on _ the fleet street review _ ten shilling a column be we magnificent rate of payment and we can hardly afford that -- then he begin pull out one book and another from the pile of all sort that lay around he i suppose like the rest you would better begin on poetry there be a tableful over there -- go and take you pick of it unless of course you have get some special subject you be not i suppose a authority on assyriology eh eh henry fear not and then a new fit of industry come upon the editor and he beg henry to take a look at the book while he run through another proof for the post that dusty table -- evidently the rubbish-heap of the room -- be henry 's first object-lesson in the half tragical half farcical over-production of modern literature such a mass of foolishness and ineptitude he have never conceive of such pretentiousness too -- and while he make various melancholy reflection upon human vanity what should he unearth suddenly from the heap but he own little volume he could but half suppress a cry of recognition what be that ask the editor not turn round find anything no say henry nothing -- for a moment i think i have presently he have make a small pile of the most promising volume and turn to take he leave the editor take up one or two of they carelessly not much here i be afraid he say never mind see what you can make of they not more than three column at the most you know and come and see I again i be glad to have see you oh say henry on the point of leave and lay he hand on he own little book may i take this one too it be not worth review but it rather interested I just now god bless I yes certainly say the editor you be welcome to the lot if you care to bring a hand-cart good-bye good-bye and henry slip he poor little neglect volume into he pocket on how many dusty table he wonder be it then lie ignominiously disregard well the day would come meanwhile he have he first batch of book for review chapter xxxiv the wit there now remain the gathering of wit fix for the evening he publisher have ask he to dinner but he have decline from a secret and absurd desire to dine at the cock this he gratify and with he mind full of the spacious time of the early victorian he turn into the publisher 's little room about nine o'clock to meet some of the later there be no great muster as yet some half-a-dozen rather shy young man spasmodically pick up strange drawing or odd-looking book lie about on the publisher 's table struggle maidenly with cigar sip a little whisky and soda but little be say among they a pale-faced lad of about fifteen miraculously self-possessed stand with he back to the chimney-piece but soon other begin to turn in and by ten the room be as full of chatter and smoke as it could hold not least conspicuous among the talker be the pale-faced boy of fifteen henry have be sit near to he and have be suddenly startle by he unexpectedly break out into a volley of learn deliver in a voice impressively deliberate and sententious what a remarkable boy that be say henry innocently to the publisher yes but he be not quite a boy -- though he be young enough a curious little creature morbidly learn a friend of mine say that he would like to catch he and keep he in a bottle and label it ` the learn homunculus ' what dialect be it he be talk in say henry i do not remember to have hear it before the publisher smile : my dear fellow you must be careful what you say that be what we call ` the oxford voice ' how remarkable say henry he attention call off by a be with a face that half suggest a faun and half suggest a flower -- a small olive-skinned face crown with purply black hair that keep fall in a elflock over he forehead and violet eye set slant-wise he be talk earnestly of fairy in a beautiful irish accent and henry like he the attraction seem mutual and henry find himself draw into a remarkable relation about a fairy-hill in connemara and fairy light that for several night have be see glimmer about it and how at last he -- that be the narrator -- and a particularly hard-headed friend of he have keep watch one moonlit night with the result that they have actually see and talk with the queen of the fairy and learn many secret of the -- the narrator here make use of a long unpronounceable irish word which henry could not catch i should have explain some of these phenomenon to you whisper the publisher presently notice that henry look a little bewildered this be a young irish poet who in the interval of he raise the devil write very beautiful lyric that he may well have learn from the fairy it be he method to seem mad on magic and such thing you will meet with many strange method here to-night do not be alarm if some one come and talk to you about strange sin you have come to london in the ` strange sin ' period i will explain afterwards he have hardly speak when a pallid young man with a preternatural length and narrowness of face begin to talk to he about the sin of the borgia i suppose you never commit a murder yourself he ask henry languidly no say henry catch the spirit of the foolishness no not yet i be keep that -- imply that he be reserve so extreme a stimulant till all he other vice fail he presently there enter a tall young man with a long thin face curtain on either side with enormous mass of black hair like a slip of the young moon glimmer through a pine-wood at the same moment there enter as if by design he very antithesis : a short firmly build clerkly fellow with a head like a billiard-ball in need of a shave a big brown moustache and enormous spectacles that say the publisher refer to the moon-in-the-pine-wood young man be we young apostle of sentiment we new man of feel the best-hated man we have and the other be we young apostle of blood he be all for muscle and brutality -- and he make all the money it be one of we many fashion just now to sing ` britain and brutality ' but my impression be that we young man of feeling will have he day -- though he will have to wait for it he would hasten it if he would cut he hair but that he say he will never do he hair he say be he battle-cry well he enjoy himself -- and love a fight though you might not think it to look at he a supercilious young man with pink cheek and a voice which he admirer compare to shelley 's then come up to henry and ask he what he think of mallarmé 's latest sonnet but find henry confessedly at sea turn the conversation to the empire ballet of which unfortunately henry know as little the conversation then languish and the shelley-voiced young man turn elsewhere for sympathy with a shrug at you country bumpkin who know nothing later than rossettus in the thick of the conversational turmoil henry 's attention have from time to time be attract by the noise proceeding from a bluster red-headed man with a face of fire who be that at last he find opportunity to ask he friend that be we greatest critic say the publisher oh say henry i must try and hear what he be say it seem important from the way he be listen to so henry listen and hear how the fire-faced man say the word damn with great volubility and variety of cadence and other word to the same effect and how the little group around he hang upon he word and say to each other how brilliant how absolute henry turn to he friend the only word i can catch be the word ` damn ' he say that say the publisher with a laugh be the master-word of fashionable criticism presently a little talkative man come up and say that he hope mr mesurier be a adherent of the rightful king oh of course say henry and do you belong to any secret society ask the little man henry could not say that he do well you must join we he say i suppose there will not be a rise just yet ask henry realize that this be the jacobite method not just yet say the little man reassuringly so henry be enrol \* \* \* \* \* and so it go on till past midnight when henry at last escape to talk it all over with the star the evening have naturally puzzle he as a man will always be puzzle who have develop under the influence of the main tendency of he generation and who find himself suddenly in a backwater of fanciful reaction henry in he simple way be a thinker and a radical and he have nourish himself on the great main-road master of english literature he have follow the lead of modern philosopher and scientist and have arrive at a mystical agnosticism -- the first step of which be to banish the dogma of the church as old wife ' tale he consider that he have inherit the hard-won gain of the rationalist but he come to london and find young man feebly play with the fire of that romanism which he regard as at once the most childish and the most dangerous of all intellectual obsession in a age of great biologist and electrician he come upon child prettily talk about fairy and the philosopher 's stone in one of the greatest age of english poetry he come to london to find young english poet fall on they knee to the metrical mathematician of france in the great age of democracy a fool have come and ask he if he be not a supporter of the house of stuart a jacobite of charade but only once have he hear the name of milton it be the learn boy of fifteen who have quote he -- a lifelong debt of gratitude and never once have he hear the voice of simple human feeling nor hear one speak of beauty simply passionately with he heart in he mouth nor of love with he heart upon he sleeve much cleverness much learning much charm there have be but he have miss the generous human impulse no one seem to be do anything because he must these be pleasant eddy dainty with lily and curiously star water-grass but the great warm stream of english literature be not flow here as he near he hotel he think of he morning visit to goldsmith 's tomb and ten-fold he repent the little half-sneer with which he have buy the flower in a boyish impulse he ring the temple bell and find he way again to the lonely corner he flower be lie there in the moonlight and again he read : here lie oliver goldsmith forgive I goldy he murmur well may man bring you flower -- for you write not as those yonder you write for the human heart chapter xxxv back to reality it be good to get back to reality with angel 's blue eye mike 's laugh and esther 's common sense let I look deep into they angel -- deep -- deep it be so good to get back to something true be they true say angel open they very wide something that will never forsake one something we can never forsake something in all the wide world 's change that will never change something that will still be angel even in a thousand year i hope to be a real angel long before that say angel laughing do you think you can promise to be true so long angel ask henry dear you know that so long as there be one little part of I leave anywhere in the world that part will be true to you -- but come tell I about london i be afraid you do not enjoy it very much oh yes i love london -- that be old london but new london make I a little sad i expect it be only because i do not quite understand the condition perhaps so say angel but tell I -- do you go to the zoo you dear child yes i go out of pure love for you now you need not be so grow up you know you want to go just for yourself as well and you see the monkey-house yes and the lion yes and the snake yes oh i would give anything to see the snake do they eat any rabbit when you be there -- fascinate they and then draw they slowly slowly in angel what terrible interest you be develop no thank goodness they do not why would not it fascinate you to see something wonderfully kill ask angel it be dreadful and wicked of course but it would be so thrillingly real i think i must introduce you to a young man i meet in london say henry who solemnly ask I if i have ever murder anyone you savage little wild thing i suppose this be what you mean by say sometimes that you be a gipsy eh well and you go to the tower and westminster abbey and everything and it be really wonderful yes i see everything -- include the queen for young people of tyre and sidon to go to london be like what it once be to make the pilgrimage to rome mike create some valuable nonsense on the occasion which unfortunately have not be preserve and esther be disgust with henry because he could give no intelligible description of the latest london hat and all examine with due reverence those wonderful book for review in tichborne street aunt tip have take advantage of he absence to enrich he room with a bargain in the shape of a old desk which be the very thing he want dear old aunt tipping and gerard it be to be fear take a little more brandy than usual in honor of he young friend 's adventure in the capital these excitement over henry sit down at he old desk to write he first review and there for the present we may leave he for he take it very seriously and be dangerous to interrupt chapter xxxvi the old home meanwhile more than a year have now go by since henry leave home and meanwhile with the exception of dot 's baptism there have be no exciting change to record perhaps uneventfulness be part of the security of a real home every morning jame mesurier have rise at half-past six -- though he no longer impose that hour of rise upon he daughter -- breakfast at eight and reach he office at nine every evening during those month punctually at half-past six he latch-key have rattle in the front-door lock and one or other of he daughter have hurry out at the sound to bid he welcome home home at last father dear they have say help he off with he coat and sometimes when he feel bright he would answer -- yes my dear night bring crow home home again jame he wife would say as he next enter the front parlor and bent down to kiss she where she sit it be a long day be not it time you be pull in a bit surely some of the younger head should begin to relieve you responsibility mary dear we can not delegate responsibility he would answer but we see nothing of you you just sacrifice you whole life for the business if he be in a good humor he might answer with one of he rare sweet laugh and jokingly make one of he few french quotation : _ telle est la vie _ my dear _ telle est la vie _ that be the french for it be not it dot jame mesurier be just perceptibly soften perhaps it be that he be grow a little tired that he be no longer quite the stern disciplinarian we meet in the first chapter perhaps the influence of he wife and he experience with he child be begin to hint to he what it take so long for a strong individual nature to learn that the law of one temperament can not justly or fruitfully be enforce as the law of another the younger child -- esther and dot and mat use sometimes to say to each other -- would grow up in a more clement atmosphere of home than have be henry 's and theirs already they be quietly assume privilege and nothing say that would have mean beating for they elder for these thing have henry and esther gladly face martyrdom henry have look on the promised land but be deny a entrance there by he stripe this younger generation would be heal the elder girl hasten to draw close to they father in gratitude and home breathe a kinder freer air than ever have be know before between esther and she father particularly a kind of comradeship begin to spring up which perhaps more than ever make the mother miss she boy but all the same home be grow old this be the kindness of the setting sun childless middle age be no doubt often dreary to contemplate yet be it a egoistical bias which lead one to find in such limitation or one might rather say preservation of the ego a certain compensation the childless man or woman have at least preserved he or she individuality as few father and mother of large family be suffer to do by the time you be fifty with a family of half a dozen child you have become comparatively impersonal as father or mother it be tacitly recognize that you life-work be finish that you ambition be accomplish or not and that you hope be at a end the young mesurier for example be all eagerly hasten towards they several future they be garrulous over they at every meal but to what future in this world be jame and mary mesurier look forward love have blossom and bring forth fruit but the fruit be quickly ripening and stranger hand would soon pluck it from the bough in a very few year they would sit under a roof-tree bare of fruit and blossom and sad with fall leaf they have dream they dream and there be only one such dream for a lifetime now they must sit and listen to the dream of they child help they to build theirs they matter now no longer for themselves but just as so much aid and sympathy on which they child might draw too well in they heart they know that they child only hear they with patience so long as they talk of they to-morrow should they sometimes dwell wistfully on they own yesterday they could too plainly see how long the story seem _ telle est la vie _ as jame mesurier say and that be so no wonder life be a sad business better perhaps be childless and retain one 's own personal hope and fear for life than be so relegate to history in the very zenith of one 's day if only this younger generation at the door be always as it assume stronger and better than its elder but though the careless assumption that it be so be somewhat general history alone show how false and impudent the assumption often be too often genius itself must submit to the silly presumption of its noisy and fatuous child and it be the young fool who too often knock imperiously at the door of wise and active middle age that all this be inevitable make it none the less sad the young mesurier be neither fool nor hard of heart and sometimes in moment of sympathy they parent would be reveal to they in sudden light of pathos and old romance they would listen to some old love-affair of they mother 's as though it have be they own or go out of they way to make they father tell once more the epic of the great business over which he preside and which as he conceive it be doubtless a greater poem than he son would ever write yet still even in such genuine sympathy there be a certain imaginative effort to be make the gulf between the generation however hide for the moment be always there yet after all jame and mary mesurier possess a incorruptible treasure which they child have neither give nor could take away to regard they as without future would be a shallow observation -- for love have always a future however old in mortal year it may have grow and as they grow older they love seem to grow stronger involuntarily they seem to draw closer together as by a instinct of self-preservation they love have be before they child be they to be spare it would still be the same love sweeter by trial when they child have pass from they in this love have be wise for they some parent love they child so unwisely that they forget to love each other and when the child forsake they be leave disconsolate one have hear young mother say that now they boy have come they husband may take a second place and often of late we have hear the woman say : give I but the child and the lover can go he way foolish unprophetic woman let but twenty year go by and how glad you will be of that reject lover for though a son may suffice for he mother what mother have ever suffice for she son but though sometimes as they look at they parent the young mesurier catch a glimpse of the infinite sadness of a life-work accomplish yet it fail to warn they against the eager haste with which they be hurry on towards a like conclusion too late they would understand that all the joy be in the do too soon say to themselves : be it for this that we little world shake with such fiery commotion and molten ardor that this present should be so firm and insensitive beneath we foot this habit -- why it be once a passion this fact -- why it be once a dream oh why shake off youth 's fragile blossom with the very speed of you own impatience why make such haste towards autumn who ever think the ruddiest lapful of apple a fair exchange for a cloud of sunlit blossom whose maturity however laden with prosperity or gilded with honor ever keep the fairy promise of he youth for so brief a space youth glitter like a dewdrop on the tree of life glitter and be go for one desperate instant of perfection it hang poise and be see no more but alas the art of enjoy youth with a wise economy be only learn when youth be over it be perhaps too paradoxical a accomplishment to be learn before for a youth that economise itself would be already middle age it be just the wasteful flare of it that leave such a dazzle in old eye as they look back in fancy to the conflagration of fragrant fire which once bourgeon and sing where these white ash now slowly smoulder towards extinction when mike have a theater of he own and can send box to he friend when henry maybe be a editor of power when esther and angel be the enthroned wife of famous man and the new heaven and the new earth be quite finish -- will they never sigh sometimes to have the making of they all over again then they will have everything to enjoy so there will be nothing leave to hope for then there will be no spice of peril in they love no keen edge that come of enforced denial and the game of life will be too sure for ambition to keep its savor there be no thrill no excitement nowadays one can almost fancy they say and like child play with they brick now let we knock it all down and build another one it will be such fun however these be intrusive autumnal thought in this book of simple youth and we young people know they not they be far indeed from esther 's mind as she talk with dot of the future one afternoon instead she word be full of impatience with the slow march of event and the enforced inactivity of a girl 's life at home it be so much easier for the boy she be say there be something for they to do but we can do nothing but sit at home and wait darn they sock and clap we hand at they success i wish i be a man no you do not say dot for then you could not marry mike and you could not wear pretty dress -- oh and lot of thing i do not much envy a man 's life after all it be all very well talk about hard work when you have not get to do it and it be not so much the work as the responsibility it must be such a responsibility to be a man of course you be right dot -- but oh this wait be so stupid all the same if only i could be do something -- anything well you _ be _ do something be it nothing to be all the world to a man say dot wistfully nothing to be he heaven upon earth nothing to be the prize he be work for and nothing to sustain and cheer he on as you do mike and as angel cheer henry would henry have be the same without angel or mike the same without you no the man 's work make more noise but the woman 's work be none the less real and useful because it be quiet and underground dear dot what a wise old thing you be grow but you know you be longing all the time for some work to do yourself do not you say the other day that you seem to be waste you life here make bed and do housework yes but i be different do not you see retorted dot sadly i have get no mike you work be to help mike be a great actor but i have get no one to help be anything you may be sure i would not complain of be idle if i have i think you be a bit forgetful sometimes how happy you be poor old dot you need not talk as if you be such a desperate old maid -- you be not twenty yet and i be sure it be a good thing for you that you have not get any of the young man about here -- to help be alderman wait till you come and stay with we in london then you 'll soon find some one to work for as you call it i do not know say dot thoughtfully somehow i think i shall never marry i suppose you mean you would rather be a nun or something serious of that sort well to tell the truth i have be think lately if perhaps i could not do something -- perhaps go into a hospital or something of that sort oh nonsense dot think of all the horrible dirty people you would have to attend to ugh christ do not think of that when he wash the foot of he disciple say little dot sententiously why dot how dreadfully religious you be get you want a good shake besides be not it a little impious to imply that the apostle be horrible dirty people you know what i mean say dot flushing yes of course dear and i think i know where you have be you have be to see that dear sister agatha you admit she be a dear of course i do but i do not know whether she be quite good for you if you would only see she among the poor little child the other day how beautiful and how happy she look you might have think differently say dot oh yes dear but then you must not forget that she point of view be different she be renounce the world she be one of those woman esther could not resist add maliciously who have give up hope of man and so have set all they hope on god esther that be unworthy of you -- though what if it be as you say be it so great a failure after all to dedicate one 's self to god rather than to one little individual man oh come say esther rather wilfully misunderstand and suddenly flush up mike be not so little as all that why you goose how earthly you be i never think of dear mike -- though it would have serve you right for say such a mean thing about sister agatha forgive I i know it be mean but i could not resist it and it be true you 'll admit of some of those pious woman though i withdraw it about sister agatha of course i could not be a sister like sister agatha say dot without be a catholic as well but i might be a nurse at one of the ordinary hospital it would be dreadfully hard work say esther harder than be a man do you think ask dot laughing for goodness ' sake do not turn catholic say esther in some alarm _ that _ would break father 's heart if you like a horror of catholicism run in the very marrow of these young people it be one of the few relic of they father 's puritanism survive in they of catholic they have be accustom to speak since childhood as of nightmare and red indian with bloody scalp at they waist and perhaps that instinctive terror of the subtle heart of rome be the religious prejudice which we will do well to part with last dot have not indeed contemplate a apostacy so unnatural but beneath these comparatively trivial word there be a ever-growing impulse to fulfil that old longing of she nature to do something as the christian would say for god something serious in return for the solemn and beautiful gift of life by a accident she have meet sister agatha one day in the house of a old irish servant of theirs who have be compel to leave they on account of ill-health and on whom she have call with a little present of fruit she have be strike by the sweetness of the sister 's face as the sister have be strike by hers sister agatha have invite dot to visit she some day at the home for orphan child of which she have charge and with some misgiving as to whether it be right thus to visit a catholic whether even it be safe dot have accept so a acquaintance have grow up and ripen into a friendship and sister agatha while make no attempt to turn the friendship to the account of she church be a great consolation to the lonely religious girl dot retain too much rationalism ever to become a catholic but the longing to do something grow and grow at a certain moment with each new generation of girl there come a epidemical desire in maiden bosom to dedicate they sweet young life to the service of what esther call horrible dirty people at these period the hospital be flood with application from young girl whom the vernal equinox urge first to be mother and fail motherhood nurse just before she meet henry angel have do she best to miss he by frantic endeavor to nurse people whom the hospital doctor decide she be far too slight a thing to lift -- for unless you can lift you patient not to say throw they about you fail in the muscular qualification of a hospital nurse dot as we have see be impel in this direction from no merely sentimental impulse unless the religious impulse which paradoxically make nun of disappointed mother may so be call perhaps unacknowledged deep down in she heart she long to be the nurse -- of one little wonderful child have this be grant she it be probable that the maim and the halt would have have less attraction for she pitying imagination as it be however she persuade herself that she love they be it because at the moment no one else seem to need she love chapter xxxvii stage wait mr laflin esther 's impatience be to be appease perhaps a little to she regret after all by a unexpected remission of the time appoint between mike and he first real engagement suddenly one day come a exciting letter from the great actor say that he see he way to give he a part in he own london company if he could join he for rehearsal in a week 's time here be news at last a foundation-stone of the new heaven be to be lay in a week 's time mike would be work at one of the alabaster wall perhaps in two year ' time perhaps even in a year with good fortune the roof would be on the door wreathe with garland and a modest little heaven ready for occupation now all that remain be to make the momentous break with the old life old mr laflin have be leave in peaceful ignorance of the mine which must now be explode beneath he evening armchair mike love he father and this have be a dread long and wisely postpone but now when the moment for inevitable decision have come mike remember with a certain shrink that responsibility of which dot have speak -- the responsibility of be a man it be he dream to be a actor to earn he bread with joy to earn it with less than joy seem unworthy of man yet there be another dream for he still more immeasurably more important -- to be esther 's husband if he stay where he be in slow revolution of a dull business he father 's place and income would become he if he renounce that certain prospect he commit himself to a destiny of brilliant chance and for the first time he realize that among those chance lurk too the chance of failure esther must decide and henry 's counsel too must be take mike thought he know what the decision and the counsel would be and of course he be not mistaken why mike how can you hesitate say esther fail if you like and i shall still love you but you do not surely think i could go on love a man who be frighten to try that be a little hard of esther for mike 's fear have be for she sake not he own however that and the even more vehement counsel of henry have the desire brace effect and mike nerve himself to deal the necessary blow at he father 's tranquillity as the writer of this book take no special joy in heart-breaking scene with father the painful and somewhat violent scene with mr laflin be here omit and leave to the imagination of any reader with a taste for such unnatural collision any one over thirty will agree that all the reason be on mr laflin 's side as all the instinct be on he son 's luckily for mike the instinct be to prove genuine and he father to live to be prouder of he rebellion than ever he would have be of he obedience this scene over it be only a matter of day -- five alone be leave -- before mike must up and away in right good earnest oh mike say esther you be sure you 'll go on loving I i be awfully frighten of those pretty girl in -- 's company you need not be say mike there be only one girl in the world will look at a funny bit of a thing like I oh i do not know say esther laugh some big girl have such strange taste well let 's hope that before many month you can come and look after I if we would only a certain five pound a week we could get along -- anything to be together of course we would have to be economical -- say esther thoughtfully on the last night but one before he leave it be mike 's turn for a farewell dinner half-a-dozen of he best friend assemble at the golden bee and toast and tear be mingle to do he honor henry happily catch the general feeling of the occasion in the follow verse not hitherto print henry be too much in earnest at the time to regard the bathos of rhyming stage wait with such dignity as summon fate except for which _ naïveté _ the poem be perhaps not a bad example of sincere occasional verse : _ dear mike at last the wishéd hour draw nigh -- weary indeed the watching of a sky for golden portent tarry afar but here to-night we hail you rise star to-night we hear the cry of summon fate -- stage wait stage wait and we who love we brother so would keep he not but only ere he go lead by the star along the untried way we would hold he hand in ours a little space with grip of love that girdeth up the heart and kiss of eye that giveth strength to part some of you lover may be half afraid to bid you forth for fear of pitfall lay about you foot but we have no such fear that cry be as a trumpet in we ear we dare not would not mock those summon fate -- stage wait stage wait and shall you fear and make delay yes when the mariner who long time lay wait the breeze shall anchor when it blow yes when a thirsty summer-flower shall close against the rain or when in reap day the husbandman shall set he field ablaze nay take you breeze drink in you strengthening rain and while you can make harvest of you grain the land be fair to which that breeze shall blow the flower be sweet the rain shall set aglow the grain be rich within you garner gate -- stage wait stage wait and we must loosen now you hand and miss you face 's gold in all we land but yet we know that in a little while you come again a conqueror so smile godspeed not parting and with heart elate we wait _ yes for the second time the die be cast henry be already afoot on the adventure perilous now it be mike 's turn these young people have passionately invoke those terrible god who fulfil we dream and already the celestial machinery be begin to move in answer perhaps it just a little take they breath to see the great wheel so readily turn at the touch of they young hand but they be in for it now and with stout heart must abide the issue this be to be esther and mike 's first experience of parting and they heart sicken at the thought love surely do well in this world so full of snare and danger to fear to lose from its eye for a moment the face of its beloved and in this respect the courage of love be the more remarkable how bravely it take the appalling risk of life to separate for a hour may mean that never as long as the world last will love hear the voice it love again good-bye love have call gaily so often and wave hand from the threshold and the beloved have call good-bye and wave and smile back -- for the last time and yet love face the fear not only of hour but of week and month week and month on sea bottomless with danger in land rife with unknown evil dizzily take the chance of desperate occupation and the courage be the greater because finally in this world love alone have anything to lose other loss may be more or less repair but love 's loss be of its essence irreparable other fair face and brave heart the world may bring we but never that one face alas for the most precious of earthly thing the only precious thing of earth there be no system of insurance the many water have quench love and the flood drown it -- yet in the wide world be there no help no hope no recompense the love that bind this little circle of young people together be so strong and warm that it have develop in they a almost painful sensibility to such risk of loss so it be that expression of affection and outward endearment be more current among they than be usual in a land where manners from a proper fear of exaggeration run to a silly extreme of unresponsiveness they never meet without show they joy to be again together never part without that inner fear that this might be they last chance of show they love for each other you all say good-bye as if you be go to america myrtillum williamson have once say i suppose it be you irish grandmother and no doubt the _ empressement _ have its odd side for those who see only the surface thus for those who love love who love to watch for it on human face mike 's good-bye at the railway station be a sight worth go far to see my word they seem to be fond of each other these young people say a lady standing at the door of the next carriage mike be lean through the window and esther be press near to he they murmur low to each other and they eye be bright with tear a little apart stand a small group in which henry and angel and ned be conspicuous and mike 's sister and dot and mat be there a callous observer might have laugh so sad and solemn they be mike 's fun try a rally but he jest fall spiritless it be not so much a parting one might have think as a funeral little be say but eye be eloquent either with tear or with long strong glance that mean undying faithfulness all round and mike know that henry 's eye be quote _ allon _ after the great companion and to belong to they henry 's will to achieve be too strong for he to think of this as a parting he could only think of it as a glorious beginning there be something impersonal in ambition and in the absorption of the work to be do the ambitious man forget he merely individual sensibility to achieve though the heaven fall -- that be henry 's ambition for mike and for himself no one really believe that the train would have the hard-heartedness to start but at last with deliberate intention evidently not to be sway by human pity the guard set the estrange whistle to he lip cold and inexorable as nero turn down the thumb of death and surely mike 's sad little face begin to move away from they hand reach out to he eye stream handkerchief flutter -- but nothing could hold he back and when at last a curve in the line have swallow the white speck of he face they turn away from the dark gulf where the train have be as though it be a newly open grave a great to-do to make about a mere parting -- say someone no doubt my dear sir all depend upon one 's standard of value no doubt these young people weigh life in fantastic scale they standard of value be no doubt uncommon to love each other be better than ruby to lose each other be bitter as death for other other value -- they have find they only reality in the human affection chapter xxxviii esther and henry once more yes mike have really go henceforth for ever so long he would only exist for esther in letter or as a sad little voice at the end of a wire it have be arrange that henry should take esther with he for dinner that evening to the brightest restaurant in tyre he be a great believer in be together and also in dinner as comforter of you sad heart perhaps too he be a little glad to feel esther lean gently upon he once more they love be too sure and lasting and ever-present to have many opportunity of be dramatic nature do not make a fuss about gravitation one of the most wonderful and powerful of law it be yet of all law the most retire gravitation never deck itself in rainbow nor do it vaunt its undoubted strength in thunder it be content to make little show because it be very strong yet you have always to reckon with it it be undemonstrative but it be always there the love of esther and henry be like that it have make little show in this history but few reader can have miss its presence in the atmosphere it might go for week without its festival but there it be all the time ready for any service staunch for any trial it be one of the law which keep the little world i have be describe slung safely in space and securely shine it be indeed something like a perfect relationship -- this love of esther and henry have the law of nature permit it it be probable that mike and angel would have be force to seek they mate elsewhere as it be though it be thus less than marriage it be more than friendship -- as the holy intercourse of a mother and a son be more than friendship free from the perturbation of sex it yet gain warmth and exhilaration from the unconscious presence of that stimulate difference though they be brother and sister friend and friend henry and esther be also man and woman so satisfying be they to each other that when they sit thus together the truth must be tell that for the time at all event they miss no other man or woman i have always you say esther do i still matter then say henry be you sure the old love be not grow old you know it can never grow old there be only one mike but there be only one henry too it be a good love to have harry be not it it make one feel so much safer in the world dear little esther do you remember those old beating and that night you bring I the cake bless you -- and henry reach he hand across the table and lay it so kindly on esther 's that a hover waiter retreat out of delicacy mistake the pair for lover it be a mistake that be often make when they be together and they have sometimes laugh when travel at the kind-hearted way passenger on the point of enter they carriage have suddenly make up they mind not to disturb the poor newly-married young thing and how we use to hate you once say esther one can hardly understand it now do you remember how on Sunday afternoon you would insist on play at church and how with a tablecloth for a surplice you use to be the minister how you use to storm if we poor thing miss any of the response the monstrous egoism of it all say henry laugh it be all get up to give I a stage and nothing else i do not care whether you enjoy it or not what dragon child be ` dragon of the prime that tare each other in they slime ' quote esther yes we tear each other and no mistake -- well i have make up for it since have not i say henry i hope i be a humble enough brother of the beautiful to please you nowadays you be the truest most reliable thing in the world say esther i always think of you as something strong and true to come to -- except mike no not even except mike we 'll call it a draw -- dear little mike to think of he go further and further away every minute i wonder where he be by now he must have reach rugby long since at that moment the waiter venture to approach with a silver tray a telegram -- it be indeed a telegram of tear and distance from mike give in at rugby even so long part and so far away mike be still true he have not yet forget these young people be great extravagant of the emotional telegram they be probably among the earliest to apply electricity for heart-breaking message some lover feel it a profanation thus to reveal they soul beneath the eye of a telegraph-operator but the objection of delicacy cease if you can regard the operator in he actual capacity as a part of the machine french perhaps be a advisable medium though if the operator misunderstand it you love be apt to take strange form at its destination and if he understand it you may as well use english at once dear mike god bless he and they pledge mike in esther 's favorite champagne the wife of great actor-manager must early inure themselves to champagne but if you be jealous of mike say esther presently take up the drop thread of they talk what about angel of course it be only nonsense say henry i know you love angel far too much to be jealous of she as i love mike and that be just the beautiful harmony of it all we be just a little impregnable world of four -- four loving heart against the world how clever it be of you to find angel i find mike too say henry laughing oh yes i know but then i discover you ah but a still higher honor belong to I for i discover you retort henry when you consider that i discover three such wonderful person as you and angel and mike do not you think on the whole that i be singularly modest do you love I say esther presently quite irrelevantly do you love _ I _ i ask first well for the sake of argument let we say ` yes ' how much as big as the world oh well then let 's have some benedictine with the coffee say esther i have think of something better more ` sacramental ' say henry smile but you could not conscientiously drink it with I it be the red drink of perfect love will you drink it with I of course i will so the waiter bring a bottle bear the beautiful word _ parfait amour _ it be like blood say esther it make I a little frightened would you rather not drink it ask henry you know if you drink it with I you must drink it with no one else it be the law of it that we can only drink it with one not even with mike not even with mike what of angel i will drink it with no one but you as long as i live i will drink it then they hold up they glass dear old esther dear old henry and then they laugh at they solemnity it be deeply swear when esther reach home that evening she find a further telegram from mike announce he arrival at euston and she have scarcely read it when she hear she father 's voice call she she go immediately to the dining-room esther dear he say you mother and i want a word with you no jame you must speak for yourself in this say mr mesurier evidently a little perturb well dear if i must be alone in the matter i must bear it i can not shrink from my duty on that account then turn to esther i call you in to speak to you about mike laflin -- yes father exclaim esther with a little gasp of surprise i meet mr laflin on the boat this morning and be much astonished and grieve to hear of the rash step he son have choose to take the matter have evidently be keep from I -- strictly speak it have i understand though on that again i have not be consult that you and mike have for some time be informally engage to each other now you know my view on the theater and i be sure that you must see that mike 's have take such a step must at once put a end to any such idea you own sense of propriety would i be sure tell you that without any word from I -- father cry esther in astonishment you know that i consider mike a very nice lad he family be respectable and he would have come into a very comfortable business if he have not take this foolish freak into he head -- but father you have laugh at he recitation yourself many a time here of a evening what difference can there be there be the difference of the theater the contaminate atmosphere the people it attract the harm it do -- you father as you know have never be within a theater in he life be it likely that he can look with calmness upon he daughter marry a man whose livelihood be to be gain in a scandalous and debase profession father i can not listen to you talking of mike like that if it be wrong to make people innocently happy to make they laugh and forget they trouble to -- to -- well if it be wrong to be mike -- i be sorry but wrong or right i love he and nothing will ever make I give he up mr mesurier here interrupted i tell you jame how it would be you can not change young heart the time be not the same as when you and i be young and though i be sure i do not want to go against you i think you be too hard on esther love be love after all -- and mike 's one of the best-hearted lad that ever walk thank you mother say esther impulsively throw she arm round she mother 's neck and burst into tear i -- i will never give -- give -- he up no dear no now do not distress yourself it will all come right you father do not quite understand and then a great tempest of sob come over esther and sweep she away to she own room the father and mother turn to each other with some anger jame i be surprised at you distressing the poor child like that to-night you might have know she would be sensitive with mike only go to-day you could surely have wait till to-morrow i be surprised mary that you can encourage she as you do you can not surely uphold the theater well jame i do not know -- there be theater and theater and actor and actor and there have be some very good man actor after all and some very bad man minister if it come to that she add and theater or no theater love 's love in spite of all the father and mother in the world -- all right mary i would prefer then that we speak no more on the matter for this evening and jame mesurier turn to he diary to record along with the state of the weather and the engagement of the day the undutiful conduct of esther and a painful difference with he wife strange that man who have themselves love and beget should thus for a moment imagine that a small social prejudice or a narrow religious formulum can break the purpose of a young and vigorous passion do they realize what it be they be propose to obstruct this be love -- _ love _ my dear sir at once the mightiest might and the rightest right in the universe this be -- niagara -- the atlantic -- the power of the star -- and the strength of the tide it be all the wind of the world and all the fire of the center you surely can not be serious in ask it to take in exchange some obsolete objection against its beloved chapter xxxix mike afar this collision with she father brace up esther 's nerve and make mike 's absence easier to bear she father make no more allusion to it he be enter that period when father however despotic content themselves with protest where once they have govern by royal proclamation he be lose heart to contend with he child they must go they own way -- though it must not be without occasional severe and solemn warning on he part mike and esther write to each other twice a week they have talk of every day but a wise instinct prompt they to the less romantic but likely the more enduring arrangement it would be none the less open to they to write fourteen letter a week if they wish but to have have to admit that one letter a day be a serious tax not only on one 's other occupation include idleness but also on the amount of subject-matter available would have be a dangerous correction of a impulsive miscalculation second-rate london lodgings be not great cheerer of the human spirit and mike be very lonely in he first letter or two but as the rehearsal proceed it be evident that he be take hold of he new world and the letter which tell of he first night and of he own encouraging success in it be buoyant with the rise tide of the future he chief have affectionately lay he hand on he shoulder as he come off from he scene and in the hearing of the whole company prophesy a great future for he mike have be bear under a lucky star and he have hardly be in london two month when accident very perceptibly brighten it the chief comedian in the company fall ill and though mike have have so little experience he chief have so much confidence in he native gift that he cast he for the vacant part mike more than justified the confidence and not only pleased he but succeed in individualise himself with the audience he have only play it for a week when one Saturday evening the audience after call the manager himself three time set up a cry for laflin the obsequious attendant pretend to consider it as a fourth call for the manager and make as if to move the curtain aside for he once more but with a magnanimity rare indeed in a star of he magnitude no no he say it be mr laflin they want quick lad and take you first call so little mike step before the curtain and make he first bow to a affectionate burst of applause what happy tear would have glitter in esther 's eye have she be there to see it and in henry 's too and particularly perhaps in excitable angel 's even so soon be the blossom give promise of the fruit chapter xl a legacy more precious than gold meanwhile henry plod away at aunt tipping 's work sometimes on a volume of essay for the london publisher and sometimes on he novel now and again write a review and earn a odd guinea for a poem and now and again indulge in a day of richly do nothing otherwise one day be like another with the many exception of the day on which he see angel or esther with ned he spend many of he evening and he soon form the pleasant habit of drop in on gerard last thing before bed-time for a smoke and half a hour 's chat there be always a good deal of youth leave in any one who genuinely love youth and gerard always speak of he youth as adam in he decline year might have speak of paradise for he life be just youth -- and the rest of it death after thirty he would say the happiest life be only history repeat itself i be no cynic -- far from it but the worst of life be the monotony of the bill of fare to do a thing once even twice be delightful -- perhaps even a third time be successfully possible but to do it four time be middle age if you think of it what be there to do after thirty that one ought not to have achieve to perfection before you know the literary dictum that the poet who have not write a masterpiece before he be thirty will never write any after of course there be exception i be speaking of the rule in business for example what future be there for the man who have not already a dash past at thirty of course the bulk the massive trunk and the impressive foliage of he business must come afterwards but the tree must have be firmly root and stoutly branch before then and able to go on grow on its own account the work in fact must have be do take perhaps the only thing really worth do in life and gerard perceptibly sadden that be marry a woman you love or i should say _ the _ woman for you only really _ love _ one woman -- i be old-fashioned enough to think that -- well i say marry the woman you love and bring into the world that miracle of miracle -- a child that shall be something of you and all she : that certainly be something to have do before thirty and not to be repeat perhaps more than once before or after she will want a boy like you and you will have a girl like she that you may easily accomplish before thirty afterwards however if you go on repeat each other what do you do but blur the individuality of the original masterpiece -- though pursued gerard laugh always ready to forget he original argument in the seductiveness of a unexpected development of it though after all i admit there might be a temptation sometimes to improve upon the original ` agne my dear ' we might say ` i be not quite satisfied yet with the shade of eva 's hair it be nearly yours but not quite it be a improvement on anna 's whose eye now be exactly yours eva 's unfortunately be not so faithful i be afraid we 'll have to try again ' no but seriously he once more begin for a really vital and successful life there be no adequate employment of the faculty after thirty except of course in the repetition of former success no i even withdraw that -- not the repetition only the conservation the feeding of former success the success be in the creation when a world be once create any fool can keep it spinning man 's life be at least thirty year too long two score year be more than enough for we to say what we be send here to say and if you 'll consider those biography in which you be most interested the biography of great writer you can not but bear I out what for instance do keat and shelley and burn and byron lose by die all of they long before they be forty -- keat even long before he be thirty and what do wordsworth and coleridge gain by live so long after wordsworth and coleridge do not even live to repeat themselves else of course one would have beg they to go on live for ever for some repetition it be admit be welcome -- for instance will not you have a little more whisky henry always agree so completely with gerard 's talk or at least so delighted in it that he have little scope of opportunity to say much himself and gerard be too keen a talker to complain of a rapt young listener how old be you he say presently twenty-two next month twenty-two how wonderful to be twenty-two yet i do not suppose you have realize it in the least in you own view you be a aged philosopher white with a past and bow down with the care of a future just you stay in bed all day to-morrow and ponder on the wonderfulness of be twenty-two i be forty-two you be begin -- i be do with and yet in some way i believe i be younger than you -- though perhaps alas what i consider the youth in I be only the wish to be young again the will to do and enjoy without the force and the appetite but by the way when i say i be forty-two i mean that i be forty-two in the course of next week next Thursday in fact and if you 'll do I that kindness i should be grateful if you would join I that evening in celebrate the melancholy occasion i have get a great mind to enlist you sympathy in a little ancient history if it will not be too great a tax upon you goodness but i 'll think it over between now and then gerard 's birthday have come and the ancient history he have speak of have prove to be a chapter of he own history the beauty and sadness of which have make a impression upon henry to be render ineffaceable a very few day after in a sudden and terrible manner one early morning about four just as it be grow light he have suddenly awaken with a strong feeling that some one be bend over he he open he eye to see as he think gerard hastily leave he bedside gerard he cry what be the matter but the figure give no answer fade away down the long room and disappear henry sit up in bed and strike a light he heart beat violently but there be no one there and the door be close it have evidently be one of those dream that persist on the eye for a moment after wake yet it leave he uneasy and presently he wonder if gerard could be ill he determine to see so slip on he dressing-gown he cross the landing to gerard 's room and softly knock open the door and put in he head gerard old chap be you all right -- gerard -- there be no answer and the room seem unaccountably still he listen for the sound of breathing but he could not hear it gerard he cry again louder but there be still no answer and then with the silence a chill terror begin to creep through he blood he have never yet see death and perhaps if he have the terror in he thought would not have be lessen with a heart that have almost stop beat and knee that shake beneath he he push open the door and walk over to the bed it be still too dark to see more than outline and mass of white and black but even so he could see that the stillness with which gerard be lie be the stillness of death he next thought be to rouse aunt tipping and together the two bent over the dead face yes he be go say aunt tip poor gentleman how beautiful he look and they both gaze in silence upon the calm smile face well he be better off she say presently lean over he and softly press down the lid of he eye henry involuntarily draw away dear lad there be nothing to be frighten of say he aunt he be as harmless as a baby then she take a handkerchief from a drawer and spread it gently over the dead man 's face to aunt tip the dead be indeed as little child and inspire she with a strange motherly tenderness many have be the tired silent one whose eye she have close and whose limb she have wash against they last rest place they be so helpless now they could do nothing any more for themselves later in the day henry come again and sit long by the dead man 's side it seem uncompanionable to have grow thus suddenly afraid of he to leave he thus alone in that still room and as he sit and watch he he give to he memory a solemn service of faithful think thus it be he go over again the word in which gerard have make he the depository the legatee of he most sacred possession gerard have evidently have some presentiment of he approach end i be go he have say to place the greatest confidence in you one man can place in another pay you the greatest compliment i shall die some day and something tell I that that divine event be not very far off now i have no one in the world who care a old ` j' pen for I and a new one be perhaps about as much as i care for any one -- with one exception and that be a woman whom i shall never see again she be not dead but have be worse than dead for I these ten year i be optimist enough to believe that she old love for I still survive make sweet the secret place of she soul never once in all these year to have doubt she love have be more than most marriage but be i to live for another ten year and still another i would believe in it still but the star be against we we meet too late we meet when she have long be engage to a friend of she youth a man noble and true to whom she owe much and whom she feel it a kind of murder to desert it be one of those fallacious chivalry of feeling which be the danger of sensitive and imaginative mind religion strengthen it as it be so apt to strengthen any form of self-destruction short of technical suicide there be but a month to they marriage when we meet for we it be a month of rapture and agony of heaven shot through with hell i see further than she i begged she at least to wait a year but the force of my appeal be weaken by scruple similar to she own to rob another of he happiness be a act from which we may well shrink though we can clearly see that the happiness be really destine for we and can never be he in any like degree during this time i have receive from she many letter letter such as a woman only write in the may-morning of she passion and one day i receive the last there be in it one sentence which when i read it i think my heart break ` do you believe ' it run ` in a love that can lie asleep as in a trance in this world to awaken again in another a love that during century of silence can still be true and be love still in a thousand year if you do go on loving I for that be the only love i dare give you i must love you no more in this world ' each morning as i have rise and each night as i have turn to sleep those word have repeat themselves again and again in my heart for ten year it be so i become the ashton gerard you know to-day since that day we have never meet or write to each other all i know be that she be still alive and still with he and never would i disturb they peace when i die i would not have she know it if love _ be _ immortal we shall meet again -- when i be worthier to meet she such reunion be either mere dream or they be reality to which the strongest force of the universe be pledge henry 's only comment have be to grip gerard 's hand and give he the sympathy of silence now say gerard once more after a while it be about those letter i want to speak to you they be here and he unlock a drawer and draw from it a little silver box i always keep they here the key of the drawer be on this ring and this little gold key be the key of the box itself i tell you this because i have what you may regard as a strange request to make i suppose most man would consider it they duty either to burn these letter or leave instruction for they to be bury with they that be a gruesome form of sentiment in which i have too much imagination to indulge both my idea of duty and sentiment take a different form the surname of the writer of these letter be nowhere reveal in they nor be there any reference in they by which she could ever be identify therefore the menace to she fair fame in they preservation be not a question involve now when the simplest woman be in love she write wonderfully but when a woman of imagination and intellect be catch by the fire of passion she become a poet once in she life every such woman be a artist once for some one man 's unworthy sake she become inspired and out of the fulness of she heart write he letter warm and real as the love-cry of sappho such be the letter in this little box they be the classic of a month 's passion write as no man have ever yet be able to write he love do you think it strange then that i should shrink from destroy they i would as soon burn the song of shelley they be live thing shall i selfishly bury the beating heart of they in the silence of the grave so mesurier he continue affectionately when i meet you and understand something of you nature i think that in you i have find one who be worthy to guard this treasure for I and perhaps pass it on again to some other choose spirit -- so that these beautiful word of a noble woman 's heart shall not die -- for when a man love a woman mesurier as you yourself must know he be insatiable to hear she praise and it be agony for he to think that she memory may suffer extinction therefore mesurier -- henry let I call you -- i want to give the memory of my love into you hand i want you to love it for I when perhaps i can love it no more i want you sometimes to open this box and read in these letter as if they be you own i want you sometimes to speak softly the name of ` helen ' when my lip can speak it no more such be the beautiful legacy of which henry find himself the possessor by gerard 's death early on that day he have remember he promise to he dead friend and have find the silver box and lock it away among he own most sacred thing some day in a hour and place upon which none might break he would open the little box and read helen 's letter as gerard have wish already one sentence be fix unforgettably upon he mind and he say it over softly to himself as he sit by gerard 's silent bed : do you believe in a love that can lie asleep as in a trance in this world to awaken again in another -- a love that during century of silence can still be true and be love still in a thousand year if you do go on loving I for that be the only love i dare give you i must love you no more in this world strange dream of the indomitable dust already another man 's love be grow dear to he already he soul say the name of helen softly for gerard 's sake chapter xli laborious day with gerard 's death henry begin to find aunt tipping 's too sad a place to go on living in it have become haunt and when new people move into gerard 's room it become still more painful for he it be as though gerard have be dispossessed and drive out so he cast about for some new shelter and one day chance have take he to the shipping end of the city he come upon some old office which seem full of anxiety to be let inquire of a chatty little housekeeper 's wife he discover away at the echo top of the build a big well-lighted room for which she think the owner would be glad to take ten pound a year that whole storey be desert henry make up he mind at once and break the news to aunt tipping that evening it be the withering of one of she few ray of poetry and she struggle to keep he but when she see how it be the good woman insist that he should take something from she towards furnish receive be nothing like so bless as give for aunt tip that old desk -- yes she have buy it for he -- that he must certainly take and think of he old aunt sometimes as he write he great book on it and some bed-linen she could well afford she would take no denial angel and esther be then call in to help he in the purchase of a carpet a folding-bed a old sofa and a few chair a carpenter get to work on the bookshelf and in a fortnight 's time still another habitation have be build for the muse -- a habitation from which she be not destine to remove again till she and angel and henry all move into one house together -- a removal which be as yet too far off to be include in this history ten pound a year a folding-bed and a teapot -- this be henry 's new formulum for the cultivation of literature he have so far progress in he ambition as to have arrive at the dignity of a garret of he own and he like to pretend that soon he might be romantically fortunate enough to sit face to face with starvation he know however that it would be a starvation mitigate by supplies from three separate well-lardered home a lad with a sweetheart and a sister a mother and a aunt all in love with he be not likely to become a authority on starvation in its severest form a stern law have be pass that henry 's daytime hour be to be as strictly respect as those of a man of business yet quite often about eleven o'clock in the morning there would come a heavenly whisper along the passage and a little knock on the door soft as a flower tap against a window-pane thank goodness that be angel angel bless you how glad i be to see you i can not get on a bit with my work this morning oh but i have not come to interrupt you dear i sha 'n' t keep you five minute only i think dear you would be so tired of press beef and tinned tongue and so i think i would make a little hot-pot for you i buy the thing for it as i come along and it will

housewife you would be if you would only stay do stay angel really darling it will be all the same if you go i know i shall do nothing look at my morning 's work and he bring she a sheet of paper contain two line and a half of new-born prose one line and a half of which be plentifully scratch out to this argument he add two or three persuasive embrace it be really true henry well of course i ought not but if you can not work of course you can not and you must have a little rest sometimes i know well then i 'll stay but only till we have finish lunch you know and we must have it early i will not stay a minute past two o'clock do you hear and now i 'll run along with this to mr glass when angel have go promptly at three as likely as not another step would be hear come down the passage and a feminine rustle suggest a fuller foliage of skirt pause outside the door then a sort of brotherly-sisterly knock esther why you have just miss angel what a pity well dear i only run up for half-a-minute i be shopping in town and i could not resist look in to see how the poor boy be get on no dear i will not take my thing off i must catch the half-past three boat and then i 'll keep you from you work esther always say this with a sort of suggestion in she voice that it be just possible henry might have find some new way of both keep she there and do he work at the same time as though she have say i know you can not possibly work while i be here but of course if you can and talk to I all the time will not interfere with it -- well i 'll stay oh no you will not really to tell the truth i have do none to-day i can not get into the mood so you have be get angel to help you oh well of course if angel can be allow to interrupt you i suppose i can too well then i 'll stay a quarter of a hour but you may as well take you thing off and i 'll make a cup of tea eh that 'll be cosey will not it and then you can read I mike 's last letter eh oh he be do splendidly dear i have a lovely letter from he this morning would you really care to hear a bit of it and esther would proceed to read pick she way among the endearment and the diminutive i _ be _ glad dear why if he go on at this rate you 'll be able to get marry in no time yes be not it splendid dear i be so happy what i would give to see he little face for five minute would not you rather perhaps he 'll be able to run up on bank holiday i be afraid not dear he speak of it in he letter and just hope for it but rather fear they 'll have to play at brighton or some other stupid seaside place that be a bother yes dear old mike to think of he work away there all by himself -- god bless he do you know he be never see this old room it strike I yesterday it do not seem quite warm till he be see it would not it be lovely to have he here some night -- one of we old long evening well i suppose it will really come one of these day and then we shall be have you married and go off to london in cloud of glory while poor old henry grub away down here in tyre well if we do go first you will not be long after we dear and if only mike could make a really great hit why in five year ' time we might all be quite rich will not it be wonderful then the kettle boil and henry make the tea and when it have long since be drunk esther begin to think it must be five o'clock and horrify to find it a quarter to six confess to be ashamed of herself and try to console she conscience by the haste of she good-bye i be afraid i have waste you afternoon she say but we do not often get a chat nowadays do we good-bye dear go on loving I will not you after that henry would give the day up as a bad job and begin to wonder if ned would be drop in that evening for a smoke and as that be ned 's almost nightly custom about eight o'clock the chance of henry 's disappointment be not serious chapter xlii a heavier footfall one morning as henry be really do a little work a more ponderous step break the silence of he landing a heavy footfall full of friendship certainly that be not angel nor even the more weighty esther though when the knock come it be little and shy as a woman 's henry throw open the door but for a moment there be no one to be see and then recall the idiosyncrasy of a certain new friend whom by that very token he guess it might be he come out on to the landing to find a great big friendly man in corpulent blue serge a rough dark beard and a slouch hat stand a few foot off in a deprecating way -- which really mean that if there be any lady in the room with mr mesurier he would prefer to call another time for though he have two or three grownup daughter of he own this giant of a man be as shy of a bit of a thing like angel whom he have meet there one day as though he be a mere boy he always feel he once say in explanation as though he might break they in shake hand they affect he like the presence of delicate china and yet he could hold a baby deftly as a elephant can nip up a flower and to see he turn over the page of a delicate _ édition de luxe _ be a lesson in tenderness for this big man who as he would himself say look for all the world like a pirate be as insatiable of fine edition as a school-girl of chocolate cream he be one of those dearest of god 's creature a gentle giant and he voice when it be not necessary to be angry be as low and kind as a old nurse at the cradle 's side henry have come to know he through he little scotch printer who print circular and bill-head for the business over which mr fairfax -- for that be he name -- preside by day he be the vigorous brain of a huge emporium a sort of tyrian whiteley 's but day and night he be a lover of book and you could never catch he so busy but that he could spare the time mysteriously to beckon you into he private office and with the glee of a child show you he last large paper he not only love book but he be rumor liberally to have assist one or two distressed man of genius well-known to the world the tale of the surreptitious goodness of he heart be many but it be know too that the big kind man have a terribly search eye under he briery brow and could be as stern towards ingratitude as he be soft to misfortune henry once catch a glimpse of this as they speak of a mutual friend whom he have help to no purpose mr fairfax never use many word on this occasion he be grimly laconic rat-poison he say shake he head rat-poison it be he way of say that that be the only cure for that particular kind of man it be evident that he generous eye have see how thing be with henry he have subscribe for at least a dozen copy of the book of angelica and in several way show he interest in the struggle young poet as have be say he have see angelica one day and he shyness have not prevent he heart from go out to these two young people and the dream he see in they eye he have determine to do what he could to help they and to-day he have come with a plan i hope you be not too proud to give I a hand mr mesurier in a little idea i have get he say i think you know how proud i be and how proud i be not mr fairfax say henry i be sure anything i could do for you would make I proud if that be what you mean thank you thank you but you must not speak too fast it be advertising -- do the word frighten you no well it be a scheme i have think of for a little really artistic and humorous advertising combine i have get a promise from one of the most original artist of the day you know he name to do the picture and i want you to do the verse -- at i may say you own price it be not perhaps the highest occupation for a poet but it be something to be go on with and if we have get good poster as advertisement i do not see why we should not have good humorous verse what do you think of it i think it be capital say henry who be almost too ready to turn he hand to anything of course i 'll do it only too glad well that be settle now name you price do not be frightened really i can not i have not the least idea what i should get wait till i have do a few of the verse and you can give I what you please no sir say mr fairfax business be business if you will not name a figure i must will you consider a hundred pound sufficient a hundred pound henry gasp out the tear almost start to he eye mr fairfax do not miss he frank joy and like he for he ingenuousness all right then we 'll call it settle i shall be ready for the verse as soon as you care to write they mr fairfax i will tell you frankly that this be a great deal to I and i thank you from my heart not a word not a word my boy we want you verse we want you verse that be right be not it good verse good money now no more of that and the good man in alarm lest he should be thank further make a abrupt and awkward farewell it will keep the lad go a few month anyhow he say to himself as he tramp downstairs glad that he would be able to think of something for while the scheme be admirable as a advertisement and would more than repay messr owen ' outlay its origin have be pure philanthropy such good angel do walk this world in the guise of bulky quite unpoetic-looking business-man one hundred pound say henry over and over again to himself one hundred pound what news for angel he have soon a scheme in he head for the book which entirely hit mr fairfax 's fancy it be to make a volume of verse celebrate each of the various department of the great store in metre parody the style of the old english ballad and various poet ancient and modern and be to be call bon marché ballad something like this for example say henry a few day later pull a envelope cover with pencil-scribble from he pocket this for the lady ' department -- _ oh where do you buy you hat lady and where do you buy you hose and where do you buy you shoe lady and where you underclothes _ _ hat shoe and stocking everything a lady 's heart require quality good and price low we be the largest buyer the stock we buy on Wednesday last be fading fast away to-morrow it may be too late -- oh come and buy to-day _ mr fairfax fairly trumpet approval if they be all as good as that he say you must have more money yes you must well well -- we 'll see we 'll see and when the bon marché ballad actually appear the generous creature insist on add another fifty pound to the cheque as many be afterwards of opinion that henry never again do such good work as these nonsense rhyme write thus for a frolic -- and one hundred and fifty pound -- and as copy of the bon marché ballad be now exceedingly scarce it may possibly be of interest to quote two or three more of its preposterous number this be a lyric illustrative of cheese for the provision department : -- _ be you fond of cheese do you sometimes sigh for a really good gorgonzolum try try we one-and-ten wonderfully rotten taste once it never can be again forget _ here be a ballad of baby 's toy : -- _ oh give I a toy the baby say -- the babe of three month old -- oh what shall i buy my little babee with silver and with gold i would you buy a trumpet fine and a rocking-horse for I and a bucket and a spade mother to dig beside the sea but where shall i buy these pretty thing the mother 's heart inquire oh go to owen cry the babe they be the largest buyer _ the subject of we last selection be melton mowbray which bear beneath its title due apology to mr swinburne : -- _ strange pie that be almost a passion o passion immoral for pie unknown be the way that they fashion unknown and unseen of the eye the pie that be marbled and mottle the pie that digest with a sigh : for all be not bass that be bottled and all be not pork that be pie _ of all the goodness else that henry and angel be to owe in future day to mr fairfax there be not room in this book to write but that matter little for be it not write in the book of love chapter xliii still another caller one afternoon the step come along the corridor be almost light enough to be angel 's though a lover 's ear tell he that hers it be not once more that feminine rustle the very whisper of romantic mystery again the little feminine knock daintiness and myrtillum well this be lovely of you myrtilla but what courage how do you ever dare venture into this wild and savage spot -- this mountain-fastness of bohemia yes it be brave of I be not it say myrtillum with a little laugh for which the stair have hardly leave she breath but what a climb it be like have you room on the matterhorn i think i must write a magazine article : ` how i climb the fifty-thousand stair ' with illustration -- and we could have some quite pretty one she say look round the room that big skylight be splendid as close dear lad to the star as you can get it be you as devote to they as ever be not you myrtilla oh yes but they do not get any nearer you know it be awfully good to see you again myrtillum say henry go over to she and take both she hand it be quite a long time you know since we have a talk it be a sweet thought of you to come you 'll have some tea will not you yes i should love to see you make tea bachelor always make such good tea what pretty cup my word we be dainty i suppose it be esther buy they for you henry detect the little trap and smile no it have not be esther no someone else then eh i think i can guess she name it be mean of you not to tell I about she henry i hear she be call angel and that she look like one i wish i could have see she before i go away go away myrtilla why where i have hear nothing of it tell I about it the atmosphere perceptibly darken with the thought of williamson well she say in the little airy melodious way she have when she be tell something particularly unhappy about herself -- a sort of harpsichord bravado -- well you know he be take to fancy himself seriously ill lately and the doctor have aid and abet he and so we be go to davo platz or some such health-wilderness -- and well that be all and you i suppose be to nurse the -- to nurse he say henry savagely hush lad it be no use not a bit you will not help I that way she say lay she hand kindly on he and she eye grow bright with suppress tear it be a shame nevertheless myrtilla a cruel shame you would like to say it be a something-else shame would not you dear boy well you can if you like : but then you must say no more and if you really want to help I you shall send I a long letter now and again with some of you new poem enclose and tell I what new book be worth send for will you do that of course i will that be precious little to do anyhow it be a good deal really but be sure you do it and of course you 'll write to I sometimes i do not think you know yet what you letter be to I i never work so well as when i have have a letter from you really dear lad i do not fancy you know how happy that make I to hear yes you take just the sort of interest in my work i want and that no one else take not even angel say myrtillum slily angel bless she love my work and be a brave little critic of it but then it be not disloyal to she to say that she do not know as much as you besides she do not approach it in quite the same way she care for it first because it be mine and only secondly for its own sake now you care for it just for what it be -- i care for it certainly for what it be go to be say myrtillum make one of those honest distinction which make she opinion so stimulate to henry yes there you be you be artistically ambitious for I you know what i want to do even before i know myself that be why you be so good for I no one but you be that for I and -- poor stuff as i know it be -- never write a word without wonder what you will think of it you be sure it be quite true say myrtillum do not say so if it be not because you know you be say what i care most to hear perhaps of anything you could say you know how i love literature and -- well you know too how fond i be of you dear lad do not you literary criticism have kindle into emotion and henry bent down and kiss myrtillum 's hand in return she let she hand rest a moment lightly on he hair and then rather spasmodically turn to remark on he bookshelf with suspicious energy at that moment another step be hear in the corridor again feminine henry know it for angel 's and it may be that he expression grow a shade embarrass as he say : i believe i shall be able to introduce you to angel after all -- for i think this be she come along the passage as henry open the door angel be on the point of throw she arm round he neck when notice a certain constraint in he manner of greet she realize that he be not alone we be just talk of you dear say henry this be my friend mr williamson -- ` myrtilla ' of whom you have often hear I speak oh yes i have often hear of mr williamson say angel not of course suffer the irony of she thought to escape into she voice and i have hear no less of miss flower say mr williamson not indeed from this faithless boy here -- for i have not see he for so long that i have have to humble myself at last and call -- but from esther myrtillum love the transparent face pulse with light flushing or fading with she vary mood answer with exquisite delicacy to any advance and retreat of the soul within but a invincible prejudice or perhaps rather fear shut angel 's eye from the appreciation of myrtillum she be sweet and beautiful but to the child that angel still be she suggest malign artifice angel look at she as a imaginative child look at the moon with suspicion so in spite of myrtillum 's effort to make friend the conversation sustain a distinct loss in sprightliness by angel 's arrival myrtillum perhaps divine a little of the truth rise to go well i be afraid it be quite a long good-bye she say oh you be go away say angel with a shade of relief involuntarily in she voice oh yes perhaps before we meet again you and henry will be marry i be sure i sincerely hope so thank you say angel somewhat coldly well good-bye henry say myrtillum -- it be rather a strangle good-bye -- and then in a evil moment she catch sight of the dante 's head which hide in a recess she have not notice before i see you be still faithful to the dante she say that be sweet of you -- good-bye good-bye miss flower angel perhaps you 'll let I say good-bye when she have go there seem a curious constraint in the air you might have say that the consistency of the air have be double gravitation be at least twice as many pound as usual to the square inch every little movement seem heavy as though the medium have be water instead of air as henry raise he hand to help angel off with she jacket they seem weight with lead no thank you say angel i will not take it off i can not stay long why dear what do you mean i think you be go to stay the evening with I i have quite a long new chapter to read to you i be sorry henry -- but i find i can not why dear how 's that will not you tell I the reason have anything happen angel stand still in the middle of the room with she face as firmly miserable as she could make it will not you tell I henry plead will not you speak to I come dear -- what be the matter you know well enough henry what be the matter come a unexpected flash of speech indeed i do not i know of no reason whatever how should i well then mr williamson 's the matter -- ` myrtillum ' as you call she something tell I it be like this all along though i could not bear to doubt you and so i put it away i wonder how often she be be here when i have know nothing about it this be the very first time she have ever set foot in these room say henry grow cold in he turn i 'll give you my word of honor if you need it i do not want to hear any more i be go good-bye go angel say henry standing between she and the door what can you mean see now -- give you brain a chance you be not think in the least you have just let yourself go -- for no reason at all you 'll be sorry to-morrow reason enough i should think when i find that you love another woman i love myrtilla williamson it be a lie angel -- and you ought to be ashamed to say it it be unworthy of you why have you never tell I then who make that sketch of dante for you i suppose i should never have know if she have not let it out i ask you once but you put I off henry have indeed prevaricate for angel have chance to ask he just after myrtillum 's letter about he poem well i 'll be frank say henry i do not tell you just because i fear a unreasonable scene like this -- if there have be nothing in it there be nothing to fear and in any case why should she paint picture for you if she do not care for you -- no i be go nothing will persuade I otherwise henry please let pass if you be a gentleman -- and poor little angel 's face fairly flame no power on earth will keep I here -- all right angel -- and henry let she have she way she foot echo down the stair further and further away she be go and henry spend that evening in torturingly imagine every kind of accident that might happen to she on the way home every hour he expect to be suddenly call to look at she dead body -- he work and so the night pass and the morning dawn in agony so go the whole of the next day for he could be proud too -- and the fault have be hers thus they sit apart for three day pole of determine silence and then at last on the evening of the third day henry who be half beside himself with suspense hear with wild thankfulness once more the little step in the passage -- it seem fainter he think and drag a little and the knock at the door be like a ghost 's there with a wan smile angel stand and with joy wordless because unspeakable they fall almost like dead thing into each other 's arm for a hour they sit thus and never speak a word only stroke each other 's hand and hair it be so good for each to know that the other be alive it take so long for the store agony in the nerve to relax i have not eat a morsel since Wednesday say angel at last nor i say henry henry dear i be sorry i know now i be wrong i give you my word never to doubt you again thank you angel do not let we even think of it any more i could not live through it again darling but it can never happen any more can it no -- but -- if you ever love any woman better than you love I you 'll tell I will not you i could bear that better than to be deceive yes angel i promise to tell you well we be really happy again now -- be we i can hardly believe it -- you do not see I outside you house last night do you henry yes i be there and i watch you carry the light into you bedroom and when you come to the window to draw down the blind i think you must have see I yes i wait and wait till i see the light go out and long after -- oh henry -- you do love I then and we do know how to hate each other sometimes do not we child say henry laughing into angel 's eye all rainbow and tear chapter xliv the end of a beginning and now blow all ye trumpet and all ye organ tremble with exultant sound bring forth the harp and the psaltry and the sackbut for the long winter of wait be at a end and mike be fly north to fetch he bride now be the wall of heaven build four-square and to-day be the roof-beam hang with garland ` tis but a small heaven yet be it big enough for two -- and mike be fly north fly north through the midnight to fetch he bride henry and the morning meet he at tyre blessing on he little wrinkled face the wrinkle be deeper and sweeter by a year 's hard work he have laugh with they every night for full twelve month laugh to make other laugh to-day he shall laugh for himself alone the very river seem
