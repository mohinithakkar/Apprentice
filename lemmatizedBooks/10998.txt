application to mine mill steam navigation railway and agriculture with practical instruction for the manufacture and management of engine of every class by john bourne ce _ new and revised edition _ -lrb- transcriber 's note : inconsistency in chapter heading and numbering of paragraph and illustration have be retain in this edition -rrb- preface to the fourth edition for some year past a new edition of this work have be call for but i be unwilling to allow a new edition to go forth with all the original fault of the work upon its head and i have be too much engage in the practical construction of steam ship and steam engine to find time for the thorough revision which i know the work require at length however i have sufficiently disengaged myself from these onerous pursuit to accomplish this necessary revision and i now offer the work to the public with the confidence that it will be find better deserving of the favorable acceptation and high praise it have already receive there be very few error either of fact or of inference in the early edition which i have have to correct but there be many omission which i have have to supply and fault of arrangement and classification which i have have to rectify i have also have to bring the information which the work profess to afford up to the present time so as to comprehend the latest improvement for the sake of greater distinctness the work be now divide into chapter some of these chapter be altogether new and the rest have receive such extensive addition and improvement as to make the book almost a new one one purpose of my emendation have be to render my remark intelligible to a tyro as well as instructive to a advanced student with this view i have devote the first chapter to a popular description of the steam engine -- which all may understand who can understand anything -- and in the subsequent gradation of progress i have be careful to set no object before the reader for the first time of which the nature and function be not simultaneously explain the design i have propose to myself in the composition of this work be to take a young lad who know nothing of steam engine and to lead he by easy advance up to the highest point of information i have myself attain and it have be a pleasing duty to I to smooth for other the path which i myself find so rugged and to impart for the general good of mankind the secret which other have guard with so much jealousy i believe i be the first author who have communicate that practical information respect the steam engine which person propose to follow the business of a engineer desire to possess my business have therefore be the rough business of a pioneer and while hew a road through the trackless forest along which all might hereafter travel with ease i have no time to attend to those minute grace of composition and petty perfection of arrangement and collocation which be the attribute of the academic grove or the literary parterre i be nevertheless not insensible to the advantage of method and clear arrangement in any work profess to instruct mankind in the principle and practice of any art and many of the change introduce into the present edition of this work be design to render it less exceptionable in this respect the woodcut now introduce into the work for the first time will i believe much increase its interest and utility and upon the whole i be content to dismiss it into circulation in the belief that those who peruse it attentively will obtain a more rapid and more practical acquaintance with the steam engine in its various application than they would be likely otherwise to acquire i have only to add that i have prepare a sequel to the present work in the shape of a hand-book of the steam engine contain the whole of the rule give in the present work illustrate by example work out at length and also contain such useful table and other datum as the engineer require to refer to constantly in the course of he practice this work may be bind up with the catechism if desire to which it be in fact a key i shall thankfully receive from engineer either abroad or at home account of any engine or other machinery with which they may become familiar in they several locality and i shall be happy in my turn to answer any inquiry on engineering subject which fall within the compass of my information if young engineer meet with any difficulty in they study i shall be happy to resolve it if i can and they may communicate with I upon any such point without hesitation in whatever quarter of the world they may happen to be john bourne 9 billiter street london _ march 1st 1856 _ preface to the fifth edition the last edition of the present work consist of 3500 copy have be all sell off in about ten month i now issue another edition the demand for the work be still unabated it afford certainly some presumption that a work in some measure supply a ascertain want when though address only a limited circle -- discourse only of technical question and without any accident to stimulate it into notoriety -- it attain so large a circulation as the present work have reach besides be reprint in america it have be translate into german french dutch and i believe into some other language so that there be perhaps not too much vanity in the inference that it have be find serviceable to those peruse it i can with truth say that the hope of render some service to mankind in my day and generation have be my chief inducement in write it and if this end be fulfil i have nothing further to desire i regret that circumstance have prevent I from yet issue the hand-book which i have have for some time in preparation and to which in my preface of the last year i refer i hope to have sufficient leisure shortly to give that and some other of my literary design the necessary attention whatever may have be the other impediment to a more prolific authorship certainly one of they have not be the coldness of the approbation with which my effort have be receive since my past performance seem to I to have meet with a appreciation far exceed they desert john bourne _ February 2d 1857 _ publisher ' notice in offer to the american public a reprint of a work on the steam engine so deservedly successful and so long consider standard the publisher have not think it necessary that it should be a exact copy of the english edition there be some detail in which they think it could be improve and better adapt to the use of american engineer on this account the size of the page have be increase to a full 12mo to admit of larger illustration which in the english edition be often on too small a scale and some of the illustration themselves have be supply by other equally applicable more recent and to we more familiar example the first part of chapter xi devote in the english edition to english portable and fixed agricultural engine in this edition give place entirely to illustration from american practice of steam engine as apply to different purpose and of appliance and machine necessary to they but with the exception of some of the illustration and the description of they and the correction of a few

of marine engine management of locomotive mechanical principle of the steam engine classification of engine 1 _ q _ -- what be mean by a vacuum _ a _ -- a vacuum mean a empty space a space in which there be neither water nor air nor anything else that we know of 2 _ q _ -- wherein do a high pressure differ from a low pressure engine _ a _ -- in a high pressure engine the steam after have push the piston to the end of the stroke escape into the atmosphere and the impel force be therefore that due to the difference between the pressure of the steam and the pressure of the atmosphere in the condense engine the steam after have press the piston to the end of the stroke pass into the condenser in which a vacuum be maintain and the impel force be that due to the difference between the pressure of the steam above the piston and the pressure of the vacuum beneath it which be nothing or in other word you have then the whole pressure of the steam urge the piston consist of the pressure show by the safety-valve on the boiler and the pressure of the atmosphere besides 3 _ q _ -- in what way would you class the various kind of condense engine _ a _ -- into single act rotative and rotatory engine single act engine be engine without a crank such as be use for pump water rotative engine be engine provide with a crank by means of which a rotative motion be produce and in this important class stand marine and mill engine and all engine indeed in which the rectilinear motion of the piston be change into a circular motion in rotatory engine the steam act at once in the production of circular motion either upon a revolving piston or otherwise but without the use of any intermediate mechanism such as the crank for derive a circular from a rectilinear motion rotatory engine have not hitherto be very successful so that only the single acting or pump engine and the double acting or rotative engine can be say to be in actual use for some purpose such for example as force air into furnace for smelt iron double acting engine be employ which be nevertheless unfurnished with a crank but engine of this kind be not sufficiently numerous to justify they classification as a distinct species and in general those engine may be consider to be single act by which no rotatory motion be impart 4 _ q _ -- be not the circular motion derive from a cylinder engine very irregular in consequence of the unequal leverage of the crank at the different part of its revolution _ a _ -- no rotative engine be generally provide with a fly-wheel to correct such irregularity by its momentum but where two engine with they respective crank set at right angle be employ the irregularity of one engine correct that of the other with sufficient exactitude for many purpose in the case of marine and locomotive engine a fly-wheel be not employ but for cotton spin and other purpose require great regularity of motion its use with common engine be indispensable though it be not impossible to supersede the necessity by new contrivance 5 _ q _ -- you imply that there be some other difference between single acting and double acting engine than that which lie in the use or exclusion of the crank _ a _ -- yes single act engine act only in one way by the force of the steam and be return by a counter-weight whereas double acting engine be urge by the steam in both direction engine as i have already say be sometimes make double act though unprovided with a crank and there would be no difficulty in so arrange the valve of all ordinary pump engine as to admit of this action for the pump might be contrived to raise water both by the upward and downward stroke as indeed in some mine be already do but engine without a crank be almost always make single act perhaps from the effect of custom as much as from any other reason and be usually speak of as such though it be necessary to know that there be some deviation from the usual practice nature and use of a vacuum 6 _ q _ -- the pressure of a vacuum you have state be nothing but how can the pressure of a vacuum be say to be nothing when a vacuum occasion a pressure of 15 lb on the square inch _ a _ -- because it be not the vacuum which exert this pressure but the atmosphere which like a head of water press on everything immerge beneath it a head of water however would not press down a piston if the water be admit on both of its side for a equilibrium would then be establish just as in the case of a balance which retain its equilibrium when a equal weight be add to each scale but take the weight out of one scale or empty the water from one side of the piston and motion or pressure be produce and in like manner pressure be produce on a piston by admit steam or air upon the one side and withdraw the steam or air from the other side it be not therefore to a vacuum but rather to the existence of a unbalanced plenum that the pressure make manifest by exhaustion be due and it be obvious therefore that a vacuum of itself would not work a engine 7 _ q _ -- how be the vacuum maintain in a condense engine _ a _ -- the steam after have perform its office in the cylinder be permit to pass into a vessel call the condenser where a shower of cold water be discharge upon it the steam be condensed by the cold water and fall in the form of hot water to the bottom of the condenser the water which would else be accumulate in the condenser be continually be pump out by a pump work by the engine this pump be call the air pump because it also discharge any air which may have enter with the water 8 _ q _ -- if a vacuum be a empty space and there be water in the condenser how can there be a vacuum there _ a _ -- there be a vacuum above the water the water be only like so much iron or lead lie at the bottom 9 _ q _ -- be the vacuum in the condenser a perfect vacuum _ a _ -- not quite perfect for the cold water enter for the purpose of condensation be heat by the steam and emit a vapor of a tension represent by about three inch of mercury that be when the common barometer stand at 30 inch a barometer with the space above the mercury communicate with the condenser will stand at about 27 inch 10 _ q _ -- be this imperfection of the vacuum wholly attributable to the vapor in the condenser _ a _ -- no it be partly attributable to the presence of a small quantity of air which enter with the water and which would accumulate until it destroy the vacuum altogether but for the action of the air pump which expel it with the water as already explain all common water contain a certain quantity of air in solution and this air recover its elasticity when the pressure of the atmosphere be take off just as the gas in soda water fly up so soon as the cork of the bottle be withdraw 11 _ q _ -- be a barometer sometimes apply to the condenser of steam engine _ a _ -- yes and it be call the vacuum gauge because it show the degree of perfection the vacuum have attain another gauge call the steam gauge be apply to the boiler which indicate the pressure of the steam by the height to which the steam force mercury up a tube gauge be also apply to the boiler to indicate the height of the water within it so that it may not be burn out by the water become accidentally too low in some case a succession of cock place a short distance above one another be employ for this purpose and in other case a glass tube be place perpendicularly in the front of the boiler and communicate at each end with its interior the water rise in this tube to the same height as in the boiler itself and thus show the actual water level in most of the modern boiler both of these contrivance be adopt 12 _ q _ -- can a condense engine be work with a pressure less than that of the atmosphere _ a _ -- yes if once it be start but it will be a difficult thing to start a engine if the pressure of the steam be not greater than that of the atmosphere before a engine can be start it have to be blow through with steam to displace the air within it and this can not be effectually do if the pressure of the steam be very low after the engine be start however the pressure in the boiler may be lower if the engine be lightly load until there be a partial vacuum in the boiler such a practice however be not to be commend as the gauge cock become useless when there be a partial vacuum in the boiler inasmuch as when they be open the water will not rush out but air will rush in it be impossible also under such circumstance to blow out any of the sediment collect within the boiler which in the case of the boiler of steam vessel require to be do every two hour or oftener this be accomplish by open a large cock which permit some of the supersalted water to be force overboard by the pressure of the steam in some case in which the boiler apply to a engine be of inadequate size the pressure within the boiler will fall spontaneously to a point considerably beneath the pressure of the atmosphere but it be preferable in such case partially to close the throttle valve in the steam pipe whereby the issue of steam to the engine be diminish and the pressure in the boiler be thus maintain while the cylinder receive its former supply 13 _ q _ -- if a hole be open into a condenser of a steam engine will air rush into it _ a _ -- if the hole communicate with the atmosphere the air will be draw in 14 _ q _ -- with what velocity do air rush into a vacuum _ a _ -- with the velocity which a body would acquire by fall from the height of a homogeneous atmosphere which be a atmosphere of the same density throughout as at the earth 's surface and although such a atmosphere do not exist in nature its existence be suppose in order to facilitate the computation it be well know that the velocity with which water issue from a cistern be the same that would be acquire by a body fall from the level of the head to the level of the issue point which indeed be a obvious law since every particle of water descend and issue by virtue of its gravity and be in its descent subject to the ordinary law of fall body air rush into a vacuum be only another example of the same general principle : the velocity of each particle will be that due to the height of the column of air which would produce the pressure sustained and the weight of air be know as well as the pressure it exert on the earth 's surface it become easy to tell what height a column of air a inch square and of the atmospheric density would require to be to weigh 15 lb the height would be 27818 foot and the velocity which the fall of a body from such a height produce would be 1338 foot per second velocity of fall body and momentum of move body 15 _ q _ -- how do you determine the velocity of fall body of different kind _ a _ -- all body fall with the same velocity when there be no resistance from the atmosphere as be show by the experiment of let fall from the top of a tall exhaust receiver a feather and a guinea which reach the bottom at the same time the velocity of fall body be one that be accelerate uniformly accord to a known law when the height from which a body fall be give the velocity acquire at the end of the descent can be easily compute it have be find by experiment that the square root of the height in foot multiply by 8021 will give the velocity 16 _ q _ -- but the velocity in what term _ a _ -- in foot per second the distance through which a body fall by gravity in one second be 16-1\/12 foot in two seconds 64-4\/12 foot in three seconds 144-9\/12 foot in four seconds 257-4\/12 foot and so on if the number of foot fall through in one second be take as unity then the relation of the time to the space will be as follow : -- number of seconds | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | unit of space pass through | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | & c so that it appear that the space pass through by a fall body be as the square of the time of fall 17 _ q _ -- be not the urge force which cause body to fall the force of gravity _ a _ -- yes the force of gravity or the attraction of the earth 18 _ q _ -- and be not that a uniform force or a force act with a uniform pressure _ a _ -- it be 19 _ q _ -- therefore during the first second of fall as much impel power will be give by the force of gravity as during every succeed second _ a _ -- undoubtedly 20 _ q _ -- how come it then that while the body fall 64-4\/12 foot in two seconds it fall only 16-1\/12 foot in one second or why since it fall only 16-1\/12 foot in one second should it fall more than twice 16-1\/12 foot in two _ a _ -- because 16-1\/12 foot be the average and not the maximum velocity during the first second the velocity acquire _ at the end _ of the 1st second be not 16-1\/12 but 32-1\/6 foot per second and at the end of the 2d second a velocity of 32-1\/6 foot have to be add so that the total velocity at the end of the 2d second become 64-2\/6 foot at the end of the 3d the velocity become 96-3\/6 foot at the end of the 4th 128-4\/6 foot and so on these number proceed in the progression 1 2 3 4 & c so that it appear that the velocity acquire by a fall body at different point be simply as the time of fall but if the velocity be as the time and the total space pass through be as the square of the time then the total space pass through must be as the square of the velocity and as the _ vis viva _ or mechanical power inherent in a fall body of any give weight be measurable by the height through which it descend it follow that the _ vis viva _ be proportionate to the square of the velocity of two ball therefore of equal weight but one move twice as fast as the other the faster ball have four time the energy or mechanical force accumulate in it that the slower ball have if the speed of a fly-wheel be double it have four time the _ vis viva _ it possess before -- _ vis viva _ be measurable by a reference to the height through which a body must have fall to acquire the velocity give 21 _ q _ -- by what consideration be the _ vis viva _ or mechanical energy proper for the fly-wheel of a engine determine _ a _ -- by a reference to the power produce every half-stroke of the engine join to the consideration of what relation the energy of the fly-wheel rim must have thereto to keep the irregularity of motion within the limit which be admissible it be find in practice that when the power resident in the fly-wheel rim when the engine move at its average speed be from two and a half to four time greater than the power generate by the engine in one half-stroke -- the variation depend on the energy inherent in the machinery the engine have to drive and the equability of motion require -- the engine will work with sufficient regularity for most ordinary purpose but where great equability of motion be require it will be advisable to make the power resident in the fly-wheel equal to six time the power generate by the engine in one half-stroke 22 _ q _ -- can you give a practical rule for determine the proper quantity of cast iron for the rim of a fly-wheel in ordinary land engine _ a _ -- one rule frequently adopt be as follow : -- multiply the mean diameter of the rim by the number of its revolution per minute and square the product for a divisor divide the number of actual horse power of the engine by the number of stroke the piston make per minute multiply the quotient by the constant number 2760000 and divide the product by the divisor find as above the quotient be the requisite quantity of cast iron in cubic foot to form the fly-wheel rim 23 _ q _ -- what be boulton and watt 's rule for find the dimension of the fly-wheel _ a _ -- boulton and watt 's rule for find the dimension of the fly-wheel be as follow : -- multiply 44000 time the length of the stroke in foot by the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch and divide the product by the square of the number of revolution per minute multiply by the cube of the diameter of the fly-wheel in foot the result number will be the sectional area of the rim of the fly-wheel in square inch central force 24 _ q _ -- what do you understand by centrifugal and centripetal force _ a _ -- by centrifugal force i understand the force with which a revolving body tend to fly from the center and by centripetal force i understand any force which draw it to the center or counteract the centrifugal tendency in the conical pendulum or steam engine governor which consist of two metal ball suspend on rod hang from the end of a vertical revolving shaft the centrifugal force be manifest by the divergence of the ball when the shaft be put into revolution and the centripetal force which in this instance be gravity predominate so soon as the velocity be arrest for the arm then collapse and hang by the side of the shaft 25 _ q _ -- what measure be there of the centrifugal force of body revolve in a circle _ a _ -- the centrifugal force of body revolve in a circle increase as the diameter of the circle if the number of revolution remain the same if there be two fly-wheel of the same weight and make the same number of revolution per minute but the diameter of one be double that of the other the larger will have double the amount of centrifugal force the centrifugal force of the _ same wheel _ however increase as the square of the velocity so that if the velocity of a fly-wheel be double it will have four time the amount of centrifugal force 26 _ q _ -- can you give a rule for determine the centrifugal force of a body of a give weight move with a give velocity in a circle of a give diameter _ a _ -- yes if the velocity in foot per second be divide by 401 the square of the quotient will be four time the height in foot from which a body must have fall to have acquire that velocity divide this quadruple height by the diameter of the circle and the quotient be the centrifugal force in term of the weight of the body so that multiply the quotient by the actual weight of the body we have the centrifugal force in pound or ton another rule be to multiply the square of the number of revolution per minute by the diameter of the circle in foot and to divide the product by 5870 the quotient be the centrifugal force in term of the weight of the body 27 _ q _ -- how do you find the velocity of the body when its centrifugal force and the diameter of the circle in which it move be give _ a _ -- multiply the centrifugal force in term of the weight of the body by the diameter of the circle in foot and multiply the square root of the product by 401 the result will be the velocity of the body in foot per second 28 _ q _ -- will you illustrate this by find the velocity at which the cast iron rim of a fly-wheel 10 foot in diameter would burst asunder by its centrifugal force _ a _ -- if we take the tensile strength of cast iron at 15000 lb per square inch a fly-wheel rim of one square inch of sectional area would sustain 30000 lb if we suppose one half of the rim to be so fix to the shaft as to be incapable of detachment then the centrifugal force of the other half of the rim at the moment of rupture must be equal to 30000 lb now 30000 lb divide by 4948 -lrb- the weight of the half rim -rrb- be equal to 6063 which be the centrifugal force in term of the weight then by the rule give in the last answer 6063 x 10 = 6063 the square root of which be 78 nearly and 78 x 401 = 31278 the velocity of the rim in foot per second at the moment of rupture 29 _ q _ -- what be the greatest velocity at which it be safe to drive a cast iron fly-wheel _ a _ -- if we take 2000 lb as the utmost strain per square inch to which cast iron can be permanently subject with safety then by a similar process to that just explain we have 4000 lbs\/4948 = 808 which multiply by 10 = 808 the square root of which be 284 and 284 x 401 = 113884 the velocity of the rim in foot per second which may be consider as the highest consistent with safety indeed this limit should not be approach in practice on account of the risk of fracture from weakness or imperfection in the metal 30 _ q _ -- what be the velocity at which the wheel of railway train may run if we take 4000 lb per square inch as the greatest strain to which malleable iron should be subject _ a _ -- the weight of a malleable iron rim of one square inch sectional area and 7 foot diameter be 21991 foot x 34 lb = 7476 one half of which be 374 lb then by the same process as before 8000\/374 = 2139 the centrifugal force in term of the weight : 2139 x 7 the diameter of the wheel = 14973 the square root of which 383 x 401 = 155187 foot per second the highest velocity of the rim of railway carriage wheel that be consistent with safety 155187 foot per second be equivalent to 1058 mile a hour as 4000 lb per square inch of sectional area be the utmost strain to which iron should be expose in machinery railway wheel can scarcely be consider safe at speed even considerably under 100 mile a hour unless so construct that the centrifugal force of the rim will be counteract to a material extent by the centripetal action of the arm hoop wheel be very unsafe unless the hoop be by some process or other firmly attach to the arm it be of no use to increase the dimension of the rim of a wheel with the view of give increase strength to counteract the centrifugal force as every increase in the weight of the rim will increase the centrifugal force in the same proportion centre of gravity gyration and oscillation 31 _ q _ -- what do you understand by the center of gravity of a body _ a _ -- that point within it in which the whole of the weight may be suppose to be concentrated and which continually endeavor to gain the lowest possible position a body hang in the center of gravity will remain at rest in any position 32 _ q _ -- what be mean by the center of gyration _ a _ -- the center of gyration be that point in a revolving body in which the whole momentum may be conceive to be concentrated or in which the whole effect of the momentum reside if the ball of a governor be to be move in a straight line the momentum might be say to be concentrate at the center of gravity of the ball but inasmuch as by its revolution round a axis the part of the ball furthest remove from the axis move more quickly than the part nearest to it the momentum can not be suppose to be concentrate at the center of gravity but at a point further remove from the central shaft and that point be what be call the center of gyration 33 _ q _ -- what be the center of oscillation _ a _ -- the center of oscillation be a point in a pendulum or any swinging body such that if all the matter of the body be to be collect into that point the velocity of its vibration would remain unaffected it be in fact the mean distance from the center of suspension of every atom in a ratio which happen not to be a arithmetical one the center of oscillation be always in a line pass through the center of suspension and the center of gravity the pendulum and governor 34 _ q _ -- by what circumstance be the velocity of vibration of a pendulous body determine _ a _ -- by the length of the suspend rod only or more correctly by the distance between the center of suspension and the center of oscillation the length of the arc describe do not signify as the time of vibration will be the same whether the arc be the fourth or the four hundredth of a circle or at least they will be nearly so and would be so exactly if the curve describe be a portion of a cycloid in the pendulum of clock therefore a small arc be prefer as there be in that case no sensible deviation from the cycloidal curve but in other respects the size of the arc do not signify 35 _ q _ -- if then the length of a pendulum be give can the number of vibration in a give time be determine _ a _ -- yes the time of vibration bear the same relation to the time in which a body would fall through a space equal to half the length of the pendulum that the circumference of a circle bear to its diameter the number of vibration make in a give time by pendulum of different length be inversely as the square root of they length 36 _ q _ -- then when the length of the second 's pendulum be know the proper length of a pendulum to make any give number of vibration in the minute can readily be compute _ a _ -- yes the length of the second 's pendulum be know the length of another pendulum require to perform any give number of vibration in the minute may be obtain by the follow rule : multiply the square root of the give length by 60 and divide the product by the give number of vibration per minute the square of the quotient be the length of pendulum require thus if the length of a pendulum be require that would make 70 vibration per minute in the latitude of london then sqrt -lrb- 391393 -rrb- x 60\/70 = -lrb- 5363 -rrb- ^ 2 = 2875 in which be the length require 37 _ q _ -- can you explain how it come that the length of a pendulum determine the number of vibration it make in a give time _ a _ -- because the length of the pendulum determine the steepness of the circle in which the body move and it be obvious that a body will descend more rapidly over a steep inclined plane or a steep arc of a circle than over one in which there be but a slight inclination the impel force be gravity which urge the body with a force proportionate to the distance descend and if the velocity due to the descent of a body through a give height be spread over a great horizontal distance the speed of the body must be slow in proportion to the greatness of that distance it be clear therefore that as the length of the pendulum determine the steepness of the arc it must also determine the velocity of vibration 38 _ q _ -- if the motion of a pendulum be dependent on the speed with which a body fall then a certain ratio must subsist between the distance through which a body fall in a second and the length of the second 's pendulum _ a _ -- and so there be the length of the second 's pendulum at the level of the sea in london be 391393 inch and it be from the length of the second 's pendulum that the space through which a body fall in a second have be determine as the time in which a pendulum vibrate be to the time in which a heavy body fall through half the length of the pendulum as the circumference of a circle be to its diameter and as the height through which a body fall be as the square of the time of fall it be clear that the height through which a body will fall during the vibration of a pendulum be to half the length of the pendulum as the square of the circumference of a circle be to the square of its diameter namely as 98696 be to 1 or it be to the whole length of the pendulum as the half of this namely 49348 be to 1 and 49348 time 391393 in be 16-1\/12 ft very nearly which be the space through which a body fall by gravity in a second 39 _ q _ -- be the motion of the conical pendulum or governor reducible to the same law which apply to the common pendulum _ a _ -- yes the motion of the conical pendulum may be suppose to be compound of the motion of two common pendulum vibrate at right angle to one another and one revolution of a conical pendulum will be perform in the same time as two vibration of a common pendulum of which the length be equal to the vertical height of the point of suspension above the plane of revolution of the ball 40 _ q _ -- be not the conical pendulum or governor of a steam engine drive by the engine _ a _ -- yes 41 _ q _ -- then will it not be drive round as any other mechanism would be at a speed proportional to that of the engine _ a _ -- it will 42 _ q _ -- then how can the length of the arm affect the time of revolution -lrb- illustration : fig 1 -rrb- _ a _ -- by fly out until they assume a vertical height answering to the velocity with which they rotate round the central axis as the speed be increase the ball expand and the height of the cone describe by the arm be diminish until its vertical height be such that a pendulum of that length would perform two vibration for every revolution of the governor by the outward motion of the arm they partially shut off the steam from the engine if therefore a certain expansion of the ball be desire and a certain length be fix upon for the arm so that the vertical height of the cone be fix then the speed of the governor must be such that it will make half the number of revolution in a give time that a pendulum equal in length to the height of the cone would make of vibration the rule be multiply the square root of the height of the cone in inch by 031986 and the product will be the right time of revolution in seconds if the number of revolution and the length of the arm be fix and it be want to know what be the diameter of the circle describe by the ball you must divide the constant number 18758 by the number of revolution per minute and the square of the quotient will be the vertical height in inch of the center of suspension above the plane of the ball ' revolution deduct the square of the vertical height in inch from the square of the length of the arm in inch and twice the square root of the remainder be the diameter of the circle in which the centre of the ball revolve 43 _ q _ can not the operation of a governor be deduce merely from the consideration of centrifugal and centripetal force _ a _ -- it can and by a very simple process the horizontal distance of the arm from the spindle divide by the vertical height will give the amount of centripetal force and the velocity of revolution requisite to produce a equivalent centrifugal force may be find by multiply the centripetal force of the ball in term of its own weight by 70440 and divide the product by the diameter of the circle make by the center of the ball in inch the square root of the quotient be the number of revolution per minute by this rule you fix the length of the arm and the diameter of the base of the cone or what be the same thing the angle at which it be desire the arm shall revolve and you then make the speed or number of revolution such that the centrifugal force will keep the ball in the desire position 44 _ q _ -- do not the weight of the ball affect the question _ a _ -- not in the least each ball may be suppose to be make up of a number of small ball or particle and each particle of matter will act for itself heavy ball attach to a governor be only requisite to overcome the friction of the throttle valve which shut off the steam and of the connection lead thereto though the weight of a ball increase its centripetal force it increase its centrifugal force in the same proportion the mechanical power 45 _ q _ -- what do you understand by the mechanical power _ a _ -- the mechanical power be certain contrivance such as the wedge the screw the inclined plane and other elementary machine which convert a small force act through a great space into a great force act through a small space in the school treatise on mechanic a certain number of these device be set forth as the mechanical power and each separate device be treat as if it involve a separate principle but not a tithe of the contrivance which accomplish the stipulate end be represent in these learn work and there be no very obvious necessity for consider the principle of each contrivance separately when the principle of all be one and the same every pressure act with a certain velocity or through a certain space be convertible into a greater pressure act with a less velocity or through a smaller space but the quantity of mechanical force remain unchanged by its transformation and all that the implement call mechanical power accomplish be to effect this transformation 46 _ q _ -- be there no power gain by the lever _ a _ -- not any : the power be merely put into another shape just as the contents of a hogshead of porter be the same whether they be let off by a inch tap or by a hole a foot in diameter there be a greater gush in the one case than the other but it will last a shorter time when a lever be use there be a greater force exert but it act through a shorter distance it require just the same expenditure of mechanical power to lift 1 lb through 100 ft as to lift 100 lb through 1 foot a cylinder of a give cubical capacity will exert the same power by each stroke whether the cylinder be make tall and narrow or short and wide but in the one case it will raise a small weight through a great height and in the other case a great weight through a small height 47 _ q _ -- be there no loss of power by the use of the crank _ a _ -- not any many person have suppose that there be a loss of power by the use of the crank because at the top and bottom centre it be capable of exert little or no power but at those time there be little or no steam consume so that no waste of power be occasion by the peculiarity those who imagine that there be a loss of power cause by the crank perplex themselves by confound the vertical with the circumferential velocity if the circle of the crank be divide by any number of equidistant horizontal line it will be obvious that there must be the same steam consume and the same power expend when the crank pin pass from the level of one line to the level of the other in whatever part of the circle it may be those line be indicative of equal ascent or descent of the piston but it will be see that the circumferential velocity be greater with the same expenditure of steam when the crank pin approach the top and bottom centre and this increase velocity exactly compensate for the diminish leverage so that there be the same power give out by the crank in each of the division 48 _ q _ -- have no plan be project for gain power by means of a lever _ a _ -- yes many plan -- some of they display much ingenuity but all display a complete ignorance of the first principle of mechanic which teach that power can not be gain by any multiplication of lever and wheel i have occasionally hear person say : you gain a great deal of power by the use of a capstan why not apply the same resource in the case of a steam vessel and increase the power of you engine by place a capstan motion between the engine and paddle wheel other i have hear say : by the hydraulic press you can obtain unlimited power why not then interpose a hydraulic press between the engine and the paddle to these question the reply be sufficiently obvious whatever you gain in force you lose in velocity and it would benefit you little to make the paddle revolve with ten time the force if you at the same time cause they to make only a tenth of the number of revolution you can not by any combination of mechanism get increase force and increase speed at the same time or increase force without diminish speed and it be from the ignorance of this inexorable condition that such myriad of scheme for the realization of perpetual motion by combination of lever weight wheel quicksilver crank and other mere piece of inert matter have be propound 49 _ q _ -- then a force once call into existence can not be destroy _ a _ -- no force be eternal if by force you mean power or in other word pressure act though space but if by force you mean mere pressure then it furnish no measure of power power be not measurable by force but by force and velocity combined 50 _ q _ -- be not power lose when two move body strike one other and come to a state of rest _ a _ -- no not even then the body if elastic will rebind from one another with they original velocity if not elastic they will sustain a alteration of form and heat or electricity will be generate of equivalent value to the power which have disappear 51 _ q _ -- then if mechanical power can not be lose and be be daily call into existence must not there be a daily increase in the power exist in the world _ a _ -- that appear probable unless it flow back in the shape of heat or electricity to the celestial space the source of mechanical power be the sun which exhale vapor that descend in rain to turn mill or which cause wind to blow by the unequal rarefaction of the atmosphere it be from the sun too that the power come which be liberate in a steam engine the solar ray enable plant to decompose carbonic acid gas the product of combustion and the vegetation thus render possible be the source of coal and other combustible body the combustion of coal under a steam boiler therefore merely liberate the power which the sun give out thousand of year before friction 52 _ q _ -- what be friction _ a _ -- friction be the resistance experience when one body be rub upon another body and be suppose to be the result of the natural attraction which body have for one another and of the interlocking of the impalpable asperity upon the surface of all body however smooth there be no doubt some electrical action involve in its production not yet recognize nor understand and it be perhaps traceable to the disturbance of the electrical equilibrium of the particle of the body owe to the condensation or change of figure which all body must experience when subject to a strain when motion in opposite direction be give to smooth surface the minute asperity of one surface must mount upon those of the other and both will be abraded and worn away in which act power must be expend the friction of smooth rub substance be less when the composition of those substance be different than when it be the same the particle be suppose to interlock less when the opposite prominence or asperity be not coincident 53 _ q _ -- do friction increase with the extent of rub surface _ a _ -- no the friction so long as there be no violent heating or abrasion be simply in the proportion of the pressure keep the surface together or nearly so it be therefore a obvious advantage to have the bearing surface of steam engine as large as possible as there be no increase of friction by extend the surface while there be a great increase in the durability when the bearing of a engine be make too small they very soon wear out 54 _ q _ -- do friction increase in the same ratio as velocity _ a _ -- no friction do not increase with the velocity at all if the friction over a give amount of surface be consider but it increase as the velocity if the comparison be make with the time during which the friction act thus the friction of each stroke of a piston be the same whether it make 20 stroke in the minute or 40 : in the latter case however there be twice the number of stroke make so that though the friction per stroke be the same the friction per minute be double the friction therefore of any machine per hour vary as the velocity though the friction per revolution remain at all ordinary velocity the same of excessive velocity we have not sufficient experience to enable we to state with confidence whether the same law continue to operate among they 55 _ q _ -- can you give any approximate statement of the force expend in overcome friction _ a _ -- it vary with the nature of the rub body the friction of iron slide upon iron have generally be take at about one tenth of the pressure when the surface be oil and then wipe again so that no film of oil be interpose the friction of iron rubbing upon brass have generally be take at about one eleventh of the pressure under the same circumstance but in machine in actual operation where a film of some lubricating material be interpose between the rub surface it be not more than one third of this amount or 1\/33d of the weight while this however be the average result the friction be a good deal less in some case mr southern in some experiment upon the friction of the axle of a grindstone -- a account of which may be find in the 65th volume of the philosophical transaction -- find the friction to amount to less than 1\/40th of the weight and mr wood in some experiment upon the friction of locomotive axle find that by ample lubrication the friction may be make as little as 1\/60th of the weight in some experiment upon the friction of shaft by mr g rennie he find that with a pressure of from 1 to 5 cwt the friction do not exceed 1\/39th of the pressure when tallow be the unguent employ with soft soap it become 1\/34th the fact appear to be that the amount of the resistance denominate friction depend in a great measure upon the nature of the unguent employ and in certain case the viscidity of the unguent may occasion a greater retardation than the resistance cause by the attrition in watchwork therefore and other fine mechanism it be necessary both to keep the bearing surface small and to employ a thin and limpid oil for the purpose of lubrication for the resistance cause by the viscidity of the unguent increase with the amount of surface and the amount of surface be relatively greater in the smaller class of work 56 _ q _ -- be a very thin unguent preferable also for the larger class of bearing _ a _ -- the nature of the unguent proper for different bearing appear to depend in a great measure upon the amount of the pressure to which the bearing be subject -- the hardest unguent be best where the pressure be greatest the function of lubricating substance be to prevent the rub surface from come into contact whereby abrasion would be produce and unguent be effectual in this respect in the proportion of they viscidity but if the viscidity of the unguent be greater than what suffice to keep the surface asunder a additional resistance will be occasion and the nature of the unguent select should always have reference therefore to the size of the rub surface or to the pressure per square inch upon they with oil the friction appear to be a minimum when the pressure on the surface of a bearing be about 90 lb per square inch the friction from too small a surface increase twice as rapidly as the friction from too large a surface add to which the bearing when the surface be too small wear rapidly away 57 _ q _ -- have not m morin in france make some very complete experiment to determine the friction of surface of different kind slide upon one another _ a _ -- he have but the result do not differ materially from what be state above though upon the whole m morin find the resistance due to friction to be somewhat greater than it have be find to be by various other engineer when the surface be merely wipe with a greasy cloth but have no film of lubricate material interpose the friction of brass upon cast iron he find to be 107 or about 1\/10th of the load which be also the friction of cast iron upon oak but when a film of lubricate material be interpose he find that the friction be the same whether the surface be wood on metal wood on wood metal on wood or metal on metal and the amount of the friction in such case depend chiefly on the nature of the unguent with a mixture of hog 's lard and olive oil interpose between the surface the friction be usually from 1\/12th to 1\/14th of the load but in some case it be only 1\/20th of the load 58 _ q _ -- may water be make to serve for purpose of lubrication _ a _ -- yes water will answer very well if the surface be very large relatively with the pressure and in screw vessel where the propeller shaft pass through a long pipe at the stern the stuffing box be purposely make a little leaky the small leakage of water into the vessel which be thus occasion keep the screw shaft in this situation always wet and this be all the lubrication which this bearing require or obtain 59 _ q _ -- what be the utmost pressure which may be employ without heating when oil be the lubricating material _ a _ -- that will depend upon the velocity when the pressure exceed 800 lb per square inch however upon the section of the bearing in a direction parallel with the axis then the oil will be force out and the bearing will necessarily heat 60 _ q _ -- but with a give velocity can you tell the limit of pressure which will be safe in practice or with a give pressure can you tell the limit of velocity _ a _ -- yes that may be do by the follow empirical rule which have be derive from observation make upon bearing of different size and move with different velocity divide the number 70000 by the velocity of the surface of the bearing in foot per minute the quotient will be the number of pound per square inch of section in the line of the axis that may be put upon the bearing or if we divide 70000 by the number of pound per square inch of section then the quotient will be the velocity in foot per minute at which the circumference of the bearing may work 61 _ q _ -- the number of square inch upon which the pressure be reckon be not the circumference of the bearing multiply by its length but the diameter of the bearing multiply by its length _ a _ -- precisely so it will be the diameter multiply by the length of the bearing 62 _ q _ -- what be the amount of friction in the case of surface slide upon one another in sandy or muddy water -- such surface for example as be to be find in the sluice of valve for water _ a _ -- various experiment have be make by mr summer of southampton to ascertain the friction of brass surface slide upon each other in salt water with the view of find the power require for move sluice door for lock gate and for other similar purpose the surface be plane as true and smooth as the plane machine would make they but be _ not _ file or scrape and the result be as follow : area of slide weight or pressure on power require to move the rub rub surface slide _ slowly _ in muddy surface salt water keep stir up sq in lb lb 8 56 215 112 44 168 655 224 885 336 1405 448 17075 -lrb- illustration : fig 2 sketch of slide the face on which the slide move be similar but three or four time as long -rrb- these result be the average of eight fair trial in each case the slide surface be totally immerse in muddy salt water and although the apparatus use for draw the slide along be not very delicately fit up the power require may be consider as a sufficient approximation for practical purpose it appear from these experiment that rough surface follow the same law as regard friction that be follow by smooth for in each case the friction increase directly as the pressure strength of material and strain subsist in machine 63 _ q _ -- in what way be the strength of the different part of a steam engine determine _ a _ -- by reference to the amount of the strain or pressure to which they be subject and to the cohesive strength of the iron or other material of which they be compose the strain subsist in engine be usually characterize as tensile crush twist breaking and shear strain but they may be all resolve into strain of extension and strain of compression and by the power of the material to resist these two strain will they practical strength be measurable 64 _ q _ -- what be the ultimate strength of the malleable and cast iron brass and other material employ in the construction of engine _ a _ -- the tensile and crush strength of any give material be by no mean the same the tensile strength or strength when extend of good bar iron be about 60000 lb or nearly 27 ton per square inch of section and the tensile strength of cast iron be about 15000 lb or say 63\/4 to 7 ton per square inch of section these be the weight which be require to break they the crush strain of cast iron however be about 100000 lb or 441\/2 ton whereas the crush strength of malleable iron be not more than 27000 lb or 12 ton per square inch of section and indeed it be generally less than this the ultimate tensile strength therefore of malleable iron be four time greater than that of cast iron but the crush strength of cast iron be between three and four time greater than that of work iron it may be state in round number that the tensile strength of malleable iron be twice greater than its crush strength or in other word that it will take twice the strain to break a bar of malleable iron by draw it asunder endway than will cripple it by force it together endway like a pillar whereas a bar of cast iron will be draw asunder with one sixth of the force that will be require to break or cripple it when force together endway like a pillar 65 _ q _ -- what be the cohesive strength of steel _ a _ -- the ultimate tensile strength of good cast or blister steel be about twice as great as that of work iron be about 130000 lb per square inch of section the tensile strength of gun metal such as be use in engine be about 36000 lb per square inch of section of work copper about 33000 lb and of cast copper about 19000 lb per square inch of section 66 _ q _ -- be the crush strength of steel greater or less than its tensile strength _ a _ -- it be about twice greater a good steel punch will punch through a plate of work iron of a thickness equal to the diameter of the punch a punch therefore of a inch diameter will pierce a plate a inch thick now it be well know that the strain require to punch a piece of metal out of a plate be just the same as that require to tear asunder a bar of iron of the same area of cross section as the area of the surface cut the area of the surface cut in this case will be the circumference of the punch 31416 inch multiply by the thickness of the plate 1 inch which make the area of the cut surface 31416 square inch the area of the point of the punch subject to the pressure be 7854 square inch so that the area cut to the area crushed be as four to one in other word it will require four time the strain to crush steel that be require to tear asunder malleable iron or it will take about twice the strain to crush steel that it will require to break it by extension 67 _ q _ -- what strain may be apply to malleable iron in practice _ a _ -- a bar of work iron to which a tensile or compress strain be apply be elongate or contract like a very stiff spiral spring nearly in the proportion of the amount of strain apply up to the limit at which the strength begin to give way and within this limit it will recover its original dimension when the strain be remove if however the strain be carry beyond this limit the bar will not recover its original dimension but will be permanently pull out or push in just as would happen to a spring to which a undue strain have be apply this limit be what be call the limit of elasticity and whenever it be exceed the bar though it may not break immediately will undergo a progressive deterioration and will break in the course of time the limit of elasticity of malleable iron when extend or in other word the tensile strain to which a bar of malleable iron a inch square may be subject without permanently derange its structure be usually take at 17800 lb or from that to 10 ton depend on the quality of the iron it have also be find that malleable iron be extend about one ten-thousandth part of its length for every ton of direct strain apply to it 68 _ q _ -- what be the limit of elasticity of cast iron _ a _ -- it be commonly take at 15300 lb per square inch of section but this be certainly much too high as it exceed the tensile strength of iron of medium quality a bar of cast iron if compress by weight will be contract in length twice as much as a bar of malleable iron under similar circumstance but malleable iron when subject to a greater strain than 12 ton per square inch of section gradually crumple up by the mere continuance of the weight a cast-iron bar one inch square and ten foot long be shorten about one tenth of a inch by a compress force of 10000 lb whereas a malleable iron bar of the same dimension would require to shorten it equally a compress force of 20000 lb as the load however approach 12 ton the compression become nearly equal and above that point the rate of the compression of the malleable iron rapidly increase a bar of cast iron when at its breaking point by the application of a tensile strain be stretch about one six-hundredth part of its length and a equal strain employ to compress it would shorten it about one eight-hundredth part of its length 69 _ q _ -- but to what strain may the iron use in the construction of engine be safely subject _ a _ -- the most of the work part of modern engine be make of malleable iron and the utmost strain to which work iron should be subject in machinery be 4000 lb per square inch of section cast iron should not be subject to more than half of this in locomotive boiler the strain of 4000 lb per square inch of section be sometimes exceed by nearly one half but such a excess of strain approach the limit of danger 70 _ q _ -- will you explain in what way the various strain subsist in a steam engine may be resolve into tensile and crush strain also in what way the magnitude of those strain may be determine _ a _ -- to take the case of a beam subject to a transverse strain such as the great beam of a engine it be clear if we suppose the beam break through the middle that the amount of strain at the upper and lower edge of the beam where the whole strain may be suppose to be collect will with any give pressure on the piston depend upon the proportion of the length to the depth of the beam one edge of the beam break by extension and the other edge by compression and the upper and lower edge may be regard as pillar one of which be extend by the strain and the other be compress if to make a extreme supposition the depth of the beam be take as equal to its length then the pillar answer to the edge of the beam will be compress and extend by what be virtually a bellcrank lever with equal arm the horizontal distance from the main center to the end of the beam be one of the arm and the vertical height from the main center to the top edge of the beam be the other arm the distance therefore pass through by the fractured edge of the beam during a stroke of the engine will be equal to the length of the stroke and the strain it will have to sustain will consequently be equal to the pressure on the piston if its motion be only half that of the piston as would be the case if its depth be make one half less the strain the beam would have to bear would be twice as great and it may be set down as a axiom that the strain upon any part of a steam engine or other machine be inversely equal to the strain produce by the prime mover multiply by the comparative velocity with which the part in question move if any part of a engine move with a less velocity than the piston it will have a greater strain on it if resist than be throw upon the piston if it move with a greater velocity than the piston it will have a less strain upon it and the difference of strain will in every case be in the inverse proportion of the difference of the velocity 71 _ q _ -- then in compute the amount of metal necessary to give due strength to a beam the first point be to determine the velocity with which the edge of the beam move at that point be the strain be greatest _ a _ -- the web of a cast-iron beam or girder serve merely to connect the upper and lower edge or flange rigidly together so as to enable the extend and compress strain to be counteract in a effectual manner by the metal of those flange it be only necessary therefore to make the flange of sufficient strength to resist effectually the crush and tensile strain to which they be expose and to make the web of the beam of sufficient strength to prevent a distortion of its shape from take place 72 _ q _ -- be the strain greater from be movable or intermittent than if it be stationary _ a _ -- yes it be nearly twice as great from be movable engineer be in the habit of make girder intend to sustain a stationary load about three time stronger than the break weight but if the load be a movable one as be the case in the girder of railway bridge they make the strength equal to six time the breaking weight 73 _ q _ -- then the strain be increase by the suddenness with which it be apply _ a _ -- if a weight be place on a long and slender beam prop up in the middle and the prop be suddenly withdraw so as to allow deflection to take place it be clear that the deflection must be greater than if the load have be gradually apply the momentum of the weight and also of the beam itself fall through the space through which it have be deflect have necessarily to be counteract by the elasticity of the beam and the beam will therefore be momentarily bent to a greater extent than what be due to the load and after a few vibration up and down it will finally settle at that point of deflection which the load properly occasion it be obvious that a beam must be strong enough not merely to sustain the pressure due to the load but also that accession of pressure due to the counteract momentum of the weight and of the beam itself although in steam engine the beam be not load by a weight but by the pressure of the steam yet the momentum of the beam itself must in every case be counteract and the momentum will be considerable in every case in which a large and rapid deflection take place a rapid deflection increase the amount of the deflection as well as the amount of the strain as be see in the cylinder cover of a cornish pump engine into which the steam be suddenly admit and in which the momentum of the particle of the metal put into motion increase the deflection to a extent such as the mere pressure of the steam could not produce 74 _ q _ -- what will be the amount of increase strain consequent upon deflection _ a _ -- the momentum of any move body be proportional to the square of its velocity it follow that the strain will be proportional to the square of the amount of deflection produce in a specify time 75 _ q _ -- but will not the inertia of a beam resist deflection as well as the momentum increase deflection _ a _ -- no doubt that will be so but whether in practical case increase of mass without reference to strength or load will upon the whole increase or diminish deflection will depend very much upon the magnitude of the mass relatively with the magnitude of the deflect pressure and the rapidity with which that pressure be apply and remove thus if a force or weight be very suddenly apply to the middle of a ponderous beam and be as suddenly withdraw the inertia of the beam will as in the case of the collision of body tend to resist the force and thus obviate deflection to a considerable extent but if the pressure be so long continue as to produce the amount of deflection due to the pressure the effect of the inertia in that case will be to increase the deflection 76 _ q _ -- will the pressure give to the beam of a engine in different direction facilitate its fracture _ a _ -- iron beam bent alternately in opposite direction or alternately deflect and release will be break in the course of time with a much less strain than be necessary to produce immediate fracture it have be find experimentally that a cast-iron bar deflect by a revolving cam to only half the extent due to its break weight will in no case withstand 900 successive deflection but if bent by the cam to only one third of its ultimate deflection it will withstand 100000 deflection without visible injury look however to the jolt and vibration to which engine be subject and the sudden strain sometimes throw upon they either from water get into the cylinder or otherwise it do not appear that a strength answering to six time the breaking weight will give sufficient margin for safety in the case of cast-iron beam 77 _ q _ -- do the same law hold in the case of the deflection of malleable iron bar _ a _ -- in the case of malleable iron bar it have be find that no very perceptible damage be cause by 10000 deflection each deflection be such as be due to half the load that produce a large permanent deflection 78 _ q _ -- the power of a rod or pillar to resist compression become very little when the diameter be small and the length great _ a _ -- the power of a rod or pillar to resist compression vary nearly as the fourth power of the diameter divide by the square of the length in the case of hollow cylindrical column of cast iron it have be find experimentally that the 355th power of the internal diameter subtract from the 355th power of the external diameter and divide by the 17th power of the length will represent the strength very nearly in the case of hollow cylindrical column of malleable iron experiment show that the 359th power of the internal diameter subtract from the 359th power of the external diameter and divide by the square of the length give a proper expression for the strength but this rule only hold where the strain do not exceed 8 or 9 ton on the square inch of section beyond 12 or 13 ton per square inch of section the metal can not be depend upon to withstand the strain though hollow pillar will sometimes bear 15 or 16 ton per square inch of section 79 _ q _ -- do not the thickness of the metal of the pillar or tube affect the question _ a _ -- it manifestly do for a tube of very thin metal such as gold leaf or tin foil would not stand on end at all be crush down by its own weight it be find experimentally that in malleable iron tube of the respective thickness of 525 272 and 124 inch the resistance per square inch of section be 1917 1447 and 747 ton respectively the power of plate to resist compression vary nearly as the cube or more nearly as the 2878th power of they thickness but this law only hold so long as the pressure apply do not exceed from 9 to 12 ton per square inch of section when the pressure be greater than this the metal be crushed and a new law supervene accord to which it be necessary to employ plate of twice or three time the thickness to obtain twice the resist power 80 _ q _ -- in a rivet tube will the riveting be much damage by heavy strain _ a _ -- it will be most affect by percussion long-continued impact on the side of a tube produce a deflection of only one fifth of that which would be require to injure it by pressure be find to be destructive of the riveting but in large rivet structure such as a ship or a railway bridge the inertia of the mass will by resist the effect of impact prevent any injurious action from this cause from take place 81 _ q _ -- will the power of iron to resist shock be in all case proportional to its power to resist strain _ a _ -- by no mean some cast iron be very hard and brittle and although it will in this state resist compression very strongly it will be easily break by a blow iron which have be remelt many time generally fall into this category as it will also do if run into very small casting it have be find by experiment that iron of which the crush weight per square inch be about 42 ton will if remelt twelve time bear a crush weight of 70 ton and if remelt eighteen time it will bear a crush weight of 83 ton but take its power to resist impact in its first state at 706 this power will be raise at the twelfth remelt to 1153 and will be sink at the eighteenth remelting to 149 82 _ q _ -- from all this it appear that a combination of cast iron and malleable iron be the best for the beam of engine _ a _ -- yes and for all beam engine beam should be make deeper at the middle than they be now make the web should be lighten by hole pierce in it and round the edge of the beam there should be a malleable iron hoop or strap securely attach to the flange by riveting or otherwise the flange at the edge of engine beam be invariably make too small it be in they that the strength of the beam chiefly reside chapter i general description of the steam engine \* \* \* \* \* the boiler 83 _ q _ -- what be the chief variety of the steam engine in actual practical use _ a _ -- there be first the single-acting engine which be use for pump water the rotative land engine which be employ to drive mill and manufactory the rotative marine engine which be use to propel steam vessel and the locomotive engine which be employ on railway the last be always a high-pressure engine the other be for the most part condense engine 84 _ q _ -- will you explain the construction and action of the single-acting engine use for drain mine _ a _ -- permit I then to begin with the boiler which be common and necessary to all engine and i will take the example of a wagon boiler such as be employ by boulton and watt universally in they early engine and which be still in extensive use this boiler be a long rectangular vessel with a round top like that of a carrier 's wagon from its resemblance to which it derive its name a fire be set beneath it and flue construct of brickwork encircle it so as to keep the flame and smoke in contact with the boiler for a sufficient time to absorb the heat -lrb- illustration : fig 3 -rrb- 85 _ q _ -- this species of boiler have not a internal furnace but be set in brickwork in which the furnace be form _ a _ -- precisely so the general arrangement and configuration will be at once understand by a reference to the annexed figure -lrb- fig 3 -rrb- which be a transverse section of a wagon boiler the line b represent the top of the grate or fire bar which slope downward from the front at a angle of about 25  give the fuel a tendency to move toward the back of the grate the supply of air ascend from the ash pit through the grate bar and the flame pass over a low wall or bridge and traverse the bottom of the boiler the smoke rise up at the back of the boiler and proceed through the flue f along one side to the front and return along the other side of the boiler and then ascend the chimney the performance of this course by the smoke be what be term a wheel draught as the smoke wheel once round the boiler and then ascend the chimney 86 _ q _ -- be the performance of this course by the smoke universal in wagon boiler _ a _ -- no such boiler sometimes have what be term a split draught the smoke and flame when they reach the end of the boiler pass in this case through a iron flue or tube reach from end to end of the boiler and on arrive at the front of the boiler the smoke split or separate -- one half pass through a flue on the one side of the boiler and the other half pass through a flue on the other side of the boiler -- both of these flue have they debouch in the chimney 87 _ q _ -- what be the appliance usually connect with a wagon boiler _ a _ -- on the top of the boiler near the front be a short cylinder with a lid secure by bolt this be the manhole door the purpose of which be to enable a man to get into the inside of the boiler when necessary for inspection and repair on the top of this door be a small valve opening downward call the atmospheric valve the intention of this valve be to prevent a vacuum from be form accidentally in the boiler which might collapse it for if the pressure in the boiler subside to a point materially below the pressure of the atmosphere the valve will open and allow air to get in a bent pipe which rise up from the top of the boiler immediately behind the position of the manhole be the steam pipe for conduct the steam to the engine and a bent pipe which ascend from the top of the boiler at the back end be the waste-steam pipe for conduct away the steam which escape through the safety valve this valve be set in a chest standing on the top of the boiler at the foot of the waste-steam pipe and it be load with iron or leaden weight to a point answerable to the intended pressure of the steam 88 _ q _ -- how be the proper level of the water in the boiler maintain _ a _ -- by means of a balanced buoy or float this float be attach to a rod which in its turn be attach to a lever set on the top of a large upright pipe the upper part of the pipe be widen out into a small cistern through a short pipe in the middle of which a chain pass to the damper but any water empty into this small cistern can not pass into the pipe except through a small valve fix to the lever to which the rod be attach the water for replenish the boiler be pump into the small cistern on the top of the pipe and it follow from these arrangement that when the buoy fall the rod open the small valve and allow the feed water to enter the pipe which communicate with the water in the boiler whereas when the buoy rise the feed can not enter the pipe and it have therefore to run to waste through a overflow pipe provide for the purpose 89 _ q _ -- how be the strength of the fire regulate _ a _ -- the draught through the furnace of land boiler be regulate by a plate of metal or a damper as it be call which slide like a sluice up and down in the flue and this damper be close more or less when the intensity of the fire have to be moderate in wagon boiler this be generally accomplish by self-acting mechanism in the small cistern pipe which be call a stand pipe the water rise up to a height proportional to the pressure of the steam and the surface of the water in this pipe will rise or fall with the fluctuation in the pressure of the steam in this pipe a float be place which communicate by means of a chain with the damper if the pressure of the steam rise the float will be raise and the damper close whereas if the pressure in the boiler fall the reverse of this action will take place -lrb- illustration : fig 4 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 5 -rrb- 90 _ q _ -- be all land boiler of the same construction as that which you have just describe _ a _ -- no many land boiler be now make of a cylindrical form with one or two internal flue in which the furnace be place a boiler of this kind be represent in fig 4 and 5 and which be the species of boiler principally use in cornwall in this boiler a large internal cylinder or flue run from end to end in the fore part of this cylinder the furnace be place and behind the furnace a large tube fill with water extend to the end of the boiler this internal tube be connect to the bottom part of the boiler by a copper pipe standing vertically immediately behind the furnace bridge and to the top part of the boiler by a bent copper pipe which stand in a vertical position near the end of the boiler the smoke after pass through the central flue circulate round the side and beneath the bottom of the boiler before its final escape into the chimney the boiler be carefully cover over to prevent the dispersion of the heat -lrb- illustration : fig 6 -rrb- 91 _ q _ -- will you describe the construction of the boiler use in steam vessel _ a _ -- these be of two class flue boiler and tubular boiler but the latter be now most use in the flue boiler the furnace be set within the boiler and the flue proceed from they wind backwards and forwards within the boiler until finally they meet and enter the chimney fig 6 7 and 8 be different view of the flue boiler of the steamer forth there be 4 boiler -lrb- as show in plan fig 6 -rrb- with 3 furnace in each or 12 furnace in all fig 7 be a elevation of 2 boiler the one to the right be the front view and that to the leave a transverse section fig 8 be a longitudinal section through 2 boiler the direction of the arrow in plan and longitudinal section will explain the direction of the smoke current -lrb- illustration : fig 7 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 8 -rrb- 92 _ q _ -- be this arrangement different from that obtain in tubular boiler _ a _ -- in tubular boiler the smoke after leave the furnace just pass once through a number of small tube and then enter the chimney these tube be sometimes of brass and they be usually about 3 inch in diameter and 6 or 7 foot long -lrb- illustration : fig 9 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 10 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 11 -rrb- fig 9 10 and 11 represent a marine tubular boiler fig 9 be a vertical longitudinal section fig 10 half a front elevation and half a transverse section and fig 11 half a back elevation and half a transverse section near the end there be a project part on the top of the boiler call the steam chest of which the purpose be to retain for the use of the cylinder a certain supply of steam in a quiescent state in order that it may have time to clear itself of foam or spray a steam chest be a usual part of all marine boiler in fig 9 a be the furnace b the steam chest and c the smoke box which open into the chimney the front of the smoke box be usually close by door which may be open when necessary to sweep the soot out of the tube the following be some form of american boiler : fig 12 and 13 be the transverse and longitudinal section of a common form of american marine boiler fig 14 and 15 be the front and sectional elevation of one of the boiler of the we steamer water witch -lrb- illustration

purpose the lowest range of tube be generally omit and the smoke make a last return beneath the bottom of the boiler fig 17 and 18 be the transverse and longitudinal section of a tubular boiler build in 1837 by rl steven for the steamboat independence -lrb- illustration : fig 16 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 17 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 18 -rrb- fig 19 be a longitudinal section of a common wood-burning locomotive -lrb- illustration : fig 19 -rrb- the engine 93 _ q _ -- the steam pass from the boiler through the steam pipe into the cylinder of the engine _ a _ -- and press up and down the piston alternately be admit alternately above and below the piston by suitable valve provide for that purpose 94 _ q _ -- this reciprocate motion be all that be require in a pump engine _ a _ -- the prevailing form of the pump engine consist of a great beam vibrate on a center like the beam of a pair of scale and the cylinder be in connection with one end of the beam and the pump stand at the other end the pump end of the beam be usually load so as to cause it to preponderate when the engine be at rest and the whole effort of the steam be employ in overcome this preponderance until a stroke be perform when the steam be shut off the heavy end of the beam again fall and the operation be repeat 95 _ q _ -- in the double-acting engine the piston be push by the steam both way whereas in the single-acting engine it be only push one way _ a _ -- the structure and action of a double-acting land engine of the kind introduce by mr watt will be understand by a reference to the annexed figure -lrb- fig 20 -rrb- where a engine of this kind be show in section a be the cylinder in which a movable piston t be force alternately up and down by the alternate admission to each side of the steam from the boiler the piston by means of a rod call the piston rod give motion to the beam v w which by means of a heavy bar p call the connect rod move the crank q and with it the fly wheel x from which the machinery to be drive derive its motion 96 _ q _ -- where do the steam enter from the boiler -lrb- illustration : fig 20 -rrb- _ a _ -- at the steam pipe b the throttle valve in that pipe be a elliptical plate of metal swivel on a spindle pass through its edge from side to side and by turn which more or less the opening through the pipe will be more or less close the extent to which this valve be open or close be determine by the governor d the ball of which as they collapse or expand move up or down a collar on the governor spindle which motion be communicate to the throttle valve by suitable rod and bell-crank the governor it will be see consist substantially of two heavy ball attach to arm fix upon a upright shaft which be keep in revolution by means of a cord drive by a pulley on the fly wheel shaft the velocity with which the ball of the governor revolve be proportional to that of the fly wheel it will follow that if by reason of too rapid a supply of steam a undue speed be give to the fly wheel and therefore to the ball a divergence of the ball will take place to a extent correspond to the excess of velocity and this movement be communicate to the throttle valve it will be partly close -lrb- see fig 1 -rrb- the supply of steam to the engine will be diminish and the velocity of its motion will be reduce if on the other hand the motion of the engine be slower than be requisite owe to a deficient supply of steam through b then the ball not be sufficiently affect by centrifugal force will fall towards the vertical spindle and the throttle valve c will be more fully open whereby a more ample supply of steam will be admit to the cylinder and the speed of the engine will be increase to the requisite extent 97 _ q _ -- the piston must be make to fit the cylinder accurately so as to prevent the passage of steam _ a _ -- the piston be accurately fit to the cylinder and make to move in it steam tight by a packing of hemp drive tightly into a groove or recess round the edge of the piston and which be squeeze down by a iron ring hold by screw the piston divide the cylinder into two compartment between which there be no communication by which steam or any other elastic fluid can pass a casing set beside the cylinder contain the valve by means of which the steam which impel the piston be admit and withdraw as the piston commence its motion in each direction the upper steam box b be divide into three compartment by two valve above the upper steam valve v be a compartment communicate with the steam pipe b below the lower valve e be another compartment communicate with a pipe call the eduction pipe which lead downward from the cylinder to the condenser in which vessel the steam be condensed by a jet of cold water by the valve v a communication may be open or close between the boiler and the top of the cylinder so as to permit or prevent a supply of steam from the one to pass to the other by the valve e a communication may be open or closed between the top of the cylinder and the condenser so that the steam in the top compartment of the cylinder may either be permit to escape into the condenser or may be confine to the cylinder the continuation of the steam pipe lead to the lower steam box b ' which like the upper be divide into three compartment by two valve v ' and e ' and the action of the lower valve be in all respects the same as that of the upper 98 _ q _ -- be all these valve connect together so that they act simultaneously _ a _ -- the four valve v e v ' e ' be connect by rod to a single handle h which handle be move alternately up and down by means of pin or tappet place on the rod which work the air pump when the handle h be press down the lever in connexion with it open the upper exhausting valve e and the lower steam valve v ' and close the upper steam valve v and the lower exhausting valve e ' on the other hand when the handle h be press up it open the upper steam valve v and the lower exhausting valve e ' and at the same time close the upper exhausting valve e and the lower steam valve v ' 99 _ q _ -- where be the condenser situate _ a _ -- the condenser k be immerge in a cistern of cold water at its side there be a tube i for the admission of water to condense the steam and which be govern by a cock by open which to any require extent a jet of cold water may be make to play in the condenser from the bottom of the condenser a short pipe lead to the air pump j and in this pipe there be a flap valve call the foot valve open towards the air pump the air pump be a pump set in the same cistern of cold water that hold the condenser and it be fit with a piston or bucket work by the rod l attach to the great beam and fit with a valve opening upward in the manner of a common sucking pump the upper part of the air pump communicate with a small cistern s call the hot well through a valve opening outwards and call the delivery valve a pump m call the hot water pump lift hot water out of the hot well to feed the boiler and another pump n lift cold water from a well or other source of supply to maintain the supply of water to the cold water cistern in which the condenser and air pump be place 100 q -- will you explain now the manner in which the engine act a -- the piston be suppose to be at the top of the cylinder the handle h will be raise by the lower pin or tappet on the air pump rod and the valve v and e ' will be open and at the same time the other pair of valve v ' and e will be close steam will therefore be admit above the piston and the steam or air which have previously fill the cylinder below the piston will be draw off to the condenser it will there encounter the jet of cold water which be keep constantly play there by keep the cock i sufficiently open it will thus be immediately condensed or reduce to water and the cylinder below the piston will have a vacuum in it the steam therefore admit from the steam pipe through the open valve v to the top of the cylinder not be resist by pressure below will press the piston to the bottom of the cylinder as it approach that position the handle h will be strike down by the upper pin or tappet on the air pump rod and the valve v and e ' previously open will be close while the valve v ' and e previously close will be open the steam which have just press down the piston and which now fill the cylinder above the piston will then flow off through the open valve e to the condenser where it will be immediately condensed by the jet of cold water and steam from the boiler admit through the open valve v ' will fill the cylinder below the piston and press the piston upward when the piston have reach the top of the cylinder the lower pin on the air pump rod will have strike the handle upward and will thereby have close the valve v ' and e and open the valve v and e ' the piston will then be in the same situation as in the commencement and will again descend and so will continue to be drive up and down by the steam 101 q -- but what become of the cold water which be let into the condenser to condense the steam a -- it be pump out by the air pump in the shape of hot water its temperature have be raise considerably by the admixture of the steam in it when the air pump piston ascend it leave behind it a vacuum and the foot valve be relieve from all pressure the weight of the water in the condenser force it open and the warm water flow from the condenser into the lower part of the air pump from which its return to the condenser be prevent by the intervene valve when the air pump piston descend its pressure on the liquid under it will force open the valve in it through which the hot water will ascend and when the bucket descend to the bottom of the pump barrel the warm water which be below it will all have pass above it and can not return when the bucket next ascend the water above it not be able to return through the bucket valve will be force into the hot well through the delivery valve s the hot water pump m pump a small quantity of this hot water into the boiler to compensate for the abstraction of the water that have pass off in the form of steam the residue of the hot water run to waste 102 _ q _ -- by what expedient be the piston rod enable to pass through the cylinder cover without leak steam out of the cylinder or air into it _ a _ -- the hole in the cylinder lid through which the piston rod pass be furnish with a recess call a stuffing box into which a stuffing or packing of plaited hemp be force which press on the one side against the interior of the stuffing box and on the other side against the piston rod which be smooth and polished prevent any leakage in this situation the packing of this stuffing box be force down by a ring of metal tighten by screw this ring which accurately fit the piston rod have a project flange through which bolt pass for tighten the ring down upon the packing and a similar expedient be employ in nearly every case in which packing be employ 103 _ q _ -- in what way be the piston rod connect to the great beam _ a _ -- the piston rod be connect to the great beam by means of two link one at each side of the beam show at _ f g _ -lrb- fig 21 -rrb- these link be usually make of the same length as the crank and they purpose be to enable the end of the great beam to move in the arc of a circle while the piston rod maintain the vertical position the point of junction therefore of the link and the piston rod be of the form of a knuckle or bend at some part of the stroke 104 _ q _ -- but what compel the top of the piston rod to maintain the vertical position _ a _ -- some engine have guide rod set on each side of the piston rod and eye on the top of the piston rod engage these guide rod and maintain the piston rod in a vertical position in every part of the stroke more commonly however the desire end be attain by means of a contrivance call the parallel motion 105 _ q _ -- what be the parallel motion _ a _ -- the parallel motion be a arrangement of jointed rod so connect together that the divergence from the vertical line at any point in the arc describe by the beam be correct by a equal and opposite divergence due to the arc perform by the jointed rod during the stroke and as these opposite deviation mutually correct one another the result be that the piston rod move in a vertical direction 106 _ q _ -- will you explain the action more in detail _ a _ -- the pin fig 21 which pass through the end of the beam at _ f _ have a link _ f g _ hang on each side of the beam and a short cross bar call a cross head extend from the bottom of one of these link to the bottom of the other which cross head be perforated with a hole in the middle for the reception of the piston rod there be similar link _ b d _ at the point of the main beam where the air pump rod be attach there be two rod _ d g _ connect the link _ b d _ with the link _ f g _ and these rod as they always continue parallel to the main beam throughout the stroke be call _ parallel bar _ attach to the end of these two rod at _ d _ be two other rod _ c d _ of which the end at _ c _ be attach to stationary pin while the end at _ d _ follow the motion of the lower end of the link _ b d _ these rod be call the _ radius bar _ now it be obvious that the arc describe by the point _ d _ with _ c _ as a center be opposite to the arc describe by the point _ g _ with _ d _ as a center the rod _ d g _ be therefore draw back horizontally by the arc describe at _ d _ to a extent equal to the verse sine of the arc describe at _ g _ or in other word the line describe by the point _ g _ become a straight line instead of a curve -lrb- illustration : fig 21 -rrb- 107 _ q _ -- do the air pump rod move vertically as well as the piston rod _ a _ -- it do the air pump rod be suspend from a cross head pass from the center of one of the link _ b d _ to the center of the other link on the opposite side of the beam now as the distance from the central axis of the great beam to the point _ b _ be equal to the length of the rod _ c d _ it will follow that the upper end of the link will follow one arc and the lower end a equal and opposite arc a point in the center of the link therefore where these opposite motion meet will follow no arc at all but will move up and down vertically in a straight line 108 _ q _ -- the use of the crank be to obtain a circular motion from a reciprocate motion _ a _ -- that be the object of it and it accomplish its object in a very perfect manner as it gradually arrest the velocity of the piston towards the end of the stroke and thus obviate what would otherwise be a injurious shock upon the machine when the crank approach the lowest part of its throw and at the same time the piston be approach the top of the cylinder the motion of the crank become nearly horizontal or in other word the piston be only advance through a very short distance for any give distance measure on the circle describe by the crank pin since then the velocity of rotation of the crank be nearly uniform it will follow that the piston will move very slowly as it approach the end of the stroke and the piston be bring to a state of rest by this gradually retard motion both at the top and the bottom of the stroke 109 _ q _ -- what cause the crank to revolve at a uniform velocity _ a _ -- the momentum of the machinery move by the piston but more especially of the fly wheel which by its operation redress the unequal pressure communicate by the crank and compel the crank shaft to revolve at a nearly uniform velocity everyone know that a heavy wheel if put into rapid rotation can not be immediately stop at the beginning and end of the stroke when the crank be vertical no force of torsion can be exert on the crank shaft by the crank but this force be at its maximum when the crank be horizontal from the vertical point where this force be nothing to the horizontal point where it be at its maximum the force of torsion exert on the crank shaft be constantly vary and the fly wheel by its momentum redress these irregularity and carry the crank through that dead point as it be term where the piston can not impart any rotative force 110 _ q _ -- be the configuration and structure of the steam engine as it leave the hand of watt materially different from those of modern engine _ a _ -- there be not much difference in modern rotative land engine the valve for admit the steam to the cylinder or condenser instead of be clack or pot-lid valve move by tappet on the air pump rod be usually sluice or slide valve move by a eccentric wheel on the crank shaft sometimes the beam be discard altogether and malleable iron be more largely use in the construction of engine instead of the cast iron which formerly so largely prevail but upon the whole the steam engine of the present day be substantially the engine of watt and he who perfectly understand the operation of watt 's engine will have no difficulty in understand the operation of any of the numerous variety of engine since introduce the marine engine 111 _ q _ -- will you describe the principal feature of the kind of steam engine employ for the propulsion of vessel _ a _ -- marine engine be of two kind -- paddle engine and screw engine in the one case the propel instrument be paddle wheel keep in rotation at each side of the ship : in the other case the propel instrument be a screw consist of two or more twisted vane revolve beneath the water at the stern of each class of engine there be many distinct variety 112 _ q _ -- what be the principal variety of the paddle engine -lrb- illustration : fig 22 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 23 -rrb- _ a _ -- there be the side lever engine -lrb- fig 26 -rrb- and the oscillate engine -lrb- fig 27 -rrb- besides numerous other form of engine which be less known or employ such as the trunk -lrb- fig 22 -rrb- double cylinder -lrb- fig 23 -rrb- annular gorgon -lrb- fig 24 -rrb- steeple -lrb- fig 25 -rrb- and many other the side lever engine however and the oscillate engine be the only kind of paddle engine which have be receive with wide or general favor -lrb- illustration : fig 24 -rrb- 113 _ q _ -- will you explain the main distinctive feature of the side lever engine _ a _ -- in all paddle vessel whatever be they subordinate characteristic a great shaft of work iron s turn round by the engine have to be carry from side to side of the vessel on which shaft be fix the paddle wheel the paddle wheel may either be form with fix float board for engage the water like the board of a common undershot water wheel or they may be form with _ feather _ float board as they be term which be float board movable on a center and so govern by appropriate mechanism that they enter and leave the water in a nearly vertical position the common fix or radial float however be the kind most widely employ and they be attach to the arm of two or more ring of malleable iron which be fix by appropriate centre on the paddle shaft it be usual in steam vessel to employ two engine the crank of which be set at right angle with one another when the paddle wheel be turn by the engine the float board engage the water cause a forward thrust to be impart to the shaft which propel forward the vessel on the same principle that a boat be propel by the action of oar -lrb- illustration : fig 25 -rrb- 114 _ q _ -- these remark apply to all paddle vessel _ a _ -- they do with respect to the side lever engine it may be describe to be such a modification of the land beam engine already describe as will enable it to be get below the deck of a vessel with this view instead of a single beam be place overhead two beam be use one of which be set on each side of the engine as low down as possible the cross head which engage the piston rod be make somewhat longer than the diameter of the cylinder and two great link or rod proceed one from each end of the cross head to one of the side lever or beam a similar cross bar at the other end of the beam serve to connect they together and to the connect rod which proceed from thence upward engage the crank and thereby turn round the paddle wheel 115 _ q _ -- will you further illustrate this general description by a example -lrb- illustration : fig 26 -rrb- _ q _ -- fig 26 be a side elevation of a side lever engine x x represent the beam or keelson to which the engine be attach and on which the boiler rest the engine be tie down by strong bolt pass through the bottom of the vessel but the boiler keep its position by its weight alone the condenser and air pump be work off the side lever by means of side rod and a cross head a strong gudgeon call the _ main center _ pass through the condenser at k the project end of which serve to support the side lever or beam l be the piston rod which by means of the cross head and side rod be connect to the side lever or beam one of which be show at h h the line m represent the connect rod to which motion be impart by the beam through the medium of the cross tail extend between the beam and which by means of the crank turn the paddle shaft s the eccentric which work the slide valve be place upon the paddle shaft it consist of a disc of metal encircle by a hoop to which a rod be attach and the disc be perforated with a hole for the shaft not in the center but near one edge when therefore the shaft revolve carry the eccentric with it the rod attach to the encircle hoop receive a reciprocate motion just as it would do if attach to a crank in the shaft 116 _ q _ -- will you describe the mode of start the engine _ a _ -- i may first mention that when the engine be at rest the connection between the eccentric and the slide valve be break by lift the end of the eccentric rod out of a notch which engage a pin on the valve shaft and the valve be at such time free to be move by hand by a bar of iron apply to a proper part of the valve gear for that purpose this be so the engineer when he wish to start the engine first open a small valve call the _ blow through valve _ which permit steam from the boiler to enter the engine both above and below the piston and also to fill the condenser and air pump this steam expel the air from the interior of the engine and also any water which may have accumulate there and when this have be do the blow through valve be shut and a vacuum very soon form within the engine by the condensation of the steam if now the slide valve be move by hand the steam from the boiler will be admit on one side of the piston while there be a vacuum on the other side and the piston will therefore be move in the desire direction when the piston reach the end of the stroke the valve have to be move in the reverse direction when the piston will return and after be move thus by hand once or twice the connection of the valve with the eccentric be to be restore by allow the notch on the end of the eccentric rod to engage the pin on the valve lever when the valve will be thereafter move by the engine in the proper manner it will of course be necessary when the engine begin to move to open the injection cock a little to enable water to enter for the condensation of the steam in the most recent marine engine a somewhat different mechanism from this be use for give motion to the valve but that mechanism will be afterwards describe 117 _ q _ -- be all marine engine condense engine _ a _ -- nearly all of they be so but recently a number of gunboat have be construct with high pressure engine in general however marine engine be low pressure or condense engine 118 _ q _ -- will you now describe the chief feature of the oscillate paddle marine engine _ a _ -- in the oscillate paddle marine engine the arrangement of the paddle shaft and paddle wheel be the same as in the case already describe but the whole of the side lever side rod cross head cross tail and connect rod be discard the cylinder be set immediately under the crank the top of the piston rod be connect immediately to the crank pin and to enable the piston rod to accommodate itself to the movement of the crank the cylinder be so construct as to be susceptible of vibrate or oscillate upon two external axis or trunnion these trunnion be generally place about half way up on the side of the cylinder and through one of they steam be receive from the boiler while through the other the steam escape to the condenser the air pump be usually work by means of a crank in the shaft which crank move the air pump bucket up and down as the shaft revolve 119 _ q _ -- will you give a example of a paddle oscillate engine _ a _ -- i will take as a example the oscillate engine construct by messr ravenhill & salk for the holyhead packet fig 27 be a longitudinal section of this vessel show a engine and boiler and fig 28 be a transverse section of one of the engine show also one of the wheel there be two cylinder in this vessel and one air pump which lie in a inclined position and be work by a crank in the shaft which stretch between the cylinder and which be call the _ intermediate shaft _ a a be one of the cylinder b b the piston rod and c c the crank d be the crank in the intermediate shaft which work the air pump e there be double eccentric fix on the shaft whereby the movement of the slide valve be regulate the purpose of the double eccentric be to enable a improved arrangement of valve gear to be employ which be denominate the _ link motion _ and which will be describe hereafter i i be the steam pipe lead to the steam trunnion k k on which and on the eduction trunnion connect with the pipe m the cylinder oscillate 120 _ q _ -- by what species of mechanism be the position of the paddle float of feather wheel govern _ a _ -- the float be support by spur project from the rim of the wheel and they may be move upon the point of the spur to which they be attach by pin by means of short lever proceed from the back of the float and connect to rod which proceed towards the center of the wheel the center however to which these rod proceed be not concentric with the wheel and the rod therefore be move in and out as the wheel revolve and impart a corresponding motion to the float in some feather wheel the proper motion be give to the rod by means of a eccentric on the ship 's side the action of paddle wheel whether radial or feathering will be more fully describe in the chapter on steam navigation screw engine 121 _ q _ -- what be the principal variety of screw engine -lrb- illustration : fig 27 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 28 -rrb- _ a _ -- the engine employ for the propulsion of screw vessel be divide into two great class -- gear engine and direct act engine and each of these class again have many variety in screw vessel the shaft on which the screw be set require to revolve at a much greater velocity than be require in the case of the paddle shaft of a paddle vessel and in gear engine this necessary velocity of rotation be obtain by the intervention of toothed wheel -- the engine themselves move with the usual velocity of paddle engine whereas in direct act engine the require velocity of rotation be obtain by accelerate the speed of the engine and which be connect immediately to the screw shaft 122 _ q _ -- will you describe some of the principal variety of gear engine _ a _ -- a good many of the gear engine for screw vessel be make in the same manner as land engine with a beam overhead which by means of a connect rod extend downward give motion to the crank shaft on which be set the cog wheel which give motion to pinion on the screw shaft -- the tooth of the wheel be generally of wood and the tooth of the pinion of iron there be usually several wheel on the crank shaft and several pinion on the screw shaft but the tooth of each do not run in the same line but be set a little in advance of one another so as to divide the thickness of the tooth into as many part as there be independent wheel or pinion by this arrangement the wheel work more smoothly than they would otherwise do 123 _ q _ -- what other form be there of gear screw engine _ a _ -- in some case the cylinder lie on they side in the manner of the cylinder of a locomotive engine in other case vertical trunk engine be employ and in other case vertical oscillate engine 124 _ q _ -- will you give a example of a gear vertical oscillate engine _ a _ -- the engine of a gear oscillate engine be similar to the paddle wheel engine -lrb- fig 27 and 28 -rrb- but the engine be place lengthway of the ship and instead of a paddle wheel on the main shaft there be a gear wheel which connect with a pinion on the screw shaft the engine of the great britain be make off the same pattern as the paddle engine construct by messr john penn & son for hm sphinx the diameter of each cylinder be 82-1\/2 inch the length of travel or stroke of the piston be 6 foot and the nominal power be 500 horse the great britain be of 3500 ton burden and she displacement at 16 foot draught of water be 2970 ton the diameter of the screw be 15-1\/2 foot length of screw in the line of the shaft 3 foot 2 inch and the pitch of the screw 19 foot 125 _ q _ -- what do you mean by the pitch of the screw _ a _ -- a screw propeller may be suppose to be a short piece cut off a screw of large diameter like a spiral stair and the pitch of a spiral stair be the vertical height from any given step to the step immediately overhead 126 _ q _ -- what be the usual number of arm _ a _ -- generally a screw have two arm but sometimes it have three or more the great britain have three arm or twisted blade resemble the vane of a windmill the multiple of the gear in the great britain be 3 to 1 and there be 17-1\/2 square foot of heating surface in the boiler for each nominal horse power the crank shaft be put into motion by the engine carry round with it the great cog wheel or aggregation of cog wheel affix to its extremity and these wheel act on suitable pinion on the screw shaft cause the screw to make three revolution for every revolution make by the engine 127 _ q _ -- what be the principal variety of direct act screw engine _ a _ -- in some case four engine have be employ instead of two and the cylinder have be lay on they side on each side of the screw shaft this multiplication of engine however introduce needless complication and be now but little use in other case two inverted cylinder be set above the screw shaft on appropriate frame and connect rod attach to the end of the piston rod turn round crank in the screw shaft 128 _ q _ -- what be the kind of direct act screw engine employ by messr penn _ a _ -- it be a horizontal trunk engine in this engine a round pipe call a trunk penetrate the piston to which it be fix be in fact cast in one piece with it and the trunk also penetrate the top and bottom of the cylinder through which it move and be make tight therein by means of stuff box the connect rod be attach at one end to a pin fix in the middle of the trunk while the other end engage the crank in the usual manner the air pump be set within the condenser and be work by a rod which be fix to the piston and derive its motion therefrom the air pump be of that species which be call double-act the piston or bucket be form without valve in it but a inlet and outlet valve be fix to each end of the pump through the one of which the water be draw into the pump barrel and through the other of which it be expel into the hot well the locomotive engine 129 _ q _ -- will you describe the more important feature of the locomotive engine _ a _ -- the locomotive employ to draw carriage upon railway consist of a cylindrical boiler fill with brass tube through which the hot air pass on its progress from the furnace to the chimney and attach to the boiler be two horizontal cylinder fit with piston valve connect rod and other necessary apparatus to enable the power exert by the piston to turn round the crank axle to which the drive wheel be attach there be therefore two independent engine enter into the composition of a locomotive the crank of which be set at right angle with one another so that when one crank be at its dead point the other crank be in a position to act with its maximum efficacy the drive wheel which be fix on the crank shaft and turn round with it propel the locomotive forward on the rail by the mere adhesion of friction and this be find sufficient not merely to move the locomotive but to draw a long train of carriage behind it 130 _ q _ -- be locomotive engine condense or high pressure engine _ a _ -- they be invariably high pressure engine and it would be impossible or at least highly inconvenient to carry the water necessary for the purpose of condensation the steam therefore after it have urge the piston to the end of the stroke escape into the atmosphere in locomotive engine the waste steam be always discharge into the chimney through a vertical pipe and by its rapid passage it greatly increase the intensity of the draught in the chimney whereby a smaller fire grate suffice for the combustion of the fuel and the evaporative power of the boiler be much increase 131 _ q _ -- can you give a example of a good locomotive engine of the usual form _ a _ -- to do this i will take the example of one of hawthorn 's locomotive engine with six wheel represent in fig 29 not one of the most modern construction now in use nor yet one of the most antiquated m be the cylinder r the connect rod c c the eccentric by which the slide valve be move j j be the steam pipe by which the steam be conduct from the steam dome of the boiler to the cylinder near the smoke stack end of this pipe be a valve k or regulator move by a handle _ p _ at the front of the boiler and of which the purpose be to regulate the admission of the steam to the cylinder _ f _ be a safety valve keep close by spring n be the eduction pipe or as it be commonly term in locomotive the _ blast pipe _ by which the steam escape from the cylinder after the stroke have be perform be project up the chimney h the water in the boiler of course cover the tube and also the top of the furnace or fire box it will be understand that there be two engine in each locomotive though from the figure be give in section only one engine can be show the cylinder of this engine be each 14 inch diameter the length of the stroke of the piston be 21 inch there be two set of drive wheel 5 foot diameter with outside connection -lrb- illustration : fig 29 -rrb- 132 _ q _ -- what be the tender of a locomotive _ a _ -- it be a carriage attach to the locomotive of which the purpose be to contain coke for feed the furnace and water for replenish the boiler 133 _ q _ -- can you give example of modern locomotive -lrb- illustration : fig 30 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 31 -rrb- _ a _ -- the most recent locomotive resemble in they material feature the locomotive represent in fig 29 i can however give example of some of the most powerful engine of recent construction fig 30 represent gooch 's express engine adapt for the wide gauge of the great western railway and fig 31 represent crampton 's express engine adapt for the ordinary or narrow gauge railway the cylinder of gooch 's engine be each 18 inch diameter and 24 inch stroke the drive wheel be 8 foot in diameter the fire grate contain 21 square foot of area and the heating surface of the fire box be 153 square foot there be in all 305 tube in the boiler each of 2 inch diameter give a heating surface in the tube of 1799 square foot the total heating surface therefore be 1952 square foot mr gooch state that a engine of this class will evaporate from 300 to 360 cubic foot of water in the hour and will convey a load of 236 ton at a speed of 40 mile a hour or a load of 181 ton at a speed of 60 mile a hour the weight of this engine empty be 31 ton of the tender 8-1\/2 ton and the total weight of the engine when load be 50 ton in one of crampton 's locomotive the liverpool with one set more of carry wheel than the fig the cylinder be of 24 inch diameter and 18 inch stroke the drive wheel be 8 foot in diameter the fire grate contain 21-1\/2 square foot of area and the heating surface of the fire box be 154 square foot there be in all 300 tube in the boiler of 2-3\/16 inch external diameter give a surface in the tube of 2136 square foot and a total heating surface of 2290 square foot the weight of this engine be state to be 35 ton when ready to proceed on a journey both engine be display at the great exhibition in 1851 as example of the most powerful locomotive engine then make the weight of such engine be very injurious to the railway bend crush and disturb the rail and try very severely the whole of the railway work no doubt the weight may be distribute upon a greater number of wheel but if the weight rest on the drive wheel be much reduce they will not have sufficient bite upon the rail to propel the train without slip this however be only one of the evil which the demand for high rate of speed have produce the width of the railway or as it be term the _ gauge _ of the rail be in most of the railway in this kingdom limit to 4 foot 8-1\/2 inch a corresponding limitation be impose on the diameter of the boiler which in its turn restrict the number of the tube which can be employ as however the attainment of a high rate of speed require much power and consequently much heating surface in the boiler and as the number of tube can not be increase without reduce they diameter it have become necessary in the case of powerful engine to employ tube of a small diameter and of a great length to obtain the necessary quantity of heating surface and such tube require a very strong draught in the chimney to make they effective with a draught of the usual intensity the whole of the heat will be absorb in the portion of the tube nearest the fire box leave that portion nearest the smoke box nothing to do but to transmit the smoke and with long tube of small diameter therefore a very strong draught be indispensable to obtain such a draught in locomotive it be necessary to contract the mouth of the blast pipe whereby the waste steam will be project into the chimney with greater force but this contraction involve a increase of the pressure on the eduction side of the piston and consequently cause a diminution in the power of the engine locomotive with small and long tube therefore will require more coke to do the same work than locomotive in which larger and shorter tube may be employ chapter ii heat combustion and steam heat 134 _ q _ -- what be mean by latent heat _ a _ -- by latent heat be mean the heat exist in body which be not discoverable by the touch or by the thermometer but which manifest its existence by produce a change of state heat be absorb in the liquefaction of ice and in the vaporization of water yet the temperature do not rise during either process and the heat absorb be therefore say to become latent the term be somewhat objectionable as the effect proper to the absorption of heat have in each case be make visible and it would be as reasonable to call hot water latent steam latent heat in the present acceptation of the term mean sensible liquefaction or vaporization but to produce these change heat be as necessary as to produce the expansion of mercury in a thermometer tube which be take as the measure of temperature and it be hard to see on what ground heat can be say to be latent when its presence be make manifest by change which only heat can effect it be the _ temperature _ only that be latent and latent temperature mean sensible vaporization or liquefaction 135 _ q _ -- but when you talk of the latent heat of steam what do you mean to express _ a _ -- i mean to express the heat consume in accomplish the vaporization compare with that necessary for produce the temperature the latent heat of steam be usually reckon at about 1000 degree by which it be mean that there be as much heat in any give weight of steam as would raise its constituent water 1000 degree if the expansion of the water could be prevent or as would raise 1000 time that quantity of water one degree the boiling point of water be 212 degree be 180 degree above the freezing point of water -- the freezing point be 32 degree so that it require 1180 time as much heat to raise 1 lb of water into steam as to raise 1180 lb of water one degree or it require about as much heat to raise a pound of boiling water into steam as would raise 5-1\/2 lb of water from the freezing to the boiling point 5-1\/2 multiply by 180 be 990 or 1000 nearly 136 _ q _ -- when it be state that the latent heat of steam be 1000 degree it be only mean that this be a rough approximation to the truth _ a _ -- precisely so the latent heat in point of fact be not uniform at all temperature neither be the total amount of heat the same at all temperature m regnault have show by a very elaborate series of experiment on steam which he have lately conclude that the total heat in steam increase somewhat with the pressure and that the latent heat diminish somewhat with the pressure this will be make obvious by the follow number : pressure temperature total heat latent heat 15 lb 2131  11789  9658  50 2810 11996 9186 100 3278 12139 8861 if then steam of 100 lb be expand down to steam of 15 lb it will have 35 degree of heat over that which be require for the maintenance of the vaporous state or in other word it will be surcharge with heat 137 _ q _ -- what do you understand by specific heat _ a _ -- by specific heat i understand the relative quantity of heat in body at the same temperature just as by specific gravity i understand the relative quantity of matter in body of the same bulk equal weight of quicksilver and water at the same temperature do not contain the same quantity of heat any more than equal bulk of those liquid contain the same quantity of matter the absolute quantity of heat in any body be not know but the relative heat of body at the same temperature or in other word they specific heat have be ascertain and arrange in table -- the specific heat of water be take as unity 138 _ q _ -- in what way do the specific heat of a body enable the quantity of heat in it to be determine _ a _ -- if any body have only half the specific heat of water then a pound of that body will at any give temperature have only half the heat in it that be in a pound of water at the same temperature the specific heat of air be 2669 that of water be 1 or it be 375 time less than that of water a amount of heat therefore which would raise a pound of water 1 degree would raise a pound of air 375 degree combustion 139 _ q _ -- what be the nature of combustion _ a _ -- combustion be nothing more than a energetic chemical combination or in other word it be the mutual neutralization of oppose electricity when coal be bring to a high temperature it acquire a strong affinity for oxygen and combination with oxygen will produce more than sufficient heat to maintain the original temperature so that part of the heat be render applicable to other purpose 140 _ q _ -- do air consist of oxygen _ a _ -- air consist of oxygen and nitrogen mix together in the proportion of 329 lb of nitrogen to 1 lb of oxygen every pound of coal require about 266 lb of oxygen for its saturation and therefore for every pound of coal burn 875 pound of nitrogen must pass through the fire suppose all the oxygen to enter into combination in practice however this perfection of combination do not exist from one-third to one-half of the oxygen will pass through the fire without enter into combination at all so that from 16 to 18 lb of air be require for every pound of coal burn 18 lb of air be about 240 cubic foot which may be take as the quantity of air require for the combustion of a pound of coal in practice 141 _ q _ -- what be the constituent of coal _ a _ -- the chief constituent of coal be carbon or pure charcoal which be associate in various proportion with volatile and earthy matter english coal contain 80 to 90 per cent of carbon and from 8 to 18 per cent of volatile and earthy matter but sometimes more than this the volatile matter be hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulphur 142 _ q _ -- what be the difference between anthracite and bituminous coal _ a _ -- anthracite consist almost entirely of carbon have 91 per cent of carbon with about 7 per cent of volatile matter and 2 per cent of ash newcastle coal contain about 83 per cent of carbon 14 per cent of volatile matter and 3 per cent of ash 143 _ q _ -- will you recapitulate the step by which you determine the quantity of air require for the combustion of coal _ a _ -- look to the quantity of oxygen require to unite chemically with the various constituent of the coal we find for example that in 100 lb of anthracite coal consist of 9144 lb of carbon and 346 lb of hydrogen we shall for the 9144 lb of carbon require 24384 lb of oxygen -- since to saturate a pound of carbon by the formation of carbonic acid require 2-2\/3 lb of oxygen to saturate a pound of hydrogen in the formation of water require 8 lb of oxygen hence 346 fib of hydrogen will take 2768 lb of oxygen for its saturation if then we add 24384 lb to 2768 lb we have 27152 lb of oxygen require for the combustion of 100 lb of coal a give weight of air contain nearly 2332 per cent of oxygen hence to obtain 27152 lb of oxygen we must have about four time that quantity of atmospheric air or more accurately 1164 lb of air for the combustion of 100 lb of coal a cubic foot of air at ordinary temperature weigh about 075 lb so that 100 lb of coal require 15524 cubic foot of air or 1 lb of coal require about 155 cubic foot of air suppose every atom of the oxygen to enter into combination if then from one-third to one-half of the air pass unconsumed through the fire a allowance of 240 cubic foot of air for each pound of coal will be a small enough allowance to answer the requirement of practice and in some case as much as 300 cubic foot will be require -- the difference depend mainly on the peculiar configuration of the furnace 144 _ q _ -- can you state the evaporative efficacy of a pound of coal _ a _ -- the evaporative efficacy of a pound of carbon have be find experimentally to be equivalent to that necessary to raise 14000 lb of water through 1 degree or 14 lb of water through 1000 degree suppose the whole heat generate to be absorb by the water now if the water be raise into steam from a temperature of 60  then 11189  of heat will have to be impart to it to convert it into steam of 15 lb pressure per square inch 14000 \/ 11189 = 12512 lb will be the number of pound of water therefore which a pound of carbon can raise into steam of 15 lb pressure from a temperature of 60  this however be a considerably larger result than can be expect in practice 145 _ q _ -- then what be the result that may be expect in practice _ a _ -- the evaporative power of different coal appear to be nearly proportional to the quantity of carbon in they and bituminous coal be therefore less efficacious than coal consist chiefly of pure carbon a pound of the best welsh or anthracite coal be capable of raise from 9-1\/2 to 10 lb of water from 212  into steam whereas a pound of the best newcastle be not capable of raise more than about 8-1\/2 lb of water from 212  into steam and inferior coal will not raise more than 6-1\/2 lb of water into steam in america it have be find that 1 lb of the best coal be equal to 2-1\/2 lb of pine wood or in some case to 3 lb and a pound of pine wood will not usually evaporate more than about 21\/2 lb of water though by careful management it may be make to evaporate 4 1\/2 lb turf will generate rather more steam than wood coke be equal or somewhat superior to the best coal in evaporative effect 146 _ q _ -- how much water will a pound of coal raise into steam in ordinary boiler _ a _ -- from 6 to 8 lb of water in the generality of land boiler of medium quality the difference depend on the kind of boiler the kind of coal and other circumstance mr watt reckon he boiler as capable of evaporate 1008 cubic foot of water with a bushel or 84 lb of newcastle coal which be equivalent to 71\/2 lb of water evaporate by 1 lb of coal and this may be take as the performance of common land boiler at the present time in some of the cornish boiler however a pound of coal raise 118 lb of boiling water into steam or a cwt of coal evaporate about 21 cubic foot of water from 212  147 _ q _ -- what method of firing ordinary furnace be the best _ a _ -- the coal should be break up into small piece and sprinkle thinly and evenly over the fire a little at a time the thickness of the stratum of coal upon the grate should depend upon the intensity of the draught : in ordinary land or marine boiler it should be thin whereas in locomotive boiler it require to be much thicker if the stratum of coal be thick while the draught be sluggish the carbonic acid result from combustion combine with a additional atom of carbon in pass through the fire and be convert into carbonic oxide which may be define to be invisible smoke as it carry off a portion of the fuel : if on the contrary the stratum of coal be thin while the draught be very rapid a injurious refrigeration be occasion by the excess of air pass through the furnace the fire should always be spread of uniform thickness over the bar of the grate and should be without any hole or uncovered place which greatly diminish the effect of the fuel by the refrigeratory action of the stream of cold air which enter thereby a wood fire require to be about 6 inch thicker than a coal one and a turf fire require to be 3 or 4 inch thicker than a wood one so that the furnace bar must be place lower where wood or turf be burn to enable the surface of the fire to be at the same distance from the bottom of the boiler 148 _ q _ -- be a slow or a rapid combustion the most beneficial _ a _ -- a slow combustion be find by experiment to give the best result as regard economy of fuel and theory tell we that the largest advantage will necessarily be obtain where adequate time have be afford for a complete combination of the constituent atom of the combustible and the supporter of combustion in many of the case however which occur in practice a slow combustion be not attainable but the tendency of slow combustion be both to save the fuel and to burn the smoke 149 _ q _ -- be not the combustion in the furnace of the cornish boiler very slow a -- yes very slow and there be in consequence very little smoke evolve the coal use in cornwall be welsh coal which evolve but little smoke and be therefore more favorable for the success of a smokeless furnace but in the manufacturing district where the coal be more bituminous it be find that smoke may be almost wholly prevent by careful firing and by the use of a large capacity of furnace 150 _ q _ -- do you consider slow combustion to be a advisable thing to practice in steam vessel _ a _ -- no i do not when the combustion be slow the heat in the furnace and flue be less intense and a larger amount of heating surface consequently become necessary to absorb the heat in locomotive where the heat of the furnace be very intense there will be the same economy of fuel with a allowance of 5 or 6 square foot of surface to evaporate a cubic foot of water as in common marine boiler with 10 or 12 151 _ q _ -- what be the method of consuming smoke pursue in the manufacturing district _ a _ -- in manchester where some stringent regulation for the prevention of smoke have for some time be in force it be find that the readiest way of burn the smoke be to have a very large proportion of furnace room whereby slow combustion may be carry on in some case too a favourable result be arrive at by raise a ridge of coal across the furnace lie against the bridge and of the same height : this ridge speedily become a mass of incandescent coke which promote the combustion of the smoke pass over it 152 _ q _ -- be the method of admit a stream of air into the flue to burn the smoke regard favorably _ a _ -- no it be find to be productive of injury to the boiler by the violent alternation of temperature it occasion as at some time cold air impinge on the iron of the boiler and at other time flame -- just as there happen to be smoke or no smoke emit by the furnace boiler therefore operate upon this principle speedily become leaky and be much worn by oxidation so that if the pressure be considerable they be liable to explode it be very difficult to apportion the quantity of air admit to the vary want of the fire and as air may at some time be rush in when there be no smoke to consume a loss of heat and a increase consumption of fuel may be the result of the arrangement and indeed such be the result in practice though a carefully perform experiment usually demonstrate a saving in fuel of 10 or 12 per cent 153 _ q _ -- what other plan have be contrived for obviate the nuisance of smoke _ a _ -- they be too various for enumeration but most of they either operate upon the principle of admit air into the flue to accomplish the combustion of the uninflammable part of the smoke or seek to attain the same object by pass the smoke over or through the fire or other incandescent material some of the plan indeed profess to burn the inflammable gas as they be evolve from the coal without permit the admixture of any of the uninflammable product of combustion which enter into the composition of smoke but this object have be very imperfectly fulfil in any of the contrivance yet bring under the notice of the public and in some case these contrivance have be find to create weightier evil than they profess to relieve 154 _ q _ -- you refer i suppose to mr charle wye william ' argand furnace _ a _ -- i chiefly refer to it though i also comprehend all other scheme in which there be a continuous admission of air into the flue with a intermittent generation of smoke 155 _ q _ -- this be not so in prideaux 's furnace _ a _ -- no in that furnace the air be admit only during a certain interval or for so long in fact as there be smoke to be consume 156 _ q _ -- will you explain the chief peculiarity of that furnace _ a _ -- the whole peculiarity be in the furnace door the front of the door consist of metal venetian which be open when the top lever be lift up and shut when that lever descend to its lowest position when the furnace door be open to replenish the fire with coal the top lever be raise up and with it the piston of the small cylinder attach to the side of the furnace the venetian be thereby open and a stream of air enter the furnace which be heat in its passage among the numerous heated plate attach to the back of the furnace door be in a favorable condition for effect the combustion of the inflammable part of the smoke the piston in the small cylinder gradually subside and close the venetian and the rate of the subsidence of the piston may obviously be regulate by a cock or as in this case a small screw valve so that the venetian shall just close when there be no more smoke to be consume -- the air or other fluid within the cylinder be force out by the piston in its descent 157 _ q _ -- have mr watt any method of consume smoke _ a _ -- he try various method but eventually fix upon the method of coke the coal on a dead plate at the furnace door before push it into the fire that method be perfectly effectual where the combustion be so slow that the requisite time for coking be allow and it be much preferable to any of the method of admit air at the bridge or elsewhere to accomplish the combustion of the inflammable part of the smoke 158 _ q _ -- what be the detail of mr watt 's arrangement as now employ _ a _ -- the fire bar and the dead plate be both set at a considerable inclination to facilitate the advance of the fuel into the furnace in boulton and watt 's 30 horse power land boiler the dead plate and the furnace bar be both about 4 foot long and they be set at the angle of 30 degree with the horizon 159 _ q _ -- be the use of the dead plate universally adopt in boulton and watt 's land boiler _ a _ -- it be generally adopt but in some case boulton and watt have substitute the plan of a revolving grate for consume the smoke and the dead plate then become both superfluous and inapplicable in this contrivance the fire be replenish with coal by a self-acting mechanism 160 _ q _ -- will you explain the arrangement of the revolving grate _ a _ -- the fire grate be make like a round table capable of turn horizontally upon a center a shower of coal be precipitate upon the grate through a slit in the boiler near the furnace mouth and the smoke evolve from the coal drop at the front part of the fire be consume by pass over the incandescent fuel at the back part from which all the smoke must have be expel in the revolution of the grate before it can have reach that position 161 _ q _ -- be a furnace with a revolving grate applicable to a steam vessel _ a _ -- i see nothing to prevent its application but the arrangement of the boiler would perhaps require to be change and it might be preferable to combine its use with the employment of vertical tube for the transmission of the smoke the introduction of any effectual automatic contrivance for feed the fire in steam vessel would bring about a important economy at the same time that it would give the assurance of the work be better do it be very difficult to fire furnace by hand effectually at sea especially in rough weather and in tropical climate whereas machinery would be unaffected by any such disturbing cause and would perform with little expense the work of many man 162 _ q _ -- the introduction of some mechanical method of feed the fire with coal would enable a double tier of furnace to be adopt in steam vessel without inconvenience _ a _ -- yes it would have at least that tendency and as the space available for area of grate be limit in a steam vessel by the width of the vessel it would be a great convenience if a double tier of furnace could be employ without a diminished effect it appear to I however that the objection would still remain of the steam raise by the lower furnace be cool and deaden by the air enter the ash-pit of the upper fire for it would strike upon the metal of the ash-pit bottom 163 _ q _ -- have any other plan be devise for feed the fire by self-acting means besides that of a revolving grate _ a _ -- yes many plan but none of they perhaps be free from a objectionable complication in some arrangement the bar be make like screw which be turn round slowly gradually carry forward the coal while in other arrangement the same object be seek to be attain by alternately lift and depress every second bar at the end nearest the mouth of the furnace in jucke ' furnace the fire bar be arrange in the manner of row of endless chain work over a roller at the mouth of the furnace and another roller at the farther end of the furnace these roller be put into slow revolution and the coal which be deposit at the mouth of the furnace be gradually carry forward by the motion of the chain which act like a endless web the clinker and ash leave after the combustion of the coal be precipitate into the ash-pit where the chain turn down over the roller at the extremity of the furnace in messr maudslay ' plan of a self-feeding furnace the fire bar be form of round tube and be place transversely across the furnace the end of the bar gear into endless screw run the whole length of the furnace whereby motion be give to the bar and the coal be thus carry gradually forward it be very doubtful whether any of these contrivance satisfy all the condition require in a plan for feed furnace of the ordinary form by self-acting means but the problem of provide a suitable contrivance do not seem difficult of accomplishment and will no doubt be effect under adequate temptation 164 _ q _ -- have not many plan be already contrived which consume the smoke of furnace very effectually _ a _ -- yes many plan and besides those already mention there be hall 's coupland 's godson 's robinson 's steven 's hazeldine 's indie 's bristow and attwood 's and a great number of other one plan which promise well consist in make the flame descend through the fire bar and the fire bar be form of tube set on a incline and fill with water which water will circulate with a rapidity proportionate to the intensity of the heat after all however the best remedy for smoke appear to consist in remove from it those portion which form the smoke before the coal be bring into use many valuable product may be get from the coal by subject it to this treatment and the residuum will be more valuable than before for the production of steam steam 165 _ q _ -- have experiment be make to determine the elasticity of steam at different temperature _ a _ -- yes very careful experiment the following rule express the result obtain by mr southern : -- to the give temperature in degree of fahrenheit add 513 degree from the logarithm of the sum subtract the logarithm of 135767 which be 21327940 multiply the remainder by 513 and to the natural number answer to the sum add the constant fraction 1 which will give the elastic force in inch of mercury if the elastic force be know and it be want to determine the corresponding temperature the rule must be modify thus : -- from the elastic force in inch of mercury subtract the decimal 1 divide the logarithm of the remainder by 513 and to the quotient add the logarithm 21327940 find the natural number answer to the sum and subtract therefrom the constant 513 the remainder will be the temperature seek the french academy and the franklin institute have repeat mr southern 's experiment on a larger scale the result obtain by they be not widely different and be perhaps nearer the truth but mr southern 's result be generally adopt by engineer as sufficiently accurate for practical purpose 166 _ q _ -- have not some superior experiment upon this subject be lately make in france _ a _ -- yes the experiment of m regnault upon this subject have be very elaborate and very carefully conduct and the result be probably more accurate than have be heretofore obtain nevertheless it be questionable how far it be advisable to disturb the rule of watt and southern with which the practice of engineer be very much identify for the sake of emendation which be not of such magnitude as to influence materially the practical result m regnault have show that the total amount of heat exist in a give weight of steam increase slightly with the pressure so that the sum of the latent and sensible heat do not form a constant quantity thus in steam of the atmospheric pressure or with 147 lb upon the square inch the sensible heat of the steam be 212 degree the latent heat 9666 degree and the sum of the latent and sensible heat 11786 degree whereas in steam of 90 pound upon the square inch the sensible heat be 3202 degree the latent heat 8914 degree and the sum of the latent and sensible heat 12110 degree there be therefore 33 degree less of heat in any give weight of water raise into steam of the atmospheric pressure than if raise into steam of 90 lb -lrb- 1 -rrb- pressure 167 _ q _ -- what expansion do water undergo in its conversion into steam _ a _ -- a cubic inch of water make about a cubic foot of steam of the atmospheric pressure 168 _ q _ -- and how much at a higher pressure _ a _ -- that depend upon what the pressure be but the proportion be easily ascertain for the pressure and the bulk of a give quantity of steam as of air or any other elastic fluid be always inversely proportional to one another thus if a cubic inch of water make a cubic foot of steam with the pressure of one atmosphere it will make half a cubic foot with the pressure of two atmosphere a third of a cubic foot with the pressure of three atmosphere and so on in all other proportion high pressure steam indeed be just low pressure steam force into a less space and the pressure will always be great in the proportion in which the space be contract 169 _ q _ -- if this be so the quantity of heat in a give weight of steam must be nearly the same whether the steam be high or low pressure _ a _ -- yes the heat in steam be nearly a constant quantity at all pressure but not so precisely steam to which a additional quantity of heat have be impart after leave the boiler or as it be call surcharged steam come under a different law for the elasticity of such steam may be increase without any addition be make to its weight but surcharge steam be not at present employ for work engine and it may therefore be consider in practice that a pound of steam contain very nearly the same quantity of heat at all pressure 170 _ q _ -- do not the quantity of heat in any body vary with the temperature _ a _ -- other circumstance remain the same the quantity of heat in a body increase with the temperature 171 _ q _ -- and be not high pressure steam hotter than low pressure steam _ a _ -- yes the temperature of steam rise with the pressure 172 _ q _ -- how then come it that there be the same quantity of heat in the same weight of high and low pressure steam when the high pressure steam have the highest temperature _ a _ -- because although the temperature or sensible heat rise with the pressure the latent heat become less in about the same proportion and as have be already explain the latent and sensible heat take together make up nearly the same amount at all temperature but the amount be somewhat greater at the higher temperature as a damp sponge become wet when subject to pressure so warm vapor become hot when force into less bulk but in neither case do the quantity of moisture or the quantity of heat sustain any alteration common air become so hot by compression that tinder may be inflamed by it as be see in the instrument for produce instantaneous light by suddenly force air into a syringe 173 _ q _ -- what law be follow by surcharged steam on the application of heat _ a _ -- the same as that follow by air in which the increment in volume be very nearly in the same proportion as the increment in temperature and the increment in volume for each degree of increase temperature be 1\/490th part of the volume at 32  a volume of air which at the temperature of 32  occupy 100 cubic foot will at 212  fill a space of 13673 cubic foot the volume which air or steam -- out of contact with water -- of a give temperature acquire by be heat to a higher temperature the pressure remain the same may be find by the follow rule : -- to each of the temperature before and after expansion add the constant number 458 : divide the greater sum by the less and multiply the quotient by the volume at the lower temperature the product will give the expand volume 174 _ q _ -- if the relative volume of steam and water be know be it possible to tell the quantity of water which should be supply to a boiler when the quantity of steam expend be specify _ a _ -- yes at the atmospheric pressure about a cubic inch of water have to be supply to the boiler for every cubic foot of steam abstracted at other pressure the relative bulk of water and steam may be determine as follow : -- to the temperature of steam in degree of fahrenheit add the constant number 458 multiply the sum by 373 and divide the product by the elastic force of the steam in pound per square inch the quotient will give the volume require 175 _ q _ -- will this rule give the proper dimension of the pump for feed the boiler with water _ a _ -- no it be necessary in practice that the feed pump should be able to supply the boiler with a much larger quantity of water than what be indicate by these proportion from the risk of leak priming or other disarrangement and the feed pump be usually make capable of raise 3-1\/2 time the water evaporate by the boiler about 1\/240th of the capacity of the cylinder answer very well for the capacity of the feed pump in the case of low pressure engine suppose the cylinder to be double acting and the pump single act but it be better to exceed this size 176 _ q _ -- be this rule for the size of the feed pump applicable to the case of high pressure engine _ a _ -- clearly not for since a cylinder full of high pressure steam contain more water than the same cylinder full of low pressure steam the size of the feed must vary in the same proportion as the density of the steam in all pump a good deal of the effect be lose from the imperfect action of the valve and in engine travel at a high rate of speed in particular a large part of the water be apt to return through the suction valve of the pump especially if much lift be permit to that valve in steam vessel moreover where the boiler be feed with salt water and where a certain quantity of supersalted water have to be blow out of the boiler from time to time to prevent the water from reach too high a degree of concentration the feed pump require to be of additional size to supply the extra quantity of water thus render necessary when the feed water be boil or very hot as in some engine be the case the feed pump will not draw from a depth and will altogether act less efficiently so that a extra size of pump have to be provide in consequence these and other consideration which might be mention show the propriety of make the feed pump very much larger than theory require the proper proportion of pump however form part of a subsequent chapter -lrb- 1 -rrb- a table contain the result arrive at by m regnault be give in the key chapter iii expansion of steam and action of the valve 177 _ q _ -- what be mean by work engine expansively _ a _ -- adjust the valve so that the steam be shut off from the cylinder before the end of the stroke whereby the residue of the stroke be leave to be complete by the expand steam 178 _ q _ -- and what be the benefit of that practice _ a _ -- it accomplish a important saving of steam or what be the same thing of fuel but it diminish the power of the engine while increase the power of the steam a larger engine will be require to do the same work but the work will be do with a smaller consumption of fuel if for example the steam be shut off when only half the stroke be complete there will only be half the quantity of steam use but there will be more than half the power exert for although the pressure of the steam decrease after the supply enter from the boiler be shut off yet it impart during its expansion _ some _ power and that power it be clear be obtain without any expenditure of steam or fuel whatever 179 _ q _ -- what will be the pressure of the steam under such circumstance at the end of the stroke _ a _ -- if the steam be shut off at half stroke the pressure of the steam reckon the total pressure both below and above the atmosphere will just be one-half of what it be at the beginning of the stroke it be a well known law of pneumatic that the pressure of elastic fluid vary inversely as the space into which they be expand or compress for example if a cubic foot of air of the atmospheric density be compress into the compass of half a cubic foot its elasticity will be increase from 15 lb on the square inch to 30 lb on the square inch whereas if its volume be enlarged to two cubic foot its elasticity will be reduce to 7-1\/2 lb on the square inch be just half its original pressure the same law hold in all other proportion and with all other gas and vapor provide they temperature remain unchanged and if the steam valve of a engine be close when the piston have descend through one - fourth of the stroke the steam within the cylinder will at the end of the stroke just exert one-fourth of its initial pressure 180 _ q _ -- then by compute the vary pressure at a number of stage the average or mean pressure throughout the stroke may be approximately determine -lrb- illustration : fig 32 diagram show law of expansion of steam in a cylinder -rrb- _ a _ -- precisely so thus in the accompany figure -lrb- fig 32 -rrb- let e be a cylinder j the piston _ a _ the steam pipe _ c _ the upper port _ f _ the lower port _ d _ the steam pipe prolong to _ e _ the equilibrium valve _ g _ the eduction valve m the steam jacket n the cylinder cover o stuffing box _ n _ piston rod p cylinder bottom let the cylinder be suppose to be divide in the direction of its length into any number of equal part say twenty and let the diameter of the cylinder represent the pressure of the steam which for the sake of simplicity we may take at 10 lb so that we may divide the cylinder in the direction of its diameter into ten equal part if now the piston be suppose to descend through five of the division and the steam valve then be shut the pressure at each subsequent position of the piston will be represent by a series compute accord to the law of pneumatic and which if the initial pressure be represent by 1 will give a pressure of 5 at the middle of the stroke and 25 at the end of it if this series be set off on the horizontal line it will mark out a hyperbolic curve -- the area of the part exterior to which represent the total efficacy of the stroke and the interior area therefore represent the diminution in the power of a stroke when the steam be cut off at one - fourth of the descent if the square above the point where the steam be cut off be count they will be find to amount to 50 and if those beneath that point be count or estimate they will be find to amount to about 69 these square be representative of the power exert so that while a amount of power represent by 50 have be obtain by the expenditure of a quarter of a cylinder full of steam we get a amount of power represent by 69 without any expenditure of steam at all merely by permit the steam first use to expand into four time its original volume 181 _ q _ -- then by work a engine expansively the power of the steam be increase but the power of the engine be diminish _ a _ -- yes the efficacy of a give quantity of steam be more than double by expand the steam four time while the efficacy of each stroke be make nearly one-half less and therefore to carry out the expansive principle in practice the cylinder require to be larger than usual or the piston faster than usual in the proportion in which the expansion be carry out every one who be acquaint with simple arithmetic can compute the terminal pressure of steam in a cylinder when he know the initial pressure and the point at which the steam be cut off and he can also find by the same process any pressure intermediate between the first and the last by set down these pressure in a table and take they mean he can determine the effect with tolerable accuracy of any particular measure of expansion it be necessary to remark that it be the total pressure of the steam that he must take not the pressure above the atmosphere but the pressure above a perfect vacuum 182 _ q _ -- can you give any rule for ascertain at one operation the amount of benefit derivable from expansion _ a _ -- divide the length of stroke through which the steam expand by the length of stroke perform with full pressure which last call 1 the hyperbolic logarithm of the quotient be the increase of efficiency due to expansion accord to this rule it will be find that if a give quantity of steam the power of which work at full pressure be represent by 1 be admit into a cylinder of such a size that its ingress be conclude when one-half the stroke have be perform its efficacy will be raise by expansion to 169 if the admission of the steam be stop at one-third of the stroke the efficacy will be 210 at one - fourth 239 at one-fifth 261 at one-sixth 279 at one-seventh 295 at one-eighth 308 the expansion however can not be carry beneficially so far as one-eighth unless the pressure of the steam in the boiler be very considerable on account of the inconvenient size of cylinder or speed of piston which would require to be adopt the friction of the engine and the resistance of vapor in the condenser which all become relatively greater with a smaller urge force 183 _ q _ -- be this amount of benefit actually realize in practice _ a _ -- only in some case it appear to be indispensable to the realization of any large amount of benefit by expansion that the cylinder should be enclose in a steam jacket or should in some other way be effectually protect from refrigeration in some engine not so protect it have be find experimentally that less benefit be obtain from the fuel by work expansively than by work without expansion -- the whole benefit due to expansion be more than counteract by the increase refrigeration due to the larger surface of the cylinder require to develop the power in locomotive engine with outside cylinder this condition of the advantageous use of expansion have be make very conspicuous as have also be the case in screw steamer with four cylinder and in which the refrigerate surface of the cylinder be consequently large 184 _ q _ -- the steam be admit to and from the cylinder by means of a slide or sluice valve -lrb- illustration : fig 33 -rrb- _ a _ -- yes and of the slide valve there be many variety but the kind most in use be the d valve -- so call from its resemblance to a half cylinder or d in its cross section -- and the three port valve show in fig 33 which consist of a brass or iron box set over the two port or opening into the cylinder and a central port which conduct away the steam to the atmosphere or condenser but the length of the box be so adjust that it can only cover one of the cylinder port and the central or eduction port at the same time the effect therefore of move the valve up and down as be do by the eccentric be to establish a connection alternately between each cylinder port and the central passage whereby the steam escape and while the steam be escape from beneath the piston the position of the valve be such that a free communication exist between the space above the piston and the steam in the boiler the piston be thus urge alternately up and down -- the valve so change its position before the piston arrive at the end of the stroke that the pressure be by that time throw on the reverse side of the piston so as to urge it into motion in the opposite direction 185 _ q _ -- be the motion of the valve then the reverse of that of the piston _ a _ -- no the valve do not move down when the piston move down nor do it move down when the piston move up but it move from its mid position to the extremity of its throw and back again to its mid position while the piston make a upward or downward movement so that the motion be as it be at right angle to the motion of the piston or it be the same motion that the piston of another engine the crank of which be set at right angle with that of the first engine would acquire 186 _ q _ -- then in a steam vessel the valve of one engine may be work from the piston of the other _ a _ -- yes it may or it may be work from its own connect rod and in the case of locomotive engine this have sometimes be do 187 _ q _ -- what be mean by the lead of the valve _ a _ -- the amount of opening which the valve present for the admission of the steam when the piston be just begin its stroke it be find expedient that the valve should have open a little to admit steam on the reverse side of the piston before the stroke terminate and the amount of this opening which be give by turn the eccentric more or less round upon the shaft be what be term the lead 188 _ q _ -- and what be mean by the lap of the valve _ a _ -- it be a elongation of the valve face to a certain extent over the port whereby the port be close sooner than would otherwise be the case this extension be chiefly effect at that part of the valve where the steam be admit or upon the _ steam side _ of the valve as the technical phrase be and the intent of the extension be to close the steam passage before the end of the stroke whereby the engine be make to operate to a certain extent expansively in some case however there be also a certain amount of lap give to the escape or eduction side to prevent the eduction from be perform too soon when the lead be great but in all case there be far less lap on the eduction than on the steam side very often there be none and sometimes less than none so that the valve be incapable of cover both the port at once 189 _ q _ -- what be the usual proportional length of stroke of the valve _ a _ -- the common stroke of the valve in rotative engine be twice the breadth or depth of the port and the length of the valve face will then be just the breadth of the port when there be lap on neither the steam nor eduction side whatever lap be give therefore make the valve face just so much longer in some engine however the stroke of the valve be a good deal more than twice the breadth of the port and it be to the stroke of the valve that the amount of lap should properly be refer 190 _ q _ -- can you tell what amount of lap will accomplish any give amount of expansion _ a _ -- yes when the stroke of the valve be know from the length of the stroke of the piston subtract that part of the stroke which be intend to be accomplish before the steam be cut off divide the remainder by the length of the stroke of the piston and extract the square root of the quotient which multiply by half the stroke of the valve and from the product take half the lead the remainder will be the lap require 191 _ q _ -- can you state how we may discover at what point of the stroke the eduction passage will be close _ a _ -- to find how much before the end of the stroke the eduction passage will be close : -- to the lap on the steam side add the lead and divide the sum by half the stroke of the valve find the arc whose sine be equal to the quotient and add 90  to it divide the lap on the eduction side by half the stroke of the valve and find the arc whose cosine be equal to the quotient subtract this arc from the one last obtain and find the cosine of the remainder subtract this cosine from 2 and multiply the remainder by half the stroke of the piston the product be the distance of the piston from the end of the stroke when the eduction passage be close 192 _ q _ -- can you explain how we may determine the distance of the piston from the end of the stroke before the steam urge it onward be allow to escape _ a _ -- to find how far the piston be from the end of its stroke when the steam that be propel it by expansion be allow to escape to the atmosphere or condenser -- to the lap on the steam side add the lead divide the sum by half the stroke of the valve and find the arc whose sine be equal to the quotient find the arc whose sine be equal to the lap on the eduction side divide by half the stroke of the valve add these two arc together and subtract 90  find the cosine of the residue subtract it from 1 and multiply the remainder by half the stroke of the piston the product be the distance of the piston from the end of its stroke when the steam that be propel it be allow to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in use these rule all the dimension be to be take in inch and the answer will be find in inch also 193 _ q _ -- be it a benefit or a detriment to open the eduction passage before the end of the stroke _ a _ -- in engine work at a high rate of speed such as locomotive engine it be very important to open the exhaust passage for the escape of the steam before the end of the stroke as a injurious amount of back pressure be thus prevent in the earlier locomotive a great loss of effect be produce from inattention to this condition and when lap be apply to the valve to enable the steam to be work expansively it be find that a still greater benefit be collaterally obtain by the earlier escape of the steam from the eduction passage and which be incidental to the application of lap to the valve the average consumption of coke per mile be reduce by mr wood from 40 lb per mile to 15 lb per mile chiefly by give a free outlet to the escape steam 194 _ q _ -- to what extent can expansion be carry beneficially by means of lap upon the valve _ a _ -- to about one-third of the stroke that be the valve may be make with so much lap that the steam will be cut off when two third of the stroke have be perform leave the residue to be accomplish by the agency of the expand steam but if more lap be put on than answer to this amount of expansion a very distorted action of the valve will be produce which may impair the efficiency of the engine if a further amount of expansion than this be want it may be accomplish by wire draw the steam or by so contract the steam passage that the pressure within the cylinder must decline when the speed of the piston be accelerate as it be about the middle of the stroke 195 _ q _ -- will you explain how this result ensue _ a _ -- if the valve be so make as to shut off the steam by the time two third of the stroke have be perform and the steam be at the same time throttle in the steam pipe the full pressure of the steam within the cylinder can not be maintain except near the beginning of the stroke where the piston travel slowly for as the speed of the piston increase the pressure necessarily subside until the piston approach the other end of the cylinder where the pressure would rise again but that the operation of the lap on the valve by this time have have the effect of close the communication between the cylinder and steam pipe so as to prevent more steam from enter by throttle the steam therefore in the manner here indicate the amount of expansion due to the lap may be double so that a engine with lap enough upon the valve to cut off the steam at two-third of the stroke may by the aid of wire drawing be virtually render capable of cut off the steam at one-third of the stroke 196 _ q _ -- be this the usual way of cut off the steam _ a _ -- no the usual way of cut off the steam be by means of a separate valve term a expansion valve but such a device appear to be hardly necessary in ordinary engine in the cornish engine where the steam be cut off in some case at one-twelfth of the stroke a separate valve for the admission of steam other than that which permit its escape be of course indispensable but in common rotative engine which may realize expansive efficacy by throttle a separate expansion valve do not appear to be require 197 _ q _ -- that be where much expansion be require a expansion valve be a proper appendage but where not much be require a separate expansion valve may be dispense with _ a _ -- precisely so the wire drawing of the steam cause a loss of part of its power and the result will not be quite so advantageous by throttle as by cut off but for moderate amount of expansion it will suffice provide there be lap upon the slide valve 198 _ q _ -- will you explain the structure or configuration of expansion apparatus of the usual construction -lrb- illustration : fig 34 -rrb- _ a _ -- the structure of expansion apparatus be very various but all the kind operate either on the principle of give such a motion to the slide valve as will enable it to cut off the steam at the desire point or on the principle of shut off the steam by a separate valve in the steam pipe or valve case the first class of apparatus have not be find so manageable and be not in extensive use except in that form know as the link motion of the second class the most simple probably be the application of a cam give motion to the throttle valve or to a valve of the same construction which either accurately fit the steam pipe or which come round to a face which however it be restrain from touch by a suitable construction of the cam a kind of expansion valve often employ in marine engine of low speed be the kind use in the cornish engine and know as the equilibrium valve this valve be represent in fig 34 it consist substantially of a annulus or bulge cylinder of brass with a steam-tight face both at its upper and lower edge at which point it fit accurately upon a stationary seat this annulus may be raise or lower without be resist by the pressure of the steam and in rotative engine it be usually work by a cam on the shaft the expansion cam be put on the shaft in two piece which be fasten to each other by means of four bolt pass through lug and be fix to the shaft by key a roller at one end of a bell-crank lever which be connect with the expansion valve press against the cam so that the motion of the lever will work the valve the roller be keep against the cam by a weight on a lever attach to the same shaft but a spring be necessary for high speed if the cam be concentric with the shaft the lever which press upon it would remain stationary and also the expansion valve but by the projection of the cam the end of the lever receive a reciprocate motion which be communicate to the valve 199 _ q _ -- the cam then work the valve _ a _ -- yes the position of the projection of the cam determine the point in relation to the stroke at which the valve be open and its circumferential length determine the length of the time during which the valve continue open the time at which the valve should begin to open be the same under all circumstance but the duration of its opening vary with the amount of expansion desire in order to obtain this variable extent of expansion there be several projection make upon the cam each of which give a different degree or _ grade _ as it be usually call of expansion these grade all begin at the same point on the cam but be of different length so that they begin to move the lever at the same time but differ in the time of return it to its original position 200 _ q _ -- how be the degree of expansion change _ a _ -- the change of expansion be effect by move the roller on to the desire grade which be do by slip the lever carry the roller endway on the shaft or pin sustain it 201 _ q _ -- be such cam applicable in all case _ a _ -- in engine move at a high rate of speed the roller will be throw back from the cam by its momentum unless it be keep against it by means of spring in some case i have employ a spring form of a great number of disc of indium rubber to keep the roller against the cam but a few brass disc require to be interpose to prevent the indium rubber disc from be worn in the central hole 202 _ q _ -- may not the percussion incident to the action of a cam at a high speed when the roller be not keep up to the face by spring be obviate by give a suitable configuration to the cam itself _ a _ -- it may at all event be reduce the outline of the cam should be a parabola so that the valve may be set in motion precisely as a fall body would be but it will nevertheless be necessary that the roller on which the cam press should be force upward by a spring rather than by a counterweight as there will thus be less inertia or momentum in the mass that have to be move 203 _ q _ -- a additional slide valve be sometimes use for cut off the steam _ a _ -- yes very frequently and the slide valve be sometimes on the side or back of the valve casing and sometimes on the back of the main or distribute valve and move with it 204 _ q _ -- be cam use in locomotive engine _ a _ -- in locomotive engine the use of cam be inadmissible and other expedient be employ of which those contrived by stephenson and by cabrey operate on the principle of accomplish the requisite variation of expansion by alter the throw of the slide valve 205 _ q _ -- what be stephenson 's arrangement -lrb- illustration : fig 35 -rrb- _ a _ -- stephenson connect the end of the forward and backward eccentric rod by a link with a curved slot in which a pin upon the end of the valve rod work by move this link so as to bring the forward eccentric rod in the same line with the valve rod the valve receive the motion due to that eccentric whereas if the backward eccentric rod be bring in a line with the valve rod the valve get the motion proper for reverse and if the link be so place that the valve rod be midway between the two eccentric rod the valve will remain nearly stationary this arrangement which be now employ extensively be what be term the link motion it be represent in the annexed figure fig 35 where _ e _ be the valve rod which be attach by a pin to a open curved link susceptible of be move up and down by the bell-crank lever _ f '' _ _ f '' _ support on the center _ g _ and act on the link _ f _ while the valve rod _ e _ remain in the same horizontal plane _ d d' _ be the eccentric rod and the link be represent in its lowest position the dot line _ h ' h '' _ show the position of the eccentric rod when the link be in its highest position and _ l l' _ when in mid position 206 _ q _ -- what be cabrey 's arrangement _ a _ -- mr cabrey make he eccentric rod terminate in a pin which work into a straight slotted lever furnish with jaw similar to the jaw on the eccentric rod of locomotive by raise the pin of the eccentric rod in this slot the travel of the valve will be vary and expansive action will be the result 207 _ q _ -- what other form of apparatus be there for work steam expansively _ a _ -- they be too numerous for description here but a few of they may be enumerate fenton seek to accomplish the desire object by introduce a spiral feather on the crank axle by move the eccentric laterally against which the eccentric be partially turn round so as to cut off the steam at a different part of the stroke dodd seek to attain the same end by correspond mechanical arrangement farcot edward and lavagrian cut off the steam by the application of a supplementary valve at the back of the ordinary valve which supplementary valve be move by tappet fix to the valve case bodmer in 1841 and meyer in 1842 employ two slide or block fit over aperture in the ordinary slide valve and which block be approximate or set apart by a right and leave hand screw pass through both -lrb- 1 -rrb- hawthorn in 1843 employ as a expansion valve a species of frame lie on the ordinary cylinder

slide valve and valve casing place on the back of the ordinary slide valve casing and through this supplementary valve the steam must first pass this supplementary valve be work by a double end lever slot at one end for the reception of a pin on the valve link the position of which in the slot determine the throw of the supplementary valve and the consequent degree of expansion 208 _ q _ -- what be the arrangement of expansion valve use in the most approve modern engine _ a _ -- in modern engine either marine or locomotive it be find that if they be fit with the link motion as they nearly all be a very good expansive action can be obtain by give a suitable adjustment to it without employ a expansion valve at all diagram take from engine work in this manner show a very excellent result and most of the modern engine trust for they expansive work to the link motion and the throttle valve -lrb- 1 -rrb- in 1838 i patent a arrangement of expansion valve consist of two movable plate set upon the ordinary slide valve and which might be draw together or asunder by means of a right and leave hand screw pass through both plate the valve spindle be hollow and a prolongation of the screw pass up through it and be arm on the top with a small wheel by means of which the plate might be adjust while the engine be at work in 1839 i fit a expansion valve in a steam vessel consist of two plate connect by a rod and move by tappet up against the steam edge of the valve in another steam vessel i fit the same species of valve but the motion be not derive from tappet but from a move part of the engine though at the moderate speed at which these engine work i find tappet to operate well and make little noise in 1837 i employ as a expansion valve a rectangular throttle valve accurately fitting a bore out seat in which it might be make to revolve though it do not revolve in work this valve be move by a pin in a pinion make two revolution for every revolution of the engine and the configuration of the seat determine the amount of the expansion in 1855 i have again use expansion valve of this construction in engine make one hundred revolution per minute and with perfectly satisfactory result -- jb chapter iv mode of estimate the power and performance of engine and boiler horse power 209 _ q _ -- what do you understand by a horse power _ a _ -- a amount of mechanical force that will raise 33000 lb one foot high in a minute this standard be adopt by mr watt as the average force exert by the strongest london horse the object of he investigation be to enable he to determine the relation between the power of a certain size of engine and the power of a horse so that when it be desire to supersede the use of horse by the erection of a engine he might from the number of horse employ determine the size of engine that would be suitable for the work 210 _ q _ -- then when we talk of a engine of 200 horse power it be mean that the impel efficacy be equal to that of 200 horse each lifting 33000 lb one foot high in a minute _ a _ -- no not now such be the case in watt 's engine but the capacity of cylinder answerable to a horse power have be increase by most engineer since he time and the pressure on the piston have be increase also so that what be now call a 200 horse power engine exert almost in every case a greater power than be exert in watt 's time and a horse power in the popular sense of the term have become a mere conventional unit for express a certain size of engine without reference to the power exert 211 _ q _ -- then each nominal

pound and a half of pressure for friction the loss of power in work the air pump & c multiply the area of the piston in square inch by this residual pressure and by the motion of the piston in foot per minute and divide by 33000 the quotient be the actual number of horse power of the engine the same result be attain by square the diameter of the cylinder multiply by the pressure per square inch as show by the indicator less a pound and a half and by the motion of the piston in foot per minute and divide by 42017 213 _ q _ how be the nominal power of a engine ascertain _ a _ -- since the nominal power be a mere conventional expression it be clear that it must be determine by a merely conventional process the nominal power of ordinary condense engine may be ascertain by the follow rule : multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the velocity of the piston in foot per minute and divide the product by 6000 the quotient be the number of nominal horse power in use this rule however it be necessary to adopt the speed of piston prescribe by mr watt which vary with the length of the stroke the speed of piston with a 2 foot stroke be accord to he system 160 per minute with a 2 ft 6 in stroke 170 3 ft 180 3 ft 6 in 189 4 ft 200 5 ft 215 6 ft 228 7 ft 245 8 ft 256 ft 214 _ q _ -- do not the speed of the piston increase with the length of the stroke _ a _ -- it do : the speed of the piston vary nearly as the cube root of the length of the stroke 215 _ q _ -- and may not therefore some multiple of the cube root of the length of the stroke be substitute for the velocity of the piston in determine the nominal power _ a _ -- the substitution be quite practicable and will accomplish some simplification as the speed of piston proper for the different length of stroke can not always be remember the rule for the nominal power of condense engine when thus arrange will be as follow : multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the cube root of the stroke in foot and divide the product by 47 the quotient be the number of nominal horse power of the engine suppose it to be of the ordinary condense description this rule assume the existence of a uniform effective pressure upon the piston of 7 lb per square inch mr watt estimate the effective pressure upon the piston of he 4 horse power engine at 6-8 lb per square inch and the pressure increase slightly with the power and become 694 lb per square inch in engine of 100 horse power but it appear to be more convenient to take a uniform pressure of 7 lb for all power small engine indeed be somewhat less effective in proportion than large one but the difference can be make up by slightly increase the pressure in the boiler and small boiler will bear such a increase without inconvenience 216 _ q _ -- how do you ascertain the power of high pressure engine _ a _ -- the actual power be readily ascertain by the indicator by the same process by which the actual power of low pressure engine be ascertain the friction of a locomotive engine when unloaded be find by experiment to be about 1 lb per square inch on the surface of the piston and the additional friction cause by any additional resistance be estimate at about 14 of that resistance but it will be a sufficiently near approximation to the power consume by friction in high pressure engine if we make a deduction of a pound and a half from the pressure on that account as in the case of low pressure engine high pressure engine it be true have no air pump to work but the deduction of a pound and a half of pressure be relatively a much smaller one where the pressure be high than where it do not much exceed the pressure of the atmosphere the rule therefore for the actual horse power of a high pressure engine will stand thus : square the diameter of the cylinder in inch multiply by the pressure of the steam in the cylinder per square inch less 1-1\/2 lb and by the speed of the piston in foot per minute and divide by 42017 the quotient be the actual horse power 217 _ q _ -- but how do you ascertain the nominal horse power of high pressure engine _ a _ -- the nominal horse power of a high pressure engine have never be define but it should obviously hold the same relation to the actual power as that which obtain in the case of condense engine so that a engine of a give nominal power may be capable of perform the same work whether high pressure or condense this relation be maintain in the follow rule which express the nominal horse power of high pressure engine : multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the cube root of the length of stroke in foot and divide the product by 156 this rule give the nominal power of a high pressure engine three time greater than that of a low pressure engine of the same dimension the average effective pressure be take at 21 lb per square inch instead of 7 lb and the speed of the piston in foot per minute be in both rule 128 time the cube root of the length of stroke -lrb- 1 -rrb- 218 _ q _ -- be 128 time the cube root of the stroke in foot per minute the ordinary speed of all engine _ a _ -- locomotive engine travel at a quicker speed -- a innovation bring about not by any process of scientific deduction but by the accident and exigency of railway transit most other engine however travel at about the speed of 128 time the cube root of the stroke in foot but some marine condensing engine of recent construction travel at as high a rate as 700 foot per minute to mitigate the shock of the air pump valve in case in which a high speed have be desirable as in the case of marine engine employ to drive the screw propeller without intermediate gear indium rubber disc rest on a perforated metal plate be now generally adopt but the indium rubber should be very thick and the guard employ to keep the disc down should be of the same diameter as the disc themselves 219 _ q _ -- can you suggest any eligible method of enable condense engine to work satisfactorily at a high rate of speed _ a _ -- the most feasible way of enable condense engine to work satisfactorily at a high speed appear to lie in the application of balance weight to the engine so as to balance the momentum of its move part and the engine must also be make very strong and rigid it appear to be advisable to perform the condensation partly in the air pump instead of altogether in the condenser as a better vacuum and a superior action of the air pump valve will thus be obtain engine construct upon this plan may be drive at four time the speed of common engine whereby a engine of large power may be purchase for a very moderate price and be capable of be put into a very small compass while the motion from be more equable will be better adapt for most purpose for which a rotary motion be require even for pump mine and blow iron furnace engine of this kind appear likely to come into use for they be more suitable than other engine for drive the centrifugal pump which in many case appear likely to supersede other kind of pump for lift water and they be also conveniently applicable to the driving of fan which when so arrange that the air condensed by one fan be employ to feed another and so on through a series of 4 or 5 have succeed in force air into a furnace with a pressure of 2-1\/2 lb on the square inch and with a far steadier flow than can be obtain by a blast engine with any conceivable kind of compensate apparatus they be equally applicable if blast cylinder be employ 220 _ q _ -- then if by this modification of the engine you enable it to work at four time the speed you also enable it to exert four time the power _ a _ -- yes always suppose it to be fully supply with steam the nominal power of this new species of engine can readily be ascertain by take into account the speed of the piston and this be take into account by the admiralty rule for power 221 _ q _ -- what be the admiralty rule for determine the power of a engine _ a _ -- square the diameter of the cylinder in inch which multiply by the speed of the piston in foot per minute and divide by 6000 the quotient be the power of the engine by the admiralty rule -lrb- 2 -rrb- 222 _ q _ -- the high speed engine do not require so heavy a fly wheel as common engine _ a _ -- no the fly wheel will be lighter both by virtue of its greater velocity of rotation and because the impulse communicate by the piston be less in amount and more frequently repeat so as to approach more nearly to the condition of a uniform pressure 223 _ q _ -- can nominal be transform into actual horse power _ a _ -- no that be not possible in the case of common condense engine the actual power exert by a engine can not be deduce from its nominal power neither can the nominal power be deduce from the power actually exert or from anything else than the dimension of the cylinder the actual horse power be a dynamical unit and the nominal horse power a measure of capacity of the cylinder be obviously incomparable thing 224 _ q _ -- that be the _ nominal _ power be a commercial unit by which engine be buy and sell and the _ actual _ power a scientific unit by which the quality of they performance be determine _ a _ -- yes the nominal power be as much a commercial measure as a yard or a bushel and be not a thing to be ascertain by any process of science but to be fix by authority in the same manner as other measure the actual power on the contrary be a mechanical force or dynamical effort capable of raise a give weight through a give distance in a give time and of which the amount be ascertainable by scientific investigation 225 _ q _ -- be there any other measure of a actual horse power than 33000 lb raise one foot high in the minute _ a _ -- there can not be any _ different _ measure but there be several equivalent measure thus the evaporation of a cubic foot of water in the hour or the expenditure of 33 cubic foot of low pressure steam per minute be reckon equivalent to a actual horse power or 528 cubic foot of water raise one foot high in the minute involve the same result -lrb- 1 -rrb- table of the horse power of both high and low pressure engine be give in the key -lrb- 2 -rrb- example -- what be the power of a engine of 42 inch diameter 3-1\/2 foot stroke and make 85 stroke per minute the speed of the piston will be 7 -lrb- the length of a double stroke -rrb- x 85 = 595 foot per minute now 42 x 42 = 1764 x 595 = 1049580 \/ 6000 = 175 horse power duty of engine and boiler 226 _ q _ -- what be mean by the duty of a engine _ a _ -- the work do in relation to the fuel consume 227 _ q _ -- and how be the duty ascertain _ a _ -- in ordinary mill or marine engine it can only be ascertain by the indicator as the load upon such engine be variable and can not readily be determine but in the case of engine pump water where the load be constant the number of stroke perform by the engine will represent the work do and the amount of work do by a give quantity of coal represent the duty in cornwall the duty of a engine be express by the number of million of pound raise one foot high by a bushel or 94 lb of welsh coal a bushel of newcastle coal will only weigh 84 lb and in compare the duty of a cornish engine with the performance of a engine in some locality where a different kind of coal be use it be necessary to pay regard to such variation 228 _ q _ -- can you tell the duty of a engine when you know its consumption of coal per horse power per hour _ a _ -- yes if the power give be the actual and not the nominal power divide 16632 by the number of pound of coal consume per actual horse power per hour the quotient be the duty in million of pound if you already have the duty in million of pound and wish to know the equivalent consumption in pound per actual horse power per hour divide 16632 by the duty in million of pound the quotient be the consumption per actual horse power per hour the duty of a locomotive engine be express by the weight of coke it consume in transport a ton through the distance of one mile upon a railway but this be a very imperfect method of represent the duty as the tractive efficacy of a pound of coke become less as the speed of the locomotive become greater and the law of variation be not accurately know 229 _ q _ -- what amount of power be generate in good engine of the ordinary kind by a give weight of coal _ a _ -- the duty of different kind of engine vary very much and there be also great difference in the performance of different engine of the same class in ordinary rotative condensing engine of good construction 10 lb of coal per nominal horse power per hour be a common consumption but such engine exert nearly twice they nominal power so that the consumption per actual horse power per hour may be take at from 5 to 6 lb engine work very expansively however attain a economy much superior to this the average duty of the pump engine in cornwall be about 60000000 lb raise 1 ft high by a bushel of welsh coal which weigh 94 lb this be equivalent to a consumption of 31 lb of coal per actual horse power per hour but some engine reach a duty of above 100000000 or 174 lb of coal per actual horse power per hour locomotive consume from 8 to 10 lb of coke in evaporate a cubic foot of water and the evaporation of a cubic foot of water per hour may be set down as represent a actual horse power in locomotive as well as in condense engine if expansion be not employ when the locomotive be work expansively however there be of course a less consumption of water and fuel per horse power or per ton per mile than when the full pressure be use throughout the stroke and most locomotive now operate with as much expansion as can be conveniently give by the slide valve 230 _ q _ -- but be not the evaporative power of locomotive affect materially by the proportion of the boiler _ a _ -- yes but this may be say of all boiler but in locomotive boiler perhaps the effect of any misproportion become more speedily manifest a high temperature of the fire box be find to be conducive to economy of fuel and this condition in its turn involve a small area of grate bar the heating surface of locomotive boiler should be about 80 square foot for each square foot of grate bar and upon each foot of grate bar about 1 cwt of coke should be burn in the hour 231 _ q _ -- probably the heat be more rapidly absorb when the temperature of the furnace be high _ a _ -- that seem to be the explanation the rapidity with which a hot body impart heat to a colder vary as the square of the difference of temperature so that if the temperature of the furnace be very high the larger part of the heat pass into the water at the furnace thereby leave little to be transmit by the tube if on the contrary the temperature of the furnace be low a large part of the heat will pass into the tube and more tube surface will be require to absorb it about 16 cubic foot of water should be evaporate by a locomotive boiler for each square foot of fire grate which with the proportion of heating surface already mention leave 5 square foot of heating surface to evaporate a cubic foot of water in the hour this be only about half the amount of surface usual in land and marine boiler per cubic foot evaporate and its small amount be due altogether to the high temperature of the furnace which by the rapidity of transmission it cause be tantamount to a additional amount of heating surface 232 _ q _ -- you have state that the steam and vacuum gauge be generally glass tube up which mercury be force by the steam or suck by the vacuum _ a _ -- vacuum gauge be very often of this construction but steam gauge more frequently consist of a small iron tube bent like the letter u and into which mercury be pour the one end of this tube communicate with the boiler and the other end with the atmosphere and when the pressure of the steam rise in the boiler the mercury be force down in the leg communicate with the boiler and rise in the other leg and the difference of level in the leg denote the pressure of the steam in this gauge a rise of the mercury one inch in the one leg involve a difference of the level between the two leg of two inch and a inch of rise be therefore equivalent to two inch of mercury or a pound of pressure a small float of wood be place in the open leg to show the rise or fall of the mercury and this leg be surmount by a brass scale graduate in inch to the mark of which the float point 233 _ q _ -- what other kind of steam and vacuum gauge be there _ a _ -- there be many other kind but probably bourdon 's gauge be now in more extended use than any other and they operation have be find to be satisfactory in practice the principle of they action may be explain to be that a thin elliptical metal tube if bent into a ring will seek to coil or uncoil itself if subject to external or internal pressure and to a extent proportional to the pressure apply the end of the tube be sharpen into a index and move to a extent correspond to the pressure apply to the tube but in the more recent form of this apparatus a dial and a hand like those of a clock be employ and the hand be move round by a toothed sector connect to the tube and which sector act on a pinion attach to the hand mr shank of paisley have lately introduce a form of steam gauge like a thermometer with a flatten bulb and the pressure of the steam by compress the bulb cause the mercury to rise to a point proportional to the pressure apply the indicator 234 _ q _ -- you have already state that the actual power of a engine be ascertain by a instrument call the indicator which consist of a small cylinder with a piston move against a spring and compress it to a extent answerable to the pressure of the steam will you explain further the structure and mode of use that instrument -lrb- illustration : fig 36 -rrb- _ a _ -- the structure of the common form of indicator will be most readily apprehend by a reference to fig 36 which be a mcnaught 's indicator upon a movable barrel a a piece of paper be wind the end of which be secure by the slight brass clamp show in the draw the barrel be support by the bracket _ b _ proceeding from the body of the indicator and at the bottom of the barrel a watch spring be coil with one end attach to the barrel and the other end to the bracket so that when the barrel be draw round by a string wound upon its lower end like a roller blind the spring return the barrel to its original position when the string be relax the string be attach to some suitable part of the engine and at every stroke the string be draw out turn round the barrel and the barrel be return again by the spring on the return stroke 235 _ q _ -- but in what way can these reciprocation of the barrel determine the power of the engine _ a _ -- they do not determine it of themselves but be only part of the operation in the inside of the cylinder _ c _ there be a small piston move steam tight in a cylinder of which _ d _ be the piston rod and _ e _ a spiral spring of steel which the piston when force upward by the steam or suck downward by the vacuum either compress or extend _ f _ be a cock attach to the cylinder of the indicator and which be screw into the cylinder cover it be obvious that so soon as this cock be open the piston will be force up when the space above the piston of the engine be open to the boiler and suck down when that space be open to the condenser -- in each case to a extent proportionate to the pressure of the steam or the perfection of the vacuum the top of the piston _ c _ be open to the atmosphere a pencil _ p _ with a knife hinge be insert into the piston rod at _ e _ and the point of the pencil bear upon the surface of the paper wound upon the drum a if the drum a do not revolve this pencil would merely trace on the paper a vertical line but as the drum a move round and back again every stroke of the engine and as the pencil move up and down again every stroke of the engine the combined movement trace upon the paper a species of rectangle which be call a indicator diagram and the nature of this diagram determine the nature of the engine 's performance 236 _ q _ -- how do it do this _ a _ -- it be clear that if the pencil be move up instantaneously to the top of its stroke and be also move down instantaneously to the bottom of its stroke and if it remain without fluctuation while at the top and bottom the figure describe by the pencil would be a perfect rectangle of which the vertical height would represent the total pressure of the steam and vacuum and therefore the total pressure urge the piston of the engine but in practice the pencil will neither rise nor fall instantaneously nor will it remain at a uniform height throughout the stroke if the steam be work expansively the pressure will begin to fall so soon as the steam be cut off and at the end of the stroke when the steam come to be discharge the subsidence of pressure will not be instantaneous but will occupy a appreciable time it be clear therefore that in no engine can the diagram describe by a indicator be a complete rectangle but the more nearly it approach to a rectangle the larger will be the power produce at every stroke with any give pressure and the area of the space include within the diagram will in every case accurately represent the power exert by the engine during that stroke 237 _ q _ -- and how be this area ascertain _ a _ -- it may be ascertain in various way but the usual mode be to take the vertical height of the diagram at a number of equidistant point on a base line and then to take the mean of these several height as representative of the mean pressure actually urge the piston now if you have the pressure on the piston per square inch and if you know the number of square inch in its area and the velocity with which it move in foot per minute you have obviously the dynamical effort of the engine or in other word its actual power 238 _ q _ -- how be the base line you have refer to obtain _ a _ -- in proceed to take a indicator diagram the first thing to be do be to allow the barrel to make two or three reciprocation with the pencil rest against it before open the cock attach to the cylinder there will thus be trace a horizontal line which be call the _ atmospheric line _ and in condense engine a part of the diagram will be above and a part of it below this line whereas in high pressure engine the whole of the diagram will be above this line upon this line the vertical ordinate may be set off at equal distance or upon any base line parallel to it but the usual course be to erect the ordinate on the atmospheric line 239 _ q _ -- will you give a example of a indicator diagram -lrb- illustration : fig 37 -rrb- _ a _ -- fig 37 be a indicator diagram take from a low pressure engine and the wave line _ a b c _ form a sort of irregular parallelogram be that which be describe by the pencil the atmospheric line be represent by the line o o the scale at the side show the pressure of the steam which in this engine rise to about 9 lb per square inch and the vacuum fall to 11 lb the steam begin to be cut off when about one-fourth of the stroke have be perform and the pressure consequently fall 240 _ q _ -- be this species of indicator which you have just describe applicable to locomotive engine _ a _ -- it be no doubt applicable under suitable condition but another species of indicator have be apply by mr gooch to locomotive engine which present several feature of superiority for such a purpose this indicator have its cylinder place horizontally and its piston compress two elliptical spring a slide valve be substitute for a cock to open or close the communication with the engine the top of the piston rod of this indicator be connect to the short arm of a smaller lever to the longer arm of which the pencil be attach and the pencil have thus a considerably larger amount of motion than the piston but it move in the arc of a circle instead of in a straight line the pencil mark on a web of paper which be unwound from one drum and wind on to another so that a succession of diagram be take without the necessity of any intermediate manipulation 241 _ q _ -- these diagram be take with a pencil move in a arc will be of a distorted form _ a _ -- they will not be of the usual form but they may be easily translate into the usual form it be undoubtedly preferable that the indicator should act immediately in the production of the final form of diagram dynamometer gauge and cataract 242 _ q _ -- what other gauge or instrument be there for tell the state or regulate the power of a engine _ a _ -- there be the counter for tell the number of stroke the engine make and the dynamometer for ascertain the tractive power of steam vessel or locomotive then there be the gauge cock and glass tube or float for tell the height of water in the boiler and in pump engine there be the cataract for regulate the speed of the engine 243 _ q _ -- will you describe the mechanism of the counter _ a _ -- the counter consist of a train of wheel work so contrived that by every stroke of the engine a index hand be move forward a certain space whereby the number of stroke make by the engine in any give time be accurately record in most case the motion be communicate by means of a detent -- attach to some reciprocate part of the engine -- to a ratchet wheel which give motion to the other wheel in its slow revolution but it be preferable to derive the motion from some revolving part of the engine by means of a endless screw as where the ratchet be use the detent will sometimes fail to carry it round the proper distance in the counter contrived by mr adie a endless screw work into the rim of two small wheel situate on the same axis but one wheel have a tooth more than the other whereby a differential motion be obtain and the difference in the velocity of the two wheel or they motion upon one another express the number of stroke perform the endless screw be attach to some revolving part of the engine whereby a rotatory motion be impart to it and the wheel into which the screw work hang down from it like a pendulum and be keep stationary by the action of gravity 244 _ q _ -- what be the nature of the dynamometer _ a _ -- the dynamometer employ for ascertain the traction upon railway consist of two flat spring join together at the end by link and the amount of separation of the spring at the center indicate by means of a suitable hand and dial the force of traction a cylinder of oil with a small hole through its piston be sometimes add to this instrument to prevent sudden fluctuation in screw vessel the forward thrust of the screw be measure by a dynamometer construct on the principle of a weigh machine in which a small spring pressure at the index will balance a very great pressure where the thrust be employ and in each case the variation of pressure be record by a pencil on a sheet of paper carry forward by suitable mechanism whereby the mean thrust be easily ascertain the tractive force of paddle wheel steamer be ascertain by a dynamometer fix on shore to which the float vessel be attach by a rope sometimes the power of a engine be ascertain by a friction break dynamometer apply to the shaft 345 _ q _ -- what will determine the amount of thrust show by the dynamometer _ a _ -- in locomotive and in paddle steamer it will be determine by the force turn the wheel and by the smallness of the diameter of the wheel for with small wheel the thrust will be greater than with large wheel in screw vessel the thrust will be determine by the force turn round the screw and by the smallness of the screw 's pitch for with any give force of torsion a fine pitch of screw will give a greater thrust than a coarse pitch of screw just as be the case when a screw work in a solid nut 246 _ q _ -- will you explain the use of the glass gauge affix to the boiler _ a _ -- the glass gauge be tube affix to the front of boiler by the aid of which the height of the water within the boiler be readily ascertainable for the water will stand at the same height in the tube as in the boiler with which there be a communication maintain both at the top and bottom of the tube by suitable stopcock the cock connect the glass tube with the boiler should always be so construct that the tube may be blow through with the steam to clear it of any internal concretion that may impair its transparency and the construction of the socket in which the tube be insert should be such that even when there be steam in the boiler a broken tube may be replace with facility 247 _ q _ -- what then be the gauge cock _ a _ -- the gauge cock be cock penetrate the boiler at different height and which when open tell whether it be water or steam that exist at the level at which they be respectively insert it be unsafe to trust to the glass gauge altogether as a means of ascertain the water level as sometimes they become choke and it be necessary therefore to have gauge cock in addition but if the boiler be short of steam and a partial vacuum be produce within it the glass gauge become of essential service as the gauge cock will not operate in such a case for though open instead of steam and water escape from they the air will rush into the boiler it be expedient to carry a pipe from the lower end of the glass tube downward into the water of the boiler and a pipe from the upper end upward into the steam in the boiler so as to prevent the water from boil down through the tube as it might otherwise do and prevent the level of the water from be ascertainable the average level of water in the boiler should be above the center of the tube and the lowest of the gauge cock should always run water and the highest should always blow steam 248 _ q _ -- be not a float sometimes employ to indicate the level of the water in the boiler _ a _ -- a float for tell the height of water in the boiler be employ only in the case of land boiler and its action be like that of a buoy float on the surface which by means of a light rod pass vertically through the boiler show at what height the water stand the float be usually form of stone or iron and be so counterbalance as to make its operation the same as if it be a buoy of timber and it be generally put in connection with the feed valve so that in proportion as the float rise the supply of feed water be diminish the feed water in land boiler be admit from a small open cistern situate at the top of a upright or stand pipe set upon the boiler and in which there be a column of water sufficiently high to balance the pressure of the steam 249 _ q _ -- what be the cataract which be employ to regulate the speed of pump engine -lrb- illustration : fig 38 -rrb- _ a _ -- the cataract consist of a small pump-plunger _ b _ and barrel set in a cistern of water the barrel be furnish on the one side with a valve _ c _ opening inwards through which the water obtain admission to the pump chamber from the cistern and on the other by a plug _ d _ through which if the plunger be force down the water must pass out of the pump chamber the engine in the upward stroke of the piston which be accomplish by the preponderance of weight at the pump end of the beam raise up the plunger of the cataract by means of a small rod -- the water enter readily through the valve already refer to and when the engine reach the top of the stroke it liberate the rod by which the plunger have be draw up and the plunger then descend by gravity force out the water through the cock the orifice of which have previously be adjust and the plunger in its descent open the injection valve which cause the engine to make a stroke 250 _ q _ -- suppose the cock of the cataract be shut _ a _ -- if the cock of the cataract be shut it be clear that the plunger can not descend at all and as in that case the injection valve can not be open the engine must stand still but if the cock be slightly open the plunger will descend slowly the injection valve will slowly open and the engine will make a gradual stroke as it obtain the water necessary for condensation the extent to which the cock be open therefore will regulate the speed with which the engine work so that by the use of the cataract the speed of the engine may be vary to suit the variation in the quantity of water require to be lift from the mine in some case a air cylinder and in other case a oil cylinder be employ instead of the apparatus just describe but the principle on which the whole of these contrivance operate be identical and the only difference be in the detail 251 _ q _ -- you have now show that the performance of a engine be determinable by the indicator but how do you determine the power of the boiler _ a _ -- by the quantity of water it evaporate there be however no very convenient instrument for determine the quantity of water supply to a boiler and the consequence be that this element be seldom ascertain chapter v proportion of boiler heating and fire grate surface 252 _ q _ -- what be the consideration which must chiefly be attend to in settle the proportion of boiler _ a _ -- in the first place there must be sufficient grate surface to enable the quantity of coal requisite for the production of the steam to be conveniently burnt take into account the intensity of the draught and in the next place there must be a sufficient flue surface readily to absorb the heat thus produce so that there may be no needless waste of heat by the chimney the flue moreover must have such a area and the chimney must be of such dimension as will enable a suitable draught through the fire to be maintain and finally the boiler must be make capable of contain such supplies of water and steam as will obviate inconvenient fluctuation in the water level and abate the risk of water be carry over into the engine with the steam with all these condition the boiler must be as light and compact as possible and must be so contrived as to be capable of be clean and repair with facility 253 _ q _ -- suppose then that you have to proportion a boiler which should be capable of supply steam sufficient to propel a steam vessel or railway train at a give speed or to perform any other give work how would you proceed _ a _ -- i would first ascertain the resistance which have to be overcome and the velocity with which it be necessary to overcome it i should then be in a position to know what pressure and volume of steam be require to overcome the resistance at the prescribe rate of motion and finally i should allow a sufficient heating and fire grate surface in the boiler accord to the kind of boiler it be to furnish the requisite quantity of steam or in other word to evaporate the requisite quantity of water 254 _ q _ -- will you state the amount of heating surface and grate surface necessary to evaporate a give quantity of water _ a _ -- the number of square foot of heating or flue surface require to evaporate a cubic foot of water per hour be about 70 square foot in cornish boiler 8 to 11 square foot in land and marine boiler and 5 or 6 square foot in locomotive boiler the number of square foot of heating surface per square foot of fire grate be from 13 to 15 square foot in wagon boiler about 40 square foot in cornish boiler and from 50 to 90 square foot in locomotive boiler about 80 square foot in locomotive be a very good proportion 255 _ q _ -- what be the heating surface of boiler per horse power _ a _ -- about 9 square foot of flue and furnace surface per horse power be the usual proportion in wagon boiler reckon the total surface as effective surface if the boiler be of a considerable size but in the case of small boiler the proportion be larger the total heating surface of a two horse power wagon boiler be accord to boulton and watt 's proportion 30 square foot or 15 ft per horse power whereas in the case of a 45 horse power boiler the total heating surface be 438 square foot or 96 ft per horse power in marine boiler nearly the same proportion obtain the original boiler of the great western steamer by messr maudslay be proportion with about 10 square foot of flue and furnace surface per horse power reckon the total amount as effective but in the boiler of the retribution by the same maker but of larger size a somewhat smaller proportion of heating surface be adopt boulton and watt have find that in they marine flue boiler 9 square foot of flue and furnace surface be requisite to boil off a cubic foot of water per hour which be the proportion of heating surface that be allow in they land boiler per horse power but inasmuch as in most modern engine and especially in marine engine the nominal considerably exceed the actual power they allow 11 or 12 square foot of heating surface per nominal horse power in they marine boiler and they reckon as effective heating surface the top of the flue and the whole of the side of the flue but hot the bottom for they land engine they still retain mr watt 's standard of power which make the actual and the nominal power identical and a actual horse power be the equivalent of a cubic foot of water raise into steam every hour 256 _ q _ -- what be the proper proportion of fire grate per horse power _ a _ -- boulton and watt allow 064 of a square foot area of grate bar per nominal horse power in they marine boiler and a good effect arise from this proportion but sometimes so large a area of fire grate can not be conveniently get and the proportion of half a square foot per horse power which be the proportion adopt in the original boiler of the great western seem to answer very well in engine work with a moderate pressure and with some expansion and this proportion be now very widely adopt with this allowance there will be 22 to 24 square foot of heating surface per square foot of fire grate and if the consumption of fuel be take at 6 lb per nominal horse power per hour there will be about 12 lb of coal consume per hour on each square foot of grate the furnace should not be more than 6 ft long as if much longer than this it will be impossible to work they properly for any considerable length of time as they will become choke with clinker at the back end 257 _ q _ -- what quantity of fuel be usually consume per hour on each square foot of fire grate _ a _ -- the quantity of fuel burn on each square foot of fire grate per hour vary very much in different boiler in wagon boiler it be from 10 to 13 lb in cornish boiler from 3-1\/2 to 4 lb and in locomotive boiler from 80 to 150 lb but about 1 cwt per hour be a good proportion in locomotive as have be already explain calorimeter and vent 258 _ q _ -- in what manner be the proper sectional area and the proper capacity of the flue of a boiler determine _ a _ -- the proper collective area for the escape of the smoke and flame over the furnace bridge in marine boiler be 19 square inch per nominal horse power accord to boulton and watt 's practice and for the sectional area of the flue they allow 18 square inch per horse power the sectional area of the flue in square inch be what be term the _ calorimeter _ of the boiler and the calorimeter divide by the length of the flue in foot be what be term the _ vent _ in marine flue boiler of good construction the vent vary between the limit of 20 and 25 accord to the size of the boiler and other circumstance -- the largest boiler have generally the largest vent and the calorimeter divide by the vent will give the length of the flue in foot the flue of all flue boiler diminish in they calorimeter as they approach the chimney as the smoke contract in its volume in proportion as it part with its heat 259 _ q _ -- be the method of determine the dimension of a boiler flue by a reference to its vent and calorimeter the method generally pursue _ a _ -- it be boulton and watt 's method but some very satisfactory boiler have be make by allow a proportion of 06 of a square foot of fire grate per nominal horse power and make the sectional area of the flue at the largest part 1\/7th of the area of fire grate and at the smallest part where it enter the chimney 1\/11th of the area of the fire grate these proportion be retain whether the boiler be flue or tubular and from 14 to 16 square foot of tube surface be allow per nominal horse power 260 _ q _ -- be the proportion of vent and calorimeter take by boulton and watt for marine flue boiler applicable also to wagon and tubular boiler _ a _ -- no in wagon and tubular boiler very different proportion prevail yet the proportion of every kind of boiler be determinable on the same general principle in wagon boiler the proportion of the perimeter of the flue which be effective as heating surface be to the total perimeter as 1 to 3 or in some case as 1 to 25 and with any give area of flue therefore the length of the flue must be from 3 to 25 time greater than would be necessary if the total surface be effective else the requisite quantity of heating surface will not be obtain if then the vent be the calorimeter divide by the length and the length be make 3 or 25 time greater the vent must become 3 or 25 time less and in wagon boiler accordingly the vent vary from 8 to 11 instead of from 21 to 25 as in the case of marine flue boiler in tubular marine boiler the calorimeter be usually make only about half the amount allow by boulton and watt for marine flue boiler or in other word the collective sectional area of the tube for the transmission of the smoke be from 8 to 9 square inch per nominal horse power it be better however to make the sectional area larger than this and to work the boiler with the damper sufficiently close to prevent the smoke and flame from rush exclusively through a few of the tube 261 _ q _ -- what be the ordinary dimension of the flue in wagon boiler _ a _ -- in boulton and watt 's 45 horse wagon boiler the area of flue be 18 square inch per horse power but the area per horse power increase very rapidly as the size of the boiler become less and amount to about 80 square inch per horse power in a boiler of 2 horse power some such increase be obviously inevitable if a similar form of flue be retain in the larger and smaller power and at the same time the elongation of the flue in the same proportion as the increase of any other dimension be prevent but in the smaller class of wagon boiler the consideration of facility of clean the flue be also operative in induce a large proportion of sectional area boulton and watt 's 2 horse power wagon boiler have 30 square foot of surface and the flue be 18 inch high above the level of the boiler bottom by 9 inch wide while they 12 horse wagon boiler have 118 square foot of heating surface and the dimension of the flue similarly measure be 36 inch by 13 inch the width of the smaller flue if similarly proportion to the larger one would be 6-1\/2 inch instead of 9 inch and by assume this dimension we should have the same proportion of sectional area per square foot of heating surface in both boiler the length of flue in the 2 horse boiler be 195 ft and in the 12 horse boiler 39 ft so that the length and height of the flue be increase in the same proportion 262 _ q _ -- will you give a example of the proportion of a flue in the case of a marine boiler _ a _ -- the nile steamer with engine of 110 horse power by boulton and watt be supply with steam by two boiler which be therefore of 55 horse power each the height of the flue wind within the boiler be 60 inch and its mean width 16-1\/2 inch make a sectional area or calorimeter of 990 square inch or 18 square inch per horse power of the boiler the length of the flue be 39 ft make the vent 25 which be the vent proper for large boiler in the dee and solway steamer by scott and sinclair the calorimeter be only 972 square inch per horse power in the eagle by caird 119 in the thame and medway by maudslay 1134 and in a great number of other case it do not rise above 12 square inch per horse power but the engine of most of these vessel be intend to operate to a certain extent expansively and the boiler be less powerful in evaporate efficacy on that account 263 _ q _ -- then the chief difference in the proportion establish by boulton and watt and those follow by the other manufacturer you have mention be that boulton and watt set a more powerful boiler to do the same work _ a _ -- that be the main difference the proportion which one part of the boiler bear to another part be very similar in the case cite but the proportion of boiler relatively to the size of the engine vary very materially thus the calorimeter _ of each boiler _ of the dee and solway be 1296 square inch of the eagle 1548 square inch and of the thame and medway 1134 square inch and the length of flue be 57 60 and 52 ft in the boiler respectively which make the respective vent 22-1\/2 25 and 21 take then the boiler of the eagle for comparison with the boiler of the nile as it have the same vent it will be see that the proportion of the two be almost identical for 990 be to 1548 as 39 be to 60 nearly but messr boulton and watt would not have set a boiler like that of the eagle to do so much work 264 _ q _ -- then the evaporate power of the boiler vary as the sectional area of the flue _ a _ -- the evaporate power vary as the square root of the area of the flue if the length of the flue remain the same but it vary as the area simply if the length of the flue be increase in the same proportion as its other dimension the evaporate power of a boiler be referable to the amount of its heating surface and the amount of heating surface in any flue or tube be proportional to the product of the length of the tube and the square root of its sectional area multiply by a certain quantity that be constant for each particular form but in similar tube the length be proportional to the square root of the sectional area therefore in similar tube the amount of heating surface be proportional to the sectional area on this area also depend the quantity of hot air pass through the flue suppose the intensity of the draught to remain unaffected and the quantity of hot air or smoke pass through the flue should vary in the same ratio as the quantity of surface 265 _ q _ -- a boiler therefore to exert four time the power should have four time the extent of heating surface and four time the sectional area of flue for the transmission of the smoke _ a _ -- yes and if the same form of flue be to be retain it should be of twice the diameter and twice the length or twice the height and width if rectangular and twice the length as then the diameter or square root of the area increase in the same ratio as the length the square root of the area divide by the length ought to be a constant quantity in each type of boiler in order that the same proportion of flue may be retain and in wagon boiler without a internal flue the height in inch of the flue encircle the boiler divide by the length of the flue in foot will be 1 very nearly instead of the square root of the area the effective perimeter or outline of that part of the cross section of the flue which be effective in generate steam may be take and the effective perimeter divide by the length ought to be a constant quantity in similar form of flue and with the same velocity of draught whatever the size of the flue may be 266 _ q _ -- will this proportion alter if the form of the flue be change _ a _ -- it be clear that with any give area of flue to increase the perimeter by adopt a different shape be tantamount to a diminution of the length of the flue and if the perimeter be diminish the length of the flue must at the same time be increase else it will be impossible to obtain the necessary amount of heating surface in boulton and watt 's wagon boiler the sectional area of the flue in square inch per square foot of heating surface be 54 in the two horse boiler in the three horse it be 474 in the four horse 435 six horse 375 eight horse 433 ten horse 396 twelve horse 363 eighteen horse 317 thirty horse 252 and in the forty-five horse boiler 205 square inch take the amount of heating surface in the 45 horse boiler at 9 square foot per horse power we obtain 18 square inch of sectional area of flue per horse power which be also boulton and watt 's proportion of sectional area for marine boiler with internal flue 267 _ q _ -- if to increase the perimeter of a flue be virtually to diminish the length then a tubular boiler where the perimeter be in effect greatly extend ought to have but a short length of tube _ a _ -- the flue of the nile steamer if reduce to the cylindrical form would be 35-1\/2 inch in diameter to have the same area but it would then require to be make 47-3\/4 foot long to have the same amount of heating surface exclude the bottom as non-effective supposing that with these proportion the heat be sufficiently extract from the smoke then every tube of a tubular boiler in which the same draught exist ought to have very nearly the same proportion 268 _ q _ -- but what be the best proportion of the part of tubular boiler relatively with one another _ a _ -- the proper relative proportion of the part of tubular boiler may easily be ascertain by a reference to the settle proportion of flue boiler for the same general principle be operative in both case in the nile steamer each boiler of 55 horse power have about 497 square foot of flue surface or 9 square foot per horse power reckon the total surface as effective the area of the flue which be rectangular be 990 square inch therefore the area be equal to that of a tube 35-1\/2 inch in diameter and such a tube to have a heating surface of 497 square foot must be 534 foot or 6408 inch in length the length therefore of the tube will be about 18 time its diameter and with the same velocity of draught these proportion must obtain whatever the absolute dimension of the tube may be with a calorimeter therefore of 18 square inch per horse power the length of a tube 3 inch diameter must not exceed 4 foot 6 inch since the heat will be sufficiently extract from the smoke in this length if the smoke only travel at the velocity due to a calorimeter of 18 square inch per horse power 269 _ q _ -- be this then the maximum length of flue which can be use in tubular boiler with advantage _ a _ -- by no mean the tube of tubular boiler be almost always more than 4 foot 6 inch long but then the calorimeter be almost always less than 18 square inch per horse power -- generally about two third of this indeed tubular boiler with a large calorimeter be not find to be so satisfactory as where the calorimeter be small partly from the propensity of the smoke in such case to pass through a few of the tube instead of the whole of they and partly from the deposit of soot which take place when the draught be sluggish it be a very confusing practice however to speak of nominal horse power in connection with boiler since that be a quantity quite indeterminate evaporative power of boiler 270 _ q _ -- the main thing after all in boiler be they evaporative power _ a _ -- the proportion of tubular boiler as of all boiler should obviously have reference to the evaporation require whereas the demand upon the boiler for steam be very often reckon contingent upon the nominal horse power of the engine and as the nominal power of a engine be a conventional quantity by no means in uniform proportion to the actual quantity of steam consume perplexing complication as to the proper proportion of boiler have in consequence spring up to which most of the failure in that department of engineering may be imputed it be highly expedient therefore in plan boiler for any particular engine to consider exclusively the actual power require to be produce and to apportion the capability of the boiler accordingly 271 _ q _ -- in other word you would recommend the inquiry to be restricted to the mode of evaporate a give number of cubic foot of water in the hour instead of embrace the problem how a engine of a give nominal power be to be supply with steam _ a _ -- i would first as i have already state consider the actual power require to be produce and then fix the amount of expansion to be adopt if the engine have to work up to three time its nominal power as be now common in marine engine i should either increase correspondingly the quantity of evaporate surface in the boiler or adopt such a amount of expansion as would increase threefold the efficacy of the steam or combine in a modify manner both of these arrangement reckon the evaporation of a cubic foot of water in the hour as equivalent to a actual horse power and allow a square yard or 9 square foot as the proper proportion of flue surface to evaporate a cubic foot of water in the hour it be clear that i must either give 27 square foot of heating surface in the boiler to have a trebled power without expansion or i must cut off the steam at one seventh of the stroke to obtain a three-fold power without increase the quantity of heating surface by cut off the steam however at one third of the stroke a heating surface of 13-1\/2 square foot will give a threefold power and it will usually be the most judicious course to carry the expansion as far as possible and then to add the proportion of heating surface necessary to make good the deficiency still find to exist 272 _ q _ -- but be it certain that a cubic foot of water evaporate in the hour be equivalent to a actual horse power _ a _ -- a actual horse power as fix by watt be 33000 lb raise one foot high in the minute and in watt 's 40 horse power engine with a 31-1\/2 inch cylinder 7 foot stroke and make 17-1\/2 stroke a minute the effective pressure be 692 lb on the square inch clear of all deduction now as a horse power be 33000 lb raise one foot high and as there be 692 lb on the square inch it be clear that 33000 divide by 692 on 4768 square inch with 692 lb on each if lift 1 foot or 12 inch high will also be equal to a horse power but 4768 square inch multiply by 12 inch in height be 572244 cubic inch or 331 cubic foot and this be the quantity of steam which must be expend per minute to produce a actual horse power 273 _ q _ -- but be 33 cubic foot of steam expend per minute equivalent to a cubic foot of water expend in the hour _ a _ -- not precisely but nearly so a cubic foot of water produce 1669 cubic foot of steam of the atmospheric density of 15 lb per square inch whereas a consumption of 33 cubic foot of steam in the minute be 1980 cubic foot in the hour in watt 's engine about one tenth be reckon as loss in fill the waste space at the top and bottom of the cylinder make 1872 cubic foot as the quantity consume per hour without this waste and in modern engine the waste at the end of the cylinder be inconsiderable 274 _ q _ -- what power be generate by a cubic foot of water in the case of the albion mill engine when work without expansion _ a _ -- in the albion mill engine when work without expansion it be find that 1 lb of water in the shape of steam raise 28489 lb 1 foot high a cubic foot of water therefore or 62-1\/2 lb if consume in the hour would raise 17805625 lb one foot high in the hour or would raise 29676 lb one foot high in a minute and if to this we add one tenth for waste at the end of the cylinder a waste which hardly exist in modern engine we have 32643 lb raise one foot high in the minute or a horse power very nearly in some case the approximation appear still nearer thus in a 40 horse engine work without expansion watt find that 674 foot of water be evaporate from the boiler per minute which be just a cubic foot per horse power per hour but it be not certain in this case that the nominal and actual power be precisely identical it will be quite safe however to reckon a actual horse power as producible by the evaporation of a cubic foot of water in the hour in the case of engine work without expansion and for boil off this quantity in flue or wagon boiler about 8 lb of coal will be require and 9 square foot of flue surface modern marine and locomotive boiler 275 _ q _ -- these proportion appear chiefly to refer to old boiler i wish you to state what be the proportion of modern flue and tubular marine boiler _ a _ -- in modern marine boiler the area of fire grate be less than in mr watt 's original boiler where it be one square foot to nine square foot of heating surface the heat in the furnace be consequently more intense and a somewhat less amount of surface suffice to evaporate a cubic foot of water in boulton and watt 's modern flue boiler they allow for the evaporation of a cubic foot of water 8 square foot of heating surface 70 square inch of fire grate 13 square inch sectional area of flue 6 square inch sectional area of chimney 14 square inch area over furnace bridge ratio of area of flue to area of fire grate 1 to 54 to evaporate a cubic foot of water per hour in tubular boiler the proportion be -- heating surface 9 square foot fire grate 70 square inch sectional area of tube 10 square inch sectional area of back uptake 12 square inch sectional area of front uptake 10 square inch sectional area of chimney 7 square inch ratio of diameter of tube to length of tube 1\/28th to 1\/30th cubical content of boiler exclusive of steam chest 65 cubic foot cubical content of steam chest 15 cubic foot 276 _ q _ -- these proportion do not apply to locomotive boiler _ a _ -- not at all in locomotive boiler the draught be maintain by the projection of the waste steam which escape from the cylinder up the chimney and the draught be much more powerful and the combustion much more rapid than in case in which the combustion be maintain by the natural draught of a chimney except indeed the chimney be of very unusual temperature and height the proportion proper for locomotive boiler will be see by the dimension of a few locomotive of approve construction which have be find to give satisfactory result in practice and which be record in the follow table : name of engine great britain palla snake sphinx diameter of cylinder 18 in 15 in 14-1\/4 in 18 in length of stroke 24 in 20 in 21 in 24 in diameter of drive wheel 8 ft 6 ft 6-1\/2 ft 5

surface of tube 1627 sqft 6687 sqft 823 sq ft 864 sq ft the blast in locomotive 277 _ q _ -- what be the amount of draught produce in locomotive boiler in comparison with that exist in other boiler _ a _ -- a good chimney of a land engine will produce a degree of exhaustion equal to from 1-1\/2 to 2-1\/2 inch of water in locomotive boiler the exhaustion be in some case equal to 12 or 13 inch of water but from 3 to 6 inch be a more common proportion 278 _ q _ -- and what force of blast be necessary to produce this exhaustion _ a _ -- the amount vary in different engine depend on the sectional area of the tube and other circumstance but on the average it may be assert that such a pressure of blast as will support a inch of mercury will maintain sufficient exhaustion in the smoke box to support a inch of water and this ratio hold whether the exhaustion be little or great to produce a exhaustion in the smoke box therefore of 6 inch of water the waste steam would require to be of sufficient pressure to support a column of 6 inch of mercury which be equivalent to a pressure of 3 lb on the square inch 279 _ q _ -- how be the force of the blast determine _ a _ -- by the amount of contraction give to the mouth of the blast pipe which be a pipe which conduct the waste steam from the cylinder and debouch at the foot of the chimney if a strong blast be require the mouth of this pipe require to be correspondingly contract but such contraction throw a back pressure on the piston and it be desirable to obtain the necessary draught with as little contraction of the blast pipe as possible the blast pipe be generally a breeches pipe of which the leg join just before reach the chimney but it be better to join the two cylinder below and to let a single pipe ascend to within 12 or 18 inch of the foot of the chimney if make with too short a piece of pipe above the join the steam will be project against each side of the chimney alternately and the draught will be damage and the chimney wear the blast pipe should not be regularly taper but should be large in the body and gather in at the mouth 280 _ q _ -- be a large and high chimney conducive to strength of draught in locomotive _ a _ -- it have not be find to be so a chimney of three or four times its own diameter in height appear to answer fully as well as a longer one and it be find that when in a engine with 17 inch cylinder a chimney of 15-1\/4 inch be substitute for a chimney of 17-1\/2 inch a superior performance be the result the chimney of a locomotive should have half the area of the tube at the ferule which be the most contract part and the blast orifice should have 1\/10th of the area of the chimney the sectional area of the tube through the ferule should be as large as possible tube without ferule it be find pass one fourth more air and tube with ferule only at the smoke box end pass one tenth more air than when there be ferule at both end 281 _ q _ -- be the exhaustion produce by the blast as great in the fire box as in the smoke box _ a _ -- experiment have be make to determine this and in few case have it be find to be more than about half as great as ordinary speed but much depend on the amount of contraction in the tube in a experiment make with a engine have 147 tube of 1-3\/4 inch external diameter and 13 foot 10 inch long and with a fire grate have a area of 9-1\/2 square foot the exhaustion at all speed be find to be three time greater in the smoke box than in the fire box the exhaustion in the smoke box be generally equivalent to 12 inch of water while in the fire box it be equivalent to only 4 inch of water show that 4 inch be require to draw the air through the grate and 8 inch through the tube 282 _ q _ -- what will be the increase of evaporation in a locomotive from a give increase of exhaustion _ a _ -- the rate of evaporation in a locomotive or any other boiler will vary as the quantity of air pass through the fire and the quantity of air pass through the fire will vary nearly as the square root of the exhaustion with four time the exhaustion therefore there will be about twice the evaporation and experiment show that this theoretical law hold with tolerable accuracy in practice 283 _ q _ -- but the same exhaustion will not be produce by a give strength of blast in all engine _ a _ -- no engine with contract fire grate and a inadequate sectional area of tube will require a stronger blast than engine of better proportion but in any give engine the relation between the blast exhaustion and evaporation hold which have be already define 284 _ q _ -- be the intensity of the draught under easy regulation _ a _ -- the intensity of the draught may easily be diminish by partially close the damper in the chimney and it may be increase by contract the orifice of the blast a variable blast pipe the orifice of which may be enlarged or contract at pleasure have be much use there be various device for this purpose but the best appear to be that adopt in stephenson 's engine where a conical nozzle be move up or down within the blast pipe which be make somewhat larger in diameter than the base of the cone but with a ring project internally against which the base of the cone abut when the nozzle be push up when the nozzle stand at the top of the pipe the whole of the steam have to pass through it and the intensity of the blast be increase by the increase velocity thus give to the steam whereas when the nozzle be move downward the steam escape through the annular opening leave between the nozzle and the pipe as well as through the nozzle itself and the intensity of the blast be diminish by the enlargement of the opening for the escape of the steam thus make available 285_q _ -- what be the best diameter for the tube of locomotive boiler _ a _ -- bury 's locomotive with 14 inch cylinder contain 92 tube of 2-1\/8 th inch external diameter and 10 foot 6 inch long whereas stephenson 's locomotive with 15 inch cylinder contain 150 tube of 1-5\/8 th external diameter 13 foot 6 inch long in stephenson 's boiler in order that the part of the tube next the chimney may be of any avail for the generation of steam the draught have to be very intense which in its turn involve a considerable expenditure of power and it be questionable whether the increase expenditure of power upon the blast in stephenson 's long tubed locomotive be compensate by the increase generation of steam consequent upon the extension of the heating surface when the tube be small in diameter they be apt to become partially choke with piece of coke but a internal diameter of 1-5\/8 th may be employ without inconvenience if the draught be of medium intensity 286 _ q _ -- will you illustrate the relation between the length and diameter of locomotive tube by a comparison with the proportion of flue in flue boiler _ a _ -- in most locomotive the velocity of the draught be such that it would require very long tube to extract the heat from the product of combustion if the heat be transmit through the metal of the tube with only the same facility as through the iron of ordinary flue boiler the nile steamer with engine of 110 nominal horse power each and with two boiler have two independent flue in each of such dimension as to make each flue equivalent to 55 nominal horse power work at 62 per cent above the nominal power so that the actual evaporative efficacy of each flue would be equivalent to 89 actual horse power suppose the engine to operate without expansion but as the mean pressure in the cylinder be somewhat less than the initial pressure the evaporative efficacy of each flue may be reckon equivalent to 80 actual horse power with this evaporative power there be a calorimeter of 990 square inch or 123 square inch per actual horse power whereas in stephenson 's locomotive with 150 tube if the evaporative power be take at 200 cubic foot of water in the hour which be a large supposition the engine will be equal to 200 actual horse power if the internal diameter of the tube be take at thirteen eighth of a inch the calorimeter per actual horse power will only be 11136 square inch or in other word the calorimeter in the locomotive boiler will be 1111 time less than in the flue boiler for the same power so that the draught in the locomotive must be 1111 time stronger and the ratio of the length of the tube to its diameter 1111 time greater than in the flue boiler suppose the heat to be transmit with only the same facility the flue of the nile would require to be 35 - 1\/2 inch in diameter if make of the cylindrical form and 47-3\/4 foot long the tube of a locomotive if 1-3\/8 th inch diameter would only require to be 2219 inch long with the same velocity of draught but as the draught be 1111 time faster than in a flue boiler the tube ought to be 246558 inch or about 20-1\/2 foot long accord to this proportion in practice however they be one third less than this which reduce the heating surface from 9 to 6 square foot per actual horse power and this length even be find to be inconvenient it be greatly preferable therefore to increase the calorimeter and diminish the intensity of the draught boiler chimney 287 _ q _ -- by what process do you ascertain the dimension of the chimney of a land boiler _ a _ -- by a reference to the volume of air it be necessary in a give time to supply to the burning fuel and to the velocity of motion produce by the rarefaction in the chimney for the area of the chimney require to be such that with the velocity due to that rarefaction the quantity of air requisite for the combustion of the fuel shall pass through the furnace in the specify time thus if 200 cubic foot of air of the atmospheric density be require for the combustion of a pound of coal -- though 250 lb be nearer the quantity generally require -- and 10 lb of coal per horse power per hour be consume by a engine then 2000 cubic foot of air must be supply to the furnace per horse power per hour and the area of the chimney must be such as to deliver this quantity at the increase bulk due to the high temperature of the chimney when move with the velocity the rarefaction within the chimney occasion and which in small chimney be usually such as to support a column of half a inch of water the velocity with which a denser fluid flow into a rarer one be equal to the velocity a heavy body acquire in fall through a height equal to the difference of altitude of two column of the heavier fluid of such height as will produce the respective pressure and therefore when the difference of pressure or amount of rarefaction in the chimney be know it be easy to tell the velocity of motion which ought to be produce by it in practice however these theoretical result be not to be trust until they have receive such modification as will make they representative of the practice of the most experienced constructor 288 _ q _ -- what then be the rule follow by the most experienced constructor _ a _ -- boulton and watt 's rule for the dimension of the chimney of a land engine be as follow : -- multiply the number of pound of coal consume under the boiler per hour by 12 and divide the product by the square root of the height of the chimney in foot the quotient be the area of the chimney in square inch in the smallest part a factory chimney suitable for a 20 horse boiler be commonly make about 20 in square inside and 80 ft high and these dimension be those which answer to a consumption of 15 lb of coal per horse power per hour which be a very common consumption in factory engine if 15 lb of coal be consume per horse power per hour the total consumption per hour in a 20 horse boiler will be 300 lb and 300 multiply by 12 = 3600 and divide by 9 -lrb- the square root of the height -rrb- = 400 which be the area of the chimney in square inch it will not answer well to increase the height of a chimney of this area to more than 40 or 50 yard without also increase the area nor will it be of utility to increase the area much without also increase the height the quantity of coal consume per hour in pound multiply by 5 and divide by the square root of the height of the chimney be the proper collective area of the opening between the bar of the grate for the admission of air to the fire 289 _ q _ -- be this rule applicable to the chimney of steam vessel _ a _ -- in steam vessel boulton and watt have heretofore be in the habit of allow 8-1\/2 square inch of area of chimney per horse power but they now allow 6 square inch to 7 square inch in some steam vessel a steam blast like that of a locomotive but of a smaller volume be use in the chimney and many of the evil of a boiler deficient in draught may be remedy by this expedient but a steam blast in a low pressure engine occasion a obvious waste of steam it also make a unpleasant noise and in steam vessel it frequently produce the inconvenience of carry the smaller part of the coal up the chimney and scatter it over the deck among the passenger it be advisable therefore to give a sufficient calorimeter in all low pressure boiler and a sufficient height of chimney to enable the chimney to operate without a steam jet but it be useful to know that a steam jet be a resource in the case of a defective boiler or where the boiler have to be urge beyond its power steam room and priming 290 _ q _ -- what be the capacity of steam room allow in boiler per horse power _ a _ -- the capacity of steam room allow by boulton and watt in they land wagon boiler be 8-3\/4 cubic foot per horse power in the two horse power boiler and 5-3\/4 cubic foot in the 20 horse power boiler and in the larger class of boiler such as those suitable for 30 and 45 horse power engine the capacity of the steam room do not fall below this amount and indeed be nearer 6 than 5-3\/4 cubic foot per horse power the content of water be 18-1\/2 cubic foot per horse power in the two horse power boiler and 15 cubic foot per horse power in the 20 horse power boiler 291 _ q _ -- be this the proportion boulton and watt allow in they marine boiler _ a _ -- boulton and watt in they early steam vessel be in the habit of allow for the capacity of the steam space in marine boiler 16 time the content of the cylinder but as there be two cylinder this be equivalent to 8 time the content of both cylinder which be the proportion commonly follow in land engine and which agree very nearly with the proportion of between 5 and 6 cubic foot of steam room per horse power already refer to take for example a engine with 23 inch diameter of cylinder and 4 foot stroke which will be 184 horse power -- the area of the cylinder will be 415476 square inch which multiply by 48 the number of inch in the stroke will give 19942848 for the capacity of the cylinder in cubic inch 8 time this be 159542784 cubic inch or 923 cubic foot 923 divide by 184 be rather more than 5 cubic foot per horse power 292 _ q _ -- be the production of the steam in the boiler uniform throughout the stroke of the engine _ a _ -- it vary with the slight variation in the pressure within the boiler throughout the stroke usually the larger part of the steam be produce during the first part of the stroke of the engine for there be then the largest demand for steam as the steam be commonly cut off somewhat before the end of the stroke the pressure rise somewhat in the boiler during that period and little steam be then produce there be less necessity that the steam space should be large when the flow of steam from the boiler be very uniform as it will be where there be two engine attach to the boiler at right angle with one another or where the engine work at a great speed as in the case of locomotive engine a high steam chest too by render boil over into the steam pipe or priming as it be call more difficult obviate the necessity for so large a steam space as do also a perforated steam pipe stretch through the length of the boiler so as not to take the steam from one place the use of steam of a high pressure work expansively have the same operation so that in modern marine boiler of the tubular construction where the whole or most of these modify circumstance exist there be no necessity for so large a proportion of steam room as 5 or 6 cubic foot per nominal horse power and about one 1-1\/2 or 2 cubic foot of steam room per cubic foot of water evaporate more nearly represent the general practice 293 _ q _ -- be this the proportion of steam room adopt in locomotive boiler _ a _ -- no in locomotive boiler the proportion of steam room per cubic foot of water evaporate be considerably less even than this it do not usually exceed 1\/5 of a cubic foot per cubic foot of water evaporate and with clean water with a steam dome a few foot high set on the barrel of the boiler or with a perforated pipe stretch from end to end of the barrel and with the steam room divide about equally between the barrel and the fire box very little priming be find to occur even with this small proportion of total steam room about 3\/4 the depth of the barrel be usually fill with water and 1\/4 with steam 294 _ q _ -- what be prime _ a _ -- priming be a violent agitation of the water within the boiler in consequence of which a large quantity of water pass off with the steam in the shape of froth or spray such a result be injurious both as regard the efficacy of the engine and the safety of the engine and boiler for the large volume of hot water carry by the steam into the condenser impair the vacuum and throw a great load upon the air pump which diminish the speed and available power of the engine and the existence of water within the cylinder unless there be safety valve upon the cylinder to permit its escape will very probably cause some part of the machinery to break by suddenly arrest the motion of the piston when it meet the surface of the water -- the slide valve be close to the condenser before the termination of the stroke in all engine with lap upon the valve so that the water within the cylinder be prevent from escape in that direction at the same time the boiler be empty of its water too rapidly for the feed pump to be able to maintain the supply and the flue be in danger of be burn from a deficiency of water above they 295 _ q _ -- what be the cause of priming _ a _ -- the cause of priming be a insufficient amount of steam room a inadequate area of water level a insufficient width between the flue or tube for the ascent of the steam and the descent of water to supply the vacuity the steam occasion and the use of dirty water in the boiler new boiler prime more than old boiler and steamer enter river from the sea be more addict to priming than if sea or river water have alone be use in the boiler -- probably from the boiling point of salt water be higher than that of fresh whereby the salt water act like so much molten metal in raise the fresh water into steam open the safety valve suddenly may make a boiler prime and if the safety valve be situate near the mouth of the steam pipe the spray or foam thus create may be mingle with the steam pass into the engine and materially diminish its effective power but if the safety valve be situate at a distance from the mouth of the steam pipe the quantity of foam or spray passing into the engine may be diminish by open the safety valve and in locomotive therefore it be find beneficial to have a safety valve on the barrel of the boiler at a point remote from the steam chest by partially open which any priming in that part of the boiler adjacent to the steam chest be check and a purer steam than before puss to the engine 296 _ q _ -- what be the proper remedy for priming _ a _ -- when a boiler prime the engineer generally close the throttle valve partially turn off the injection water and open the furnace door whereby the generation of steam be check and a less violent ebullition in the boiler suffice where the priming arise from a insufficient amount of steam room it may be mitigate by put a higher pressure upon the boiler and work more expansively or by the interposition of a perforated plate between the boiler and the steam chest which break the ascend water and liberate the steam in some case however it may be necessary to set a second steam chest on the top of the exist one and it will be preferable to establish a communication with this new chamber by means of a number of small hole bore through the iron plate of the boiler rather than by a single large orifice where priming arise from the existence of dirty water in the boiler the evil may be remedy by the use of collect vessel or by blow off largely from the surface and where it arise from a insufficient area of water level or a insufficient width between the flue for the free ascent of the steam and the descent of the superincumbent water the evil may be abate by the addition of circulate pipe in some part of the boiler which will allow the water to descend freely to the place from whence the steam rise the width of the water space be virtually increase by restrict they function to the transmission of a current of steam and water to the surface it be desirable to arrange the heating surface in such a way that the feed water enter the boiler at its lowest point be heated gradually as it ascend until toward the superior part of the flue it be raise gradually into steam but in all case there will be current in the boiler for which it be proper to provide the steam pipe proceeding to the engine should obviously be attach to the highest point of the steam chest in boiler of every construction 297 _ q _ -- have now state the proportion proper to be adopt for evaporate any give quantity of water in steam boiler will you proceed to show how you would proportion a boiler to do a give amount of work say a locomotive boiler which will propel a train of 100 ton weight at a speed of 50 mile a hour _ a _ -- accord to experiment on the resistance of railway train at various rate of speed make by mr gooch of the great western railway it appear that a train weigh with locomotive tender and carriage about 100 ton experience at a speed of 50 mile a hour a resistance of about 3000 lb or about 30 lb per ton which resistance include the resistance of the engine as well as that of the train this therefore be the force which must be impart at the circumference of the drive wheel except that small part intercept by the engine itself and the force exert by the piston must be greater than that at the circumference of the drive wheel in the proportion of they slower motion or in the proportion of the circumference of the drive wheel to the length of a double stroke of the engine if the diameter of the drive wheel be 5-1\/2 foot its circumference will be 17278 foot and if the length of the stroke be 18 inch the length of a double stroke will be 3 foot the pressure on the piston must therefore be greater than the traction at the circumference of the drive wheel in the proportion of 17278 to 3 or in other word the mean pressure on the piston must be 17278 lb and the area of cylinder and pressure of steam must be such as to produce conjointly this total pressure it thus become easy to tell the volume and pressure of steam require which steam in its turn represent its equivalent of water which be to be evaporate from the boiler and the boiler must be so proportion by the rule already give as to evaporate this water freely in the case of a steam vessel the mode of procedure be the same and when the resistance and speed be know it be easy to tell the equivalent value of steam strength of boiler 298 _ q _ -- what strain should the iron of boiler be subject to in work _ a _ -- the iron of boiler like the iron of machine or structure be capable of withstand a tensile strain of from 50000 to 60000 lb upon every square inch of section but it will only bear a third of this strain without permanent derangement of structure and it do not appear expedient in any boiler to let the strain exceed 4000 lb upon the square inch of sectional area of metal especially if it be liable to be weaken by corrosion 299_q _ -- have any experiment be make to determine the strength of boiler _ a _ -- the question of the strength of boiler be investigate very elaborately a few year ago by a committee of the franklin institute in america and it be find that the tenacity of boiler plate increase with the temperature up to 550  at which point the tenacity begin to diminish at 32  the cohesive force of a square inch of section be 56000 lb at 570  it be 66500 lb at 720  55000 lb at 1050  32000 lb at 1240  22000 lb and at 1317  9000 lb copper follow a different law and appear to be diminish in strength by every addition to the temperature at 32  the cohesion of copper be find to be 32800 lb per square inch of section which exceed the cohesive force at any higher temperature and the square of the diminution of strength seem to keep pace with the cube of the increase temperature strip of iron cut in the direction of the fiber be find to be about 6 per cent stronger than when cut across the grain repeat pile and welding be find to increase the tenacity of the iron but the result of welding together different kind of iron be not find to be favorable the accidental overheating of a boiler be find to reduce the ultimate or maximum strength of the plate from 65000 to 45000 lb per square inch of section and riveting the plate be find to occasion a diminution in they strength to the extent of one third these result however be not precisely the same as those obtain by mr fairbairn 300 _ q _ -- what be the result obtain by he _ a _ -- he find that boiler plate bear a tensile strain of 23 ton per square inch before rupture which be reduce to 16 ton per square inch when join together by a double row of rivet and 13 ton or about 30000 when join together by a single row of rivet a circular boiler therefore with the end of its plate double rivet will bear at the utmost about 36000 lb per square inch of section or about 12000 lb per square inch of section without permanent derangement of structure 301 _ q _ -- what pressure do cylindrical boiler sustain in practice _ a _ -- in some locomotive boiler which be work with a pressure of 80 lb upon the square inch the thickness of the plate be only 5\/16ths of a inch while the barrel of the boiler be 39 inch in diameter it will require a length of 32 inch of the boiler when the plate be 5\/16ths thick to make up a sectional area of one square inch and the separate force will be 39 time 32 multiply by 80 which make the separate force 9984 lb sustain by two square inch of sectional area -- one on each side or the strain be 4992 lb per square inch of sectional area which be quite as great strain as be advisable the accession of strength derive from the boiler end be not here take into account but neither be the weakening effect count that be cause by the rivet hole some locomotive of 4 foot diameter of barrel and of 3\/8ths iron have be work to as high a pressure as 200 lb on the inch but such feat of daring be neither to be imitate nor commend 302_q _ -- can you give a rule for the proper thickness of cylindrical boiler _ a _ -- the thickness proper for cylindrical boiler of work iron expose to a internal pressure may be find by the follow rule : -- multiply 254 time the internal diameter of the cylinder in inch by the greatest pressure within the cylinder per circular inch and divide by 17800 the result be the thickness in inch if we apply this rule to the example of the locomotive boiler just give we have 39 x 254 x 62832 -lrb- the pressure per circular inch correspond to 80 lb per square inch -rrb- = 62241379 and this divide by 17800 give 0349 as the thickness in inch instead of 03125 or 5\/16ths the actual thickness if we take the pressure per square inch instead of per circular inch we obtain the follow rule which be somewhat simpler : -- multiply the internal diameter of the cylinder in inch by the pressure in pound per square inch and divide the product by 8900 the result be the thickness in inch both these rule give the strain about one fourth of the elastic force or 4450 lb per square inch of sectional area of the iron but 3000 lb be enough when the flame impinge directly on the iron as in some of the ordinary cylindrical boiler and the rule may be adapt for that strain by take 6000 as a divisor instead of 8900 303 _ q _ -- in marine and wagon boiler which be not of a cylindrical form how do you procure the requisite strength _ a _ -- where the side of the boiler be flat instead of be cylindrical a sufficient number of stay must be introduce to withstand the pressure and it be expedient not to let the strain upon these stay be more than 3000 lb per square inch of section as the strength of internal stay in boiler be generally soon diminish by corrosion indeed a strain at all approach that upon locomotive boiler would be very unsafe in the case of marine boiler on account of the corrosion both internal and external to which marine boiler be subject the stay should be small and numerous rather than large and few in number as when large stay be employ it be difficult to keep they tight at the end and oxidation of the shell follow from leakage at the end of the stay all boiler should be prove when new to twice or three time the pressure they be intend to bear and they should be prove occasionally by the hand pump when in use to detect any weakness which corrosion may have occasion 304 _ q _ -- will you describe the disposition of the stay in a marine boiler _ a _ -- if the pressure of steam be 20 lb on the square inch which be a very common pressure in tubular boiler there will be a pressure of 2880 lb on every square foot of flat surface so that if the strain upon the stay be not to exceed 3000 lb on the square inch of section there must be nearly a square inch of sectional area of stay for every square foot of flat surface on the top and bottom side and end of the boiler this very much exceed the proportion usually adopt and in scarcely any instance be boiler stay sufficiently to be safe when the shell be compose of flat surface the furnace should be stay together with bolt of the best scrap iron 1-1\/4 inch in diameter tap through both plate of the water space with thin nut in each furnace and it be expedient to make the row of stay run horizontally near the level of the bar sufficiently low to come beneath the top of the bar so as to be shield from the action of the fire with which view they should follow the inclination of the bar the row of stay between the level of the bar and the top of the furnace should be as near the top of the furnace as will consist with the function they have to perform so as to be remove as far as possible from the action of the heat and to support the furnace top cross bar may either be adopt to which the top be secure with bolt as in the case of locomotive or stay tap into the furnace top with a thin nut beneath may be carry to the top of the boiler but very little dependence can be put in such stay as stay for keep down the top of the boiler and the top of the boiler must therefore be stay nearly as much as if the stay connect it with the furnace crown do not exist the large rivet pass through thimble sometimes use as stay for water space or boiler shell be objectionable as from the great amount of hammer such rivet have to receive to form the head the iron become crystalline so that the head be liable to come off and indeed sometimes fly off in the act of be form if such a fracture occur between the boiler after they be seat in they place or in any position not accessible from the outside it will in general be necessary to empty the faulty boiler and repair the defect from the inside 305 _ q _ -- what should be the pitch or numerical distribution of the stay _ a _ -- the stay where the side of the boiler be flat and the pressure of the steam be from 20 to 30 lb should be pitch about a foot or 18 inch asunder and in the wake of the tube where stay can not be carry across to connect the boiler side angle iron rib like the rib of a ship should be rivet to the interior of the boiler and stay of greater strength than the rest should pass across above and below the tube to which the angle iron would communicate the strain the whole of the long stay within a boiler should be firmly rivet to the shell as if build with and form a part of it as by the common method of fix they in by means of cutter the decay or accidental detachment of a pin or cutter may endanger the safety of the boiler wherever a large perforation in the shell of any circular boiler occur a sufficient number of stay should be put across it to maintain the original strength and where stay be intercept by the root of the funnel short stay in continuation of they should be place inside boiler explosion 306 _ q _ -- what be the chief cause of boiler explosion _ a _ -- the chief cause of boiler explosion be undoubtedly too great a pressure of steam or a insufficient strength of boiler but many explosion have also arise from the flue have be suffer to become red hot if the safety valve of a boiler be accidentally jam or if the plate or stay be much worn by corrosion while a high pressure of steam be nevertheless maintain the boiler necessarily burst and if from a insufficiency of water in the boiler or from any other cause the flue become highly heat they may be force down by the pressure of the steam and a partial explosion may be the result the worst explosion be where the shell of the boiler burst but the collapse of a furnace or flue be also very disastrous generally to the person in the engine room and sometimes the shell burst and the flue collapse at the same time for if the flue get red hot and water be throw upon they either by the feed pump or otherwise the generation of steam may be too rapid for the safety valve to permit its escape with sufficient facility and the shell of the boiler may in consequence be rent asunder sometimes the iron of the flue become highly heat in consequence of the improper configuration of the part which by retain the steam in contact with the metal prevent the access of the water : the bottom of large flue upon which the flame beat down be very liable to injury from this cause and the iron of flue thus act upon may be so soften that the flue will collapse upward with the pressure of the steam the flue of boiler may also become red hot in some part from the attachment of scale which from its imperfect conduct power will cause the iron to be unduly heated and if the scale be accidentally detach a partial explosion may occur in consequence 307 _ q _ -- do the contact of water with heated metal occasion a instantaneous generation of steam _ a _ -- it be find that a sudden disengagement of steam do not immediately follow the contact of water with the hot metal for water throw upon red hot iron be not immediately convert into steam but assume the spheroidal form and roll about in globule over the surface these globule however high the temperature of the metal may be on which they be place never rise above the temperature of 205  and give off but very little steam but if the temperature of the metal be lower the water cease to retain the spheroidal form and come into intimate contact with the metal whereby a rapid disengagement of steam take place if water be pour into a very hot copper flask the flask may be cork up as there will be scarce any steam produce so long as the high temperature be maintain but so soon as the temperature be suffer to fall below 350  or 400  the spheroidal condition be no longer maintainable steam be generate with rapidity and the cork will be project from the mouth of the flask with great force 308 _ q _ -- what precaution can be take to prevent boiler explosion _ a _ -- one useful precaution against the explosion of boiler from too great a internal pressure consist in the application of a steam gauge to each boiler which will make the existence of any undue pressure in any of the boiler immediately visible and every boiler should have a safety valve of its own the passage lead to which should have no connection with the passage lead to any of the stop valve use to cut off the connection between the boiler so that the action of the safety valve may be make independent of the action of the stop valve in some case stop valve have jam or have be carry from they seat into the mouth of the pipe communicate between they and the action of the safety valve should be render independent of all such accident safety valve themselves sometimes stick fast from corrosion from the spindle become bent from a distortion of the boiler top with a high pressure in consequence of which the spindle become jam in the guide and from various other cause which it would be tedious to enumerate but the inaction of the safety valve be at once indicate by the steam gauge and when discover the blow through valve of the engine and blow off cock of the boiler should at once be open and the fire rake out a cone in the ball of the waste steam pipe to send back the water carry upward by the steam should never be insert as in some case this cone have become loose and close up the mouth of the waste steam pipe whereby the safety valve be render inoperative the boiler be in danger of burst 309 _ q _ -- may not danger arise from excessive priming _ a _ -- if the water be carry out of the boiler so rapidly by priming that the level of the water can not be maintain and the flue or furnace be in danger of become red hot the best plan be to open every furnace door and throw in a few bucket full of water upon the fire take care to stand sufficiently to the one side to avoid be scald by the rush of steam from the furnace there be no time to begin draw the fire in such a emergency and by this treatment the fire though not altogether extinguish will be render incapable of do harm if the flue be already red hot on no account must cold water be suffer to enter the boiler but the heat should be maintain in the furnace and the blow off cock be open or the mud hole door loosen so as to let all the water escape but at the same time the pressure must be keep quite low in the boiler so that there will be no danger of the hot flue collapse with the pressure of the steam 310 _ q _ -- be plug of fusible metal useful in prevent explosion _ a _ -- plug of fusible metal be at one time in much repute as a precaution against explosion the metal be so compound that it melt with the heat of high pressure steam but the device though ingenious have not be find of any utility in practice the basis of fusible metal be mercury and it be find that the compound be not homogeneous and that the mercury be force by the pressure of the steam out of the interstice of the metal combine with it leave a porous metal which be not easily fusible and which be therefore unable to perform its intended function in locomotive however and also in some other boiler a lead rivet be insert with advantage in the crown of the fire box which be melt out if the water become too low and thus give notice of the danger 311 _ q _ -- may not explosion occur in marine boiler from the accumulation of salt on the flue _ a _ -- yes in marine boiler this be a constant source of danger which be only to be meet by attention on the part of the engineer if the water in the boiler be suffer to become too salt a incrustation of salt will take place on the furnace which may cause they to become red hot and they may then be collapse even by they own weight aid by a moderate pressure of steam the expedient which should be adopt for prevent such a accumulation of salt from take place within the boiler as will be injurious to it properly fall under the head of the management of steam boiler and will be explain in a subsequent chapter chapter vi proportion of engine \* \* \* \* \* steam passage 312 _ q _ -- what size of orifice be commonly allow for the escape of the steam through the safety valve in low pressure engine _ a _ -- about 08 of a circular inch per horse power or a circular inch per 1-1\/4 horse power the follow rule however will give the dimension suitable for all kind of engine whether high or low pressure : -- multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the speed of the piston in foot per minute and divide the product by 375 time the pressure on the boiler per square inch the quotient be the proper area of the safety valve in square inch this rule of course suppose that the evaporate surface have be properly proportion to the engine power 313 _ q _ -- be this rule applicable to locomotive _ a _ -- it be applicable to high pressure engine of every kind the dimension of safety valve however in practice be very variable be in some case greater and in some case less than what the rule give the consideration be apparently as often what proportion will best prevent the valve from stick in its seat as what proportion will enable the steam to escape freely in bury 's locomotive the safety valve be generally 2-1\/2 inch diameter for all size of boiler and the valve be keep down by a lever form in the proportion of 5 to 1 fit at one end with a salter 's balance as the area of the valve be 5 square inch the number of pound show on the spring balance denote the number of pound pressure on each square inch of the boiler 314 _ q _ -- be there only one safety valve in a locomotive boiler _ a _ -- there be always two 315 _ q _ -- and be they always press down by a spring balance and never by weight _ a _ -- they be never press down by weight in fact weight would not answer on a locomotive at all as they would jump up and down with the jerk or jolt of the train and cause much of the steam to escape in land and marine boiler however the safety valve be always keep down by weight but in steam vessel a good deal of steam be lose in stormy weather by the opening of the valve owe to the inertia of the weight when the ship sink suddenly in the deep recess between the wave 316 _ q _ -- what other size of safety valve be use in locomotive _ a _ -- some be as large as 4 inch diameter give 12 square inch of area and other be as small as 1-3\/16 inch diameter give 1 square inch of area 317 _ q _ -- and be these valve all press down by a salter 's spring balance _ a _ -- in the great majority of case they be so and the lever by which they be press down be generally graduate in the proportion of the area of the valve to unity that be in the case of a valve of 12 inch area the long end of the lever to which the spring balance be attach be 12 time the length of the short end so that the weight or pressure on the balance show the pressure per square inch on the boiler in some case however a spiral spring and in other case a pile of elliptical spring be place directly upon the top of the valve and it appear desirable that one of the valve at least should be load in this manner it be difficult when the lever be divide in such a proportion as 12 to 1 to get sufficient lift of the valve without a large increase of pressure on the spring and it appear expedient therefore to employ a shorter lever which involve either a reduction in the area of the valve or a increase strength in the spring 318 _ q _ -- what be the proper dimension of the steam passage _ a _ -- in slow work engine the common size of the cylinder passage be one twenty-fifth of the area of the cylinder or one fifth of the diameter of the cylinder which be the same thing this proportion correspond very nearly with one square inch per horse power when the length of the cylinder be about equal to its diameter and one square inch of area per horse power for the cylinder port and eduction passage answer very well in the case of engine work at the ordinary speed of 220 foot per minute the area of the steam pipe be usually make less than the area of the eduction pipe especially when the engine be work expansively and with a considerable pressure of steam in the case of ordinary condense engine however work with the usual pressure of from 4 to 8 lb above the atmosphere the area of the steam pipe be not less than a circular inch per horse power in such engine the diameter of the steam pipe may be find by the follow rule : divide the number of nominal horse power by 08 and extract the square root of the quotient which will be the internal diameter of the steam pipe 319 _ q _ -- will you explain by what process of computation these proportion be arrive at _ a _ -- the size of the steam pipe be so regulate that there will be no material disparity of pressure between the cylinder and boiler and in fix the size of the eduction passage the same object be keep in view when the diameter of the cylinder and the velocity with which the piston travels be know it be easy to tell what the velocity of the steam in the steam pipe will be for if the area of the cylinder be 25 time greater than that of the steam pipe the steam in the steam pipe must travel 25 time faster than the piston and the difference of pressure requisite to produce this velocity of the steam can easily be ascertain by find what height a column of steam must be to give that velocity and what the weight or pressure be of such a column in practice however this proportion be always exceed from the condensation of steam in the pipe 320 _ q _ -- if the relation you have mention subsist between the area of the steam passage and the velocity of the piston then the passage must be larger when the piston travel very rapidly _ a _ -- and they be so make the area of the port of locomotive engine be usually so proportion as to be from 1\/10th to 1\/8th the area of the cylinder -- in some case even as much as 1\/6th and in all high speed engine the port should be very large and the valve should have a good deal of travel so as to open the port very quickly the area of port which it appear advisable to give to modern engine of every description be express by the follow rule : -- multiply the area of the cylinder in square inch by the speed of the piston in foot per minute and divide the product by 4000 the quotient be the area of each cylinder port in square inch this rule give rather more than a square inch of port per nominal horse power to condense engine work at the ordinary speed but the excess be but small and be upon the right side for engine travel very fast it give a good deal more area than the common proportion which be too small in nearly every case in locomotive engine the eduction pipe pass into the chimney and the force of the issue steam have the effect of maintain a rapid draught through the furnace as before explain the orifice of the waste steam pipe or the blast pipe as it be term be much contract in some engine with the view of produce a fiercer draught and a area of 1\/22d of the cylinder be a common proportion but this be as much contraction as should be allow and be greater than be advisable 321 _ q _ -- in engine move at a high rate of speed you have state that it be important to give the valve lead or in other word to allow the steam to escape before the end of the stroke _ a _ -- yes this be very important else the piston will have to force out the steam from the cylinder and will be much resist near the end of the stroke the piston begin to travel slowly and if the steam be then permit to escape very little of the effective stroke be lose and time be afford to the steam before the motion of the piston be again accelerate to make its escape by the port in some locomotive from inattention to this adjustment and from a contract area of tube section which involve a strong blast about half the power of the engine have be lose but in more recent engine by use enlarged port and by give sufficient lead this loss have be greatly diminish 322 _ q _ -- what do you call sufficient lead _ a _ -- in fast go engine i would call it sufficient lead when the eduction port be nearly open at the end of the stroke 323 _ q _ -- can you give any example of the benefit of increase the lead _ a _ -- the early locomotive be make with very little lead and the proportion be in fact very much the same as those previously exist in land engine about 1832 the benefit of lap upon the valve which have be employ by boulton and watt more than twenty year before be begin to be pretty generally apprehend and in the following year this expedient of economy be apply to the steamer manchester in the clyde and to some other vessel with very marked success shortly after this time lap begin to be apply to the valve of locomotive and it be find that not only be there a benefit from the operation of expansion but that there be a still greater benefit from the superior facility of escape give to the steam inasmuch as the application of lap involve the necessity of turn the eccentric round upon the shaft which cause the eduction to take place before the end of the stroke in 1840 one of the engine of the liverpool and manchester railway be alter so as to have 1 inch lap on the valve and 1 inch opening on the eduction side at the end of the stroke the valve have a total travel of 4-1\/4 inch the consumption of fuel per mile fall from 363 lb to 286 lb or about 25 per cent and a softer blast suffice by use larger exhaust passage larger tube and closer fire bar the consumption be subsequently bring down to 15 lb per mile air pump condenser and hot and cold water pump 324 _ q _ -- will you state the proper dimension of the air pump and condenser in laud and marine engine _ a _ -- mr watt make the air pump of he engine half the diameter of the cylinder and half the stroke or one eighth of the capacity and the condenser be usually make about the same size as the air pump but as the pressure of the steam have be increase in all modern engine it be better to make the air pump a little larger than this proportion 06 of the diameter of the cylinder and half the stroke answer very well and the condenser may be make as large as it can be get with convenience though the same size as the air pump will suffice 325 _ q _ -- be air pump now sometimes make double acting _ a _ -- most of the recent direct act marine engine for drive the screw be fit with a double acting air pump and when the air pump be double act it need only be about half the size that be necessary when it be single act it be single act in nearly every case except the case of direct act screw engine of recent construction 326 _ q _ -- what be the difference between a single and a double acting air pump _ a _ -- the single act air pump expel the air and water from the condenser only in the upward stroke of the pump whereas a double acting air pump expel the air and water both in the upward and downward stroke it have therefore to be provide with inlet and outlet valve at both end whereas the single act pump have only to be provide with a inlet or foot valve as it be term at the bottom and with a outlet or delivery valve as it be term at the top the single act air pump require to be provide with a valve or valve in the piston or bucket of the pump to enable the air and water lie below the bucket when it begin to descend and which have enter from the condenser during the upward stroke to pass through the bucket into the space above it during the downward stroke from whence they be expel into the atmosphere on the upward stroke succeed but in the double acting air pump no valve be require in the piston or bucket of the pump and all that be necessary be a inlet and outlet valve at each end 337 _ q _ -- what be the dimension of the foot and discharge valve of the air pump _ a _ -- the area through the foot and discharge valve be usually make equal to one fourth of the area of the air pump and the diameter of the waste water pipe be make one fourth of the diameter of the cylinder which give a area somewhat less than that of the foot and discharge valve passage but this proportion only apply in slow engine in fast engine with the air pump bucket move as fast as the piston the area through the foot and discharge valve should be equal to the area of the pump itself and the waste water pipe should be of about the same dimension 328 _ q _ -- you have state that double acting air pump need only be of half the size of single act one do that relation hold at all speed _ a _ -- it hold at all speed if the velocity of the pump bucket be in each case the same but it do not hold if the engine with the single act pump work slowly and the engine with the double act pump move rapidly as in the case of direct act screw engine all pump move at a high rate of speed lose part of they efficiency and such pump should therefore be of extra size 329 _ q _ -- how do you estimate the quantity of water requisite for condensation _ a _ -- mr watt find that the most beneficial temperature of the hot well of he engine be 100 degree if therefore the temperature of the steam be 212  and the latent heat 1000  then 1212  may be take to represent the heat contain in the steam or 1112  if we deduct the temperature of the hot well if the temperature of the injection water be 50  then 50 degree of cold be available for the abstraction of heat and as the total quantity of heat to be abstracted be that requisite to raise the quantity of water in the steam 1112 degree or 1112 time that quantity one degree it would raise one fiftieth of this or 2224 time the quantity of water in the steam 50 degree a cubic inch of water therefore raise into steam will require 2224 cubic inch of water at 50 degree for its condensation and will form therewith 2324 cubic inch of hot water at 100 degree mr watt 's practice be to allow about a wine pint -lrb- 289 cubic inch -rrb- of injection water for every cubic inch of water evaporate from the boiler 330 _ q _ -- be not a good vacuum in a engine conducive to increase power _ a _ -- it be 331 _ q _ -- and be not the vacuum good in the proportion in which the temperature be low suppose there to be no air leak _ a _ -- yes 332 _ q _ -- then how could mr watt find a temperature of 100  in the water draw from the condenser to be more beneficial than a temperature of 70  or 80  suppose there to be a abundant supply of cold water 333 _ a _ -- because the superior vacuum due to a temperature of 70  or 80  involve the admission of so much cold water into the condenser which have afterward to be pump out in opposition to the pressure of the atmosphere that the gain in the vacuum do not equal the loss of power occasion by the additional load upon the pump and there be therefore a clear loss by the reduction of the temperature below 100  if such reduction be cause by the admission of a additional quantity of water if the reduction of temperature however be cause by the use of colder water there be a gain produce by it though the gain will within certain limit be greater if advantage be take of the lowness of the temperature to diminish the quantity of injection 334 _ q _ -- how do you determine the proper area of the injection orifice _ a _ -- the area of the injection orifice proper for any engine can easily be tell when the quantity of water requisite to condense the steam be know and the pressure be specify under which the water enter the condenser the vacuum in the condenser may be take at 26 inch of mercury which be equivalent to a column of water 294 ft high and the square root of 294 multiply by 8021 be 4315 which be the velocity in foot per second that a heavy body would acquire in fall 294 ft or with which the water would enter the condenser now if a cubic foot of water evaporate per hour be equivalent to a actual horse power and 289 cubic inch of water be requisite for the condensation of a cubic inch of water in the form of steam 289 cubic foot of condense water per horse power per hour or 13905 cubic inch per second will be necessary for the engine and the size of the injection orifice must be such that this quantity of water flow with the velocity of 4315 ft per second or 5178 inch per second will gain admission to the condenser divide therefore 13905 the number of cubic inch to be inject by 5178 the velocity of influx in inch per second we get 002685 for the area of the orifice in square inch but inasmuch as it have be find by experiment that the actual discharge of water through a hole in a thin plate be only six tenth of the theoretical discharge on account of the contract vein the area of the orifice must be increase in the proportion of such diminution of effect or be make 004475 or 1\/22d of a square inch per horse power this it will be remark be the theoretical area require per actual horse power but as the friction and contraction in the pipe further reduce the discharge the area be make 1\/15th of a square inch per actual horse power or rather per cubic foot of water evaporate from the boiler 335 _ q _ -- can not the condensation of the steam be accomplish by any other means than by the admission of cold water into the condenser _ a _ -- it may be accomplish by the method of external cold as it be call which consist in the application of a large number of thin metallic surface to the condenser on the one side of which the steam circulate while on the other side there be a constant current of cold water and the steam be condensed by come into contact with the cold surface without mingle with the water use for the purpose of refrigeration the first kind of condenser employ by mr watt be construct after this fashion but he find it in practice to be inconvenient from its size and to become fur up or incrust when the water be bad whereby the conduct power of the metal be impaired he therefore revert to the use of the jet of cold water as be upon the whole preferable the jet enter the condenser instead of the cylinder as be the previous practice and this method be now the one in common use some few year ago a good number of steam vessel be fit with hall 's condenser which operate on the principle of external cold and which consist of a faggot of small copper tube surround by water but the use of those condenser have not be persist in and most of the vessel fit with they have return to the ordinary plan 336 _ q _ -- you state that the capacity of the feed pump be 1\/240th of the capacity of the cylinder in the case of condense engine -- the engine be double acting and the pump single acting -- and that in high pressure engine the capacity of the pump should be greater in proportion to the pressure of the steam can you give any rule that will express the proper capacity for the feed pump at all pressure _ a _ -- that will not be difficult in low pressure engine the pressure in the boiler may be take at 5 lb above the atmospheric pressure or 20 lb altogether and as high pressure steam be merely low pressure steam compress into a smaller compass the size of the feed pump in relation to the size of the cylinder must obviously vary in the direct proportion of the pressure and if it be 1\/240th of the capacity of the cylinder when the total pressure of the steam be 20 lb it must be 1\/120th of the capacity of the cylinder when the pressure be 40 lb per square inch or 25 lb per square inch above the atmospheric pressure this law of variation be express by the follow rule : -- multiply the capacity of the cylinder in cubic inch by the total pressure of the steam in lb per square inch or the pressure per square inch on the safety valve plus 15 and divide the product by 4800 the quotient be the capacity of the feed pump in cubic inch when the feed pump be single act and the engine double act if the feed pump be double acting or the engine single act the capacity of the pump must just be one half of what be give by this rule 337 _ q _ -- but should not some addition be make to the size of pump thus obtain if the pump work at a high rate of speed _ a _ -- no this rule make allowance for defective action all pump lift much less water than be due to the size of they barrel and the number of they stroke moderately good pump lose 50 per cent of they theoretical effect and bad pump 80 per cent 338 _ q _ -- to what be this loss of effect to be chiefly ascribe _ a _ -- mainly to the inertia of the water which if the pump piston be draw up very rapidly can not follow it with sufficient rapidity so that there may be a vacant space between the piston and the water and at the return stroke the momentum of the water in the pipe expend itself in give a reverse motion to the column of water approach the pump messr kirchweger and prusman of hanover have investigate this subject by apply a revolving cock at the end of a pipe lead from a elevated cistern contain water and the water escape at every revolution of the cock in the same manner as if a pump be draw it with a column of water of 17 foot they find that at 80 revolution of the cock per minute the water deliver per minute by the cock be 945 gallon but with 140 revolution of the cock per minute the water deliver per minute by the cock be only 542 gallon they subsequently apply a air vessel to the pipe beside the cock when the discharge rise to 129 gallon per minute with 80 revolution and 1828 gallon with 140 revolution air vessel should therefore be apply to the suction side of fast move pump and this be now do with good result 339 _ q _ -- what be the usual dimension of the cold water pump of land engine _ a _ -- if to condense a cubic inch of water raise into steam 289 cubic inch of condense water be require then the cold water pump ought to be 289 time larger than the feed pump suppose that its loss be equally great the feed pump however be make sufficiently large to compensate for leak in the boiler and loss of steam through the safety valve so that it will be sufficient if the cold water pump be 24 time larger than the feed pump this ratio be preserve by the follow rule : -- multiply the capacity of the cylinder in cubic inch by the total pressure of the steam per square inch or the pressure on the safety valve plus 15 and divide the product by 200 the quotient be the proper capacity of the cold water pump in cubic inch when the engine be double act and the pump single act fly wheel 340 _ q _ -- by what consideration do you determine the dimension of the fly wheel of a engine _ a _ -- by a reference to the power generate each half stroke of the engine and the number of half stroke that be necessary to give to the fly wheel its standard velocity suppose the whole power devote to that object in practice the power resident in the fly vary from 2-1\/2 to 6 time that generate each half stroke and if the weight of the wheel be equal to the pressure on the piston its velocity must be such as it would acquire by fall through a height equal to from 2-1\/2 to 6 time the stroke accord to the purpose for which the engine be intend if a very equable motion be require a heavier or swifter fly wheel must be employ 341 _ q _ -- what be boulton and watt 's rule for fly wheel _ a _ -- they rule be one which under any give circumstance fix the sectional area of the fly wheel rim and it be as follow : -- multiply 44000 time the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the length of the stroke in foot and divide this product by the product of the square of the number of revolution of the fly wheel per minute multiply by the cube of its diameter in foot the quotient be the area of section of the fly wheel rim in square inch strength of land engine 342 _ q _ -- can you give a rule for tell the proper thickness of the cylinder of steam engine _ a _ -- in low pressure engine the thickness of metal of the cylinder in engine of a medium size should be about 1\/40th of the diameter of the cylinder which with a pressure of steam of 20 lb above the atmosphere will occasion a strain of only 400 lb per square inch of section of the metal the thickness of the metal of the trunnion bearing of oscillate engine should be 1\/32d of the diameter of the cylinder and the breadth of the bearing should be about half its diameter in high pressure engine the thickness of the cylinder should be about 1\/16th its diameter which with a pressure of steam of 80 lb upon the square inch will occasion a strain of 640 lb upon the square inch of section of the metal and the thickness of the metal of the trunnion bearing of high pressure oscillate engine should be 1\/13th of the diameter of the cylinder the strength however be not the sole consideration in proportion cylinder for they must be make of a certain thickness however small the pressure be within they that they may not be too fragile and will stand boring while also a engine of 40 inch diameter would be about one inch thick the thickness would not be quite two inch in a 80 inch cylinder in fact there will be a small constant add to the thickness for all diameter which will be relatively larger the smaller the cylinder become in the cylinder of penn 's 12 horse power engine the diameter of cylinder be 21-1\/2 inch the thickness of the metal be 9\/16ths : in penn 's 40 inch cylinder the thickness be 1 inch and in the engine of the ripon

piston rod _ a _ -- the diameter of the piston rod be usually make 1\/10th of the diameter of the cylinder or the sectional area of the piston rod be 1\/100th of the area of the cylinder this proportion however be not applicable to locomotive or even fast move marine engine in locomotive engine the piston rod be make 1\/7th of the diameter of the cylinder and it be obvious that where the pressure on the piston be great the piston rod must be larger than when the pressure on the piston be small 344 _ q _ -- what be the proper dimension of the main link of a land beam engine _ a _ --

length of the rod the sectional area at the center 1\/28th of the area of the cylinder and at the end 1\/35th of the area of the cylinder : the length of the rod be usually 3-1\/2 time the length of the stroke it be preferable however to make the connect rod of malleable iron and then the dimension will be those proper for marine engine 346 _ q _ -- what be mr watt 's rule for the connect rod _ a _ -- some of he connect rod be of iron and some of wood to determine the thickness when of wood multiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inch by the length of the stroke in foot and

of the end stud of a land engine beam _ a _ -- in low pressure engine the diameter of the end stud of the engine beam be usually make 1\/9th of the diameter of the cylinder when of cast iron and 1\/10th when of work iron which give a load with low steam of about 500 lb per circular inch of transverse section but a larger size be preferable as with large bearing the brass do not wear so rapidly and the strap be not so likely to be burst by the bearing become oval these size as also those which immediately follow suppose the pressure on the piston to be 18 lb per circular inch 348 _ q

the length -- the width of the edge bead be about three time the thickness of the web in many modern engine the force act at the end of the beam be more than 18 lb per circular inch of the piston but the above rule be still applicable by take a imaginary cylinder with a area larger in the proportion of the larger pressure 351 _ q _ -- what be mr watt 's rule for the main beam of he engine _ a _ -- some of those beam be of wood and some of cast iron the wood beam be so proportion that the thickness be 1\/58th of the circumference and the depth 1\/375 the side of the beam suppose it square be find by multiply the diameter of the cylinder by the length of the stroke and extract the cube root of the quotient which will be the depth or thickness of the beam this rule allow a beam 16 foot long to bend 1\/8th of a inch and a beam 32 foot long to bend 1\/4 of a inch for cast iron beam the square of the diameter of the cylinder multiply by the length between the centre be equal to the square of the depth multiply by the thickness 352 _ q _ -- what law do the strength of beam and shaft follow _ a _ -- in the case of beam subject to a break force the strength with any give cohesion of the

elastic force 366 _ q _ -- how do you find the diameter of the main center when proportion accord to this rule _ a _ -- the diameter of the main center may be find by multiply 00367 time the square root of the pressure upon the piston in lb per square inch by the diameter of the cylinder in inch which will give the diameter of the main center journal in inch when of malleable iron and the length of the main center journal should be 1-1\/2 time its diameter the strain upon the main center journal in ordinary working will be about 1\/2 the elastic force 367 _ q _ -- what be the proper dimension of the gib and cutter of a engine _ a _ -- the depth of gib and cutter for attach the piston rod to the cross head be 00358 time the cube root of the pressure of the steam on the piston in lb per square inch multiply by the diameter of the cylinder and the thickness of the gib and cutter be 0007 time the cube root of the pressure on the piston in lb per square inch multiply by the diameter of its cylinder the depth of the cutter through the piston be 0017 time the square root of the pressure on the piston in lb per square inch multiply by the diameter of the cylinder in inch and the thickness of the cutter through the piston be 0007 time the square root of the pressure on the piston in lb per square inch multiply by the diameter of the cylinder 368 _ q _ -- be not some of the part of a engine construct accord to these rule too weak when compare with the other part _ a _ -- it be obvious from the vary proportion subsist in the different part of the engine between the strain and the elastic force that in engine proportion by these rule -- which represent nevertheless the average practice of the best constructor -- some of the part must possess a considerable excess of strength over other part and it appear expedient that this disparity should be diminish which may best be do by increase the strength of the part which be weakest inasmuch as the frequent fracture of some of the part show that the dimension at present adopt for those part be scarcely sufficient unless the iron of which they be make be of the best quality at the same time it be quite certain that engine proportion by these rule will work satisfactorily where good material be employ but it be important to know in what part good material and larger dimension be the most indispensable in many of the part moreover it be necessary that the dimension should be proportion to meet the wear and the tendency to heat instead of be merely proportion to obtain the necessary strength and the crank pin be one of the part which require to be large in diameter and as long as possible in the bearing so as to distribute the pressure and prevent the disposition to heat which would otherwise exist the cross head journal also should be long and large for as the top of the side rod have little travel the oil be less draw into the bearing than if the travel be greater and be be constantly press out by the punching strain this strain should therefore be reduce as far as possible by its distribution over a large surface in the rule which be contain in the answer to the ten precede question -lrb- 358 to 367 -rrb- the pressure on the piston in lb per square inch be take as the sum of the pressure of steam in the boiler and of the vacuum the latter be assume to be 15 lb per square inch chapter vii constructive detail of boiler \* \* \* \* \* land and marine boiler 369 _ q _ -- will you explain the course of procedure in the construction and setting of wagon boiler _ a _ -- most boiler be make of plate three eighth of a inch thick and the rivet be from three eighth to three fourth of a inch in diameter in the bottom and side of a wagon boiler the head of the rivet or the end form on the rivet before they be insert should be large and place next the fire or on the outside whereas on the top of the boiler the head should be on the inside the rivet should be place about two inch distant from center to center and the center of the row of rivet should be about one inch from the edge of the plate the edge of the plate should be truly cut both inside and outside and after the part of the boiler have be rivet together the edge of the plate should be set up or caulk with a blunt chisel about a quarter of a inch thick in the point and strike by a hammer of about three or four pound weight one man hold the caulking tool while another strike 370 _ q _ -- be this the usual mode of caulking _ a _ -- no it be not the usual mode but it be the best mode and be the mode adopt by mr watt the usual mode now be for one man to caulk the seam with a hammer in one hand and a caulking chisel in the other and in some of the difficult corner of marine flue boiler it be not easy for two man to get in a good deal of the caulking have also sometimes to be do with the left hand 371 _ q _ -- should the boiler be prove after caulk _ a _ -- the boiler should be fill with water and caulk afresh in any leaky part when empty again all the joint should be paint with a solution of sal ammoniac in urine and so soon as the seam be well rust they should be dry with a gentle fire and then be paint over with a thin putty form of whiting and linseed oil the heat be continue until the putty become so hard that it can not be readily scratch with the nail and care must be take neither to burn the putty nor to discontinue the fire until it have become quite dry 372 _ q _ -- how should the brickwork setting of a wagon boiler be build _ a _ -- in build the brickwork for the setting of the boiler the part upon which the heat act with most intensity be to be build with clay instead of mortar but mortar be to be use on the outside of the work old bar of flat iron may be lay under the boiler chime to prevent that part of the boiler from be burn out and bar of iron should also run through the brickwork to prevent it from splitting the top of the boiler be to be cover with brickwork lay in the best lime and if the lime be not of the hydraulic kind it should be mix with dutch terrass to make it impenetrable to water the top of the boiler should be well plaster with this lime which will greatly conduce to the tightness of the seam opening into the flue must be leave in convenient situation to enable the flue to be sweep out when require and these opening may be close with cast iron door joint with clay or mortar which may be easily remove when require adjacent to the chimney a slit must be leave in the top of the flue with a groove in the brickwork to enable the slide door or damper to be fix in that situation which by be lower into the flue will obstruct the passage of the smoke and moderate the draught whereby the chimney will be prevent from draw the flame into it before the heat have act sufficiently upon the boiler 373 _ q _ -- be marine construct in the same way as land boiler _ a _ -- there be very little difference in the two case : the whole of the shell of marine boiler however should be double rivet with rivet 11\/16ths of a inch in diameter and 2-3\/8 th inch from center to center the weakening effect of double riveting be much less than that of single riveting the furnace above the line of bar should be of the best lowmoor bowling or staffordshire scrap plate and the portion of each furnace above the bar should consist only of three plate one for the top and one for each side the lower seam of the side plate be situate beneath the level of the bar so as not to be expose to the heat of the furnace the tube plate of tubular boiler should be of the best lowmoor or bowling iron seven eighth to one inch thick : the shell should be of the best staffordshire or thornycroft s crown iron 7\/16ths of a inch thick 374 _ q _ -- of what kind of iron should the angle iron or corner iron be compose _ a _ -- angle iron should not be use in the construction of boiler as in the manufacture it become reedy and be apt to split up in the direction of its length : it be much the safer practice to bend the plate at the corner of the boiler but this must be carefully do without introduce any more sharp bend than can be avoid and plate which require to be bent much should be of lowmoor iron it will usually be find expedient to introduce a ring of angle iron around the furnace mouth though it be discard in the other part of the boiler but it should be use as sparingly as possible and any that be use should be of the best quality 375 _ q _ -- be it not important to have the hole in the plate opposite to one another _ a _ -- the whole of the plate of a boiler should have the hole for the rivet punch and the edge cut straight by means of self-acting machinery in which a travel table carry forward the plate with a equal progression every stroke of the punch or shears and machinery of this kind be now extensively employ the practice of force the part of boiler together with violence by means of screw-jack and drift through the hole should not be permit as a great strain may thus be throw upon the rivet even when there be no steam in the boiler all rivet should be of the best lowmoor iron the work should be caulk both within and without wherever it be accessible but in the more confine situation within the flue the caulking will in many case have to be do with the hand or chip hammer instead of the heavy hammer previously prescribe 376 _ q _ -- how be the setting of marine boiler with internal furnace effect _ a _ -- in the setting of marine boiler care must be take that no copper bolt or nail project above the wooden platform upon which they rest and also that no project copper bolt in the side of the ship touch the boiler as the galvanic action in such a case would probably soon wear the point of contact into hole the platform may consist of three inch plank lay across the keelson nail with iron nail the head of which be well punch down and caulk and putty like a deck the surface may then be paint over with thin putty and fore and aft board of half the thickness may then be lay down and nail securely with iron nail have the head well punch down this platform must then be cover thinly and evenly with mastic cement and the boiler be set down upon it and the cement must be caulk beneath the boiler by means of wooden caulking tool so as completely to fill every vacuity cooming of wood slope on the top must next be set round the boiler and the space between the cooming and the boiler must be caulk full of cement and be smooth off on the top to the slope of the cooming so as to throw off any water that might be dispose to enter between the cooming and the boiler 377 _ q _ -- how be the cement use for set marine boiler compound _ a _ -- mastic cement proper for the setting of boiler be sell in many place ready make hamelin 's mastic be compound as follow : -- to any give weight of sand or pulverize earthenware add two third such give weight of powdered bath portland or other similar stone and to every 560 lb weight of the mixture add 40 lb weight of litharge 2 lb of powdered glass or flint 1 lb of minium and 2 lb of gray oxide of lead pass the mixture through a sieve and keep it in a powder for use when want for use a sufficient quantity of the powder be mix with some vegetable oil upon a board or in a trough in the manner of mortar in the proportion of 605 lb of the powder to 5 gallon of linseed walnut or pink oil and the mixture be stir and trodden upon until it assume the appearance of moistened sand when it be ready for use the cement should be use on the same day as the oil be add else it will be set into a solid mass 378 _ q _ -- what be the best length of the furnace of marine boiler _ a _ -- it have already be state that furnace bar should not much exceed six foot in length as it be difficult to manage long furnace but it be a frequent practice to make the furnace long and narrow the consequence of which be that it be impossible to fire they effectually at the after end especially upon long voyage and in stormy weather and air escape into the flue at the after end of the bar whereby the efficacy of the boiler be diminish where the bar be very long it will generally be find that a increase supply of steam and a diminish consumption of coal will be the consequence of shorten they and the bar should always lie with a considerable inclination to facilitate the distribution of the fuel over the after part of the furnace when there be two length of bar in the furnace it be expedient to make the central cross bar for bear up the end double and to leave a space between the end of the bar so that the ash may fall through between they the space thus leave enable the bar to expand without injury on the application of heat whereas without some such provision the bar be very liable to get burn out by bend up in the center or at the end as they must do if the elongation of the bar on the application of heat be prevent and this must be the effect of permit the space at the end of the bar to be fill up with ash at each end of each bed of bar it be expedient to leave a space which the ash can not fill up so as to cause the bar to jam and care must be take that the heel of the bar do not come against any of the furnace bearer whereby the room leave at the end of the bar to permit the expansion would be render of no avail 379 _ q _ -- have you any remark to offer respect the construction and arrangement of the furnace bridge and damper of marine boiler _ a _ -- the furnace bridge of marine boiler be wall or partition build up at the end of the furnace to narrow the opening for the escape of heat into the flue they be either make of fire brick or of plate iron contain water : in the case of water bridge the top part of the bridge should be make with a large amount of slant so as to enable the steam to escape freely but notwithstanding this precaution the plate of water bridge be apt to crack at the bend so that fire brick bridge appear on the whole to be preferable in shallow furnace the bridge often come too near the furnace top to enable a man to pass over they and it will save expense if in such bridge the upper portion be construct of two or three fire block which may be lift off where a person require to enter the flue to sweep or repair they whereby the perpetual demolition and reconstruction of the upper part of the bridge will be prevent 380 _ q _ -- what be the benefit of bridge _ a _ -- bridge be find in practice to have a very sensible operation in increase the production of steam and in some boiler in which the brick bridge have be accidentally knock down by the fireman a very considerable diminution in the supply of steam have be experience they chief operation seem to lie in concentrate the heat within the furnace to a higher temperature whereby the heat be more rapidly transmit from the furnace to the water and less heat have consequently to be absorb by the flue in this way the bridge render the heating surface of a boiler more effective or enable a smaller amount of heating surface to suffice 381 _ q _ -- be the bridge behind the furnace the only bridge use in steam boiler _ a _ -- it be not a uncommon practice to place a hang bridge consist of a plate of iron descend a certain distance into the flue at that part of the flue where it enter the chimney whereby the stratum of hot air which occupy the highest part of the flue be keep in protracted contact with the boiler and the cooler air occupy the lower part of the flue be that which alone escape the practice of introduce a hang bridge be a beneficial one in the case of some boiler but be not applicable universally as boiler with a small calorimeter can not be further contract in the flue without a diminution in they evaporate power in tubular boiler a hanging bridge be not applicable but in some case a perforated plate be place against the end of the tube which by suitable connection be make to operate as a slide damper which partially or totally close up the end of every tube and at other time a damper construct in the manner of a venetian blind be employ in the same situation these variety of damper however have only yet be use in locomotive boiler though applicable to tubular boiler of every description 382 _ q _ -- be it a benefit to keep the flue or tube appertain to each furnace distinct _ a _ -- in a flue boiler this can not be do but in a tubular boiler it be a advantage that there should be a division between the tube pertain to each furnace so that the smoke of each furnace may be keep apart from the smoke of the furnace adjoining it until the smoke of both enter the chimney as by this arrangement a furnace only will be render inoperative in clean the fire instead of a boiler and the tube belong to one furnace may be sweep if necessary at sea without interfere injuriously with the action of the rest in a steam vessel it be necessary at interval to empty out one or more furnace every watch to get rid of the clinker which would otherwise accumulate in they and it be advisable that the connection between the furnace should be such that this operation when be perform on one furnace shall injure the action of the rest as little as possible 383 _ q _ -- can any constructive precaution be take to prevent the furnace and tube plate of the boiler from be burn by the intensity of the heat _ a _ -- the side of the internal furnace or flue in all boiler should be so construct that the steam may readily escape from they surface with which view it be expedient to make the bottom of the flue somewhat wider than the top or slightly conical in the cross section and the upper plate should always be overlap by the plate beneath so that the steam can not be retain in the overlap but will escape as soon as it be generate if the side of the furnace be make high and perfectly vertical they will speedily be buckle and crack by the heat as a film of steam in such a case will remain in contact with the iron which will prevent the access of the water and the iron of the boiler will be injure by the high temperature it must in that case acquire to moderate the intensity of the heat act upon the furnace side it be expedient to bring the outside fire bar into close contact with the side of the furnace so as to prevent the entrance of air through the fire in that situation by which the intensity of the heat would be increase the tube plate nearest the furnace in tubular boiler should also be so inclined as to facilitate the escape of the steam and the short bent plate or flange of the tube plate connect the tube plate with the top of the furnace should be make with a gradual bend as if the bend be sudden the iron will be apt to crack or burn away from the concretion of salt where the furnace mouth be contract by bend in the side and top of the furnace as be the general practice the bend should be gradual as salt be apt to accumulate in the pocket make by a sudden bend and the plate will then burn into hole 384 _ q _ -- in what manner be the tubing of boiler perform _ a _ -- the tube of marine boiler be generally iron tube three inch in diameter and between six and seven foot long but sometimes brass tube of similar dimension be employ when brass tube be employ the use of ferule drive into the end of the tube be sometimes employ to keep they tight but when the tube be of malleable iron of the thickness of russell 's boiler tube they may be make tight merely by firmly drive they into the tube plate and the same may be do with thick brass tube the hole in the tube plate next the front of the boiler be just sensibly larger in diameter than the hole in the other tube plate and the hole upon the outer surface of both tube plate be very slightly countersunk the whole of the tube be drive through both tube plate from the front of the boiler -- the precaution however be take to drive they in gently at first with a light hand hammer until the whole of the tube have be insert to a equal depth and then they may be drive up by degree with a heavy hammer whereby any distortion of the hole from unequal driving will be prevent finally the end of the tube should be rivet up so as to fill the countersink the tube should be leave a little longer than the distance between the outer surface of the tube plate so that the countersink at the end may be fill by stave up the end of the tube rather than by riveting it over and the stave will be best accomplish by means of a mandril with a collar upon it which be drive into the tube so that the collar rest upon the end of the tube to be rivet or a tool like a blunt chisel with a recess in its point may be use as be the more usual practice 385 _ q _ -- should not stay be introduce in substitution of some of the tube _ a _ -- it appear expedient in all case that some of the tube should be screw at the end so as to serve as stay if the riveting at the tube end happen to be burn away and also to act as abutment to the rivet tube -- or else to introduce very strong rod of about the same diameter as a tube in substitution of some of the tube and these stay should have nut at each end both within and without the tube plate which nut should be screw up with white lead interpose before the tube be insert if the tube be long they expansion when the boiler be be blow off will be apt to start they at the end unless very securely fix and it be difficult to prevent brass tube of large diameter and proportionate length from be start at the end even when secure by ferule but the brass tube commonly employ be so small as to be susceptible of sufficient compression endway by the adhesion due to the ferule to compensate for the expansion whereby they be prevent from start at the end in some of the early marine boiler fit with brass tube a galvanic action at the end of the tube be find to take place and the iron of the tube plate be waste away in consequence with rapidity but further experience prove the injury to be attributable chiefly to imperfect fitting whereby a leakage be cause that induce oxidation and when the tube be well fit any injurious action at the end of the tube be find to cease 386 _ q _ -- what be the best mode of construct the chimney and the part in connection therewith _ a _ -- in sea-going steamer the funnel plate be usually about nine foot long and 3\/16ths thick and where different flue or boiler have they debouch in the same chimney it be expedient to run division plate up the chimney for a considerable distance to keep the draught distinct the damper should not be in the chimney but at the end of the boiler flue so that they may be available for use if the funnel by accident be carry away the waste steam pipe should be of the same height as the funnel so as to carry the waste steam clear of it for if the waste steam strike the funnel it will wear the iron into hole and the waste steam pipe should be make at the bottom with a faucet joint to prevent the working of the funnel when the vessel roll from break the pipe at the neck there should be two hoop round the funnel for the attachment of the funnel shroud instead of one so that the funnel may not be carry overboard if one hoop break or if the funnel break at the upper hoop from the corrosive action of the waste steam as sometimes happen the deck over the steam chest should be form of a iron plate support by angle iron beam and there should be a high angle iron cooming round the hole in the deck through which the chimney ascend to prevent any water upon the deck from leak down upon the boiler around the lower part of the funnel there should be a sheet iron case to prevent any inconvenient dispersion of heat in that situation and another short piece of casing of a somewhat larger diameter and rivet to the chimney should descend over the first casing so as to prevent the rain or spray which may beat against the chimney from be pour down within the case upon the top of the boiler the pipe for conduct away the waste water from the top of the safety valve should lead overboard and not into the bilge of the ship as inconvenience arise from the steam occasionally pass through it if it have its termination in the engine room 387 _ q _ -- be not the chimney of some vessel make so that they may be lower when require _ a _ -- the chimney of small river vessel which have to pass under bridge be generally form with a hinge so that they may be lower backward when pass under a bridge and the chimney of some screw vessel be make so as to shut up like a spyglass when the fire be put out and the vessel be navigate under sail in smaller vessel however two length of chimney suffice and in that case there be a standing piece on deck which however do not project above the bulwark 388 _ q _ -- will you explain any further detail in the construction of marine boiler which occur to you as important _ a _ -- the man-hole and mud-hole door unless put on from the outside like a cylinder cover with a great number of bolt should be put on from the inside with cross bar on the outside and the bolt should be strong and have coarse thread and square nut so that the thread may not be overrun nor the nut become round by the unskilful manipulation of the fireman by whom these door be remove or replace it be very expedient that sufficient space should be leave between the furnace and the tube in all tubular boiler to permit a boy to go in to clear away any scale that may have form and to hold on the rivet in the event of repair be want and it be also expedient that a vertical row of tube should be leave out opposite to each water space to allow the ascent of the steam and descent of the water as it have be find that the removal of the tube in that position even in a boiler with deficient heating surface have increase the production of steam and diminish the consumption of fuel the tube should all be keep in the same vertical line so as to permit the introduction of a instrument to scrape they but they may be zig-zag in the horizontal line whereby a greater strength of metal will be obtain around the hole in the tube plate and the tube should not be place too close together else they heating efficacy will be impaired incrustation and corrosion of boiler 389 _ q _ -- what be the cause of the formation of scale in marine boiler _ a _ -- scale be form in all boiler which contain earthy or saline matter just in the way in which a scaly deposit or rock as it be sometimes term be form in a tea kettle in sea water the chief ingredient be common salt which exist in solution : the water admit to the boiler be take away in the shape of steam and the saline matter which be not vaporizable accumulate in process of time in the boiler until its amount be so great that the water be saturated or unable to hold any more in solution the salt be then precipitated and form a deposit which harden by heat the formation of scale therefore be similar to the process of make salt from sea water by evaporation the boiler be in fact a large salt pan 390 _ q _ -- but be the scale soluble in fresh water like the salt in a salt pan _ a _ -- no it be not or if soluble at all be only so to a very limited extent the several ingredient in sea water begin to be precipitate from solution at different degree of concentration and the sulphate and carbonate of lime which begin to be precipitate when a certain state of concentration be reach enter largely into the composition of scale and give it its insoluble character piece of waste or other similar object leave within a marine boiler appear when take out as if they have be petrified and the scale deposit upon the flue of a marine boiler resemble layer of stone 391 _ q \/ _ -- be much inconvenience experience in marine boiler from these incrustation upon the flue _ a _ -- incrustation in boiler at one time cause much more perplexity than it do at present as it be suppose that in some sea it be impossible to prevent the boiler of a steamer from become salt up but it have now be satisfactorily ascertain that there be very little difference in the saltness of different sea and that however salt the water may be the boiler will be preserve from any injurious amount of incrustation by blow off as it be call very frequently or by permit a considerable portion of the supersalted water to escape at short interval into the sea if blow off be sufficiently practice the scale upon the flue will never be much thicker than a sheet of write paper and _ no excuse _ should be accept from engineer for permit a boiler to be damage by the accumulation of calcareous deposit 392 _ q _ -- what be the temperature at which sea water boil in a steam boiler _ a _ -- sea water contain about 1\/33rd its weight of salt and in the open air it boil at the temperature of 2132  if the proportion of salt be increase to 2\/33rds of the weight of the water the boiling point will rise to 2144  with 3\/33rds of salt the boiling point will be 2155  4\/33rds 2167  5\/33rds 2179  6\/33rds 219  7\/33rds 2202  8\/33rds 2214  9\/33rds 2225  10\/33rds 2237  11\/33rds 2249  and 12\/33rds which be the point of saturation 226  in a steam boiler the boil point of water contain these proportion of salt must be higher as the elevation of temperature due to the pressure of the steam have to be add to that due to the saltness of the water the temperature of steam at the atmospheric pressure be 212  its temperature at a pressure of 15 lb per square inch above the atmosphere will be 250  and add to this 47  as the increase temperature due to the saltness of the water when it contain 4\/33rds of salt we have 2547  as the temperature of the water in the boiler when it contain 4\/33rds of salt and the pressure of the steam be 15 lb on the square inch 393 _ q _ -- what degree of concentration of the salt water may be safely permit in a boiler _ a _ -- it be find by experience that when the concentration of the salt water in a boiler be prevent from exceed that point at which it contain 2\/33rds its weight of salt no injurious incrustation will take place and as sea water contain only 1\/33rd of its weight of salt it be clear that it must be reduce by evaporation to one half of its bulk before it can contain 2\/33rds of salt or in other word a boiler must blow out into the sea one half of the water it receive as feed in order to prevent the water from rise above 2\/33rds of concentration or 8 ounce of salt to the gallon 394 _ q _ -- how do you determine 8 ounce to the gallon to be equivalent to twice the density of salt water or two salt water as it be sometimes call _ a _ -- the density of the water of different sea vary somewhat a gallon of fresh water weigh 10 lb a gallon of salt water from the baltic weigh 1015 lb a gallon of salt water from the irish channel weigh 1028 lb and a gallon of salt water from the mediterranean 1029 lb if we take a average saltness represent by a weight of 1025 lb then a gallon of water concentrate to twice this saltness will weigh 105 lb or the salt in it will weigh 5 lb or 8 oz which be the proportion of 8 oz to the gallon however the proportion of 2\/33rds give a greater proportion than 8 oz to the gallon for 2\/33 = 1\/16 nearly and 1\/16 of 10 lb = 10 oz by keep the density of the water in a marine boiler at the proportion of 8 or 10 oz to the gallon no inconvenient amount of scale will be deposit on the flue or tube the bulk of water it may be remark be not increase by put salt in it up to the point of saturation but only its density be increase 395 _ q _ -- be there not a great loss of heat by blow off so large a proportion of the heated water from the boiler _ a _ -- the loss be not very great boiler be sometimes work at a saltness of 4\/33rds and take this saltness and suppose the latent heat of steam to be at 1000  at the temperature of 212  and reckon the sum of the latent and sensible heat as form a constant quantity the latent heat of steam at the temperature of 250  will be 962  and the total heat of the steam will be 1212  in the case of fresh water but as the feed water be send into the boiler at the temperature of 100  the accession of heat it receive from the fuel will be 1112  in the case of fresh water or 1112  increase by 398  in the case of water contain 4\/33ds of salt -- the 398  be the 47  increase of temperature due to the presence of 4\/33rds of salt multiply by 0847 the specific heat of steam this make the total accession of heat receive by the steam in the boiler equal to 111598  or say 1116  which multiply by 3 as 3 part of the water be raise into steam give we 3348  for the heat in the steam while the accession of heat receive in the boiler by the 1 part of residual brine will be 1547  multiply by 085 the specific heat of the brine or 130495  and 3348  divide by 130495  be about 1\/26th it appear therefore that by blow off the boiler to such a extent that the saltness shall not rise above what answer to 4\/33rds of salt about 1\/25th of the heat be blow into the sea this be but a small proportion and as there will be a greater waste of heat if from the existence of scale upon the flue the heat can be only imperfectly transmit to the water there can not be even a economy of fuel in niggard blow off while it involve the introduction of other evil the proportion of 4\/33rds of saltness however or 16 oz to the gallon be larger than be advisable especially as it be difficult to keep the saltness at a perfectly uniform point and the work point should therefore be 2\/33rds as before prescribe 396 _ q _ -- have no means be devise for turn to account the heat contain in the brine which be expel from the boiler _ a _ -- to save a part of the heat lose by the operation of blow off the hot brine be sometimes pass through a number of small tube surround by the feed water but there be no very great gain from the use of such apparatus and the tube be apt to become choke up whereby the safety of the boiler may be endanger by the injurious concentration of its contents pump work by the engine for the extraction of the brine be generally use in connection with the small tube for the extraction of the heat from the supersalted water and if the tube become choke the pump will cease to eject the water while the engineer may consider they to be all the while in operation 397_q _ -- what be the usual mode of blow off the supersalted water from the boiler _ a _ -- the general mode of blow off the boiler be to allow the water to rise gradually for a hour or two above the lowest working level and then to open the cock communicate with the sea and keep it open until the surface of the water within the boiler have fall several inch but in some case a cock of smaller size be allow to run water continuously and in other case brine pump be use as already mention in every case in which the supersalted water be discharge from the boiler in a continuous stream a hydrometer or salt gauge of some convenient construction should be apply to the boiler so that the density of the water may at all time be visible and immediate notice be give of any interruption of the operation various contrivance have be devise for this purpose the most of which operate on the principle of a hydrometer but perhaps a more satisfactory principle would be that of a differential steam gauge which would indicate the difference of pressure between the steam in the boiler and the steam of a small quantity of fresh water enclose in a suitable vessel and immerge in the water of the boiler 398 _ q _ -- what be the advantage of blow off from the surface of the water in the boiler _ a _ -- blow off from a point near the surface of the water be more beneficial than blow off from the bottom of the boiler solid particle of any kind it be well know if introduce into boiling water will lower the boiling point in a slight degree and the steam will chiefly be generate on the surface of the particle and indeed will have the appearance of come out of they if the particle be small the steam generate beneath and around they will balloon they to the surface of the water where the steam will be liberate and the particle will descend and the impalpable particle in a marine boiler which by they subsidence upon the flue concrete into scale be carry in the first instance to the surface of the water so that if they be catch there and eject from the boiler the formation of scale will be prevent 399 _ q _ -- be there any plan in operation for take advantage of this property of particle rise to the surface _ a _ -- advantage be take of this property in lamb 's scale preventer which be substantially a contrivance for blow off from the surface of the water that in practice be find to be very effectual but a float in connection with a valve at the mouth of the discharging pipe be there introduce so as to regulate the quantity of water blow out by the height of the water level or by the extent of open give to the feed cock the operation however of the contrivance would be much the same if the float be dispense with but the float act advantageously in hinder the water from rise too high in the boiler should too much feed be admit and thereby obviate the risk of the water run over into the cylinder in some boiler sheet iron vessel call sediment collector be employ which collect into they the impalpable matter which in lamb 's apparatus be eject from the boiler at once one of these vessel of about the size and shape of a loaf of sugar be put into each boiler with the apex of the cone turn downward into a pipe lead overboard for conduct the sediment away from the boiler the base of the cone stand some distance above the water line and in its side conical slit be cut so as to establish a free communication between the water within the conical vessel and the water outside it the particle of stony matter which be balloon to the surface by the steam in every other part of the boiler subside within the cone where no steam be generate the water be consequently tranquil and the deposit be discharge overboard by means of a pipe communicate with the sea by blow off from the surface of the water the requisite cleanse action be obtain with less waste of heat and where the water be muddy the foam upon the surface of the water be eject from the boiler -- thereby remove one of the chief cause of priming 400 _ q _ -- what be the cause of the rapid corrosion of marine boiler _ a _ -- marine boiler be corrode externally in the region of the steam chest by the drip of water from the deck the bottom of the boiler be corrode by the action of the bilge water and the ash pit by the practice of quench the ash with salt water these source of injury however admit of easy remedy the top of the boiler may be preserve from external corrosion by cover it with feel upon which be lay sheet lead solder at every joint so as to be impenetrable to water the ash pit may be shield by guard plate which be plate fitting into the ash pit and attach to the boiler by a few bolt so that when wear they may be remove and new one substitute whereby any wear upon the boiler in that part will be prevent and there will be very little wear upon the bottom of a boiler if it be imbed in mastic cement lay upon a suitable platform 401 _ q _ -- be not marine boiler subject to internal corrosion _ a _ -- yes the greatest part of the corrosion of a boiler take place in the inside of the steam chest and the origin of this corrosion be one of the obscurest subject in the whole range of engineering it can not be from the chemical action of the salt water upon the iron for the flue and other part of the boiler beneath the water suffer very little from corrosion and in steam vessel provide with hall 's condenser which supply the boiler with fresh water not much increase durability of the boiler have be experience nevertheless marine boiler seldom last more than for 5 or 6 year whereas land boiler make of the same quality of iron often last 18 or 20 year and it do not appear probable that land boiler would last a very much shorter time if salt water be use in they the thin film of scale spread over the part of a marine boiler situate beneath the water effectually protect they from corrosion and when the other part be completely wear out the flue generally remain so perfect that the hammer mark upon they be as conspicuous as at they first formation the operation of the steam in corrode the interior of the boiler be most capricious -- the part which be most rapidly wear away in one boiler be untouch in another and in some case one side of a steam chest will be very much waste away while the opposite side remain uninjured sometimes the iron exfoliate in the shape of a black oxide which come away in flake like the leaf of a book while in other case the iron appear as if eat away by a strong acid which have a solvent action upon it the application of feel to the outside of a boiler have in several case be find to accelerate sensibly its internal corrosion boiler in which there be a large accumulation of scale appear to be more corroded than where there be no such deposit and where the funnel pass through the steam chest the iron of the steam chest be invariably much more corroded than where the funnel do not pass through it 402 _ q _ -- can you suggest no reason for the rapid internal corrosion of marine boiler _ a _ -- the fact which i have enumerate appear to indicate that the internal corrosion of marine boiler be attributable chiefly to the existence of surcharged steam within they which be steam to which a additional quantity of heat have be communicate subsequently to its generation so that its temperature be greater than be due to its elastic force and on this hypothesis the observe fact relative to corrosion become to some extent explicable feel apply to the outside of a boiler may accelerate its internal corrosion by keep the steam in a surcharged state when by the dispersion of a part of the heat it would cease to be in that state boiler in which there be a large accumulation of scale must have work with the water very salt which necessarily produce surcharged steam for the temperature of steam can not be less than that of the water from which it be generate and inasmuch as the boiling point of water under any give pressure rise with the saltness of the water the temperature of the steam must rise with the saltness of the water the pressure remain the same or in other word the steam must have a higher temperature than be due to its elastic force or be in the state of surcharged steam the circumstance of the chimney flue pass through the steam will manifestly surcharge the steam with heat so that all the circumstance which be find to accelerate corrosion be it appear such as would also induce the formation of surcharged steam 403 _ q _ -- be it the natural effect of surcharged steam to waste away iron _ a _ -- it be the natural effect of surcharged steam to oxidate the iron with which it be in contact as be illustrate by the familiar process for make hydrogen gas by send steam through a red hot tube fill with piece of iron and although the action of the surcharged steam in a boiler be necessarily very much weaker than where the iron be red hot it manifestly must have _ some _ oxidize effect and the amount of corrosion produce may be very material where the action be perpetual boiler with a large extent of heating surface or with descend flue circulate through the cooler water in the bottom of the boiler before ascend the chimney will be less corroded internally than boiler in which a large quantity of the heat pass away in the smoke and the corrosion of the boiler will be diminish if the interior of any flue pass through the steam be coat with fire brick so as to present the transmission of the heat in that situation the best practice however appear to consist in the transmission of the smoke through a suitable passage on the outside of the boiler so as to supersede the necessity of carry any flue through the steam at all or a column of water may be carry round the chimney into which as much of the feed water may be introduce as the heat of the chimney be capable of raise to the boiling point as under this limitation the presence of feed water around the chimney in the steam chest will fail to condense the steam 404 _ q _ -- in steam vessel there be usually several boiler _ a _ -- yes in steam vessel of considerable power and size 405 _ q _ -- be these boiler generally so construct that any one of they may be throw out of use _ a _ -- marine boiler be now generally supply with stop valve whereby one boiler may be throw out of use without impair the efficacy of the remainder these stop valve be usually spindle valve of large size and they be for the most part set in a pipe which run across the steam chest connect the several boiler together the spindle of these valve should project through stuff box in the cover of the valve chest and they should be balance by a weighted lever and keep in continual action by the steam if the valve be lift up and be suffer to remain up as be the usual practice they will become fix by corrosion in that position and it will be impossible after some time to shut they on a emergency these valve should always be easily accessible from the engine room and it ought not to be necessary for the coal box to be empty to gain access to they 406 _ q _ -- should each boiler have at least one safety valve for itself _ a _ -- yes it would be quite unsafe without this provision as the stop valve might possibly jam sometimes valve jam from a distortion in the shape of the boiler when a considerable pressure be put upon it 407 _ q _ -- how be the admission of the water into the boiler regulate _ a _ -- the admission of feed water into the boiler be regulate by hand by the engineer by means of cock and sometimes by spindle valve raise and lower by a screw cock appear to be the preferable expedient as they be less liable to accident or derangement than screw valve and in modern steam vessel they be generally employ 408 _ q _ -- at what point of the boiler be the feed introduce _ a _ -- the feed water be usually conduct from the feed cock to a point near the bottom of the boiler by means of a internal pipe the object of this arrangement be to prevent the rise steam from be condensed by the enter water by be introduce near the bottom of the boiler the water come into contact in the first place with the bottom of the furnace and flue and extract heat from they which could not be extract by water of a higher temperature whereby a saving of fuel be accomplish in some case the feed water be introduce into a case around the chimney from whence it descend into the boiler this plan appear to be a expedient one when the boiler be short of heating surface and more than a usual quantity of heat ascend the chimney but in well proportioned boiler a water case round the chimney be superfluous when a water casing be use the boiler be generally feed by a head of water the feed water be force up into a small tank from whence it descend into the boiler by the force of gravity while the surplus run to waste as in the feeding apparatus of land engine 409 _ q _ -- suppose that the engineer should shut off the feed water from the boiler while the engine be work what would be the result _ a _ -- the result would be to burst the feed pipe except for a safety valve place on the feed pipe between the engine and the boiler which safety valve open when any undue pressure come upon the pipe and allow the water to escape there be however generally a cock on the suction side of the feed pump which regulate the quantity of water draw into the pump but there must be cock on the boiler also to determine into which boiler the water shall be chiefly discharge and these cock be sometimes all shut accidentally at the same time 410 _ q _ -- be there no expedient in use in steam vessel for enable the position of the water level in the boiler to determine the quantity of feed water admit _ a _ -- in some steam vessel float have be introduce to regulate the feed but they action can not be depend on in agitate water if apply after the common fashion float would probably answer if place in a cylinder which communicate with the water in the boiler by means of small hole and a disc of metal might be attach to the end of a rod extend beneath the water level so as to resist irregular movement from the motion of the ship at sea which would otherwise impair the action of the apparatus 411 _ q _ -- how be the proper level of the water in the boiler of a steam vessel maintain when the engine be stop for some time and the boiler be blow off steam _ a _ -- by means of a separate pump work sometimes by hand but usually by a small separate engine call the donkey engine this pump by the aid of suitable cock will pump from the sea into the boiler from the sea upon deck either to wash deck or to extinguish fire and from the bilge overboard through a suitable orifice in the side of the ship locomotive boiler 412 _ q _ -- will you recapitulate the general feature of locomotive boiler _ a _ -- locomotive boiler consist of three portion -lrb- see fig 29 -rrb- : the barrel e e contain the tube the fire box b and the smoke box f of which the barrel smoke box and external fire box be always of iron but the internal fire box be generally make of copper though sometimes also it be make of iron the tube be sometimes of iron but generally of brass fix in by ferule the whole of the iron plate of a locomotive boiler which be subject to the pressure of steam should be lowmoor or bowling plate of the best quality and the copper should be coarse grain rather than rich or soft and be perfectly free from irregularity of structure and lamination 413 _ q _ -- what be the usual dimension of the barrel _ a _ -- the thickness of the plate compose the barrel of the boiler vary generally from 5\/16ths to 3\/8ths of a inch and the plate should run in the direction of the circumference so that the fiber of the iron may be in the direction of the strain the diameter of the barrel commonly vary from 3 ft to 3 ft 6 inch the diameter of the rivet should be from 11\/16ths to 3\/4ths of a inch and the pitch of the rivet or distance between they centre should be from 17\/8th to 2 inch 414 _ q _ -- how be the fire box of a locomotive construct _ a _ -- the space between the external and internal fire box form a water space which must be stay every 4-1\/2 or 5 inch by means of copper or iron stay bolt screw through the outer fire box into the metal of the inner fire box and securely rivet within it : iron stay bolt be as durable as copper and they superior tenacity give they a advantage sometimes tube be employ as stay the internal and external fire box be join together at the bottom by a n-shaped iron and round the fire door they be connect by means of a copper ring 1-1\/4 in thick and 2 in broad -- the inner fire box be dish sufficiently outward at that point and the outer fire box sufficiently inward to enable a circle of rivet 3\/4 of a inch in diameter pass through the copper ring and the two thickness of iron to make a water-tight joint the thickness of the plate compose the external fire box be in general 3\/8ths of a inch if the fire box be circular and from 3\/8ths to 1\/2 inch if the fire box be square and the thickness of the internal fire box be in most case 7\/16ths if copper and from 3\/8ths to 7\/16ths of a inch if of iron circular internal fire box if make of iron should be weld rather than rivet as the rivet head be liable to be burn away by the action of the fire and when the fire box be square each side should consist of a single plate turn over at the edge with a radius of 3 inch for the introduction of the rivet 415 _ q _ -- be there any provision for stiffen the crown of the furnace in a locomotive _ a _ -- the roof of the internal fire box whether flat as in stephenson 's engine or dome shape as in bury 's require to be stiffen with cross stay bar but the bar require to be stronger and more numerous when apply to a flat surface the end of these stay bar rest above the vertical side of the fire box and to the stay bar thus extend across the crown the crown be attach at interval by means of stay bolt there be project boss upon the stay bar encircle the bolt at every point where a bolt go through but in the other part they be keep clear of the fire box crown so as to permit the access of water to the metal and with the view of facilitate the ascent of the steam the bottom of each stay bar should be sharpen away in those part where it do not touch the boiler 416 _ q _ -- be any inconvenience experience from the intense heat in a locomotive furnace _ a _ -- the fire bar in locomotive have always be a source of trouble as from the intensity of the heat in the furnace they become so hot as to throw off a scale and to bend under the weight of the fuel the best alleviation of these evil lie in make the bar deep and thin : 4 or 5 inch deep by five eighth of a inch thick on the upper side and three eighth of a inch on the under side be find in practice to be good dimension in some locomotive a frame carry a number of fire bar be make so that it may be drop suddenly by loosen a catch but it be find that any such mechanism can rarely be long keep in work order as the molten clinker by run down between the frame and the boiler will generally glue the frame into its place it be therefore find preferable to fix the frame and to lift up the bar by the dart use by the stoker when any cause require the fire to be withdraw the furnace bar of locomotive be always make of malleable iron and indeed for every species of boiler malleable iron bar be to be prefer to bar of cast iron as they be more durable and may if thin be set closer together whereby the small coal or coke be save that would otherwise fall into the ash pit the ash box of locomotive be make of plate iron a quarter thick : it should not be less than 10 in deep and its bottom should be about 9 in above the level of the rail the chimney of a locomotive be make of plate iron one eighth of a inch thick : it be usually of the same diameter as the cylinder but be better smaller and must not stand more than 14 ft high above the level of the rail 417 _ q _ -- be locomotive boiler provide with a steam chest _ a _ -- the upper portion of the external fire box be usually form into a steam chest which be sometimes dome shaped sometimes semicircular and sometimes of a pyramidical form and from this steam chest the steam be conduct away by a internal pipe to the cylinder but in other case a independent steam chest be set upon the barrel of the boiler consist of a plate iron cylinder 20 inch in diameter 2 foot high and three eighth of a inch thick with a dome shape top and with the seam weld and the edge turn over to form a flange of attachment to the boiler the pyramidical dome of the form employ in stephenson 's locomotive present a considerable extent of flat surface to the pressure of the steam and this flat surface require to be very strongly stay with angle iron and tension rod whereas the semiglobular dome of the kind employ in bury 's engine require no stay whatever latterly however these dome over the fire box have be either much reduce in size or abandon altogether 418 _ q _ -- be any beneficial use make of the surplus steam of a locomotive _ a _ -- to save the steam which be form when the engine be stationary a pipe be usually fit to the boiler which on a cock be turn conduct the steam into the water in the tender whereby the feed water be heated and less fuel be subsequently require this method of dispose of the surplus steam may be adopt when the locomotive be descend incline or on any occasion where more steam be produce than the engine can consume 419_q _ -- what means be provide to facilitate the inspection and cleaning of locomotive boiler _ a _ -- the man hole or entrance into the boiler consist of a circular or oval aperture of about 15 in diameter place in bury 's locomotive at the apex of the dome and in stephenson 's upon the front of the boiler a few inch below the level of the round part and the cover of the man hole in bury 's engine contain the safety valve seat in whatever situation this man hole be place the surface of the ring encircle the hole and of the internal part of the door or cover should be accurately fit together by scrape or grind so that they need only the interposition of a little red lead to make they quite tight when screw together lead or canvas joint if of any considerable thickness will not long withstand the action of high pressure steam and the whole of the joint about a locomotive should be such that they require nothing more than a little paint or putty or a ring of wire gauze smear with white or red lead to make they perfectly tight there must be a mud hole opposite the edge of each water space if the fire box be square to enable the boiler to be easily clean out and these hole be most conveniently close by screw plug make slightly taper a cock for empty the boiler be usually fix at the bottom of the fire box and it should be so place as to be accessible when the engine be at work in order that the engine driver may blow off some water if necessary but it must not be in such a position as to send the water blow off among the machinery as it might carry sand or grit into the bearing to they manifest injury 420 _ q _ -- will you state the dimension of the tube plate and the means of secure the tube in it _ a _ -- the tube plate be generally make from five eighth to three fourth of a inch thick but seven eighth of a inch thick appear to be preferable as when the plate be thick the hole will not be so liable to change they figure during the process of ferule the tube : the distance between the tube should never be make less than three fourth of a inch and the hole should be slightly taper so as to enable the tube to hold the tube plate together the tube be secure in the tube plate by means of taper ferule drive into the end of the tube the ferule be for the most part make of steel at the fire box end and of work iron at the smoke box end though ferule of malleable cast iron have in some case be use with advantage : malleable cast iron ferule be almost as easily expand when hammer cold upon a mandrel as the common work iron one be at a work heat spring steel roll with a feather edge to facilitate its conversion into ferule be supply by some of the steel-maker of sheffield and it appear expedient to make use of steel thus prepare when steel ferule be employ in case where ferule be not employ it may be advisable to set out the tube behind the tube plate by means of a expand mandrel there be various form of this instrument one form be that know as prosser 's expand mandrel in which there be six or eight segment which be force out by means of a hexagonal or octagonal wedge which be force forward by a screw when the wedge be withdraw the segment collapse sufficiently to enable they to enter the tube and there be a annular protuberance on the exterior circle of the segment which protuberance when the mandrel be put into the tube just come behind the inner edge of the tube plate when the wedge be tighten up by the screw the protuberance on the exterior of the segment compose the mandrel cause a corresponding bulge to take place in the tube at the back of the tube plate and the tube be thereby bring into more intimate contact with the tube plate than would otherwise be the case there be a steel ring indent into the segment of prosser 's mandrel to contract the segment when the central wedge be withdraw a more convenient form of the instrument however be obtain by place the segment in a circular box with one end project and support each segment in the box by a tenon which fit into a mortise in the cylindrical box to expand the segment a round taper piece of steel like a drift be force into a central hole round which the segment be arrange a piece of steel tube also slit up to enable a central drift to expand it answer very well but the thickness of that part of the tube in which there require to be spring enough to let the mandrel expand require to be sufficiently reduce to prevent the piece from crack when the central drift be drive in by a hammer the drift be better when make with a globular head so that it may be strike back by the hammer as well as be drive in a expand mandrel with a central drift be more rapid in its operation than when the expansion be produce by means of a screw 421 _ q _ -- will you explain the means that be adopt to regulate the admission of steam to the cylinder _ a _ -- in locomotive the admission of the steam from the boiler to the cylinder be regulate by a valve call the regulator which be generally place immediately above the internal fire box and be connect with two copper pipe -- one conduct steam from the highest point of the dome down to it and the other conduct the steam that have pass through it along the boiler to the upper part of the smoke box regulator may be divide into two sort viz those with slide valve and steam port and those with conical valve and seat of which the latter kind be the best the former kind have for the most part consist of a circular valve and face with radial aperture the valve resemble the outstretched wing of a butterfly and be make to revolve on its central pivot by connect link between its outer edge or by its central spindle in some of stephenson 's engine the regulator consist of a slide valve cover a port on the top of the valve chest a rod pass from this valve through the smoke box below the boiler and by means of a lever parallel to the start lever be bring up to the engineer 's reach cock be at first use as regulator but be give up as they be find liable to stick fast a gridiron slide valve have be use by stephenson which consist of a perforated square move upon a face with a equal number of hole this plan of a valve give with a small movement a large area of opening in bury 's engine a sort of conical plug be use which be withdraw by turn the handle in front of the fire box : a spiral grove of a very large pitch be make in the valve spindle in which fit a pin fix to the boiler and by turn the spindle a end motion be give to it which either shut or open the steam passage accord to the direction in which it be turn the best regulator would probably be a valve of the equilibrium description such as be use in the cornish engine : there would be no friction in such a regulator and it could be open or shut with a small amount of force such valve indeed be now sometimes employ for regulator in locomotive chapter viii constructive detail of engine pump engine 422 _ q _ -- will you explain the course of procedure in the erection of a pump engine such as boulton and watt introduce into cornwall _ a _ -- the best instruction on this subject be those of mr watt himself which be as follow : -- have fix on the proper situation of the pump in the pit from its center measure out the distance to the center of the cylinder from which set off all the other dimension of the house include the thickness of the wall and dig out the whole of the include ground to the depth of the bottom of the cellar so that the bottom of the cylinder may stand on a level with the natural ground of the place or lower if convenient for the less the height of the house above the ground the firmer it will be the foundation of the wall must be lay at least two foot lower than the bottom of the cellar unless the foundation be firm rock and care must be take to leave a small drain into the pit quite through the lowest part of the foundation of the lever wall to let off any water that may be spill in the engine house or may naturally come into the cellar if the foundation at that depth do not prove good you must either go down to a better if in you reach or make it good by a platform of wood or pile or both 423 _ q _ -- these direction refer to the foundation _ a _ -- yes but i will now proceed to the other part within the house low wall must be build to carry the cylinder beam so as to leave sufficient room to come at the hold down bolt and the end of these beam must also be lodge in the wall the lever wall must be build in the firmest manner and run solid course by course with thin lime mortar care be take that the lime have not be long slake if the house be build of stone let the stone be large and long and let many header be lay through the wall : it should also be a rule that every stone be lay on the broadest bed it have and never set on its edge a course or two above the lintel of the door that lead to the condenser build into the wall two parallel flat thin bar of iron equally distant from each other and from the outside and inside of the wall and reach the whole breadth of the lever wall about a foot higher in the wall lay at every four foot of the breadth of the front other bar of the same kind at right angle to the former course and reach quite through the thickness of the wall and at each front corner lay a long bar in the middle of the side wall and reach quite through the front wall if these bar be 10 foot or 12 foot long it will be sufficient when the house be build up nearly to the bottom of the opening under the great beam another double course of bar be to be build in as have be direct at the level of the upper cylinder beam hole must be leave in the wall for they end with room to move they laterally so that the cylinder may be get in and smaller hole must be leave quite through the wall for the introduction of iron bar which be firmly fasten to the cylinder beam at one end and screw at the other or outer end will serve by they go through both the front and back wall to bind the house more firmly together the spring beam or iron bar fasten to they must reach quite through the back wall and be key or screw up tight and they must be firmly fasten to the lever wall on each side either by iron bar firm piece of wood or long strong stone reach far back into the wall they must also be bed solidly and the residue of the opening must be build up in the firmest manner 424 _ q _ -- if there be a deficiency of water for the purpose of condensation what course should be pursue _ a _ -- if there be no water in the neighborhood that can be employ for the purpose of condensation it will be necessary to make a pond dig in the earth for the reception of the water deliver by the air pump to the end that it may be cool and use again for the engine the pond may be three or four foot deep and line with turf puddle or otherwise make water tight throw up the water into the air in the form of a jet to cool it have be find detrimental as the water be then charge with air which vitiate the vacuum 425 _ q _ -- how be the piston of a pump engine pack _ a _ -- to pack the piston take sixty common-sized white or untarred rope-yarn and with they plait a gasket or flat rope as close and firm as possible taper for eighteen inch at each end and long enough to go round the piston and overlap for that length coil this rope the thin way as hard as possible and beat it with a sledge hammer until its breadth answer the place put it in and beat it down with a wooden drift and a hand mallet pour some melt tallow all around then pack in a layer of white oakum half a inch thick so that the whole packing may have the depth of five to six inch depend on the size of the engine finally screw down the junk ring the packing should be beat solid but not too hard otherwise it will create so great a friction as to prevent the easy going of the engine abundance of tallow should be allow especially at first the quantity require will be less as the cylinder grow smooth in some of the more modern pump engine the piston be provide with metallic packing consist for the most part of a single ring with a tongue piece to break the joint and packed behind with hemp the upper edge of the metallic ring be sharpen away from the inside so as to permit more conveniently the application of hemp packing behind it and the junk ring be make much the same as if no metallic packing be employ 426 _ q _ -- will you explain the mode of put the engine into operation _ a _ -- to set the engine go the steam must be raise until the pressure in the steam pipe be at least equal to three pound on the square inch and when the cylinder jacket be fully warm and steam issue freely from the jacket cock open all the valve or regulator the steam will then forcibly blow out the air or water contain in the eduction pipe and to get rid of the air in the cylinder shut the steam valve after have blow through the engine for a few minute the cold water round the condenser will condense some of the steam contain in the eduction pipe and its place will be supply by some of the air from the cylinder the steam valve must again be open to blow out that air and the operation be to be repeat until the air be all draw out of the cylinder when that be the case shut all the valve and observe if the vacuum gauge show a vacuum in the condenser when there be a vacuum equivalent to three inch of mercury open the injection a very little and shut it again immediately and if this produce any considerable vacuum open the exhausting valve a very little way and the injection at the same time if the engine do not now commence its motion it must be blow through again until it move if the engine be lightly load or if there be no water in the pump the throttle valve must be keep nearly close and the top and exhaustion regulator must be open only a very little way else the engine will make its stroke with violence and perhaps do mischief if there be much unbalanced weight on the pump end the plug which open the steam valve must be so regulate that the valve will only be open very slightly and if after a few stroke it be find that the engine go out too slowly the valve may be then so adjust as to open wider the engine should always be make to work full stroke that be until the catch pin be make to come within half a inch of the spring at each end and the piston should stand high enough in the cylinder when the engine be at rest to spill over into the perpendicular steam pipe any water which may be condensed above it for if water remain upon the piston it will increase the consumption of steam when the engine be to be stop shut the injection valve and secure it and adjust the tappet so as to prevent the exhausting valve from open and to allow the steam valve to open and remain open otherwise a partial vacuum may arise in the cylinder and it may be fill with water from the injection or from leak a single act engine when it be in good order ought to be capable of go as slow as one stroke in ten minute and as fast as ten stroke in one minute and if it do not fulfil these condition there be some fault which should be ascertain and remedy 427 _ q _ -- you explanation have reference to the pump engine as introduce into cornwall by watt : have any modification be since make upon it _ a _ -- in the modern cornish engine the steam be use very expansively and a high pressure of steam be employ in some case a double cylinder engine be use in which the steam after have give motion to a small piston on the principle of a high pressure engine pass into a larger cylinder where it operate on the principle of a condense engine but there be no superior effect gain by the use of two cylinder and there be greater complexity in the apparatus instead of the lever wall cast iron column be now frequently use for support the main beam in pump engine and the cylinder end of the main beam be generally make longer than the pump end in engine make in cornwall so as to enable the cylinder to have a long stroke and the piston to move quickly without communicate such a velocity to the pump bucket as will make they work with such a shock as to wear themselves out quickly a high pressure of steam too can be employ where the stroke be long without involve the necessity of make the work part of such large dimension as would otherwise be necessary for the strength of the part of a single act engine will require to be much the same whatever the length of the stroke may be 428 _ q _ -- what kind of pump be mostly use in drain deep mine _ a _ -- the pump now universally prefer be the plunger pump which admit of be pack or tighten while the engine be at work but the lowest lift of a mine be generally supply with a pump on the suction principle both with the view of enable the lowest pipe to follow the water with facility as the shaft be sink deeper and to obviate the inconvenience of the valve of the pump be render inaccessible by any flooding in the mine the pump valve of deep mine be a perpetual source of expense and trouble as from the pressure of water upon they it be difficult to prevent they from close with violence and many expedient have be contrived to mitigate the evil of which the valve know as harvey and west 's valve have perhaps gain the widest acceptation 429 _ q _ -- will you describe harvey and west 's pump valve _ a _ -- this valve be a compromise between the equilibrium valve of the kind employ for admit the steam to and from the cylinder in single act engine and the common spindle valve formerly use for that purpose and to comprehend its action it be necessary that the action of the equilibrium valve which have be already represent fig 34 should first be understand this valve consist substantially of a cylinder open at both end and capable of slide upon a stationary piston fix upon a rod the length of the cylinder which proceed from the center of the orifice the valve be intend to close it be clear that when the cylinder be press down until its edge rest upon the bottom of the box contain it the orifice of the pipe must be close as the steam can neither escape past the edge of the cylinder nor between the cylinder and the piston and it be equally clear that as the pressure upon the cylinder be equal all around it and the whole of the downward pressure be maintain by the stationary piston the cylinder can be raise or lower without any further exertion of force than be necessary to overcome the friction of the piston and of the rod by which the cylinder be raise instead of the rub surface of a piston however a conical valve face between the cylinder and piston be employ which be tight only when the cylinder be in its lowest position and there be a similar face between the edge of the cylinder and the bottom of the box in which it be place the move part of the valve too instead of be a perfect cylinder be bulge outward in the middle so as to permit the steam to escape past the stationary piston when the cylindrical part of the valve be raise it be clear that if such a valve be apply to a pump no pressure of water within the pump would suffice to open it neither would any pressure of water above the valve cause it to shut with violence and if a equilibrium valve therefore be use as a pump valve at all it must be open and shut by mechanical means in harvey and west 's valve however the equilibrium principle be only partially adopt the lower face be considerably larger in diameter than the upper face and the difference constitute a annulus of pressure which will cause the valve to open or shut with the same force as a spindle valve of the area of the annulus to deaden the shock still more effectually the lower face of the valve be make to strike upon end wood drive into a annular recess in the pump bucket and valve thus construct work with very little noise or tremor but it be find in practice that the use of harvey and west 's valve or any contrivance of a similar kind add materially to the load upon the pump especially in low lift where the addition of a load to the valve make a material addition to the total resistance which the engine have to overcome instead of end wood drive into a recess for the valve to strike upon a mixture of tin and lead cast in a recess be now frequently use and be find to be preferable to the wood 430 _ q _ -- be there any other kind of pump valve which be free from the shock incidental to the working of common valve _ a _ -- in some case canvass valve be use for pump with the effect of materially mitigate the shock but they require frequent renewal and be of inferior eligibility in they action to the slide valve which might in many case be apply to pump without inconvenience 431 _ q _ -- could not a form of pump be devise capable of work without valve at all _ a _ -- it appear probable that by work a common reciprocating pump at a high speed a continuous flow of water might be maintain through the pipe in such a way as to render the existence of any valve superfluous after once the action be begin the momentum of the move water act in fact as valve the centrifugal pump however threaten to supersede pump of every other kind and if the centrifugal pump be employ there will be no necessity for pump valve at all there be less loss of effect by the centrifugal pump than by the common pump 432 _ q _ -- what be the best form of the centrifugal pump _ a _ -- there be two form in which the centrifugal pump may be apply to mine -- that in which the arm diverge from the bottom like the letter v and that in which revolving arm be set in a tight case near the bottom of the mine and be turn by a shaft from the surface such pump both draw and force and either by arrange they in a succession of lift in the shaft of the mine or otherwise the water may be draw without inconvenience from any depth the introduction of the centrifugal pump would obviously extinguish the single act engine as rotative engine work at a high speed would be the most appropriate form of engine where the centrifugal pump be employ 433 _ q _ -- this would not be a heavy deprivation _ a _ -- the single act engine be a remnant of engineering barbarism which must now be supersede by more compendious contrivance the cornish engine though rudely manufacture be very expensive in production as a large engine do but little work whereas by employ a smaller engine move with a high speed the dimension may be so far diminish that the most refined machinery may be obtain at less than the present cost 434 _ q _ -- be not the cornish engine more economical in fuel than other engine _ a _ -- it be a mistake to suppose that there be any peculiar virtue in the existing form of cornish engine to make it economical in fuel or that a less lethargic engine would necessarily be less efficient the large duty of the engine in cornwall be traceable to the large employment of the principle of expansion and to a few other cause which may be make of quite as decisive efficacy in smaller engine work with a quicker speed and there be therefore no argument in the performance of the present engine against the propose substitution various form of marine engine 435 _ q _ -- what species of paddle engine do you consider to be the best _ a _ -- the oscillate engine 436 _ q _ -- will you explain the grounds of that preference _ a _ -- the engine occupy little space consist of few part be easily accessible for repair and may be both light and strong at the same time in the case of large engine the crank in the intermediate shaft be a disadvantage as it be difficult to obtain such a forge quite sound but by forge it in three crank flat bar which be then lay together and weld into a square shaft a sound forge will be more probable and the bar should be round a little on the side which be weld to allow the scoria to escape during that operation it be important in so large a forge not to let the fire be too fierce else the surface of the iron will be burn before the heart be bring to a welding heat in some case in oscillate engine the air pump have be work by a eccentric and that may at any time be do where doubt of obtain a sound intermediate shaft be entertain but the precaution must be take to make the eccentric very wide so as to distribute the pressure over a large surface else the eccentric will be apt to heat 437 _ q _ -- have not objection be bring against the oscillate engine _ a _ -- in common with every other improvement the oscillate engine at the time of its introduction encounter much opposition the cylinder it be say would become oval the trunnion bearing would be liable to heat and the trunnion joint to leak the strain upon the trunnion would be apt to bend in or bend out the side of the cylinder and the circumstance of the cylinder be fix across its center while the shaft require to accommodate itself to the working of the ship might it be think be the occasion of such a strain upon the trunnion as would either break they or bend the piston rod it be a sufficient reply to these objection to say that they be all hypothetical and that none of they in practice have be find to exist -- to such a extent at least as to occasion any inconvenience but it be not difficult to show that they be altogether unsubstantial even without a recourse to the disproof afford by experience 438 _ q _ -- be there not a liability in the cylinder to become oval from the strain throw on it by the piston _ a _ -- there be no doubt a tendency in oscillate engine for the cylinder and the stuffing box to become oval but after a number of year ' wear it be find that the amount of ellipticity be less than that which be find to exist in the cylinder of side lever engine after a similar trial the resistance oppose by friction to the oscillation of the cylinder be so small that a man be capable of move a large cylinder with one hand whereas in the side lever engine if the parallel motion be in the least untrue which be at some time or other a almost inevitable condition the piston be push with great force against the side of the cylinder whereby a large amount of wear and friction be occasion the trunnion bearing instead of be liable to heat like other journal be keep down to the temperature of the steam by the flow of steam pass through they and the trunnion packing be not liable to leak when the packing before be introduce be squeeze in a cylindrical mould 439 _ q _ -- might not the eduction trunnion be immerse in water _ a _ -- in some case a hollow or lantern brass about one third or one fourth the length of the packing space and supply with steam or water by a pipe be introduce in the middle of the packing so that if there be any leakage through the trunnion it will be a leakage of steam or water which will not vitiate the vacuum but in ordinary case this device will not be necessary and it be not commonly employ it be clear that there can be no buckling of the side of the cylinder by the strain upon the trunnion if the cylinder be make strong enough and in cylinder of the ordinary thickness such a action have never be experience nor be it the fact that the intermediate shaft of steam vessel to which part alone the motion be communicate by the engine require to adapt itself to the alter form of the vessel as the engine and intermediate shaft be rigidly connect although the paddle shaft require to be capable of such a adaptation even if this objection exist however it could easily be meet by make the crank pin of the ball and socket fashion which would permit the position of the intermediate shaft relatively with that of the cylinder to be slightly change without throw a undue strain upon any of the work part 440 _ q _ -- be the trunk engine inferior to the oscillate _ a _ -- a very elegant and efficient arrangement of trunk engine suitable for paddle vessel have latterly be employ by messr rennie of which all the part resemble those of penn 's oscillate engine except that the cylinder be stationary instead of be movable and a round trunk or pipe set upon the piston and move steam tight through the cylinder cover enable the connect rod which be fix to the piston to vibrate within it to the requisite extent but the vice of all trunk engine be that they be necessarily more wasteful of steam as the large mass of metal enter into the composition of the trunk move as it do alternately into the atmosphere and the steam must cool and condense a part of the steam the radiation of heat from the interior of the trunk will have the same operation though in vertical trunk engine the loss from this cause might probably be reduce by fill the trunk with oil so far as this could be do without the oil be spill over the edge 441 _ q _ -- what species of screw engine do you consider the best _ a _ -- i be incline to give the preference to a variety of the horizontal steeple engine such as be first use in hm amphion in this engine the cylinder lie on they side and they be place near the side of the vessel with they mouth point to the keel from each cylinder two long piston rod proceed across the vessel to a cross head work in guide and from this cross head a connect rod return back to the center of the vessel and give motion to the crank the piston rod be so place in the piston that one of they pass above the crank shaft and the other below the crank shaft the cross head lie in the same horizontal plane as the center of the cylinder and a lug project upward from the cross head to engage one piston rod and downward from the cross head to engage the other piston rod the air pump be double act and its piston or bucket have the same stroke as the piston of the engine the air pump bucket derive its motion from a arm on the cross head and a similar arm be usually employ in engine of this class to work the feed and bilge pump 442 _ q _ -- be not inconvenience experience in direct act screw engine from the great velocity of they motion _ a _ -- not if they be properly construct but they require to be much stronger to be fit with more care and to have the bearing surface much larger than be necessary in engine move slowly the momentum of the reciprocate part should also be balance by a weight apply to the crank or crank shaft as be do in locomotive a very convenient arrangement for obtain surface be to form the crank of each engine of two cast iron disc cast with heavy side the excess of weight upon the heavy side be nearly equal to that of the piston and its connection when the piston be travel in one direction the weight be travel in the opposite and the momentum of the piston and its attachment which be arrest at each reciprocation be just balance by the equal and opposite momentum of the weight one advantage of the horizontal engine be that a single engine may be employ whereby greater simplicity of the machinery and greater economy of fuel will be obtain since there will be less radiate surface in one cylinder than in two cylinder piston and valve 443 _ q _ -- be it a beneficial practice to make cylinder with steam jacket _ a _ -- in cornwall where great attention be pay to economy of fuel all the engine be make with steam jacket and in some case a flue wind spirally round the cylinder for keep the steam hot mr watt in he early practice discard the steam jacket for a time but resume it again as he find its discontinuance occasion a perceptible waste of fuel and in modern engine it have be find that where a jacket be use less coal be consume than where the use of a jacket be reject the cause of this diminished effect be not of very easy perception for the jacket expose a larger radiate surface for the escape of the heat than the cylinder nevertheless the fact have be establish beyond doubt by repeat trial that engine provide with a jacket be more economical than engine without one the exterior of the cylinder or jacket should be cover with several ply of feel and then be case in timber which must be very narrow the board be first dry in a stove and then bind round the cylinder with hoop like the stave of a cask in many of the cornish engine the steam be let into casing form in the cylinder cover and cylinder bottom for the further economisation of the heat and the cylinder stuffing box be make very deep and a lantern or hollow brass be introduce into the center of the packing into which brass the steam gain admission by a pipe provide for the purpose so that in the event of the packing become leaky it will be steam that will be leak into the cylinder instead of air which be incondensable would impair the efficiency of the engine a lantern brass of a similar kind be sometimes introduce into the stuff box of oscillate engine but its use there be to receive the lateral pressure of the piston rod and thus take any strain off the packing 444 _ q _ -- will you explain the proper course to pursue in the production of cylinder _ a _ -- in all engine the valve case if make in a separate piece from the cylinder should be attach by means of a metallic joint as such a barbarism as a rust joint in such situation be no longer permissible in the case of large engine with valve casing suitable for long slide a expansion joint in the valve casing should invariably be insert otherwise the steam by gain admission to the valve case before it can enter the cylinder expand the case while the cylinder remain unaltered in its dimension and the joint be damage and in some case the cylinder be crack by the great strain thus introduce the chest of the blow-through valve be very commonly cast upon the valve casing and in engine where the cylinder be stationary this be the most convenient practice all engine where the valve be not of such a construction as to leave the face when a pressure exceed that of the steam be create in the cylinder by priming or otherwise should be provide with a escape valve to let out the water and such valve should be so construct that the water can not fly out with violence over the attendant but it should be conduct away by a suitable pipe to a place where its discharge can occasion no inconvenience the stuff box of all engine which can not be stop frequently to be repack should be make very deep metallic packing in the stuffing box have be use in some engine consist in most instance of one or more ring cut spring and slip upon the piston rod before the cross head be put on and pack with hemp behind this species of packing answer very well when the parallel motion be true and the piston rod free from scratch and it accomplish a material saving of tallow in some case a piece of sheet brass pack behind with hemp have be introduce with good effect a flange be turn over on the under edge of the brass to prevent it from slip up or down with the motion of the rod the sheet brass speedily put a excellent polish upon the rod and such a packing be more easily keep and require less tallow than where hemp alone be employ in side lever marine engine the attachment of the cylinder to the diagonal stay be generally make of too small a area and the flange be make too thick a very thick flange cast on any part of a cylinder endanger the soundness of the cylinder by induce a unequal contraction of the metal and it be a preferable course to make the flange for the attachment or the frame thin and the surface large -- the bolt be turn bolt and nicely fit if from malformation in this part the frame work to a inconvenient extent the best expedient appear to be the introduction of a number of steel taper bolt the hole have be previously bore out and if the flange be thick enough square key may also be introduce half into one flange and half into the other so as to receive the strain if the jaw crack or break away however it will be best to apply a malleable iron hoop around the cylinder to take the strain and this will in all case be the preferable expedient where from any peculiarity of structure there be a difficulty in introduce bolt and key of sufficient strength 445 _ q _ -- which be the most eligible species of piston _ a _ -- for large engine piston with a metallic packing consist of a single ring with the end mortice into one another and a piece of metal let in flush over the joint and rivet to one end of the ring appear to be the best species of piston and if the cylinder be oscillate it will be expedient to chamfer off the upper edge of the ring on the inner side and to pack it at the back with hemp if the cylinder be a stationary one spring may be substitute for the hemp packing but in any case it will be expedient to make the vertical joint of the end of the ring run a little obliquely so as to prevent the joint form a ridge in the cylinder for small piston two ring may be employ make somewhat eccentric internally to give a greater thickness of metal in the center of the ring these ring must be set one above the other in the cylinder and the joint which be oblique must be set at right angle with one another so as to obviate any disposition of the ring in they expansion to wear the cylinder oval the ring must first be turn a little larger than the diameter of the cylinder and a piece be then to be cut out so that when the end be bring together the ring will just enter within the cylinder the ring while retain in a state of compression be then to be put in the lathe and turn very truly and finally it be to be hammer on the inside with the small end of the hammer to expand the metal and thus increase the elasticity 446 _ q _ -- the ring should be carefully fit to one another laterally _ a _ -- the ring be to be fit laterally to the piston and to one another by scrape -- a steady pin be fix upon the flange of the piston and fitting into a corresponding hole in the lower ring to keep the lower ring from turn round and a similar pin be fix into the top edge of the lower ring to prevent the upper ring from turn round but the hole into which these pin fit must be make oblong to enable the ring to press outward as the rub surface wear in most case it will be expedient to press the packing ring out with spring where they be not pack behind with hemp and the spring should be make very strong as the prevail fault of spring be they weakness sometimes short bent spring set round at regular interval between the packing ring and body of the piston be employ the center of each spring be secure by a steady pin or bolt screw into the side of the piston but it will not signify much what kind of spring be use provide they have sufficient tension when piston be make of a single ring or of a succession of single ring the strength of each ring should be test previously to its introduction into the piston by means of a lever load by a heavy weight 447 _ q _ -- what kind of piston be employ by messr penn _ a _ -- messr penn 's piston for oscillate engine have a single packing ring with a tongue piece or mortice end make in the manner already describe the ring be pack behind with hemp packing and the piece of metal which cover the joint be a piece of thick sheet copper or brass and be indented into the iron of the ring so as to offer no obstruction to the application of the hemp the ring be fit to the piston only on the under edge the top edge be round to a point from the inside and the junk ring do not bear upon it but the junk ring squeeze down the hemp packing between the packing ring and the body of the piston 448 _ q _ -- how should the piston rod be secure to the piston _ a _ -- the piston rod where it fit into the piston should have a good deal of taper for if the taper be too small the rod will be draw through the hole and the piston will be split asunder small groove be sometimes turn out of the piston rod above and below the cutter hole and hemp be introduce in order to make the piston eye tight most piston rod be fix to the piston by means of a gib and cutter but in some case the upper portion of the rod within the eye be screw and it be fix into the piston by means of a indented nut this nut be in some case hexagonal and in other case the exterior form a portion of a cone which completely fill a corresponding recess in the piston but nut make in this way become rust into they seat after some time and can not be start again without much difficulty messr miller ravenhill & co fix in they piston rod by means of a indented hexagonal nut which may be start by means of a open box key the thread of the screw be make flat upon the one side and much slant on the other whereby a greater strength be secure without create any disposition to split the nut in side lever engine it be a judicious practice to add a nut to the top of the piston rod in addition to the cutter for secure the piston rod to the cross head in a good example of a engine thus provide the piston rod be 7 in in diameter and the screw 5 in the part of the rod which fit into the cross head eye be 1 ft 5-1\/2 in long and taper from 6-1\/2 in to 6-13\/16 in diameter this proportion of taper be a good one if the taper be less or if a portion of the piston rod within the cross head eye be leave untapered as be sometimes the case it be very difficult to detach the part from one another 449 _ q _ -- which be the most beneficial construction of slide valve _ a _ -- the best construction of slide valve appear to be that adopt by messr penn for they larger engine and which consist of a three port valve to the back of which a ring be apply of a area equal to that of exhaustion port and which by bear steam tight against the back of the case so that a vacuum may be maintain within the ring put the valve in equilibrium so that it may be move with a inconsiderable exercise of force the back of the valve casing be put on like a door and its internal surface be make very true by scrape there be a hole through the valve so as to conduct away any steam which may enter within the ring by leakage and the ring be keep tight against the back of the casing by means of a ring situate beneath the bearing ring provide with four lug through which bolt pass tap into boss on the back of the valve and by unscrew these bolt -- which may be do by means of a box key which pass through hole in the case close with screw plug -- the lower ring be raise upward carry the bearing ring before it the ring must obviously be fit over a boss upon the back of the valve and between the ring which be of brass a gasket ring be interpose to compensate by its compressibility for any irregularity of pressure and each of the bolt be provide with a ratchet collar to prevent it from turn back so that the engineer in tighten these bolt will have no difficulty in tighten they equally if he count the number of click make by the ratchet where this species of valve be use it be indispensable that large escape valve be apply to the cylinder as a valve on this construction be unable to leave the face in locomotive engine the valve universally employ be the common three port valve 450 _ q _ -- might not a equilibrium valve be so construct by the interposition of spring as to enable it to leave the cylinder face when a internal force be apply _ a _ -- that can no doubt be do and in some engine have be do in the screw steamer azof the valve be of the equilibrium construction but the plate which carry the packing on which the top ring rest be a octagon and fit into a octagonal recess on the back of the valve below each side of the octagon there be a bent flat spring which lift up the octagonal plate and with it the packing ring against the back of the valve casing and should water get into the cylinder it escape by lift the valve which be render possible by the compressibility of the spring a equivalent arrangement be show in fig 39 and 40 where the ring be lift by spiral spring -lrb- illustration : fig 39 equilibrium gridiron slide valve longitudinal section scale 3\/4 inch = 1 foot -rrb- 451 _ q _ -- what species of valve be that show in fig 39 and 40 -lrb- illustration : fig 40 equilibrium gridiron slide valve back view with ring remove scale 3\/4 inch = 1 foot -rrb- _ a _ -- it be a equilibrium gridiron valve

and d be the eduction passage s s s s show the limit of the steam space for the steam penetrate to the central chamber s s by the side of the valve when the valve be open upon the steam side the cylinder receive steam through both port at that end of the cylinder and both port at the other end of the cylinder be at the same time open to the eduction the benefit of this species of valve be that it give the same opening of the valve that be give in ordinary engine with half the amount of travel or if three port be make instead of two then it would give the same area of open that be give in common engine with one third the amount of travel for direct act screw engine this species of valve be now extensively use 452 _ q _ -- will you describe the configuration and mode of attachment of the eccentric by which the valve be move _ a _ -- in marine engine whether paddle or screw if move at a slow rate of speed the eccentric be generally loose upon the shaft for the purpose of backing and be furnish with a back balance and catch so that it may stand either in the position for go ahead or in that for go astern the body of the eccentric be of cast iron and it be put on the shaft in two piece the half be put together with rebate joint to keep they from separate laterally and they be prevent from slide out by round steel pin each ground into both half square key would probably be preferable to round pin in this arrangement as the pin tend to wedge the jaw of the eccentric asunder in some case the half of the eccentric be bolt together by means of flange which be perhaps the preferable practice the eccentric hoop in marine and land engine be generally of brass it be expedient to cast a oil cup on the eccentric hoop and where practicable a pan should be place beneath the eccentric for the reception of the oil dropping the notch of the eccentric rod for the reception of the pin of the valve shaft be usually steel to prevent inconvenient wear for when the side of the notch wear the valve movement be not only disturbed but it be very difficult to throw the eccentric rod out of gear it be find to be preferable however to fit this notch with a brass bush for the wear be then less rapid and it be a easy thing to replace this bush with another when it become wear the eccentric catch of the kind usually employ in marine engine sometimes break off at the first bolt hole and it be preferable to have a bolt in advance of the catch face or to have a hoop encircle the shaft with the catch weld on it the hoop itself be fix by bolt or a key this hoop may either be put on before the crank in one piece or afterwards in two piece 453 _ q _ -- be such eccentric use in direct act screw engine _ a _ -- no direct act screw engine be usually fit with the link motion and two fix eccentric air pump and condenser 454 _ q _ -- what be the detail of the air pump _ a _ -- the air pump bucket and valve be all of brass in modern marine engine and the chamber of the pump be line with copper or make wholly of brass whereby a single boring suffice when a copper lining be use the pump be first bore out and a bent sheet of copper be introduce which be make accurately to fill the place by hammer the copper on the inside air pump rod of muntz 's metal or copper be much use iron rod cover with brass be generally waste away where the bottom cone fit into the bucket eye and if the case be at all porous the water will insinuate itself between the casing and the rod and eat away the iron if iron rod cover with brass be use the brass casing should come some distance into the bucket eye the cutter should be of brass and a brass washer should cover the under side of the eye so as to defend the end of the rod from the salt water rod of muntz 's metal be probably on the whole to be prefer it be a good practice to put a nut on the top of the rod to secure it more firmly in the cross head eye where that plan can be conveniently adopt the part of the rod which fit into the cross head eye should have more taper when make of copper or brass than when make of iron as if the taper be small the rod may get stave into the eye whereby its detachment will be difficult 455 _ q _ -- what species of packing be use in air pump _ a _ -- metallic packing have in some instance be employ in air pump bucket but its success have not be such as to lead to its further adoption the packing commonly employ be hemp a deep solid block of metal however without any packing be often employ with a satisfactory result but this block should have circular groove cut round its edge to hold water where ordinary packing be employ the bucket should always be make with a junk ring whereby the packing may be easily screw down at any time with facility in slow move engine the bucket valve be generally of the spindle or pot-lid kind but butterfly valve be sometimes use the foot and delivery valve be for the most part of the flap or hang kind these valve all make a considerable noise in work and be objectionable in many way valve on belidor 's construction which be in effect that of a throttle valve hang off the center be some year ago propose for the delivery and foot valve and it appear probable that they operation would be more satisfactory than that of the valve usually employ 456 _ q _ -- where be the delivery valve usually situate _ a _ -- some delivery valve seat be bolt into the mouth of the air pump whereby access to the pump bucket be render difficult : but more commonly the delivery valve be a flap valve exterior to the pump if delivery valve seat be put in the mouth of the air pump at all the best mode of fix they appear to be that adopt by messr maudslay the top of the pump barrel be make quite fair across and upon this flat surface a plate contain the delivery valve be set there be a small ledge all round to keep it steady between the bottom of the stuffing box of the pump cover and the eye of the valve seat a short pipe extend encircle the pump rod its lower end check into the eye of the valve seat and its upper end widen out to form the bottom of the stuffing box of the pump cover upon the top of this pipe some screw press which be accessible from the top of the stuffing box gland and the packing also aid in keep down the pipe the function of which be to retain the valve seat in its place when the pump bucket have to be examine the valve seat may be sling with the cover so as to come up with the same purchase for the bucket valve of such pump messr maudslay employ two or more concentric ring valve with a small lift these valve have give a good deal of trouble in some case in consequence of the frequent fracture of the bolt which guide and confine the ring but this be only a fault of detail which be easily remedy and the principle appear to be superior to that of any of the other metallic air pump valve at present in common use -lrb- illustration : fig 41 trunk air pump scale 3\/4 inch to 1 foot -rrb- 457 _ q _ -- be not air pump valve now very generally make of indium rubber _ a _ -- they be almost invariably so make if the engine be travel fast as in the case of direct act screw engine and they be very often make of large disc or ring of indium rubber even when the engine travel slowly a very usual and eligible arrangement for many purpose be that show in fig 41 where both foot and delivery valve be situate in the end of the pump and they as well as the valve in the bucket be make of indium rubber ring close on a grate the trunk in the air pump enable guide rod to be dispense with -lrb-

air pump section -rrb- 458 _ q _ -- the air pump when double acting have of course inlet and outlet valve at each end _ a _ -- yes and the general arrangement of the valve of double acting air pump such as be usual in direct act screw engine be that represent in the figure of penn 's trunk engine already describe in chapter i each inlet and outlet valve consist of a number of indium rubber disc set over a perforated brass plate and each disc be bind down by a bolt in the middle which bolt also secure a brass guard set above the disc to prevent it from rise too high the usual configuration of those valve be that represent in fig 42 43 and 44 fig 42 and 43 be a section and ground plan of the species of valve use by messr penn and fig 44 be a section of that use by messr maudslay it be important in these valve to have the indium rubber thick -- say about a inch thick for valve eight inch in diameter it be also advisable to make the central bolt with a nut above and a nut below and to form the bolt with a counter sink neck so that it will not fall down when the top nut be remove the lower point of the bolt should be rivet over on the nut to prevent it from unscrew and the top end should have a split pin through the point for the same purpose the hole through which the bolt pass should be tap though the bolt be not screw into it so that if a bolt break a temporary stud may be screw into the hole without the necessity of take out the whole plate the guard should be large else the disc may stretch in the central hole until it come over it but the guard should not permit too much lift of the valve else a good deal of the water and air will return into the pump at the return stroke before the valve shut penn 's guard be rather small and maudslay 's permit too much lift 459 _ q _ -- what be the proper area through the valve grating _ a _ -- the collective area should be at least equal to the area of the pump piston and the lower edge of the perforation should be round off to afford more free ingress or egress to the water 460 _ q _ -- be there much strain throw on the plate in which the valve be set _ a _ -- a good deal of strain and in the earlier direct act screw engine these plate be nearly in every case make too light they should be make thick have strong feather upon they and be very securely bolt down with split pin at the point of the bolt to prevent they from unscrew the plate will be very apt to be break should some of the bolt become loose of course all the bolt and split pin as well as the plate and guard must be of brass 461 _ q _ -- how be the plate to be take out should that become necessary _ a _ -- they be usually take out through a door in the top of the hot well provide for that purpose which door should be as large as the plate themselves and it be a good precaution to cast upon this door -- which will be of cast iron -- six or eight stout project foot which will press upon the top of the outlet or delivery valve plate when the door be screw down the upper or delivery valve plate and the lower or foot valve plate should have similar foot a large part of the strain will thus be transfer from the plate to the door which can easily be make strong enough to sustain it it be advisable that the plate should lie at a angle so that the shock of the water may not come upon the whole surface at once 462 _ q _ -- do the double acting air pump usual in direct act screw engine produce as good a vacuum as the single act air pump usual in paddle engine _ a _ -- it will do so if properly construct but i do not know of any case of a double acting air pump with indium rubber valve which have be properly construct 463 _ q _ -- what be the fault of such pump _ a _ -- the pump frequently work by start as if at time it do not draw at all and then again on a sudden gorge itself with water so as to throw a great strain upon the work part the vacuum moreover be by no means so good as it should be and it be a universal vice of direct act screw engine that the vacuum be defective i have be at some pain to investigate the cause of this imperfection and in a sugar house engine fit with pump like those of a direct act screw engine to maintain a vacuum in the pan i find that a better vacuum be produce when the engine be go slowly than when it be go fast which be quite the reverse of what be to have be expect as the hot water which have to be remove by the condensation of the steam proceeding from the pan be a constant quantity in this engine too which be a high pressure one the irregularity of the engine consequent upon the fitful catch of the water by the pump be more conspicuous as the working of this vacuum pump be the only work that the engine have to perform 464 _ q _ -- and be you able to discover the cause of these irregularity _ a _ -- the main cause of they i find to be the largeness of the space leave between the valve plate in this class of pump and out of which there be nothing to press the air or water which may be lie there it consequently happen that if there be the slightest leakage of air into the pump this air be merely compress and not expel by the advance of the air pump piston it expand again to its former bulk on the return of the pump piston and prevent the water from enter until there be such a accumulation of pressure in the condenser as force the water into the pump when the air be expel by the water cause a good vacuum to be momentarily form in the pump when it gorge itself by take a sudden gulp of water so soon however as the pressure fall in the condenser and some more air leak into the pump the former imperfect action recur and be again redress in the same violent manner 465 _ q _ -- be this irregular action of the pump the cause of the imperfect vacuum _ a _ -- it be one cause sometimes one end of the pump will alone draw and the other end will be inoperative although it be equally open to the condenser and this will chiefly take place at the stuffing box end where a leakage of air be more likely to occur i find however that even when both end of the pump be act equally and there be no leakage of air at all the vacuum maintain by a double act horizontal pump with indium rubber valve be not so good as that maintain by a single act pump of the kind usual in old engine 466 _ q _ -- will you specify more precisely what be the result you obtain _ a _ -- when the vacuum pan be exhaust by the pump without any boil be carry on in the pan but only a little cold water be let into it and also into the pump to enable they to act in they best manner it be find that whereas with the old pump a vacuum of 114 on the sugar boiler 's gauge could be readily obtain equal to about 29-1\/2 inch of mercury the lowest that could possibly be get with the new horizontal pump be 122 degree of the sugar boiler 's gauge or 29 inch of mercury and to get that the engine must not go faster than 10 or 12 stroke per minute the proper speed of the engine be 75 stroke per minute but if allow to go at that speed the vacuum fall to 130 of the sugar maker 's gauge or 28-1\/2 inch of mercury when the steam be let into the worm of the pan so as to boil the water in it the vacuum be 134 at 75 revolution of the engine and go down to 132 at 40 revolution but rise again to 135 equal to about 28-1\/4 inch of mercury at 20 revolution 467 _ q _ -- to what do you attribute the circumstance of a better vacuum be get at low speed than at high speed _ a _ -- it be difficult to assign the precise reason but it appear to be a consequence of the largeness of the vacant space between the valve plate when the piston of the air pump be draw back the air contain in this large collection of water will cause it to boil up like soda water and when the piston of the pump be force forward this air instead of be expel will be again drive into the water there will consequently be a quantity of air in the pump which can not be get rid of at all and which will impair the vacuum as a matter of course 468 _ q _ -- what expedient do you adopt to improve the vacuum in the engine to which you have refer _ a _ -- i put block of wood on the air pump piston which at the end of its stroke project between the valve plate and force the water out i also introduce a cock of water at each end of the pump between the valve plate to insure the presence of water at each end of the pump to force the air out with these amelioration the pump work steadily and the vacuum obtain become as good as in the old pump i have previously introduce a injection cock into each end of the air pump in steam vessel from which i have obtain advantageous result and in all horizontal air pump i would recommend the piston and valve plate to be so construct that the whole of the water will be express by the piston i would also recommend a injection cock to be introduce at each end of the pump pump cock and pipe 469 _ q _ -- will you explain the arrangement of the feed pump _ a _ -- in steam vessel the feed pump plunger be generally of brass and the barrel of the pump be sometimes of brass but generally of cast iron there should be a considerable clearance between the bottom of the plunger and the bottom of the barrel as otherwise the bottom of the barrel may be knock out should coal dust or any other foreign substance gain admission as it probably would do if the injection water be draw at any time from the bilge of the vessel as be usually do if the vessel spring a leak the valve of the feed pump in marine engine be generally of the spindle kind and be most conveniently arrange in a chest which may be attach in any accessible position to the side of the hot well there be two nozzle upon this chest of which the lower one lead to the pump and the upper one to the boiler the pipe lead to the pump be a suction pipe when the plunger ascend and a force pipe when the plunger descend the plunger in ascend draw the water out of the hot well through the lowest of the valve and in descend force it through the center valve into the space above it which communicate with the feed pipe should the feed cock be shut so as to prevent any feed water from pass through it the water will raise the topmost valve which be load to a pressure considerably above the pressure of the steam and escape into the hot well this arrangement be neater and less expensive than that of have a separate loaded valve on the feed pipe with a overflow through the ship 's side as be the more usual practice 470 _ q _ -- will you describe what precaution be to be observe in the construction of the cock use in engine _ a _ -- all the cock about a engine should be provide with bottom and stuff box and reliance should never be place upon a single bolt pass through a bottom washer for keep the plug in its place in the case of any cock communicate with the boiler for a great strain be throw upon that bolt if the pressure of the steam be high and if the plug be make with much taper and should the bolt break or the thread strip the plug will fly out and person stand near may be scald to death in large cock it appear the preferable plan to cast the bottom in and the metal of which all the cock about a marine engine be make should be of the same quality as that use in the composition of the brass and should be without lead or other deteriorate material in some case the bottom of cock be burn in with hard solder but this method can not be depend upon as the solder be soften and waste away by the hot salt water and in time the bottom leak or be force out the stuffing box of cock should be make of adequate depth and the gland should be secure by means of four strong copper bolt the taper of blow-off cock be a important element in they construction as if the taper be too great the plug will have a continual tendency to rise which if the packing be slack will enable grit to get between the face while if the taper be too little the plug will be liable to jam and a few time grind will sink it so far through the shell that the waterway will no longer correspond one eighth of a inch deviation from the perpendicular for every inch in height be a common angle for the side of the cock which correspond with one quarter of a inch difference of diameter in a inch of height but perhaps a somewhat greater taper than this or one third of a inch difference in diameter for every inch of height be a preferable proportion the bottom of the plug must be always keep a small distance above the bottom of the shell and a adequate surface must be leave above and below the waterway to prevent leakage cock form accord to these direction will be find to operate satisfactorily in practice while they will occasion perpetual trouble if there be any malformation 471 _ q _ -- what be the best arrangement and configuration of the blow-off cock _ a _ -- the blow-off cock of a boiler be generally place some distance from the boiler but it appear preferable that they should be place quite close to it as there be no means of shut off the water from the pipe between the blow-off cock and the boiler should fracture or leakage there arise every boiler must be furnish with a blow-off cock of its own independently of the main blow-off cock on the ship 's side so that the boiler may be blow off separately and may be shut off from one another the preferable arrangement appear to be to cast upon each blow-off cock a bend for attach the cock to the bottom of the boiler and the plug should stand about a inch in advance of the front of the boiler so that it may be remove or re-ground with facility the general arrangement of the blow-off pipe be to run a main blow-off pipe beneath the floor plate across the ship at the end of the engine and into this pipe to lead a separate pipe furnish with a cock from each boiler the main blow-off pipe where it penetrate the ship 's side be furnish with a cock : and in modern steam vessel kingston 's valve be also use which consist of a spindle or plate valve fit to the exterior of the ship so that if the internal pipe or cock break the external valve will still be operative some expedient of this kind be almost necessary as the blow-off cock require occasional regrinding and the sea cock can not be re-ground without put the vessel into dock except by the use of kingston 's valve or some equivalent expedient 472 q -- what be the proper construction and situation of the injection cock and waste water valve a -- the sea injection cock be usually make in the same fashion as the sea blow-off cock and of about the same size or rather larger the injection water be generally admit to the condenser by means of a slide valve but a cock appear to be preferable as it be more easily open and have not any disposition to shut of its own accord in paddle vessel the sea injection pipe should be put through the ship 's side in advance of the paddle so that the water draw in may not be injuriously charge with air the waste water pipe pass from the hot well through the vessel 's side be provide with a stop valve call the discharge valve which be usually make of the spindle kind so as to open when the water come from the air pump press against it in some case this valve be a sluice valve but the hot well be then almost sure to be split if the engine be set on without the valve have be open the opening of the waste water pipe should always be above the load water line as it will otherwise be difficult to prevent leakage through the engine into the ship when the vessel be lie in harbor 473 q -- what be the best arrangement of gauge cock and glass gauge a -- gauge cock be generally very inartificially make and occasion needless annoyance they be rarely make with bottom or with stuff box and be consequently for the most part adorn with stalactite of salt after a short period of service the water discharge from they too from the want of a proper conduit disfigure the front of the boiler and add to the corrosion in the ash pit it would be preferable to combine the gauge cock appertain to each boiler into a single upright tube connect suitably with the boiler and the water flow from they could be direct downward into a funnel tube communicate with the bilge the cock of the glass tube as well as of the gauge cock should be furnish with stuff box and with bottom unless the water enter through the bottom of the plug which in gauge cock be sometimes the case the glass gauge tube should always be fit with a cock at each neck communicate with the boiler so that the water and steam may be shut off if the tube break and the cock should be so make as to admit of the tube be blow through with steam to clear they as in muddy water they will become so soil that the water can not be see the gauge cock frequently have pipe run up within the boiler to the end that a high water level may be make consistent with a easily accessible position of the gauge cock themselves with the glass tube however this species of arrangement be not possible and the glass tube must always be place in the position of the water level 474 q -- what be the proper material of the pipe in steam vessel a -- most of the pipe of marine engine should be make of copper the steam pipe may be of cast iron if make very strong but the waste water pipe should be of copper cast iron blow-off pipe have in some case be employ but they be liable to fracture and be dangerous the blow-off and feed pipe should be of copper but the waste steam pipe may be of galvanized iron every pipe pass through the ship 's side and every pipe fix at both end and liable to be heat and cool should be furnish with a faucet or expansive joint and in the case of the cast iron pipe the part of the pipe fitting into the faucet should be turn in the distribution of the faucet of the pipe expose to pressure care must be take that they be so place that the part of the pipe can not be force asunder or turn round by the strain as serious accident have occur from the neglect of this precaution 475 _ q _ -- what be the best mode of make pipe tight where they penetrate the ship 's side _ a _ -- in wooden vessel the pipe where they pierce the ship 's side should be make tight as follow : -- the hole be cut a short piece of lead pipe with a broad flange at one end should be fit into it the place have be previously smear with white lead and the pipe should then be beat on the inside until it come into close contact all around with the wood a loose flange should next be slip over the project end of the lead pipe to which it should be solder and the flange should both be nail to the timber with scupper nail white lead have be previously spread underneath this method of procedure it be clear prevent the possibility of leakage down through the timber and all therefore that have to be guard against after this precaution be to prevent leakage into the ship to accomplish this object let the pipe which it be desire to attach be put through the leaden hause and let the space between the pipe and the lead be pack with gasket and white lead to which a little olive oil have be add the pipe must have a flange upon it to close the hole in the ship 's side the packing must then be drive in from the outside and be keep in by means of a gland secure with bolt pass through the ship 's side if the pipe be below the water line the gland must be of brass but for the waste water pipe a cast iron gland will answer this method of secure pipe penetrate the side however though the best for wooden vessel will it be clear fail to apply to iron one in the case of iron vessel it appear to be the best practice to attach a short iron nozzle project inward from the skin for the attachment of every pipe below the water line as the copper or brass would waste the iron of the skin if the attachment be make in the usual way detail of the screw and screw shaft 476 _ q _ -- what be the best method of fix the screw upon the shaft _ a _ -- the best way be to cut two large groove in the shaft come up to a square end and two corresponding groove or key seat in the screw boss opposite the arm fit into the groove on the shaft key with head the length of which be equal to half the depth of the boss and with the end of the key bear against the end of the groove in the shaft then ship on the propeller and drive other key of a equal length from the other side of the boss so that the point of the key will nearly meet in the middle next burr up the edge of the groove upon the head of the key to prevent they from work back and finally tap a bolt into the side of the boss to penetrate the shaft propeller so fit will never get slack 477 _ q _ -- what be the best way of fitting in the screw pipe at the stern _ a _ -- it should have project ring which should be turn and cast iron piece with hole in they bore out to the size of these ring should be secure to the stern frame and the pipe be then ship through all before this be do however the stern post must be bore out by a template to fit the pipe and the pipe be to be secure at the end to the stern post either by a great external nut of cast iron or by bolt pass through the stern post and through lug on the pipe the pipe should be bore throughout its entire length and the shaft should be turn so as to afford a very long bearing which will prevent rapid wear 478 _ q _ -- how be the hole form in the deadwood of the ship in which the screw work _ a _ -- a great frame of malleable iron the size of the hole be first set up and the plating of the ship be bring to the edge of this hole and be rivet through the frame it be important to secure this frame very firmly to the rest of the ship with which view it be advisable to form a great palm like the palm of a vice on its inner superior corner which project into the ship may be secure by breast-hook plate to the side whereby the strain which the screw cause will be distribute over the stern instead of be concentrate on the rivet of the frame 479 _ q _ -- be there several length of screw shaft _ a _ -- there be 480 _ q _ -- how then be these secure to one another _ a _ -- the best mode of secure the several length of shaft together be by forge the shaft with flange at the end which be connect together by bolt say six strong bolt in each accurately fit to the hole -lrb- illustration : fig 44 end of the screw shaft of correo show the mode of receive the thrust a disc b tighten wedge -rrb- 481 _ q _ -- how be the thrust of the shaft usually receive _ a _ -- in some case it be receive on a number of metal disc set in a box contain oil and should one of these disc stick fast from friction the other will be free to revolve this arrangement which be represent in fig 44 be use pretty extensively and answer the purpose perfectly it be of course necessary that the box in which the disc a be set shall be strong enough to withstand the thrust which the screw occasion another arrangement still more generally use be that represent in fig 55 and 56 p 331 it be a good practice to make the thrust plummer block with a very long sole in the direction of the shaft so as to obviate any risk of canting or spring forward when the strain be apply as such a circumstance if occur even to a slight extent would be very likely to cause the bearing to heat 482 _ q _ -- be there not arrangement exist in some vessel for enable the screw to be lift out of the water while the vessel be at sea _ a _ -- there be but such arrangement be not usual in merchant vessel in one form of apparatus the screw be set on a short shaft in the middle of a slide frame which can be raise or lower in groove like a window and the screw shaft within the ship can be protrude or withdraw by appropriate mechanism so as to engage or leave free this short shaft as may be require when the screw have to be lift the screw shaft be draw into the vessel leave the short shaft free to be raise up by the slide frame and the frame be raise by long screw turn round by a winch purchase on deck a chain or rope however be better for the purpose of raise this frame than long screw but the frame should in such case be provide with pall catch like those of a windlass which if the rope should break will prevent the screw from fall detail of the paddle and paddle shaft 483 _ q _ -- what be the most important detail of the construction of paddle wheel _ a _ -- the structure of the feather wheel will be hereafter describe in connection with a account of the oscillate engine and it will be expedient now to restrict any account of the detail to the common radial paddle as apply to ocean steamer the best plan of make the paddle centre be with square eye and each center should be secure in its place by means of eight thick key the shaft should be burr up against the head of these key with a chisel so as to prevent the key from come back of they own accord if the key be want to be drive back this burr must be cut off and if make thick and of the right taper they may then be start without difficulty the shaft must of course be forge with square projection on it so as to be suitable for the application of centre with square eye messr maudslay & co bear out they paddle centre and turn a seat for they on the shaft afterward fix they on the shaft with a single key this plan be objectionable for the two reason that it be insecure when new and when old be irremovable the general practice among the london engineer be to fix the paddle arm at the center to a plate by means of bolt a projection be place upon the plate on each side of the arm to prevent lateral motion but this method be inferior in durability to that adopt in the clyde in which each arm be fit into a socket by means of a cutter -- a small hole be leave opposite to the end of each arm whereby the arm may be force back by a drift 484 _ q _ -- how be the arm attach to the outside ring _ a _ -- some engineer join the paddle arm to the outer ring by means of bolt but unless very carefully fit those bolt after a time become slack sideways and a constant working of the part of the wheel go on in consequence sometimes the part of the other ring opposite the arm be form into a mortise and the arm be wedge tight in these hole by wedge drive in on each side but the plan be a expensive one and not satisfactory as the wedge work loose even though rivet over at the point the best mode of make a secure attachment of the arm to the ring consist in make the arm with long t head and riveting the cross piece to the outer ring with a number of rivet not of the largest size which would weaken the outer ring too much the best way of secure the inner ring to the arm be by means of lug weld on the arm and to which the ring be rivet 485 _ q _ -- what be the scantling of the paddle float _ a _ -- the paddle float be usually make either of elm or pine if of the former the common thickness for large sea-going vessel be about 2-1\/2 inch if of the latter 3 inch the float should have plate on both side else the paddle arm will be very liable to cut into the wood and the iron of the arm will be very rapidly waste when the float have be fresh put on they must be screw up several time before they come to a bearing if this be not do the bolt will be sure to get slack at sea and all the float on the weather side may be wash off the bolt for hold on the paddle float be make extra strong on account of the corrosion to which they be subject and the nut should be make large and should be square so that they may be effectually tighten up even though they corner be worn away by corrosion it be a good plan to give the thread of the paddle bolt a nick with a chisel after the nut have be screw up which will prevent the nut from turn back paddle float when consist of more than one board should be bolt together edgeway by means of bolt run through they whole breadth the float should not be notch to allow of they projection beyond the outer ring as if the side of the notch be in contact with the outer ring the ring be soon eat away in that part and the project part of the float be unsupported be liable to be break off 486 _ q _ -- do not the wheel jolt sideways when the vessel roll _ a _ -- it be usual to put a steel plate at each end of the paddle shaft tighten with a key to prevent end play when the vessel roll but the arrangement be precarious and insufficient messr maudslay make they paddle shaft bearing with very large fillet in the corner with the view of diminish the evil but it would be preferable to make the bearing of the crank shaft spheroidal and indeed it would probably be a improvement if most of the bearing about the engine be to be make in the same fashion the loose end of the crank pin should be make not spheroidal but consist of a portion of a sphere and a brass bush might then be fit into the crank eye that would completely encase the ball of the pin and yet permit the outer end of the paddle shaft to fall without strain the pin the bush be at the same time susceptible of a slight end motion the paddle shaft where it pass through the vessel 's side be usually surround by a lead stuffing box which will yield if the end of the shaft fall this stuffing box prevent leakage into the ship from the paddle wheel : but it be expedient as a further precaution to have a small tank on the ship 's side immediately beneath the stuffing box with a pipe lead down to the bilge to catch and conduct away any water that may enter around the shaft 487 _ q _ -- how be the outer bearing of the paddle wheel supply with tallow _ a _ -- the bearing at the outer end of the paddle shaft be sometimes supply with tallow force into a hole in the plummer block cover as in the case of water wheel but for vessel intend to perform long voyage it be preferable to have a pipe lead down to the oil cup above the journal from the top of the paddle box through which pipe oil may at any time be supply 488 _ q _ -- will you explain the method of put engine into a steam vessel _ a _ -- as a illustration of this operation it may be advisable to take the case of a side lever engine and the method of proceeding be as follow : -- first measure across from the inside of paddle bearer to the center of the ship to make sure that the central line run in a fore and aft direction on the deck or beam usually draw by the carpenter be really in the center stretch a line across between the paddle bearer in the direction of the shaft to this line in the center of the ship where the fore and aft mark have be make apply a square with arm six or eight foot long and bring a line stretch perpendicularly from the deck to the keelson accurately to the edge of the square : the lower point of the line where it touch the keelson will be immediately beneath the mark make upon the deck if this point do not come in the center of the keelson it will be better to shift it a little so as to bring it to the center alter the mark upon the deck correspondingly provide either paddle shaft will admit of this be do -- one of the paddle bracket be pack behind with wood to give it a additional projection from the side of the paddle bearer continue the line fore and aft upon the keelson as nearly as can be judge in the center of the ship stretch another line fore and aft through the mark upon the deck and look it out of wind with the line upon the keelson fix upon any two point equally distant from the center in the line stretch transversely in the direction of the shaft and from those point as centre and with any convenient radius sweep across the fore and aft line to see that the two be at right angle and if not shift the transverse line a little to make they so from the transverse line next let fall a line upon each outside keelson bring the edge of the square to the line the other edge rest on the keelson a point will thus be get on each outside keelson perpendicularly beneath the transverse line run in the direction of the shaft and a line draw between those two point will be directly below the shaft to this line the line of the shaft mark on the sole plate have to be bring care be take at the same time that the right distance be preserve between the fore and aft line upon the sole plate and the fore and aft line upon the central keelson 489 _ q _ -- of course the keelson have first to be properly prepare _ a _ -- in a wooden vessel before any part of the machinery be put in the keelson should be dub fair and straight and be look out of wind by means of two straight edge the art of place engine in a ship be more a piece of plain common sense than any other feat in engineering and every man of intelligence may easily settle a method of procedure for himself plumb line and spirit level it be obvious can not be employ on board a vessel and the problem consist in so place the sole plate without these aid that the paddle shaft will not stand awry across the vessel nor be carry forward beyond its place by the frame shoulder up more than be expect as a plumb line can not be use recourse must be have to a square and it will signify nothing at what angle with the deck the keelson run so long as the line of the shaft across the keelson be square down from the shaft center the sole plate be fix there be no difficulty in set the other part of the engine in they proper place upon they the paddle wheel must be hang from the top of the paddle box to enable the shaft to be rove through they and the cross stay between the engine should be fix in when the vessel be afloat to try whether the shaft be in a line turn the paddle wheel and try if the distance between the crank be the same at the upper and under and the two horizontal centre if not move the end of the paddle shaft up or down backward or forward until the distance between the crank at all the four centre be the same 490 _ q _ -- in what manner be the engine of a steam vessel secure to the hull _ a _ -- the engine of a steamer be secure to the hull by means of bolt call hold down bolt and in wooden vessel a good deal of trouble be cause by these bolt which be generally make of iron sometimes they go through the bottom of the ship and at other time they merely go through the keelson -- a recess be make in the floor or timber to admit of the introduction of a nut the iron however wear rapidly away in both case even though the bolt be tin and it have be find the preferable method to make such of the bolt as pass through the bottom or enter the bilge of muntz 's metal or of copper in a side lever engine four muntz 's metal bolt may be put through the bottom at the crank end of the framing of each engine four more at the main center and four more at the cylinder make twelve through bolt to each engine and it be more convenient to make these bolt with a nut at each end as in that case the bolt may be drop down from the inside and the necessity be obviate of put the vessel on very high block in the dock in order to give room to put the bolt up from the bottom the remainder of the hold down bolt may be of iron and may by means of a square neck be screw into the timber of the keelson as wood screw -- the upper part be furnish with a nut which may be screw down upon the sole plate so soon as the wood screw portion be in its place if the cylinder be a fix one it should be bolt down to the sole plate by as many bolt as be employ to attach the cylinder cover and they should be of copper or brass in any situation that be not easily accessible 491 _ q _ -- if the engine become loose how do you refix they _ a _ -- it be difficult to fix engine effectually which have once begin to work in the ship for in time the surface of the keelson on which the engine bear become worn uneven and the engine necessarily rock upon it as a general rule the bolt attach the engine to the keelson be too few and of too large a diameter : it would be preferable to have smaller bolt and a greater number of they in addition to the bolt go through the keelson or the vessel 's bottom there should be a large number of wood screw secure the sole plate to the keelson and a large number of bolt secure the various part of the engine to the sole plate in iron vessel hold down bolt pass through the bottom be not expedient and there the engine have merely to be secure to the iron plate of the keelson which be make hollow to admit of a more effectual attachment 492 _ q _ -- what be the proper proportion of bolt _ a _ -- in well form bolt the spiral groove penetrate about one twelfth of the diameter of the cylinder round which it wind so that the diameter of the solid cylinder which remain be five sixth of the diameter over the thread if the strain to which iron may be safely subject in machinery be one fifteenth of its utmost strength or 4000 lb on the square inch then 2180 lb may be sustain by a screw a inch in diameter at the outside of the thread the strength of the hold down bolt may easily be compute when the elevate force of the piston or main center be know but it be expedient very much to exceed this strength in practice on account of the elasticity of the keelson the liability to corrosion and other cause the locomotive engine 493 _ q _ -- what be the amount of tractive force requisite to draw carriage on railway _ a _ -- upon well form railway with carriage of good construction the average tractive force require for low speed be about 7-1\/2 lb per ton or 1\/300th of the load though in some experimental case where particular care be take to obtain a favorable result the tractive force have be reduce as low as 1\/500th of the load at low speed the whole of the tractive force be expend in overcome the friction which be make up partly of the friction of attrition in the axle and partly of the roll friction or the obstruction to the rolling of the wheel upon the rail the roll friction be very small when the surface be smooth and in the case of railway carriage do not exceed 1\/1000th of the load whereas the draught on common road of good construction which be chiefly make up of the roll friction be as much as 1\/36th of the load 494_q _ -- in reference to friction you have already state that the friction of iron slide upon brass which have be oil and then wipe dry so that no film of oil be interpose be about 1\/11th of the pressure but that in machine in actual operation where there be a film of oil between the rub surface the friction be only about one third of this amount or 1\/33d of the weight how then can the tractive resistance of locomotive at low speed which you say be entirely make up of friction be so little as 1\/500th of the weight _ a _ -- i do not state that the resistance to traction be 1\/500th of the weight upon a average -- to which condition the answer give to a previous question must be understand to apply -- but i state that the average traction be about 1\/300th of the load which nearly agree with my former statement if the total friction be 1\/300th of the load and the roll friction be 1\/1000th of the load then the friction of attrition must be 1\/429th of the load and if the diameter of the wheel be 36 in and the diameter of the axle be 3 in which be common proportion the friction of attrition must be increase in the proportion of 36 to 3 or 12 time to represent the friction of the rub surface when move with the velocity of the carriage 12\/429ths be about 1\/35th of the load which do not differ much from the proportion of 1\/33d as previously determine 495 _ q _ -- what be the amount of adhesion of the wheel upon the rail _ a _ -- the adhesion of the wheel upon the rail be about 1\/5th of the weight when the rail be clean or either perfectly wet or perfectly dry but when the rail be half wet or greasy the adhesion be not more than 1\/10th or 1\/12th of the weight or pressure upon the wheel the weight of a locomotive of modern construction vary from 20 to 25 ton 496 _ q _ -- and what be its cost and average performance _ a _ -- the cost of a common narrow gauge locomotive of average power vary from # 1900 to # 2200 it will run on a average 130 mile per day at a cost for repair of 2-1\/2 d per mile and the cost of locomotive power include repair wages oil and coke do not much exceed 6d per mile run on economically manage railway this do not include a sink fund for the renewal of the engine when wear out which may be take as equivalent to 10 per cent on they original cost 497 _ q _ -- do the expense of traction increase much with a increase speed _ a _ -- yes it increase very rapidly partly from the undulation of the earth when a heavy train pass over it at a high velocity but chiefly from the resistance of the atmosphere and blast pipe which constitute the greatest of the impediment to motion at high speed at a speed of 30 mile a hour the atmospheric resistance have be find in some case to amount to about 12 lb a ton and in side wind the resistance even exceed this amount partly in consequence of the additional friction cause from the flange of the wheel be force against the rail and partly because the wind catch to a certain extent the front of every carriage whereby the efficient breadth of each carriage in give motion to the air in the direction of the train be very much increase at a speed of 30 mile a hour a engine evaporate 200 cubic foot of water in the hour and therefore exert about 200 horse power will draw a load of 110 ton take the friction of the train at 7-1\/2 lb per ton or 825 lb operate at the circumference of the drive wheel -- which with 5 ft 6 in wheel and 18 in stroke be equivalent to 4757 lb upon the piston -- and take the resistance of the blast pipe at 6 lb per square inch of the piston and the friction of the engine unloaded at 1 lb per square inch which with piston 12 in in diameter amount together to 1582 lb and reckon the increase friction of the engine due to the load at 1\/7th of the load as in some case it have be find experimentally to be though a much less proportion than this would probably be a nearer average we have 70184 lb for the total load upon the piston at 30 mile a hour the speed of the piston will be 4578 foot per minute and 70184 lb multiply by 4578 ft per minute be equal to 32130235 lb raise one foot high in the minute which divide by 33000 give 973 horse power as the power which would draw 110 ton upon a railway at a speed of 30 mile a hour if there be no atmospheric resistance the atmospheric resistance be at the rate of 12 lb a ton with a load of 110 ton equal to 1320 lb move at a speed of 30 mile a hour which when reduce become 1058 horse power and this add to 973 make 2031 instead of 200 horse power as ascertain by a reference to the evaporative power of the boiler this amount of atmospheric resistance however exceed the average and in some of the experiment for ascertain the atmospheric resistance a part of the resistance due to the curve and irregularity of the line have be count as part of the atmospheric resistance 498 _ q _ -- be the resistance per ton of the engine the same as the resistance per ton of the train _ a _ -- no it be more since the engine have not merely the resistance of the atmosphere and of the wheel to encounter but the resistance of the machinery besides accord to mr gooch 's experiment upon a train weigh 100 ton the resistance of the engine and tender at 131 mile per hour be find by the indicator to be 1238 lb the resistance per ton of the train as ascertain by the dynamometer be at the same speed 758 lb and the average resistance of locomotive and train be 904 lb at 202 mile per hour these resistance respectively become 190 819 and 122 lb at 441 mile per hour the resistance become 340 2110 and 255 lb and at 574 mile a hour they become 355 1781 and 238 lb 499 _ q _ -- be it not maintain that the resistance of the atmosphere to the progress of railway train increase as the square of the velocity _ a _ -- the atmospheric resistance no doubt increase as the square of the velocity and the power therefore necessary to overcome it will increase as the cube of the velocity since in double the speed four time the power must be expend in overcome the atmospheric resistance in half the time at low speed the resistance do not increase very rapidly but at high speed as the rapid increase in the atmospheric resistance cause the main resistance to be that arise from the atmosphere the total resistance will vary nearly as the square of the velocity thus the resistance of a train include locomotive and tender will at 15 mile a hour be about 93 lb per ton at 30 mile a hour it will be 132 lb per ton and at 60 mile a hour 29 lb per ton if we suppose the same law of progression to continue up to 120 mile a hour the resistance at that speed will be 922 lb per ton and at 240 mile a hour the resistance will be 3448 lb per ton thus in double the speed from 60 to 120 mile per hour the resistance do not fall much short of be increase fourfold and the same remark apply to the increase of the speed from 120 to 240 mile a hour these deduction and other deduction from mr gooch 's experiment on the resistance of railway train be fully discuss by mr clark in he treatise on railway machinery who give the follow rule for ascertain the resistance of a train suppose the line to be in good order and free from curve : -- to find the total resistance of the engine tender and train in pound per ton at any give speed square the speed in mile per hour divide it by 171 and add 8 to the quotient the result be the total resistance at the rail in lb per ton 500_q _ -- how come it that the resistance of fluid increase as the square of the velocity instead of the velocity simply _ a _ -- because the height necessary to generate the velocity with which the move object strike the fluid or the fluid strike the object increase as the _ square _ of the velocity and the resistance or the weight of a column of any fluid vary as the height a fall body as have be already explain to have acquire twice the velocity must have fall through four time the height the velocity generate by a column of any fluid be equal to that acquire by a body fall through the height of the column and it be therefore clear that the pressure due to any give velocity must be as the square of that velocity the pressure be in every case as twice the altitude of the column the work do however by a stream of air or other fluid in a give time will vary as the cube of the velocity for if the velocity of a stream of air be double there will not only be four time the pressure exert per square foot but twice the quantity of air will be employ and in windmill accordingly it be find that the work do vary nearly as the cube of the velocity of the wind if however the work do by _ a give quantity _ of air move at different speed be consider it will vary as the square of the speed 501 _ q _ -- but in a case where there be no work do and the resistance vary as the square of the speed should not the power requisite to overcome that resistance vary as the square of the speed _ a _ -- it should if you consider the resistance over a give distance and not the resistance during a give time suppose the resistance of a railway train to increase as the square of the speed it would take four time the power so far as atmospheric resistance be concern to accomplish a mile at the rate of 60 mile a hour that it would take to accomplish a mile at 30 mile a hour but in the former case there would be twice the number of mile accomplish in the same time so that when the velocity of the train be double we should require a engine that be capable of overcome four time the resistance at twice the speed or in other word that be capable of exert eight time the power so far as regard the element of atmospheric resistance we know by experience however that it be easier to attain high speed on railway than in steam vessel where the resistance do increase nearly as the square of the speed 502 _ q _ -- will you describe generally the arrangement of a locomotive engine _ a _ -- the boiler and engine be hang upon a framework set on wheel and together with this frame or carriage constitute what be commonly call the locomotive behind the locomotive run another carriage call the tender for hold coke and water a common mode of connect the engine and tender be by means of a rigid bar with a eye at each end through which pin be pass between the engine and tender however buffer should always be interpose as they pressure contribute greatly to prevent oscillation and other irregular motion of the engine 503 _ q _ -- how be the framing of a locomotive usually construct _ a _ -- all locomotive be now make with the framing which support the machinery situate within the wheel but for some year a vehement controversy be maintain respect the relative merit of outside and inside framing which have terminate however in the universal adoption of the inside frame it be difficult in engine intend for the narrow gauge to get cylinder within the framing of sufficient diameter to meet the exigency of railway locomotion by cast both cylinder in a piece however a considerable amount of room may be make available to increase they diameter it be very desirable that the cylinder of locomotive should be as large as possible so that expansion may be adopt to a large extent and with any give speed of piston the power of a engine either to draw heavy load or achieve high velocity will be increase with every increase of the dimension of the cylinder the framing of locomotive to which the boiler and machinery be attach and which rest upon the spring situate above the axle be form generally of malleable iron but in some engine the side frame consist of oak with iron plate rivet on each side the guard plate be in these case generally of equal length the frame be curved upward to pass over the drive axle hard cast iron block be rivet between the guard plate to serve as guide for the axle bush the side frame be connect across the end and cross stay be introduce beneath the boiler to stiffen the frame sideways and prevent the end of the connect or eccentric rod from fall down if they should be break 504 _ q _ -- what be the nature and arrangement of the spring of locomotive _ a _ -- the spring be of the ordinary carriage kind with plate connect at the center and allow to slide on each other at they end the upper plate terminate in two eye through each of which pass a pin which also pass through the jaw of the bridle connect by a double threaded screw to another bridle which be joint to the frame the center of the spring rest upon the axle box sometimes the spring be place between the guard plate and below the framing which rest upon they extremity one species of spring which have gain a considerable introduction consist of a number of flat steel plate with a piece of metal or other substance interpose between they at the center leave the end stand apart it would be preferable perhaps to make the plate of a common spring with different curve so that the leaf though in contact at the center would not be in contact with the end with light load but would be bring into contact gradually as the strain cony on : a spring would thus be obtain that be suitable for all load 505 _ q _ -- what be the difference between inside and outside cylinder engine _ a _ -- outside cylinder be so designate when place upon the outside of the frame with they connect rod operate upon pin in the drive wheel while the inside cylinder be situate within the framing and the connect rod attach themselves to crank in the drive axle 506 _ q _ -- whether be inside or outside cylinder engine to be prefer _ a _ -- a diversity of opinion obtain as to the relative merit of outside and inside cylinder the chief objection to outside cylinder be that they occasion a sinuous motion in the engine which be apt to send the train off the rail but this action may be make less perceptible or be remedy altogether by place a weight upon one side of the wheel the momentum of which will just balance the momentum of the piston and its connection the sinuous or rock motion of locomotive be traceable to the arrest momentum of the piston and its attachment at every stroke of the engine and the effect of the pressure thus create will be more operative in induce oscillation the farther it be exert from the central line of the engine if both cylinder be set at right angle in the center of the carriage and the piston be both attach to a central crank there would be no oscillation produce or the same effect would be realize by place one cylinder in the center of the carriage and two at the side -- the piston of the side cylinder move simultaneously : but it be impossible to couple the piston of a upright cylinder direct to the axle of a locomotive without cause the spring to work up and down with every stroke of the engine : and the use of three cylinder though adopt in some of stephenson 's engine involve too much complication to be a beneficial innovation 507 _ q _ -- whether be four-wheeled or six-wheeled engine preferable _ a _ -- much controversial ingenuity have be expend upon the question of the relative merit of the four and six-wheeled engine one party maintain that four-wheeled engine be most unsafe and the other that six-wheeled engine be unmechanical and be more likely to occasion accident the four-wheeled engine however appear to have be charge with fault that do not really attach to they when properly construct for it by no means follow that if the axle of a four-wheeled engine break or even altogether come away that the engine must fall down or run off the line inasmuch as if the engine be properly couple with the tender it have the tender to sustain it it be obvious enough that such a connection may be make between the tender and the engine that either the fore or hind axle of the engine may be take away and yet the engine will not fall down but will be keep up by the support which the tender afford and the argument hitherto parade against the four-wheeled engine be so far as regard the question of safety nothing more than argument against the existence of the suggest connection it be no doubt the fact that locomotive engine be now become too heavy to be capable of be bear on four wheel at high speed without injury to the rail but the objection of damage to the rail apply with at least equal force to most of the six-wheeled engine hitherto construct as in those engine the engineer have the power of put nearly all the weight upon the drive wheel and if the rail be wet or greasy there be a great temptation to increase the bite of those wheel by screw they down more firmly upon the rail a greater strain be thus throw upon the rail than can exist in the case of any equally heavy four-wheeled engine and the engine be make very unsafe as a pitch motion will inevitably be induce at high speed when a engine be thus poise upon the central drive wheel and there will also be more of the rock or sinuous motion locomotive however intend to achieve high speed or to draw heavy load be now generally make with eight wheel and in some case the driving wheel be place at the end of the engine instead of in the middle 508 _ q _ -- as the question of the locomotive boiler have be already dispose of in discuss the question of boiler in general it now only remain to inquire into the subject of the engine and we may commence with the cylinder will you state the arrangement and construction of the cylinder of a locomotive and they connection _ a _ -- the cylinder be place in the same horizontal plane as the axle of the drive wheel and the connect rod which be attach to the piston rod engage either a crank in the drive axle or a pin in the drive wheel accord as the cylinder be inside or outside of the framework the cylinder be generally make a inch longer than the stroke or there be half a inch of clearance at each end of the cylinder to permit the spring of the vehicle to act without cause the piston to strike the top or bottom of the cylinder the thickness of metal of the cylinder end be usually about a third more than the thickness of the cylinder itself and both end be generally make removable the priming of the boiler when it occur be very injurious to the cylinder and valve of locomotive especially if the water be sandy as the grit carry over by the steam wear the rub surface rapidly away the face of the cylinder on which the valve work be raise a little above the metal around it both to facilitate the operation of form the face and with the view of enable any foreign substance deposit on the face to be push aside by the valve into the less elevated part where it may lie without occasion any further disturbance the valve casing be sometimes cast upon the cylinder and it be generally cover with a door which may be remove to permit the inspection of the face in some valve casing the top as well as the back be removable which admit of the valve and valve bridle be remove with greater facility a cock be place at each end of locomotive cylinder to allow the water to be discharge which accumulate in the cylinder from priming or condensation and the four cock of the two cylinder be usually connect together so that by turn a handle the whole be open at once in stephenson 's engine however with variable expansion there be but one cock provide for this purpose which be on the bottom of the valve chest 509 _ q _ -- what kind of piston be use in locomotive _ a _ -- the variety of piston employ in locomotive be very great and sometimes even the more complicated kind be find to work very satisfactorily but in general those piston which consist of a single ring and tongue piece or of two single ring set one above the other so as to break joint be preferable to those which consist of many piece in stephenson 's piston the screw be at one time liable to work slack and the spring to break 510 _ q _ -- will you explain the connection of the piston rod with the connect rod _ a _ -- the piston rod of all engine be now generally either case harden very deeply or be make of steel and in locomotive engine the diameter of the piston rod be about one seventh of the diameter of the cylinder and it be form of tilted steel the cone of the piston rod by which it be attach to the piston be turn the reverse way to that which be adopt in common engine with the view of make the cutter more accessible from the bottom of the cylinder which be make to come off like a door the top of the piston rod be secure with a cutter into a socket with jaw through the hole of which a cross head pass which be embrace between the jaw by the small end of the connect rod while the end of the cross head move in guide between the piston rod clutch and the guide block the feed pump rod join the cross head in some engine 511 _ q _ -- what kind of guide be employ for the end of the piston rod _ a _ -- the guide be form of steel plate attach to the framing between which work the guide block fix on the end of the cross head which have flange bear against the inner edge of the guide steel or brass guide be better than iron one : stephenson and hawthorn attach they guide at one end to a cross stay at the other to lug on the cylinder cover and they be make stronger in the middle than at the end stout guide rod of steel encircle by stuff box on the end of the cross head would probably be find superior to any other arrangement the stuff box might contain conical bush cut spirally in addition to the packing and a ring cut spirally might be spring upon the rod and fix in advance of the stuffing box with lateral play to wipe the rod before enter the stuffing box to prevent it from be scratch by the adhesion of dust 512 _ q _ -- be any provision make for keep the connect rod always of the same length _ a _ -- in every kind of locomotive it be very desirable that the length of the connect rod should remain invariable in spite of the wear of the brass for there be a danger of the piston striking against the cover of the cylinder if it be shorten as the clearance be leave as small as possible in order to economize steam in some engine the strap encircle the crank pin be fix immovably to the connect rod by dovetail key and a bolt pass through the key rod and strap to prevent the dovetail key from work out the brass be tighten by a gib and cutter which be keep from work loose by three pinch screw and a cross pin or cutter through the point the effect of this arrangement be to lengthen the rod but at the cross head end of the rod the elongation be neutralize by make the strap loose so that in tighten the brass the rod be shorten by a amount equal to its elongation at the crank pin end the tightening here be also effect by a gib and cutter which be keep from work loose by two pinch screw press on the side of the cutter both journal of the connect rod be furnish with oil cup have a small tube in the center with siphon wick the connect rod be a thick flat bar with its edge round 513 _ q _ -- how be the crank axle of locomotive construct _ a _ -- the crank axle of locomotive be always make of work iron with two crank forge upon it toward the middle of its length at a distance from each other answerable to the distance between the cylinder boss be make on the axle for the wheel to be key upon and bearing for the support of the frame the axle be usually forge in two piece which be afterward weld together sometimes the piece for the crank be put on separately but the crank so make be liable to give way in engine with outside cylinder the axle be make straight-the crank pin be insert in the nave of the wheel the bearing to which the connect rod be attach be make with very large fillet in the corner so as to strengthen the axle in that part and to obviate side play in the connect rod in engine which have be in use for some time however there be generally a good deal of end play in the bearing of the axle themselves and this slackness contribute to make the oscillation of the engine more violent but this evil may be remedy by make the bearing spheroidal whereby end play become impossible 514 _ q _ -- how be the bearing of the axle arrange _ a _ -- the axle bear only against the top of the axle box which be generally of brass but a plate extend underneath the bear to prevent sand from be throw upon it the upper part of the box in most engine have a reservoir of oil which be supply to the journal by tube with siphon wick stephenson use cast iron axle box with brass and grease instead of oil and the grease be feed upon the journal by the heat of the bearing melting it whereby it be make to flow down through a hole in the brass any engine construct with outside bearing have inside bearing also which be support by longitudinal bar which serve also in some case to support the piston guide these bearing be sometimes make so as not to touch the shaft unless they break 515 _ q _ -- how be the eccentric of a locomotive construct _ a _ -- in locomotive the body of the eccentric be of cast iron in inside cylinder engine the eccentric be set on the axle between the crank and they be put on in two piece hold together by bolt but in straight axle engine the eccentric be cast in a piece and be secure on the shaft by means of a key the eccentric when in two piece be retain at its proper angle on the shaft by a pinch screw which be provide with a jam nut to prevent it from work loose a piece be leave out of the eccentric in cast it to allow of the screw be insert and the void be afterward fill by insert a dovetail piece of metal stephenson and hawthorn leave hole in they eccentric on each side of the central arm and they apply pinch screw in each of these hole the method of fix the eccentric to the shaft by a pinch screw be scarcely sufficiently substantial and case be perpetually occur when this method of attachment be adopt of eccentric shift from they place in the modern engine the eccentric be forge on the axle 516 _ q _ -- how be the eccentric strap construct _ a _ -- the eccentric hoop be generally of work iron as brass hoop be find liable to break when form of malleable iron one half of the strap be forge with the rod the other half be secure to it by bolt nut and jam nut piece of brass be in some case pin within the malleable iron hoop but it appear to be preferable to put brass within the hoop to encircle the eccentric as in the case of any other bearing when the brass strap be use the lug have generally nut on both side so that the length of the eccentric rod may be adjust by they means to the proper length but it be better for the lug of the hoop to abut against the neck of the screw and if any adjustment be necessary from the wear of the strap washer can be interpose in some engine the adjustment be effect by screw the valve rod and the cross head through which it pass have a nut on either side of it by which its position upon the valve rod be determine 517 _ q _ -- will you describe the eccentric rod and valve lever _ a _ -- in the engine in use before the introduction of the link motion the fork of the eccentric rod be of steel and the length of the eccentric rod be the distance between the center of the crank axle and the center of the valve shaft but in modern engine the use of the link motion be universal the valve lever in locomotive be usually longer than the eccentric lever to increase the travel of the valve if lever be employ but it be better to connect the valve rod to the link of the link motion without the intervention of lever the pin of the eccentric lever in the old engine use to wear quickly stephenson use to put a ferule of brass on these pin which be loose and act like a roller facilitate the throwing in and out of gear and when wear could easily be replace so that there be no material derangement of the motion of the valve from play in this situation 518 _ q _ -- what be the arrangement of a start lever _ a _ -- the start lever travels between two iron segment and can be fix in any desire position this be do by a small catch or bell crank joint to the bottom of the handle at the end of the lever and come up by the side of the handle but press out from it by a spring the smaller arm of this bell crank be joint to a bolt which shoot into notch make in one of the segment between which the lever move by press the bell crank against the handle of the lever the bolt be withdraw and the lever may be shift to any other point when the spring be release the bolt fly into the nearest notch 519 _ q _ -- in what way do the start handle act on the machinery of the engine to set it in motion _ a _ -- its whole action lie in raise or depress the link of the link motion relatively with the valve rod if the valve rod be attach to the middle of the link the valve will derive no motion from it at all and the engine will stop if the attachment be slip to one end of the link the engine will go ahead and if slip to the other end it will go astern the start handle merely achieve this change of position 520 _ q _ -- will you explain the operation of set the valve of a locomotive _ a _ -- in set the valve of locomotive place the crank in the position answerable to the end of the stroke of the piston and draw a straight line represent the center line of the cylinder through the centre of the crank shaft and crank pin from the center of the shaft describe a circle with the diameter equal to the throw of the valve another circle to represent the crank shaft and a third circle to represent the path of the crank pin from the center of the crank shaft draw a line perpendicular to the center line of the cylinder and crank shaft and draw another perpendicular at a distance from the first equal to the amount of the lap and the lead of the valve : the point in which this line intersect the circle of the eccentric be the point in which the center of the eccentric should be place for the forward and reverse motion when the eccentric rod be attach directly to the valve the radius of the eccentric which precede the crank in its revolution form with the crank a obtuse angle but when by the intervention of lever the valve have a motion oppose to that of the eccentric rod the angle contain by the crank and the radius of the eccentric must be acute and the eccentric must follow the crank : in other word with a direct attachment to the valve the eccentric be set _ more _ than one fourth of a revolution in advance of the crank and with a indirect attachment the eccentric be set _ less _ than one fourth of a circle behind the crank if the valve be without lead or lap the eccentric would be exactly one fourth of a circle in advance of the crank or behind the crank accord to the nature of the valve connection but as the valve would thus cover the port by the amount of the lap and lead the eccentric must be set forward so as to open the port to the extent of the lap and lead and this be effect by the plan just describe 521 _ q _ -- in the event of the eccentric slip round upon the shaft which you state sometimes happen be it necessary to perform the operation of set the valve as you have just describe it _ a _ -- if the eccentric shift upon the shaft they may be easily refix by set the valve open the amount of the lead set the crank at the end of the stroke and bring round the eccentric upon the shaft till the eccentric rod gear with the valve it would often be troublesome in practice to get access to the valve for the purpose of set it and this may be dispense with if the amount of lap on the valve and the length of the eccentric rod be know to this end draw upon a board two straight line at right angle to one another and from they point of intersection as a center describe two circle one represent the circle of the eccentric the other the crank shaft draw a straight line parallel to one of the diameter and distant from it the amount of the lap and the lead : the point in which he parallel intersect the circle of the eccentric be the position of the forward and backward eccentric through these point draw straight line from the center of the circle and mark the intersection of these line with the circle of the crank shaft measure with a pair of compass the chord of the arc intercept between either of these point and the diameter which be at right angle with the crank and the diameter be first mark on the shaft itself then by transfer with the compass the distance find in the diagram and mark the point the eccentric may at any time be adjust without difficulty -lrb- illustration : fig 45 -rrb- 522 _ q _ -- will you describe the structure and arrangement of the feed pump of locomotive engine _ a _ -- the feed pump of locomotive be generally make of brass but the plunger be sometimes make of iron and be generally attach to the piston cross head though in stephenson 's engine they be work by rod attach to eye on the eccentric hoop there be a ball valve fig 45 between the pump and the tender and two usually in the pipe lead from the pump to the boiler besides a cock close to the boiler by which the pump may be shut off from the boiler in case of any accident to the valve the ball valve be guide by four branch which rise vertically and join together at the top in a hemispherical form the shock of the ball against this cap have in some case break it after one week 's work from the top of the cage have be flat and the branch not have have they junction at the top properly fillet these valve guard be attach in different way to the pipe when one occur at the junction of two piece of pipe it have a flange which along with the flange of the pipe and that of the valve seat be hold together by a union joint it be sometimes form with a thread at the under end and screw into the pipe the ball be cast hollow to lessen the shock as well as to save the metal in some case where the feed pump plunger have be attach to the cross head the piston rod have be bent by the strain and that must in all case occur if the communication between the pump and boiler be close when the engine be start and there be no escape valve for the water 523 _ q _ -- be none but ball valve use in the feed pump _ a _ -- spindle valve have in some case be use instead of ball valve but they be more subject to derangement but piston valve so contrived as to shut a portion of water in the cage when about to close might be adopt with a great diminution of the shock slide valve might be apply and would probably be find preferable to any of the expedient at present in use in all spindle valve open and shut rapidly it be advisable to have the lower surface conical to take off the shock of the water and a large lift of the valve should be prevent else much of the water during the return stroke of the pump will flow out before the valve shut 524 _ q _ -- at what part of the boiler be the feed water admit _ a _ -- the feed pipe of most locomotive engine enter the boiler near the bottom and about the middle of its length in stephenson 's engine the water be let in at the smoke box end of the boiler a little below the water level by this mean the heat be more fully extract from the escape smoke but the arrangement be of questionable applicability to engine of which the steam dome and steam pipe be at the smoke box end as in that case the enter cold water would condense the steam 525 _ q _ -- how be the pipe connect the tender and locomotive construct so as to allow of play between the engine and tender without leakage _ a _ -- the pipe connect the tender with the pump should allow access to the valve and free motion to the engine and tender this end be attain by the use of ball and socket joint and to allow some end play one piece of the pipe slide into the other like a telescope and be keep tight by means of a stuffing box any pipe joint between the engine and tender must be make in this fashion 526 _ q _ -- have you any suggestion to make respect the arrangement of the feed pump _ a _ -- it would be a material improvement if a feed pump be to be set in the tender and work by means of a small engine such as that now use in steam vessel for feed the boiler the present action of the feed pump of locomotive be precarious as if the valve leak in the slightest degree the steam or boiling water from the boiler will prevent the pump from draw it appear expedient therefore that at least one pump should be far from the boiler and should be set among the feed water so that it will only have to force if a pump be arrange in the manner suggest the boiler could still be feed regularly though the locomotive be stand still but it would be prudent to have the exist pump still work in the usual way by the engine in case of derangement of the other or in case the pump in the tender might freeze 527 _ q _ -- will you explain the construction of locomotive wheel _ a _ -- the wheel of a locomotive be always make of malleable iron the drive wheel be make larger to increase the speed the bearing wheel also be easier on the road when large in the goods engine the driving wheel be smaller than in the passenger engine and be generally couple together wheel be make with much variety in they constructive detail : sometimes they be make with cast iron nave with the spoke and rim of work iron but in the best modern wheel the nave be form of the end of the spoke weld together at the center when cast iron nave be adopt the spoke be forge out of flat bar with t-formed head and be arrange radially in the founder 's mould the cast iron when fluid be pour among they the end of the t head be then weld together to constitute the periphery of the wheel or inner tire and little wedge-form piece be insert where there be any deficiency of iron in some case the arm be hollow though of work iron the tire of work iron and the nave of cast iron and the spoke be turn where they be fit into the nave and be secure in they socket by means of cutter hawthorn make he wheel with cast iron nave and work iron rim and arm but instead of welding the arm together he make palm on they outer end which be attach by rivet to the rim these rivet however unless very carefully form be apt to work loose and it would probably be find a improvement if the palm be to be slightly indent into the rim in case in which the palm do not meet each other at the end when the rim be turn it be ready for the tire which be now make of steel 528 _ q _ -- how do you find the length of bar necessary for form a tire _ a _ -- to find the proper length of bar requisite for the formation of a hoop of any give diameter add the thickness of the bar to the require diameter and the corresponding circumference in the table of circumference of circle be the length of the bar if the iron be bent edgewise the breadth of the bar must be add to the diameter for it be the thickness of the bar measure radially that be to be take into consideration in the tire of railway wheel which have a flange on one edge it be necessary to add not only the thickness of the tire but also two third of the depth of the flange generally however the tire bar be send from the forge so curved that the plain edge of the tire be concave and the flange edge convex while the side which be afterward to be bent into contact with the cylindrical surface of the wheel be a plane in this case the addition of the diameter of two third of the depth of the flange be unnecessary for the curving of the flange edge have the effect of increase the real length of the bar when the tire be thus curve it be only necessary to add the thickness of the hoop to the diameter and then to find the circumference from a table or the same result will be obtain by multiply the diameter thus increase by the thickness of the hoop by 31416 529 _ q _ -- how be the tire attach to the wheel _ a _ -- the material for wheel tire be first swaged separately and then weld together under the heavy hammer at the steel work after which they be bent to the circle weld and turn to certain gauge the tire be now heat to redness in a circular furnace during the time it be get hot the iron wheel turn to the right diameter be bolt down upon a face plate or surface the tire expand with the heat and when at a cherry red it be drop over the wheel for which it be previously too small and it be also hastily bolt down to the surface plate the whole mass be then quickly immerse by a swing crane in a tank of water five foot deep and haul up and down till nearly cold the tire be not afterward temper the tire be attach to the rim with rivet have countersunk head and the wheel be then fix on its axle 530 _ q _ -- be it necessary to have the whole tire of steel _ a _ -- it be not indispensable that the whole tire should be of steel but a dovetail groove turn out of the tire at the place where it bear most on the rail and fit with a band of steel will suffice this band may be put in in piece and the expedient appear to be the best way of repair a worn tire but particular care must be take to attach these piece very securely to the tire by rivet else in the rapid revolution of the wheel the steel may be throw out by the centrifugal force in aid of such attachment the steel after be introduce be well hammer which expand it sideways until it fill the dovetail groove 531 _ q _ -- be any arrangement adopt to facilitate the passage of the locomotive round curve _ a _ -- the tire be turn somewhat conical to facilitate the passage of the engine round curve -- the diameter of the outer wheel be virtually increase by the centrifugal force of the engine and that of the inner wheel be correspondingly diminish whereby the curve be pass without the resistance which would otherwise arise from the inequality of the space pass over by wheel of the same diameter fix upon the same axle the rail moreover be not set quite upright but be slightly inclined inward in consequence of which the wheel must be either conical or slightly dish to bear fairly upon the rail one benefit of incline the rail in this way and con the tire be that the flange of the wheel be less liable to bear against the side of the rail and with the same view the flange of all the wheel be make with large fillet in the corner wheel have be place loose upon the axle but they have less stability and be not now much use nevertheless this plan appear to be a good one if properly work out 532 _ q _ -- be any precaution take to prevent engine from be throw off the rail by obstruction leave upon the line _ a _ -- in most engine a bar be strongly attach to the front of the carriage on each side and project perpendicularly downward to within a short distance of the rail to clear away stone or other obstruction that might occasion accident if the engine run over they chapter ix steam navigation \* \* \* \* \* resistance of vessel in water 533 _ q _ -- how do you determine the resistance encounter by a vessel move in water _ a _ -- the resistance experience by vessel move in water vary as the square of the velocity of they motion or nearly so and the power necessary to impart a increase velocity vary nearly as the cube of such increase velocity to double the velocity of a steam vessel therefore will require four time the amount of tractive force and as that quadruple force must act through twice the distance in the same time a engine capable of exert eight time the original power will be require -lrb- 1 -rrb- 534 _ q _ -- in the case of a board move in water in the manner of a paddle float or in the case of move water impinging on a stationary board what will be the pressure produce by the impact _ a _ -- the pressure produce upon a flat board by striking water at right angle to the surface of the board will be equal to the weight of a column of water have the surface strike as a base and for its altitude twice the height due to the velocity with which the board move through the water if the board strike the water obliquely the resistance will be less but no very reliable law have yet be discover to determine its amount 535 _ q _ -- will not the resistance of a vessel in move through the water be much less than that of a flat board of the area of the cross section _ a _ -- it will be very much less as be manifest from the comparatively small area of paddle board and the small area of the circle describe by the screw relatively with the area of the immerse midship section of the vessel the absolute speed of a vessel with any give amount of power will depend very much upon she shape 536 _ q _ -- in what way be it that the shape of a vessel influence she speed since the vessel of the same sectional area must manifestly put in motion a column of water of the same magnitude and with the same velocity _ a _ -- a vessel will not strike the water with the same velocity when the bow line be sharp as when they be otherwise for a very sharp bow have the effect of enable the vessel to move through a great distance while the particle of water be move aside but a small distance or in other word it cause the velocity with which the water be move to be very small relatively with the velocity of the vessel and as the resistance increase as the square of the velocity with which the water be move it be conceivable enough in what way a sharp bow may diminish the resistance 537 _ q _ -- be the whole power expend in the propulsion of a vessel consume in move aside the water to enable the vessel to pass _ a _ -- by no means only a portion and in well-formed vessel only a small portion of the power be thus consume in the majority of case the greater part of the power be expend in overcome the friction of the water upon the bottom of the vessel and the problem chiefly claim consideration be in what way we may diminish the friction 538 _ q _ -- do the resistance produce by this friction increase with the velocity _ a _ -- it increase nearly as the square of the velocity at two nautical mile per hour the thrust necessary to overcome the friction vary as the 1823 power of the velocity and at eight nautical mile per hour the thrust necessary to overcome the friction vary as the 1713 power of the velocity it be hardly proper perhaps to call this resistance by the name of friction it be partly perhaps mainly due to the viscidity or adhesion of the water 539 _ q _ -- perhaps at high velocity this resistance may become less _ a _ -- that appear very probable it may happen that at high velocity the adhesion be overcome so that the water be drag off the vessel and the friction thereafter follow the law which obtain in the case of solid body but any such conclusion be mere speculation since no experiment illustrative of this question have yet be make 540 _ q _ -- will a vessel experience more resistance in move in salt water than in move in fresh _ a _ -- if the immersion be the same in both case a vessel will experience more resistance in move in salt water than in move in fresh on account of the greater density of salt water but as the notation be proportionably greater in the salt water the resistance will be the same with the same weight carry 541 _ q _ -- discard for the present the subject of friction and look merely to the question of bow and stern resistance in what manner should the hull of a vessel be form so as to make these resistance a minimum _ a _ -- the hull should be so form that the water instead of be away drive forcibly from the bow be open gradually so that every particle of water may be move aside slowly at first and then faster like the ball of a pendulum until it reach the position of the midship frame at which point it will have come to a state of rest and then again like a return pendulum vibrate back in the same way until it come to rest at the stern it be not difficult to describe mechanically the line which the water should pursue if a endless web of paper be put into uniform motion and a pendulum carry a pencil or brush be hang in front of it then such pendulum will trace on the paper the proper water line of the ship or the line which the water should pursue in order that no power may be lose except that which be lose in friction it be find however in practice that vessel form with water line on this principle be not much superior to ordinary vessel in the facility with which they pass through the water : and this point to the conclusion that in ordinary vessel of good form the amount of power consume in overcome the resistance due to the wave at the bow and the partial vacuity at the stern be not so great as have heretofore be suppose and that in fact the main resistance be that due to the friction -lrb- 1 -rrb- this statement suppose that there be no difference of level between the water at the bow and the water at the stern in the experiment on the steamer pelican the resistance be find to vary as the 228th power of the velocity but the deviation from the recognize law be imputed to a difference in the level of the water at the bow and stern experiment on the resistance of vessel 542 _ q _ -- have experiment be make to determine the resistance which steam vessel experience in move through the water _ a _ -- experiment have be make both to determine the relative resistance of different class of vessel and also the absolute resistance in pound or ton the first experiment make upon this subject be conduct by messr boulton and watt and they have be numerous long continue and carefully perform these experiment be make upon paddle vessel 543 _ q _ -- will you recount the chief result of these experiment _ a _ -- the purpose of the experiment be to establish a coefficient of performance which with any give class of vessel would enable the speed which would be obtain with any give power to be readily predict this coefficient be obtain by multiply the cube of the velocity of the vessel experiment upon in mile per hour by the sectional area of the immerse midship section in square foot and divide by the number of nominal horse power and this coefficient will be large in the proportion of the goodness of the shape of the vessel 544 _ q _ -- how many experiment be make altogether _ a _ -- there be five different set of experiment on five different class of vessel the first set of experiment be make in 1828 upon the vessel caledonium diana eclipse kingshead moordyke and eagle-vessel of a similar form and all with square bilge and flat floor and the result be to establish the number 925 as the coefficient of performance of such vessel the second set of experiment be make upon the superior vessel venus swiftsure dasher arrow spitfire fury albion queen dart hawk margaret and hero-all vessel have flat floor and round bilge where the coefficient become 1160 the third set of experiment be make upon the vessel lightning meteor jame watt cinderellum navy meteor crocodile watersprite theti dolphin wizard escape and dragon-all vessel with rise floor and round bilge and the coefficient of performance be find to be 1430 the fourth set of experiment be make in 1834 upon the vessel magnet dart eclipse flamer firefly ferret and monarch when the coefficient of performance be find to be 1580 the fifth set of experiment be make upon the red rover city of canterbury herne queen and prince of wale and in the case of those vessel the coefficient rise to 2550 the velocity of any of these vessel with any power or sectional area may be ascertain by multiply the coefficient of its class by the nominal horse power divide by the sectional area in square foot and extract the cube root of the quotient which will be the velocity in mile per hour or the number of nominal horse power requisite for the accomplishment of any require speed may be ascertain by multiply the cube of the require velocity in mile per hour by the sectional area in square foot and divide by the coefficient : the quotient be the number of nominal horse power requisite to realize the speed 545 _ q _ -- see however that the nominal power do not represent a invariable amount of dynamical efficiency would it not be better to make the comparison with reference to the actual power _ a _ -- in the whole of the experiment recite except in the case of one or two of the last the pressure of steam in the boiler vary between 2-3\/4 lb and 4 lb per square inch and the effective pressure on the piston vary between 11 lb and 13 lb per square inch so that the average ratio of the nominal to the actual power may be easily compute but it will be preferable to state the nominal power of some of the vessel and they actual power as ascertain by experiment 546 _ q _ -- then state this _ a _ -- of the eclipse the nominal power be 76 and the actual power 1444 horse of the arrow the nominal power be 60 and the actual 1195 spitfire nominal 40 actual 64 fury nominal 40 actual 656 albion nominal 80 actual 1354 dart nominal 100 actual 1524 hawk nominal 40 actual 73 hero nominal 100 actual 1714 meteor nominal 100 actual 160 jame watt nominal 120 actual 204 watersprite nominal 76 actual 1576 dolphin nominal 140 actual 238 dragon nominal 80 actual 131 magnet nominal 140 actual 238 dart nominal 120 actual 237 flamer nominal 120 actual 234 firefly nominal 52 actual 866 ferret nominal 52 actual 88 monarch nominal 200 actual 378 in the case of swift vessel of modern construction such as the red rover herne queen and prince of wale the coefficient appear to be about 2550 but in these vessel there be a still greater excess of the actual over the nominal power than in the case of the vessel previously enumerate and the increase in the coefficient be consequent upon the increase pressure of the steam in the boiler as well as the superior form of the ship the nominal power of the red rover herne and city of canterbury be in each case 120 horse but the actual power of the red rover be 294 of the herne 354 and of the city of canterbury 306 and in some vessel the excess be still greater so that with such variation it become necessary to adopt a coefficient derive from the introduction of the actual instead of the nominal power 547 _ q _ -- what will be the average difference between the nominal and actual power in the several class of vessel you have mention and the respective coefficient when correct for the actual power _ a _ -- in the first class of vessel experiment upon the actual power be about 16 time greater than the nominal power in the second class 167 time greater in the third class 17 time greater and in the fourth 196 time greater while in such vessel as the red rover and city of canterbury it be 265 time greater so that if we adopt the actual instead of the nominal power in fix the coefficient we shall have 554 as the first coefficient 694 as the second 832 for the third and 806 for the fourth instead of 92511601430 and 1580 as previously specify while for such vessel as the red rover herne queen and prince of wale we shall have 962 instead of 2550 these smaller coefficient then express the relative merit of the different vessel without reference to any difference of efficacy in the engine and it appear preferable with such a variable excess of the actual over the nominal power to employ they instead of those first refer to from the circumstance of the third of the new coefficient be greater than the fourth it appear that the superior result in the fourth set of experiment arise altogether from a greater excess of the actual over the nominal power 548 _ q _ -- these experiment you have already state be all make on paddle vessel have similar coefficient of performance be obtain in the case of screw vessel _ a _ -- the coefficient of a greater number of screw vessel have be obtain and record but it would occupy too much time to enumerate they here the coefficient of performance of the fairy be 4648 of the rattler 6768 and of the frankfort 7923 this coefficient however refer to nautical and not to statute mile if reduce to statute mile for the purpose of comparison with the previous experiment the coefficient will respectively become 703 1033 and 1212 which indicate that the performance of screw vessel be equal to the performance of paddle vessel but some of the superiority of the result may be imputed to the superior size of the screw vessel influence of the size of vessel upon they speed 549 _ q _ -- will large vessel attain a greater speed than small suppose each to be furnish with the same proportionate power _ a _ -- it be well know that large vessel furnish with the same proportionate power will attain a greater speed than small vessel as appear from the rule usual in yacht race of allow a certain part of the distance to be run to vessel which be of inferior size the velocity attain by a large vessel will be greater than the velocity attain by a small vessel of the same mould and the same proportionate power in the proportion of the square root of the linear dimension of the vessel a vessel therefore with four time the sectional area and four time the power of a smaller symmetrical vessel and consequently of twice the length will have its speed increase in the proportion of the square root of 1 to the square root of 2 or 14 time 550 _ q _ -- will you further illustrate this doctrine by a example _ a _ -- the screw steamer fairy if enlarged to three time the size while retain the same form would have twenty-seven time the capacity nine time the sectional area and nine time the power the length of such a vessel would be 434 foot she breadth 63 foot 4-1\/2 inch she draught of water 16-1\/2 foot she area of immerse section 729 square foot and she nominal power 1080 horse now as the length of the fairy and of the new vessel be in the proportion of 1 to 3 the speed will be in the proportion of the square root of 1 to the square root of 3 or in other word the speed of the large vessel will be 173 time greater than the speed of the small vessel if therefore the speed of the fairy be 13 knot the speed of the new vessel will be 2249 knot although the proportion of power to sectional area which be suppose to be the measure of the resistance be in both case precisely the same if the speed of the fairy herself have to be increase to 2229 knot the power would have to be increase in the proportion of the cube of 13 to the cube of 2249 or 52 time which make the power necessary to propel the fairy at that speed equal to 624 nominal horse power structure and operation of paddle wheel 551 _ q _ -- will you describe the configuration and mode of action of the paddle wheel in general use _ a _ -- there be two kind of paddle wheel in extensive use the one be the ordinary radial wheel in which the float be fix on arm radiate from the center and the other the feather wheel in which each float be hang upon a center and be so govern by suitable mechanism as to be always keep in nearly the vertical position in the radial wheel there be some loss of power from oblique action whereas in the feather wheel there be little or no loss from this cause but in every kind of paddle there be a loss of power from the recession of the water from the float board or the _ slip _ as it be commonly call and this loss be the necessary condition of the resistance for the propulsion of the vessel be create in a fluid the slip be express by the difference between the speed of the wheel and the speed of the vessel and the larger this difference be the greater the loss of power from slip must be -- the consumption of steam in the engine be proportionate to the velocity of the wheel and the useful effect be proportionate to the speed of the ship 552 _ q _ -- the resistance necessary for propulsion will not be situate at the circumference of the wheel _ a _ -- in the feather wheel where every part of any one immerged float move forward with the same horizontal velocity the pressure or resistance may be suppose to be concentrate in the center of the float whereas in the common radial wheel this can not be the case for as the outer edge of the float move more rapidly than the edge nearest the center of the wheel the outer part of the float be the most effectual in propulsion the point at which the outer and inner portion of the float just balance one another in propel effect be call the _ center of pressure _ and if all the resistance be concentrate in this point they would have the same effect as before in resist the rotation of the wheel the resistance upon any one move float board totally immerse in the water will when the vessel be at rest obviously vary as the square of its distance from the center of motion -- the resistance of a fluid vary with the square of the velocity but except when the wheel be sink to the axle or altogether immerse in the water it be impossible under ordinary circumstance for one float to be totally immerse without other be immerse partially whereby the arc describe by the extremity of the paddle arm will become greater than the arc describe by the inner edge of the float and consequently the resistance upon any part of the float will increase in a higher ratio than the square of its distance from the center of motion -- the position of the center of pressure be at the same time correspondingly affect in the feather wheel the position of the center of pressure of the enter and emerge float be continually change from the lower edge of the float -- where it be when the float be enter or leave the water -- to the center of the float which be its position when the float be wholly immerged but in the radial wheel the center of pressure can never rise so high as the center of the float 553 _ q _ -- all this relate to the action of the paddle when the vessel be at rest : will you explain its action when the vessel be in motion _ a _ -- when the wheel of a coach roll along the ground any point of its periphery describe in the air a curve which be term a cycloid any point within the periphery trace a prolate or protracted cycloid and any point exterior to the periphery trace a curtate or contract cycloid -- the prolate cycloid partaking more of the nature of a straight line and the curtate cycloid more of the nature of a circle the action of a paddle wheel in the water resemble in this respect that of the wheel of a carriage run along the ground : that point in the radius of the paddle of which the rotative speed be just equal to the velocity of the vessel will describe a cycloid point nearer the center prolate cycloid and point further from the center curtate cycloid the circle describe by the point whose velocity equal the velocity of the ship be call the _ roll circle _ and the resistance due to the difference of velocity of the rolling circle and center of pressure be that which operate in the propulsion of the vessel the resistance upon any part of the float therefore will vary as the square of its distance from the rolling circle suppose the float to be totally immerged but take into account the greater length of time during which the extremity of the paddle act whereby the resistance will be make greater we shall not err far in estimate the resistance upon any point at the third power of its distance from the rolling circle in the case of light immersion and the 25 power in the case of deep immersion 554 _ q _ -- how be the position of the center of pressure to be determine _ a _ -- with the foregoing assumption which accord sufficiently with experiment to justify its acceptation the position of the center of pressure may be find by the follow rule : -- from the radius of the wheel substract the radius of the rolling circle to the remainder add the depth of the paddle board and divide the fourth power of the sum by four time the depth from the cube root of the quotient subtract the difference between the radius of the wheel and roll circle and the remainder will be the distance of the center of pressure from the upper edge of the paddle 555 _ q _ -- how do you find the diameter of the rolling circle _ a _ -- the diameter of the rolling circle be very easily find for we have only to divide 5280 time the number of mile per hour by 60 time the number of stroke per minute to get a expression for the circumference of the rolling circle or the follow rule may be adopt : -- divide 88 time the speed of the vessel in statute mile per hour by 31416 time the number of stroke per minute the quotient will be the diameter in foot of the rolling circle the diameter of the circle in which the center of pressure move or the effective diameter of the wheel be know and also the diameter of the rolling circle we at once find the excess of the velocity of the wheel over the vessel 556 _ q _ -- will you illustrate these rule by a example _ a _ -- a steam vessel of moderately good shape and with engine of 200 horse power realize with 22 stroke per minute a speed of 1062 mile per hour to find the diameter of the rolling circle we have 88 time 1062 equal to 93466 and 22 time 31416 equal to 691152 then 93466 divide by 691152 be equal to 1352 foot which be the diameter of the rolling circle the diameter of the wheel be 19 ft 4 in so that the diameter of the rolling circle be about 2\/3ds of the diameter of the wheel and this be a frequent proportion the depth of the paddle board be 2 foot and the difference between the diameter of the wheel and roll circle will be 58133 which will make the difference of they radius 29067 and add to this the depth of the paddle board we have 49067 the fourth power of which be 57964 which divide by four time the depth of the paddle board give we 72455 the cube root of which be 41689 which diminish by the difference of the radius of the wheel and roll circle leave 12622 foot for the distance of the center of pressure from the upper edge of the paddle board in the case of light immersion the radius of the wheel be 96667 the distance from the center of the wheel to the upper edge of the float be 76667 and add to this 12622 we get 89299 foot as the radius or 178598 foot as the diameter of the circle in which the center of pressure revolve with 22 stroke per minute the velocity of the center of pressure will be 20573 foot per second and with 1062 mile per hour for the speed of the vessel the velocity of the rolling circle will be 15576 foot per second the effective velocity will be the difference between these quantity or 4997 foot per second now the height from which a body must fall by gravity to acquire a velocity of 4997 foot per second be about 62 foot and twice this height or 124 foot multiply by 62-1\/2 which be the number of lb weight in a cubic foot of water give 77-1\/2 lb as the pressure on each square foot of the vertical paddle board as each board be of 20 square foot of area and there be a vertical board on each side of the ship the total pressure on the vertical paddle board will be 2900 lb 557 _ q _ -- what pressure be this equivalent to on each square inch of the piston _ a _ -- a vessel of 200 horse power will have two cylinder each 50 inch diameter and 5 foot stroke or thereabout the area of a piston of 50 inch diameter be 19635 square inch so that the area of the two piston be 3927 square inch and the piston will move through 10 foot every revolution and with 22 stroke per minute this will be 220 foot per minute or 366 foot per second now if the effective velocity of the center of pressure and the velocity of the piston have be the same then a pressure of 2900 lb upon the vertical paddle would have be balance by a equal pressure on the piston which would have be in this case about 75 lb per square inch but as the effective velocity of the center of pressure be 4997 foot per second while that of the piston be only 366 foot per second the pressure must be increase in the proportion of 4997 to 366 to establish a equilibrium of pressure or in other word it must be 102 lb per square inch it follow from this investigation that in radial wheel the greater part of the engine power be distribute among the oblique float 558 _ q _ -- how come this to be the case _ a _ -- to understand how it happen that more power be expend upon the oblique than upon the vertical float it be necessary to remember that the only resistance upon the vertical paddle be that due to the difference of velocity of the wheel and the ship but if the wheel be suppose to be immerse to its axle so that the enter float strike the water horizontally it be clear that the resistance on such float be that due to the whole velocity of rotation and that the resistance to the enter float will be the same whether the vessel be in motion or not the resistance oppose to the rotation of any float increase from the position of the vertical float-where the resistance be that due to the difference of velocity of the wheel and vessel -- until it reach the plane of the axis suppose the wheel to be immerse so far where the resistance be that due to the whole velocity of rotation and although in any oblique float the total resistance can not be consider operative in a horizontal direction yet the total resistance increase so rapidly on each side of the vertical float that the portion of it which be operative in the horizontal direction be in all ordinary case of immersion very considerable in the feather wheel where there be little of this oblique action the resistance will be in the proportion of the square of the horizontal velocity of the several float which may be represent by the horizontal distance between they and in the feather wheel the vertical float have the greatest horizontal velocity will have the greatest propel effect 559 _ q _ -- should the float in feather wheel enter and leave the water vertically _ a _ -- the float should be so govern by the central crank or eccentric that the enter and emerge float have a direction intermediate between a radius and a vertical line 560 _ q _ -- can you give any practical rule for proportion paddle wheel _ a _ -- a common rule for the pitch of the float be to allow one float for every foot of diameter of the wheel but in the case of fast vessel a pitch of 2-1\/2 foot or even less appear preferable as a close pitch occasion less vibration if the float be put too close however the water will not escape freely from between they and if set too far apart the stroke of the enter paddle will occasion a inconvenient amount of vibratory motion and there will also be some loss of power to find the proper area of a single float : -- divide the number of actual horse power of both engine by the diameter of the wheel in foot the quotient be the area of one paddle board in square foot proper for sea go vessel and the area multiply by 06 will give the length of the float in foot in very sharp vessel which offer less resistance in pass through the water the area of paddle board be usually one-fourth less than the above proportion and the proper length of the float may in such case be find by multiply the area by 07 in sea go vessel about four float be usually immerse and in river steamer only one or two float there be more slip in the latter case but there be also more engine power exert in the propulsion of the ship from the greater speed of engine thus render possible 561 _ q _ -- then be it beneficial to use small float _ a _ -- quite the contrary if to permit a greater speed of the engine the float be diminish in area instead of be raise out of the water no appreciable accession to the speed of the vessel will be obtain whereas there will be a increase speed of vessel if the accelerate speed of the engine be cause by diminish the diameter of the wheel in vessel intend to be fast therefore it be expedient to make the wheel small so as to enable the engine to work with a high velocity and it be expedient to make such wheel of the feather kind to obviate loss of power from oblique action in no wheel must the roll circle fall below the water line else the enter and emerge float will carry mass of water before they the slip be usually equal to about one-fourth of the velocity of the center of pressure in well proportioned wheel but it be desirable to have the slip as small as be possible consistently with the observance of other necessary condition the speed of the engine and also the speed of the vessel be fix the diameter of the rolling circle become at once ascertainable and add to this the slip we have the diameter of the wheel configuration and action of the screw 562 _ q _ -- will you describe more in detail than you have yet do the configuration and mode of action of the screw propeller _ a _ -- the ordinary form of screw propeller be represent in fig 46 and 47 fig 46 be a perspective view and fig 47 a end view or view such as be see when look upon the end of the shaft the screw here represent be one with two arm or blade some screw have three arm some four and some six but the screw with two arm be the most usual and screw with more than three arm be not now much employ in this country the screw on be put into revolution by the engine preserve a spiral path in the water in which it draw itself forward in the same way as a screw nail do when turn round in a piece of wood whereas the paddle wheel more resemble the action of a cog wheel work in a rack -lrb- illustration : fig 46 fig 47 ordinary form of screw propeller -rrb- 563 _ q _ -- but the screw of a steam vessel have no resemblance to a screw nail _ a _ -- it have in fact a very close resemblance if you suppose only a very short piece of the screw nail to be employ and if you suppose moreover the thread of the screw to be cut nearly into the center to prevent the wood from strip the original screw propeller be make with several convolution of screw but it be find advantageous to shorten they until they be now only make one-sixth of a convolution in length 564 _ q _ -- and the pitch you have already explain to be the distance in the line of the shaft from one convolution to the next suppose the screw to consist of two or more convolution _ a _ -- yes that be what be mean by the pitch if a thread be wind upon a cylinder with a equal distance between the convolution it will trace a screw of a uniform pitch and if the thread be wind upon the cylinder with a increase distance between each convolution it will trace a screw of a increase pitch but two or more thread may be wind upon the cylinder at the same time instead of a single thread if two thread be wind upon it they will trace a double-threaded screw if three thread be wind upon it they will trace a treble-threaded screw and so of any other number now if the thread be suppose to be raise up into a very deep and thin spiral feather and the cylinder be suppose to become very small like the newel of a spiral stair then a screw will be obtain of the kind proper for propel vessel except that only a very short piece of such screw must be employ whatever be the number of thread wind upon a cylinder if the cylinder be cut across all the thread will be cut a slice cut out of the cylinder will therefore contain a piece of each thread but the thread in the case of a screw propeller answer to the arm so that in every screw propeller the number of thread enter into the composition of the screw will be the same as the number of arm a ordinary screw with two blade be a short piece of a screw of two thread 565 _ q _ -- in what part of the ship be the screw usually place -lrb- illustration : fig 48 -rrb- _ a _ -- in that part of the run of the ship call the dead wood which be a thin and unused part of the vessel just in advance of the rudder the usual arrangement be show in fig 48 which represent the application to a vessel of a species of screw which have the arm bent backwards to counteract the centrifugal motion give to the water when there be a considerable amount of slip 566 _ q _ -- how be the slip in a screw vessel determine _ a _ -- by compare the actual speed of the vessel with the speed due to the pitch and number of revolution of the screw or what be the same thing the speed which the vessel would attain if the screw work in a solid nut the difference between the actual speed and this hypothetical speed be the slip 567 _ q _ -- in well form screw propeller what be the amount of slip find to be _ a _ -- if the screw be properly proportion to the resistance that the vessel have to overcome the slip will not be more than 10 per cent but in some case it amount to 30 per cent or even more than this in other case however the slip be nothing at all and even less than nothing or in other word the vessel pass through the water with a greater velocity than if the screw be work in a solid nut 568 _ q _ -- then it must be by the aid of the wind or some other extraneous force _ a _ -- no by the action of the screw alone 569 _ q _ -- but how be such a result possible _ a _ -- it appear to be mainly owe to the centrifugal action of the screw which interpose a film or wedge of water between the screw itself and the water on which the screw react this negative slip as it be call chiefly occur when the pitch of the screw be less than its diameter and when consequently the velocity of rotation be greater than if a coarser pitch have be employ there be moreover in all vessel pass through the water with any considerable velocity a current of water follow the vessel in which current in the case of a screw vessel the screw will revolve and in certain case the phenomenon of negative slip may be imputable in part to the existence of this current 570 _ q _ -- be the screw propeller as effectual a instrument of propulsion as the radial or feathering paddle _ a _ -- in all case of deep immersion it appear to be quite as effectual as the radial paddle indeed more so but it be scarcely as effectual as the feather paddle with any amount of immersion and scarcely as effectual as the common paddle in the case of light immersion comparative advantage of paddle and screw vessel 571 _ q _ -- whether do you consider paddle or screw vessel to be on the whole the most advantageous _ a _ -- that be a large question and can only receive a qualify answer in some case the use of paddle be indispensable as for example in the case of river vessel of a limited draught of water where it would not be possible to get sufficient depth below the water surface to enable a screw of a proper diameter to be get in 572 _ q _ -- but how do the matter stand in the case of ocean vessel _ a _ -- in the case of ocean vessel it be find that paddle vessel fit with the ordinary radial wheel and screw vessel fit with the ordinary screw be about equally efficient in calm and in fair or beam wind with light and medium immersion if the vessel be load deeply however as vessel start on a long voyage and carry much coal must almost necessarily be then the screw have a advantage since the screw act in its best manner when deeply immerse and the paddle in they worst when a screw and paddle vessel however of the same model and power be set to encounter head wind the paddle vessel it be find have in all case a advantage not in speed but in economy of fuel for whereas in a paddle vessel when she progress be resist the speed of the engine diminish nearly in the proportion of the diminish speed of ship it happen that in a screw vessel this be not so -- at least to a equal extent -- but the engine work with nearly the same rate of speed as if no increase of resistance have be encounter by the ship it follow from this circumstance that whereas in paddle vessel the consumption of steam and therefore of fuel per hour be materially diminish when head wind occur in screw vessel a similar diminution in the consumption of steam and fuel do not take place 573 _ q _ -- but perhaps under such circumstance the speed of the screw vessel will be the greater of the two _ a _ -- no the speed of the two vessel will be the same unless the strength of the head wind be so great as to bring the vessel nearly to a state of rest and on that supposition the screw vessel will have the advantage such case occur very rarely in practice and in the case of the ordinary resistance impose by head wind the speed of the screw and paddle vessel will be the same but the screw vessel will consume most coal 574 _ q _ -- what be the cause of this peculiarity _ a _ -- the cause be that when the screw be so proportion in its length as to be most suitable for propel vessel in calm it be too short to be suitable for propel vessel which encounter a very heavy resistance it follow therefore that if it be prevent from pursue its spiral course in the water it will displace the water to a certain extent laterally in the manner it do if the engine be set on when the vessel be at anchor and a part of the engine power be thus waste in produce a useless disturbance of the water which in paddle vessel be not expend at all 575 _ q _ -- if a screw and paddle vessel of the same mould and power be tie stern to stern will not the screw vessel preponderate and tow the paddle vessel astern against the whole force of she engine _ a _ -- yes that will be so 576 _ q _ -- and see that the vessel be of the same mould and power so that neither can derive a advantage from a variation in that condition do not the preponderance of the screw vessel show that the screw must be the most powerful propeller _ a _ -- no it do not 577 _ q _ -- see that the vessel be the same in all respects except as regard the propeller and that one of they exhibit a superiority do not this circumstance show that one propeller must be more powerful than the other _ a _ -- that do not follow necessarily nor be it the fact in this particular case all steam vessel when set into motion will force themselves forward with a amount of thrust which set aside the loss from friction and from other cause will just balance the pressure on the piston in a paddle vessel as have already be explain it be easy to tell the tractive force exert at the center of pressure of the paddle wheel when the pressure urge the piston the dimension of the wheel and the speed of the vessel be know and that force whatever be its amount must always continue the same with any constant pressure on the piston in a screw vessel the same law apply so that with any give pressure on the piston and discard the consideration of friction it will follow that whatever be the thrust exert by a paddle or a screw vessel it must remain uniform whether the vessel be in motion or at rest and whether move at a high or a low velocity through the water now to achieve a equal speed during calm in two vessel of the same model there must be the same amount of propel thrust in each and this thrust whatever be its amount can not afterward vary if a uniform pressure of steam be maintain the thrust therefore cause by they respective propel instrument when a screw and paddle vessel be tie stern to stern must be the same as at other time and as at other time those thrust be equal so must they be when the vessel be set in the antagonism suppose 578 _ q _ -- how come it then that the screw vessel preponderate _ a _ -- not by virtue of a larger thrust exert by the screw in press forward the shaft and with it the vessel but by the gravitation against the stern of the wave of water which the screw raise by its rapid rotation this wave will only be raise very high when the progress of the vessel through the water be nearly arrest at which time the centrifugal action of the screw be very great and the vessel under such circumstance be force forward partly by the thrust of the screw and partly by the hydrostatic pressure of the protuberance of water which the centrifugal action of the screw raise up at the stern 579 _ q _ -- can you state any fact in corroboration of this view _ a _ -- the screw vessel will not preponderate if a screw and paddle vessel be tie bow to bow and the engine of each be then reverse in some screw vessel the amount of thrust actually exert by the screw under all its vary circumstance have be ascertain by the application of a dynamometer to the end of the shaft by this instrument -- which be form by a combination of lever like a weigh machine for cart -- a thrust or pressure of several ton can be measure by the application of a small weight and it have be find by repeat experiment with the dynamometer that the thrust of the screw in a screw vessel when tow a paddle vessel against the whole force of she engine be just the same as it be when the two vessel be maintain a equal speed in calm the preponderance of the screw vessel must therefore be imputable to some other agency than to a superior thrust of the screw which be find by experiment not to exist 580 _ q _ -- have the dynamometer be apply to paddle vessel _ a _ -- it have not be apply to the vessel themselves as in the case of screw vessel but it have be employ on shore to ascertain the amount of tractive force that a paddle vessel can exert on a rope 581 _ q _ -- have any experiment be make to determine the comparative performance of screw and paddle vessel at sea _ a _ -- yes numerous experiment of which the best know be probably those make on the screw steamer rattler and the paddle steamer alecto each vessel of the same model size and power -- each vessel being of about 800 ton burden and 200 horse power subsequently another set of experiment with the same object be make with the niger screw steamer and the basilisk paddle steamer both vessel be of about 1000 ton burden and 400 horse power the general result which be obtain in the course of these experiment be those which have be already recite 582 _ q _ -- will you recapitulate some of the main incident of these trial _ a _ -- i may first state some of the chief dimension of the vessel the rattler be 176 foot 6 inch long 32 foot 8-1\/2 inch broad 888 ton burden 200 horse power and have a area of immerse midship section of 380 square foot at a draught of water of 11 foot 5-1\/2 inch the alecto be of the same dimension in every respect except that she be only of 800 ton burden the difference in this particular be wholly owe to the rattler have be draw out about 15 foot at the stern to leave abundant room for the application of the screw the rattler be fit with a dynamometer which enable the actual propel thrust of the screw shaft to be measure and the amount of this thrust multiply by the distance through which the vessel pass in a give time would determine the amount of power actually utilize in propel the ship both vessel be fit with indicator apply to the cylinder so as to determine the amount of power exert by the engine 583 _ q _ -- how many trial of the vessel be make on this occasion _ a _ -- twelve trial in all but i need not refer to those in which similar or identical result be only repeat the first trial be make under steam only the weather be calm and the water smooth at 54 minute past 4 in the morning both vessel leave the nore and at 30-1\/2 minute past 2 the rattler stop she engine in yarmouth road where in 20-1\/2 minute afterward she be join by the alecto the mean speed achieve by the rattler during this trial be 92 knot per hour the mean speed of the alecto be 88 knot per hour the slip of the screw be 102 per cent the actual power exert by the engine as show by the indicator be in the case of the rattler 3346 horse and in the case of the alecto 2812 horse be a difference of 534 horse in favor of the rattler the forward thrust upon the screw shaft be 3 ton 17 cwt 3 qr and 14 lb the horse power of the shaft -- or power actually utilize -- ascertain by multiply the thrust in pound by the space pass through by the vessel in foot per minute and divide by 33000 be 2478 horse power this make the ratio of the shaft to the engine power as 1 to 13 or in other word it show that the amount of engine power utilize in propulsion be 77 per cent in a subsequent trial make with the vessel run before the wind but with no sail set and the mast strike the speed realize by the rattler be 10 knot per hour the slip of the screw be 112 per cent the actual power exert by the engine of the rattler be 3688 horse the actual power exert by the engine of the alecto be 2917 horse the thrust of the shaft be equal to a weight of 4 ton 4 cwt 1 qr 1 lb the horse power of the shaft be 2902 horse and the ratio of the shaft to the engine power be 1 to 12 here therefore the amount of the engine power utilize be 84 per cent 584 _ q _ -- if in any screw vessel the power of the engine be diminish by shut off the steam or otherwise you will then have a larger screw relatively with the power of the engine than before _ a _ -- yes 585 _ q _ -- be any experiment make to ascertain the effect of this modification _ a _ -- there be but the result be not find to be better than before the experiment be make by shut off the steam from the engine of the rattler until the number of stroke be reduce to 17 in the minute the actual power be then 1267 horse thrust upon the shaft 2 ton 2 cwt 3 qr 14 lb horse power of shaft 884 horse ratio of shaft to engine power 1 to 14 slip of the screw 187 per cent in this experiment the power utilize be 71 per cent 586 _ q _ -- be any experiment make to determine the relative performance in head wind _ a _ -- the trial in which this relation be best determine last for seven hour and be make against a strong head wind and heavy head sea the speed of the rattler by patent log be 42 knot and at the conclusion of the trial the alecto have the advantage by about half a mile owe to a accidental injury to the indicator the power exert by the engine of the rattler in this trial could not be ascertain but judge from the power exert in other experiment with the same number of revolution it appear probable that the power actually exert by the rattler be about 300 horse the number of stroke per minute make by the engine of the rattler be 22 whereas in the alecto the number of stroke per minute be only 12 so that while the engine of the alecto be reduce by the resistance occasion by a strong head wind to nearly half they usual speed the engine of the rattler be only lessen about one twelfth of they usual speed the mean thrust upon the screw shaft during this experiment be 4 ton 7 cwt 0 qr 16 lb the horse power of the shaft be 1259 horse and the slip of the screw be 56 per cent take the power actually exert by the rattler at 300 horse the power utilize in this experiment be only 42 per cent 587 _ q _ -- what be the dimension of the screw in the rattler _ a _ -- diameter 10 foot length 1 foot 3 inch pitch 11 foot the foregoing experiment show that with a larger screw a better average performance would be obtain the best result arrive at be when the vessel be somewhat assist by the wind which be equivalent to a reduction of the resistance of the hull or to a smaller hull which be only another expression for a larger proportionate screw 588 _ q _ -- when you speak of a larger screw what increase of dimension do you mean to express _ a _ -- a increase of the diameter the amount of react power of the screw upon the water be hot measure by the number of square foot of surface of the arm but by the area of the disc or circle in which the screw revolve the diameter of the screw of the rattler be 10 foot the area of its disc be 785 square foot and with the amount of thrust already mention as exist in the first experiment viz 8722 lb the react pressure on each square foot of the screw 's disc will be 108-1\/2 lb the immerse midship section be 380 square foot this be equivalent to 23 lb per square foot of immerse midship section at a speed of 92 knot per hour 589 _ q _ -- in smaller vessel of similar form will the resistance per square foot of midship section be more than this _ a _ -- it will be considerably more in the pelican a vessel of 109-3\/4 square foot of midship section i estimate the resistance per square foot of midship section at 30 lb when the speed of the vessel be 97 knot per hour in the minx with a immerse midship section of 82 square foot the resistance per square foot of immerse midship section be find by the dynamometer to be 41 lb at a speed of 8-1\/2 knot and in the dwarf a vessel with 60 square foot of midship section i estimate the resistance per square foot of midship section at 46 lb at a speed of 9 knot per hour which be just double the resistance per square foot of the rattler the diameter of the screw of the minx be 4-1\/2 foot so that the area of its disc be 159 square foot and the area of immerse midship section be about 5 time greater than that of the screw 's disc the diameter of the screw of the dwarf be 5 foot 8 inch so that the area of its disc be 2522 square foot and the area of immerse midship section be 24 time greater than that of the screw 's disc the pressure per square foot of the screw 's disc be 214 lb in the case of the minx and 109-1\/2 lb in the case of the dwarf 590 _ q _ -- from the greater proportionate resistance of small vessel will not they require larger proportionate screw than large vessel _ a _ -- they will 591 _ q _ -- be there any ready means of predict what the amount of thrust of a screw will be _ a _ -- when we know the amount of pressure on the piston and the velocity of they motion relatively with the velocity of advance make by the screw suppose it to work in a solid nut it be easy to tell what the thrust of the screw would be if it be clear of the effect of friction and other irregular source of disturbance the thrust in fact would be at once find by the principle of virtual velocity and if we take this theoretical thrust and diminish it by one fourth to compensate for friction and lateral slip we shall have a near approximation to the amount of thrust that will be actually exert -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- see treatise on the screw propeller by j bourne c e comparative advantage of different screw 592 _ q _ -- what species of screw do you consider the best _ a _ -- in case in which a large diameter of screw can be employ the ordinary screw or helix with two blade seem to be as effective as any other and it be the most easily construct if however the screw be restricted in diameter or if the vessel be require to tow or will have to encounter habitually strong head wind it will be preferable to employ a screw with a increase pitch and also of such other configuration that it will recover from the water some portion of the power that have be expend in slip 593 _ q _ -- how can this be do _ a _ -- there be screw which be intend to accomplish this object already in actual use when there be much slip a centrifugal velocity be give to the water and the screw indeed if the engine be set on when the vessel be at rest act very much as a centrifugal fan would do if place in the same situation the water project outward by the centrifugal force escape in the line of least resistance which be to the surface and if there be a high column of water over the screw or in other word if the screw be deeply immerse then the centrifugal action be resist to a greater extent and there will be less slip produce the easiest expedient therefore for obviate loss by slip be to sink the screw deeply in the water but as there be obvious limit to the application of this remedy the next best device be to recover and render available for propulsion some part of the power which have be expend in give motion to the water one device for do this consist in place the screw well forward in the dead wood so that it shall be overhang by the stern of the ship the water force upward by the centrifugal action of the screw will by impinge on the overhang stern press the vessel forward in the water just in the same way as be do by the wind when act on a oblique sail i believe the two revolving vane without any twist or obliquity on they at all would propel a vessel if set well forward in the dead wood or beneath the bottom merely by the ascent of the water up the inclined plane of the vessel 's run and at all event a screw so place would in my judgment aid materially in propel the vessel when she progress be resist by head wind 594 _ q _ -- but you say there be some kind of screw which profess to accomplish this -lrb- illustration : fig 49 the earl of dundonald 's propeller -rrb- _ a _ -- there be screw which profess to counteract the centrifugal velocity give to the water by impart to it a equal centripetal force the consequence of which will be that the water project backward by the screw instead of take the form of the frustum of a cone with its small end next the screw will take the form of a cylinder one of these form of screw be that patent by the earl of dundonald in 1843 and which be represent in fig 49 another be the form of screw already represent in fig 48 and which be patent by mr hodgson in 1844 mr hodgson bend the arm of he propeller backward not into the form of a triangle but into the form of a parabola to the end that the impact of the screw on the particle of the water may cause they to converge to a focus as the ray of light would do in a parabolic reflector but this particular configuration be not important see that the same convergence which be give to the particle of the water with a screw of uniform pitch bent back into the form of a parabola will be give with a screw bent back into the form of a triangle if the pitch be suitably vary between the center and the circumference 595 _ q _ -- then the pitch may be vary in two way _ a _ -- yes : a screw may have a pitch increase in the direction of the length as would happen in the case of a spiral stair if every successive step in the ascent be thicker than the one below it or it may increase from the center to the circumference as would happen in the case of a spiral stair if every step be thinner at the center of the lower than at its outer wall when the pitch of a screw increase in the direction of its length the lead edge of the screw enter the water without shock or impact as the advance of the lead edge per revolution will not be greater than the advance of the vessel when the pitch of a screw increase in the direction of its diameter the central part of the screw will advance with only the same velocity as the water so that it can not communicate any centrifugal velocity to the water and the whole slip as well as the whole propel pressure will occur at the outer part of the screw blade 596 _ q _ -- be there any advantage derive from these form of screw _ a _ -- there be a slight advantage but it be so slight as hardly to balance the increase trouble of manufacture and consequently they be not generally or widely adopt 597 _ q _ -- what other kind of screw be there propose to themselves the same or similar object _ a _ -- there be the corrugated screw the arm of which be corrugated so as it be to gear with the water during its revolution and thereby prevent it from acquire a centrifugal velocity then there be griffith 's screw which have a large ball at its center which by the suction it create at its hinder part in pass through the water produce a converge force which partly counteract the divergent action of the arm finally there be holm 's screw which have now be apply to a good number of vessel with success 598 _ q _ -- will you describe the configuration and action of holm 's screw _ a _ -- first then the screw increase in the direction of its length and this increase be very rapid at the follow edge so that in fact the follow edge stand in the plane of the shaft or in the vertical longitudinal plane of the vessel then the end of the arm be bent over into a curved flange the edge of which point astern and the point where this curved flange join the follow edge of the screw be form not into a angle but into a portion of a sphere so that this corner resemble the bowl of a spoon when the screw be put into revolution the water be encounter by the lead edge of the screw without shock as its advance be only equal to the advance of the vessel and before the screw leave the water it be project directly astern at the same time the curved flange at the rim of the screw prevent the dispersion of the water in a radial direction and it consequently assume the form of a column or cylinder of water project backward from the ship 599 _ q _ -- what be the nature of beattle 's screw _ a _ -- beattie 's screw be a arrangement of the screw propeller whereby it be project beyond the rudder and the main object of the arrangement be to take away the vibratory motion at the stern -- a intention which it accomplish in practice there be a oval eye in the rudder to permit the screw shaft to pass through it 600 _ q _ -- when the diameter of the cylinder of water project backward by a screw and the force urge it into motion be know may not the velocity it will acquire be approximately determine _ a _ -- that will not be very difficult and i will take for illustration the case of the minx already refer to which will show how such a computation be to be conduct the speed of this vessel in one of the experiment make with she be 8445 knot the number of revolution of the screw per minute 23132 and the pressure on each square foot of area of the screw 's disc 214 lb if a knot be take to be 60756 foot then the distance advance by the vessel when the speed be 8445 knot will be 37 foot per revolution and this advance will be make in about 26 of a second of time now the distance which a body will fall by gravity in 26 of a second be 1087 foot and a weight of 214 lb put into motion by gravity or by a pressure of 214 lb would therefore acquire a velocity of 1087 foot during the time one revolution of the screw be be perform the weight to be move however be 37 cubic foot of water that be the new water seize by the screw each revolution for every square foot of surface in the screw 's disc and 37 cubic foot of water weigh 2315 lb so that the urge force of 214 lb be somewhat less than the force of gravity and the velocity of motion communicate to the water will be somewhat under 1087 foot per revolution or we may say it will be in round number 1 foot per revolution this add to the progress of the vessel will make the distance advance by the screw through the water 47 foot per revolution leave the difference between this and the pitch namely 113 foot to be account for on the supposition that the screw blade have break laterally through the water to that extent it would be proper to apply some correction to this computation which would represent the increase resistance due to the immersion of the screw in the water for a column of water can not be move in the direction of its axis beneath the surface without give motion to the superincumbent water and the inertia of this superincumbent water must therefore be take into the account in the experiment upon the minx the depth of this superincumbent column be but small the total amount of the slip be 3653 per cent and there will not be much error in set down about one half of this as due to the recession of the water in the direction of the vessel 's track and the other half as due to the lateral penetration of the screw blade 601 _ q _ -- be it not important to make the stern of screw vessel very fine with the view of diminish the slip and increase the speed _ a _ -- it be most important the rifleman a vessel of 486 ton have originally engine of 200 horse power which propel she at a speed of 8 knot a hour the teazer a vessel of 296 ton have originally engine of 100 horse power which propel she at a speed of 6-1\/2 knot a hour the engine of the teazer be subsequently transfer to the rifleman and new engine of 40 horse power be put into the teazer both vessel be simultaneously sharpen at the stern and the result be that the 100 horse engine drive the rifleman when sharpen as fast as she have previously be drive by the 200 horse engine and the 40 horse engine drive the teazer when sharpen a knot a hour faster than she have previously be drive by the 100 horse engine the immersion of both vessel be keep unchanged in each case and the 100 horse engine of the teazer when transfer to the rifleman drive that vessel after she have be sharpen 2 knot a hour faster than they have previously drive a vessel not much more than half the size these be important fact for every one to be acquaint with who be interested in the success of screw vessel and who seek to obtain the maximum of efficiency with the minimum of expense -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- see treatise on the screw propeller by john bourne c e proportion of screw 602 _ q _ -- in fix upon the proportion of a screw proper to propel any give vessel how would you proceed _ a _ -- i would first compute the probable resistance of the vessel and i would be able to find the relative resistance of the screw and hull and in every case it be advisable to make the screw as large in diameter as possible the larger the screw be the greater will be the efficiency of the engine in propel the vessel the larger will be the ratio of the pitch to the diameter which produce a maximum effect and the smaller will be the length of the screw or the fraction of a convolution to produce a maximum effect 603 _ q _ -- will you illustrate this doctrine by a practical example _ a _ -- the french screw steamer pelican be fit successively with two screw of four blade but the diameter of the first screw be 9842 inch and the diameter of the second 54 inch if the efficiency of the first screw by represent by 1 that of the second screw will be represent by 823 or in other word if the first screw would give a speed of 10 knot the second would give little more than 8 the most advantageous ratio of pitch to diameter be find to be 22 in the case of the large screw and 1384 in the case of the small the fraction of a convolution which be find to be most advantageous be 281 in the case of the large screw and 450 in the case of the small screw 604 _ q _ -- be screw of four blade find to be more efficient than screw with two _ a _ -- they be find to have less slip but not to be more efficient the increase slip in those of two blade be balance by the increase friction in those of four screw of two blade to secure a maximum efficiency must have a finer pitch than screw of four 605 _ q _ -- be the proportion find to be most suitable in the case of the pelican applicable to the screw of other vessel _ a _ -- only to those which have the same relative resistance of screw and hull take the relative resistance to be the area of immerse midship section divide by the square of the screw 's diameter it will in the case of the rattler be 380\/100 or 38 from the experiment make by mm bourgoi and moll on the screw steamer pelican they have deduce the proportion of screw proper for all other class of vessel whether the screw be of two four or six blade 606 _ q _ -- will you specify the nature of they deduction _ a _ -- i will first enumerate those which bear upon screw with two blade when the relative resistance be 55 the ratio of pitch to diameter should be 1006 and the fraction of the pitch or proportion of one entire convolution should be 0454 when the relative resistance be 5 the ratio of pitch to diameter should be 1069 and fraction of pitch 0428 relative resistance 45 pitch 1135 fraction 0402

propeller i have go into these various question more fully than would consort with the limit of this publication screw vessel with full and auxiliary power 609 _ q _ -- do you consider that the screw propeller be best adapt for vessel of full power or for vessel with auxiliary power _ a _ -- it be in my opinion best adapt for vessel with auxiliary power and it be a worse propeller than paddle wheel for vessel which have habitually to encounter strong head wind screw vessel be but ill calculate -- at least as construct heretofore -- to encounter head wind and the legitimate sphere of the screw be in propel vessel with auxiliary power 610 _ q _ -- do the screw act well in conjunction with sail _ a _ -- i can not say it act better than paddle except in so far as it be less in the way and be less affect by the listing or heel over of the ship a small steam power however act very advantageously in aid of sail for not only do the operation of the sail in reduce the resistance of the hull virtually increase the screw 's diameter but the screw by reduce the resistance which have to be overcome by the sail and by increase the speed of the vessel enable the sail to act with greater efficiency as the wind will not rebind from they with as great a velocity as it would otherwise do and a larger proportion of the power of the wind will also be use up in the case of beam wind moreover the action of the screw by the larger advance it give to the vessel will enable the sail to intercept a larger column of wind in a give time it appear therefore that the sail add to the efficiency of the screw and that the screw also add to the efficiency of the sail 611 _ q _ -- what be the comparative cost of transport merchandise in paddle steamer of full power in screw steamer of auxiliary power and in sailing ship _ a _ -- that will depend very much upon the locality where the comparison be make in the case of vessel perform distant ocean voyage in which they may reckon upon the aid of uniform and constant wind such as the trade wind or the monsoon sailing ship of large size will be able to carry more cheaply than any other species of vessel but where the wind be irregular and there be not much sea room or for such circumstance as exist in the channel or mediterranean trade screw vessel with auxiliary power will constitute the cheapest instrument of conveyance 612 _ q _ -- be there any fact record illustrative of the accuracy of this conclusion _ a _ -- a full paddle vessel of 1000 ton burden and 350 horse power will carry about 400 ton of cargo besides coal for a voyage of 500 mile and the expense of such a voyage include wear and tear depreciation & c will be about 190_l _ the duration of the voyage will be about 45-1\/2 hour a screw vessel of 400 ton burden and 100 horse power will carry the same amount of cargo besides she coal on the same voyage and the expense of the voyage include wear and tear depreciation & c will be not much more than 60_l _ a auxiliary screw vessel therefore can carry merchandise at one third of the cost of a full-powered paddle vessel by similar comparison make between the expense of convey merchandise in auxiliary screw steamer and sailing ship on coast voyage it appear that the cost in screw steamer be about one third less than in the sailing ship the greater expedition of the screw steamer much more than compensate for the expense which the maintenance of the machinery involve screw and paddle combine 613 _ q _ -- would not a screw combine with paddle act in a similarly advantageous way as a screw or paddle when aid by the wind _ a _ -- if in any give paddle vessel a supplementary screw be add to increase she power and speed the screw will act in a more beneficial manner than if it have the whole vessel to propel itself and for a like reason the paddle will act in a more beneficial manner there will be less slip both upon the paddle and upon the screw than if either have be employ alone but the same object would be attain by give the vessel larger paddle or a larger screw 614 _ q _ -- have any vessel be construct with combined screw and paddle _ a _ -- not any that i know of except the great vessel build under the direction of mr brunel the bee many year since be fit with both screw and paddle but this be for the purpose of ascertain the relative efficiency of the two mode of propulsion and not for the purpose of use both together 615 _ q _ -- what would be the best means of accelerate the speed of a paddle vessel by the introduction of a supplementary screw _ a _ -- if the vessel require new boiler the best course of procedure would be to work a single engine give motion to the screw with high pressure steam and to let the waste steam from the high pressure engine work the paddle engine in this way the power might be double without any increase expenditure of fuel per hour and there would be a diminish expenditure per voyage in the proportion of the increase speed 616 _ q _ -- what would the increase speed be by double the power _ a _ -- the increase would be in the proportion of the cube root of 1 to the cube root of 2 or it would be 125 time greater if therefore the exist speed be 10 mile it would be increase to 12-1\/2 mile by double the power and the vessel would ply with about a fourth less coal by increase the power in the manner suggest 617 _ q _ -- be not high pressure steam dangerous in steam vessel _ a _ -- not necessarily so and it have now be introduce into a good number of steam vessel with satisfactory result in the case of locomotive engine where it be use so widely very few accident have occur and in steam vessel the only additional source of danger be the salting of the boiler this may be prevent either by the use of fresh water in the boiler or by practise a larger amount of blow off to insure which it should be impossible to diminish the amount of water send into the boiler by the feed pump and the excess should be discharge overboard through a valve near the water level of the boiler which valve be govern by a float that will rise or fall with the fluctuating level of the water if the float be a copper ball a little water should be introduce into it before it be solder or braze up which will insure a equality of pressure within and without the ball and a leakage of water into it will then be less likely to take place a stone float however be cheaper and if properly balance will be equally effective all steam vessel should have a large excess of boil feed water constantly flow into the boiler and a large quantity of water constantly blow off through the surface valve which be govern by float will open and let the superfluous water escape whenever the water level rise too high in this way the boiler will be keep from salt and priming will be much less likely to occur the great problem of steam navigation be the economy of fuel since the quantity of fuel consume by a vessel will very much determine whether she be profitable or otherwise notwithstanding the momentous nature of this condition however the consumption of fuel in steam vessel be a point to which very little attention have be pay and no efficient means have yet be adopt in steam vessel to insure that measure of economy which be know to be attainable and which have be attain already in other department of engineering in which the benefit of such economy be of less weighty import it need nothing more than the establishment of a efficient system of registration in steam vessel to insure a large and rapid economy in the consumption of fuel as this quality would then become the test of a engineer 's proficiency and would determine the measure of he fame in the case of the cornish engine a saving of more than half the fuel be speedily effect by the introduction of the simple expedient of registration in agricultural engine a like economy have speedily follow from a like arrangement yet in both of these case the benefit of a large saving be less eminent than they would be in the case of steam navigation and it be to be hope that this expedient of improvement will now be speedily adopt chapter x

burden this engine be a single steeple engine lay on its side and in its general feature it resemble the engine of the amphion already describe only that there be one cylinder instead of two the cylinder be of 42 inch diameter and 42 inch stroke and the vessel have be propel by this single engine at the rate of fourteen mile a hour 641 _ q _ -- be not a single engine liable to stick upon the center so that it can not be start or reverse with facility _ a _ -- a single engine be no doubt more liable to stick upon the center than two engine the crank of which be set at right angle with one another but numerous paddle vessel be ply successfully that be propel by a single engine and the screw offer still greater facility than paddle for such a mode of construction in the screw engine refer to as the cylinder be lay upon its side there be no unbalanced weight to be lift up every stroke and the crank whereby the screw shaft be turn round consist of two disc with a heavy side intend to balance the momentum of the piston and its connection but these counter-weight by they gravitation also prevent the connect rod and crank from continue in the same line when the engine be stop and in fact they place the crank in the most advantageous position for start again when it have to be set on 642 _ q _ -- will you explain the general arrangement of the part of this engine _ a _ -- the cylinder lie on its side near one side of the vessel and from the end of the cylinder two piston rod extend to a cross head slide athwartship in guide near the other side of the vessel to this cross head the connect rod be attach and one end of it partake of the motion of the cross head or piston while the other end be free to follow the revolution of the crank on the screw shaft 643 _ q _ -- what be the advantage of two disc enter into the composition of the crank instead of one _ a _ -- a double crank such as two disc form with the crank pin be a much steadier combination than would result if only one disc be employ with a over-hung pin then the friction on the neck of the shaft be make one half less by be divide between the two bearing and the short prolongation of the shaft beyond the journal be convenient for the attachment of the eccentric to work the valve 644 _ q _ -- will you enumerate some of the principal dimension of this engine _ a _ -- the bottom frame on which

inch long and to relieve the valve from the great friction due to the pressure on so large a surface a balance piston be place over the back of the valve to which it be connect by a strong link and the upward pressure on this piston be nearly the same as the downward pressure on the valve it follow that the friction be extinguish and the valve can be move with great case with one hand the balance piston be 21 inch in diameter in the original construction of this balance piston two fault be commit the passage communicate between the condenser and the top of the balance piston be too small and the pin at the end of the link connect the valve and balance piston be form with a inadequate amount of bear surface it follow from this misproportion that the balance piston be adjust to take off nearly the whole of the pressure lift the valve off the face at the beginning of each stroke for the escape of the steam into the eduction passage momentarily impair the vacuum subsist there and owe to the smallness of the passage lead to the space above the balance piston the vacuum subsist in that space could not be impair with equal rapidity the balance piston therefore rise by the upward pressure upon it momentarily predominate over the downward pressure on the valve but this fault be correct by enlarge the communicate passage between the top of the balance piston and the eduction pipe the smallness of the pin at the end of the link connect the valve and balance piston cause the surface to cut into one another and to wear very rapidly and the pin and eye in this situation should be large in diameter and as long as they can be get as they be not so easily lubricate as the other bearing about the engine and be moreover keep at a high temperature by the steam the balance piston be pack in the same way as the main piston of the engine its cylinder which be only a few inch in length be set on the top of the valve casing and a trunk project upward from its

diameter a good deal of trouble have be experience in locomotive from the defective action of the feed pump partly cause by the leakage of steam into the pump which prevent the water from enter they and partly from the return of a large part of the water through the valve at the return stroke of the pump in consequence of the valve lifting too high the pet cock -- a small cock communicate with the interior of the pump -- will allow any steam to escape which gain admission and the air which enter by the cock cool down the barrel of the pump so that in a short time it will be in a condition to draw the most ordinary species of valve in the feed pump of locomotive be the ball valve notwithstanding the excellent performance of the best example of locomotive engine it be quite certain that there be still much room for improvement and indeed various source of economy be at present visible which if properly develop would materially reduce the expense of the locomotive power in all engine the great source of expense be the fuel and although the consumption of fuel have be greatly reduce within the last ten or fifteen year it be capable of be still further reduce by certain easy expedient of improvement which therefore it be important should be universally apply one of these expedient consist in heat the feed water by the waste steam and the feed water should in every case be send into the boiler _ boil hot _ instead of be quite cold as be at present generally the case the port of the cylinder should be as large as possible the expansion of the steam should be carry to a greater extent and in the case of engine with outside cylinder the waste steam should circulate entirely round the cylinder before escape by the blast pipe the escape of heat from the boiler should be more carefully prevent and the engine should be balance by weight on the wheel to obviate a waste of power by yaw on the rail the most important expedient of all however lie in the establishment of a system of register the performance of all new engine in order that competition may stimulate the different constructor to the attainment of the utmost possible economy and under the stimulus of comparison and notoriety a large measure of improvement would speedily ensue the benefit consequent on public competition be abundantly illustrate by the rapid diminution of the consumption of fuel in

value as model form rather in fact a illustrated catalogue of the manufacturer than a study for the mechanic on this account they have be entirely omit and they place supply by a few illustration from american workmanship not only of steam engine of various form and application but also of various machine or appliance connect with the working of engine as for the determination or regulation of pressure of the boiler for the supply or feed of the boiler the regulation of the speed of the engine and the like the gauge use in this country to show the pressure of steam in boiler be of various construction but perhaps the most common be the bourdon or as it be know here the ashcroft gauge from the party introduce it and hold the patent fig 59 represent its interior construction it consist of a thin metallic tube _ a _ bent into nearly a complete circle close at one end the steam be introduce at the other at _ b _ the effect of the pressure of the steam on the interior of the tube be to expand the circle more or less accord to the pressure the elasticity of the metal return the circle to its original position when the pressure be remove the free or closed end of the tube be connect by a link _ c _ with a lever _ d _ at the opposite end of which be segmental gear in gear with a pinion on which be a hand which mark the pressure on a dial the dial and hand be not show on the cut but be on the exterior case remove to show the construction -lrb- illustration : fig 59 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 60 -rrb- fig 60 be a elevation of a boiler with clark 's patent steam and fire regulator attach for the control of the draft of the chimney by the pressure of steam in the boiler it consist of a chamber _ a _ with a flexible diaphragm or cover on top in communication with the boiler on this diaphragm rest a plunger or piston which be hold down like a safety valve by a lever and weight _ b _ the end of the lever be connect with a balanced damper _ c _ in the chimney the weight _ b _ be place at any require position on the lever and when the pressure of steam in the boiler exert on the diaphragm become sufficient to raise the weight the lever rise and the damper begin to close and to check the draft in the chimney when properly adjust the machine work on a variation of from one to two pound between the extreme of motion when the damper be very large say 3 foot or over they should be set on roller like common grindstone roller the regulator should be attach directly to the damper the length of the pipe connect the regulator with the boiler being of no account -lrb- illustration : fig 61 -rrb- porter 's patent governor fig 61 be a modification of the ordinary centrifugal governor very small ball be employ from 2-1\/4 to 2-5\/8 inch in diameter these swing from a single joint at the axis of the spindle which be the most sensitive arrangement and make from 300 to 350 revolution per minute at which speed they centrifugal force lift the counterpoise the lower arm be joint to the upper one at the centre of the ball and connect with the slide by joint about two inch apart the counterpoise may be attach to the slide in any manner for the sake of elegance it be put in the form of a vase rise between the arm its stem form the slide the vase be hollow and fill with lead and weigh from 60 lb to 175 lb it move freely on the spindle through nearly twice the vertical distance traverse by the ball and be capable of rise from 2-1\/2 to 3 inch before its rim will touch the arm it be represent in the figure as lift through about one half of its range of action the standard be bore out of the solid form a long and perfect bearing for the spindle the arm and ball be of gun metal the joint pin of steel every part of the governor be finish bright except the bracket carry the lever and the square base of the standard which be paint the pulley be from 3 to 10 inch in diameter and make in the larger size about 125 revolution and in the smaller 230 revolution per minute the higher speed of the governor be get up by gear mr porter warrant the follow action in this governor operate any regulate valve or cut-off which be in reasonably good order the engine should be run with the stop-valve wide open and except the usual oiling will require no attention from the engineer under any circumstance after it be start until it be to be stop no increase in the pressure of steam will affect its motion perceptibly the extreme possible variation in the speed between that at which the regulate valve will be hold wide open and that at which it will be close be from 3 to 5 per cent be least in the largest governor this be less than 1\/6 of the variation require by the average of ordinary governor and be with difficulty detect by the sens the entire load which the engine be capable of drive may be throw on or off at once and one watch the revolution can not tell when it be do the governor will be sensibly affect by a variation in the motion of the engine of 1 revolution in 800 notwithstanding this extreme sensitiveness or rather by reason of it it will not oscillate but when the load be uniform will stand quite or nearly motionless for the supply of the water to the boiler in many position it be very convenient to have a pump unconnected with the engine on this account it be very usual in this country to have what be call donkey pump or engine independent of the main engine which can be use to feed the boiler or for supply water for many other purpose fig 62 be a longitudinal section of the worthington steam pump the first of its kind and for many year in successful operation the general arrangement be that of a steam cylinder the piston rod of which carry through into the water cylinder and attach directly to the water plunger work back and forth without rotary motion and of course without use either crank or fly wheel -lrb- illustration : fig 62 -rrb- in the figure _ a _ be the steam cylinder -- _ b _ the

access to the water valve _ n n _ small hole through the plunger which relieve the pressure near the end of the stroke to give momentum to throw the valve when work at slow speed -lrb- illustration : fig 63 -rrb- fig 63 be a perspective view of hr worthington 's duplex steam pump the prominent peculiarity of this pump be its valve motion as see in the cut two steam pump be place side by side -lrb- or end to end if desire -rrb- each pump by a rock shaft connect with its piston rod give a constant and easy motion to the steam valve of the other each pump therefore give steam to and start its neighbor and then finish its own stroke pause a instant till its own steam valve be open by the other pump allow it to make the return stroke this combined action produce a perfectly positive valve motion without dead point great regularity and ease of motion and entire absence of noise or shock of any kind both kind of pump be make by mr worthington of various size accord to the requirement the duplex be use for boiler feed and for the supply of city with water fig 64 be a side elevation of the woodward steam pump the pump be direct act the steam and water piston be on the same rod but momentum be obtain to throw the valve by means of a fly wheel place beyond the pump and connect with the piston rod by a cross head and a yoke the machine be simple in its construction and action and be extensively use giffard 's injector both in europe and this country be quite extensively use to supply the place of a pump as independent feed for all class of boiler it be represent in elevation

handle which will admit a small quantity of steam to the apparatus a partial vacuum be thus produce cause the water to enter through the supply pipe as soon as this happen which can be observe at the overflow pipe the supply of steam or water may be increase as require up to the capacity of the instrument regulate either by means of the wheel and handle so as to prevent any overflow the quantity of water deliver into the boiler may be vary by means of the stop cock on the steam and water pipe without alter the handle on the injector a graduate cock on the water supply pipe be very convenient for this purpose the machine be manufacture by wm seller & co philadelphium as a example of portable steam engine of which there be large number in this country of different manufacturer we give the representation -lrb- fig 67 -rrb- of one make by jc hoadley of lawrence mass -lrb- illustration : fig 67 -rrb- in these machine the rule and proportion of the locomotive engine be adapt to the requirement of stationary power for all purpose under forty horse power the lead idea be : high velocity high pressure good valve motion large fire-box numerous and short flue and steam blast the characteristic feature be : great strength of boiler fully adequate to bear with safety 200 lb pressure per sq in great compactness and simplicity large and adjustable wear surface and the entire absence of all finish or polish for mere show the cylinder be place over the center of the boiler at the fire-box end so that the strain due to the engine be central to the boiler -lrb- which serve as bed plate -rrb- the start valve be under the hand of the engineer when at the fire door and both end of the crank shaft be available for drive pulley for the sake of compactness the cylinder be set low by means of a depression in the boiler between the stand of the crank shaft to admit of the play of the crank and connect rod all the part be attach to the boiler which be make of sufficient strength to bear all extra strain due to the working of the engine they have feed water heater force pump jackson 's governor and valve belt for governor belt pulley turn on the face steam gauge everything in short necessary to the convenient working of a steam engine all engine be fire up and try before they leave the shop and they be warrant tight safe and complete a strong and convenient run gear so arrange as to be easily attach and detach at pleasure be furnish if desire form when separate a useful wagon -lrb- illustration : fig 68 -rrb- fig 68 be a compact vertical engine as build by r hoe & co of this city it be intend to drive printing press but be adapt to any kind of work and be especially suit to such place as require economy of space although the value of expansion have be call in question by some of the engineer of the united state navy and under a appropriation from congress be now to be make the subject of experiment yet in almost all the manufactory and workshop of the united state no matter what the form of steam engine or the purpose to which it be apply whether stationary locomotive or marine some form of cut-off by which expansion of the steam can be avail of be consider indispensable many variety be in use but those engine be most popular in which the cut-off be apply directly to the valve on the cylinder open they quickly and shut off almost instantly avoid all wire drawing of the steam at the port and regulate the speed of the engine promptly of this class of engine those manufacture by the corliss steam engine company of providence rus be perhaps the widest know not only for they extensive introduction but also from have by a long and successful litigation establish the claim of the patentee mr george h corliss -lrb- illustration : fig 70 -rrb- fig 70 be a section of the cylinder and valve chest of a horizontal corliss engine _ s _ be the steam connection and _ e _ the exhaust there be two distinct set of valve the steam _ s s ' _ and the exhaust _ e e ' _ operate independently of each other in they construction the valve may be consider cylindrical plug of which portion near the port be cut away to admit the steam and reduce the bearing surface the valve be fit on the lathe and the seat by bore the motion give to the valve be rock but it will be observe that the valve be not firmly connect to the rock shaft or cylinder in the figure the valve be show shade line and the shaft or stem plain in this way the valve be not affect by the packing of the valve stem but always rest upon the face of the port in the figure the piston be just about to commence its outstroke the movement of the steam be suppose to be represent by the arrow the inner steam valve _ s _ and the outer exhaust _ e ' _ be just begin to open it will be observe that the outer steam _ s ' _ be fully close whilst the inner exhaust valve _ e _ be but barely so show that there have be a cut-off on the steam valve but no lead to the exhaust that it be leave fully open till the completion of the stroke -lrb- illustration : fig 71 -rrb- fig 71 be a side elevation of the cylinder with the valve connection with the governor _ s _ be the steam pipe _ s s ' _ handle to the steam valve and _ e e ' _ to the exhaust valve show in dot line in fig 70 the handle to the exhaust valve be connect directly to a rock plate _ r _ to which motion be give by a connection _ x _ with a eccentric on the engine shaft when once set therefore the movement of the exhaust valve be constant and they will always be open and close at the same point of the stroke connect with the rock plate _ r _ and on opposite side of its center the same as the exhaust valve connection there be two lever vibrate on a center _ c _ of which one only be show as it cover the other to the upper end of these lever pawl be attach one end of which rest on the stem or rod connect with the handle _ s s ' _ of the steam valve on these stem there be notch against which the pawl strike and as the lever vibrate inward they push back the stem and thereby open the valve and this continue for the whole length of the inward motion of the lever or till the outer extremity of the pawl come in contact with the end of the short lever _ l _ which push down the outer end of the pawl relieve the stem at the other end and the valve stem return to its place through the force of spring attach to the outer extremity of the valve stem _ a _ be cylindrical guide to the valve stem at the inner extremity of which be air cushion the lever _ l _ be connect directly with the governor as the ball rise they depress the extremity which come in contact with the pawl sooner and thereby shut the valve earlier and on the contrary when the ball be depress the valve remain open longer as the pawl come in contact with the stem always at one point the steam valve open constantly but be close at any point by the relief of the pawl accord to the speed of the governor fig 71 represent partly in section and partly in plan the cylinder steam chest valve & c of one of the woodruff & beach high pressure engine wright 's patent fig 72 represent in elevation the cam shaft to the upper end of which not show in the drawing be attach the ordinary centrifugal governor the cylinder steam chest valve & c be similar to those of other engine need no special notice but the cam for opening and close the steam valve fig 72 require particular attention as it embody a beautiful and simple device for cut off the steam with certainty at any part of the stroke the motion be produce automatically by the action of the governor on this cam throw it more or less out of center with the spindle of the governor as the rotation of the ball be less or more rapid the eccentricity of the cam determine the amount of steam admit to the work cylinder of the engine to produce this effect the cam be make as follow : _ c _ be a hollow cylinder or shell with a part of one end form into a cam proper throughout the whole length of this piece upon the inside there be a spiral groove cut to receive one end of a feather by which its pitch or eccentricity be regulate _ c ' _ be also a hollow cylinder or shell of the same length and diameter as _ c _ with a similar spiral groove cut on the inside the outside be perfectly smooth and plain upon which the toe -lrb- _ t _ -rrb- for close the valve be fasten the inside piece consist of two hub _ d d' _ eccentric with each other and make in one piece _ d _ be turn to exactly fit the inside of the shell _ c _ and _ d' _ to fit the shell _ c ' _ the hub _ d' _ have a socket -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- into which the spindle -lrb- _ s _ -rrb- of the governor be screw the end -lrb- _ d _ -rrb- of the hub _ d _ form a journal or bearing with a bevel wheel on its extremity to convey motion from the crank-shaft gear to the governor and cut-off there be a hole throughout the length of the inside hub _ d _ and _ d' _ which be continue through the spindle of the governor and contain the rod -lrb- _ r _ -rrb- that connect the cam with the governor this hole be eccentric to the outside surface of the hub _ d _ as well as to the shell _ c _ and concentric with the hub _ d' _ and shell _ c ' _ and with the governor rod -lrb- _ r _ -rrb- the shell _ c _ and hub _ d _ and shell _ c ' _ and hub _ d' _ be connect together by feather one piece of each feather be of a spiral form and the other a straight or rectangular piece the two be connect together by a stub on the rectangular piece which fit into a hole or bearing in the other or spiral piece so that the latter can turn on the stub and accommodate itself to the groove in which it have to work the spiral part of each feather work in the spiral groove on the inside of its corresponding shell _ c _ and _ c ' _ respectively and the rectangular piece work in a straight groove cut in the hub _ d _ and _ d' _ the inner part of the rectangular piece be fasten to the governor rod -lrb- _ r _ -rrb- so that the feather be permanently connect with the governor the shell _ c ' _ revolve inside of two yoke -lrb- _ y _ -rrb- and -lrb- _ y ' _ -rrb- one attach to each steam-valve toe -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- and -lrb- _ a ' _ -rrb- respectively on the inside of each yoke and opposite to its valve-toe be a raise piece against which the closing piece -lrb- _ t _ -rrb- on the shell -lrb- _ c ' _ -rrb- act to close the valve this shell -lrb- _ c ' _ -rrb- as before notice have a spiral groove on its inside similar in all respects to that in the cam-shell -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- and be act upon in the same manner and through the same rod by the governor it be evident that the closing piece -lrb- _ t _ -rrb- on its outside will always hold the same relation to the opening toe on the lower or cam-shell -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- and whatever alteration be make in the one a corresponding alteration take place in the other thereby insure the closing of the valve at the proper time at every point of the variation of the cut-off when the several piece above describe be put together the apparatus for opening and close the valve and produce the cut-off be complete as show in fig 72 and it operate as follow : -lrb- illustration : fig 71 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 72 -rrb- motion be communicate by gear from the crank-shaft to the bevel wheel on the piece -lrb- _ d _ -rrb- on the end of the hub _ d _ and be communicate to the spindle of the governor which be screw into the socket on _ d' _ as the ball rise or fall through change of centrifugal force due to the variation in the speed of rotation they raise or depress the governor-rod which pass through the spindle and the hub _ d' _ and _ d _ and be attach to the feather thereby raise or depress the feather which act on they respective spiral groove instantly alter the lift of the cam on the shell -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- and bring the closing toe -lrb- _ t _ -rrb- on the shell -lrb- _ c ' _ -rrb- into proper position for closing and so regulate the amount of steam admit to the cylinder -lrb- illustration : fig 71 -rrb- consequently any speed may be select at which the load of the engine be to move and any variation from that will be instantly feel by the governor and correct by this simple and beautiful device there be no jar in the working of the part the feather move noiselessly in they groove the governor rod move up and down through the spindle and the hub _ d _ and _ d' _ and can be regulate by hand to give any require opening of the steam port to suit the work to be do any change in the amount of work will then alter the speed of the engine and so affect the governor and cam as before say it be unnecessary to insist on the great economy attain by use steam with a well-regulated cut-off for practical man know now that the essential point of excellence in the steam engine be a good boiler which generate the greatest quantity of steam for the least consumption of fuel and secondly a reliable cut-off which use the steam to the best advantage by admit the proper quantity for the work require steam fire engine -- portable engine for the extinguishment of fire be a american invention and to messr ab & e latta of cincinnatus work on the right principle be due the credit which they claim in they circular as follow : we claim to be the _ original _ and first _ projector _ of the _ first successful steam fire engine _ in the world 's history there have be many attempt at make a machine of such construction as would answer to extinguish fire but none of they prove to be available in a sufficiently short space of time to warrant they use as a fire apparatus we hold that a steam fire engine should be of such nature as to be bring into requisition in as short a space of time as be necessary to get the machine on the ground and the hose lay and ready to work : that be suppose the fire to be within one square of the place where the steamer be located the object in locate a machine at any point be to protect that immediate vicinity and it be therefore absolutely necessary to have it available in the shortest space of time and that with unerring certainty we think that reliability be of the greatest importance to the protection of a city from fire as everything be dependent on the _ work _ of such apparatus in time and for this reason no expense should be spare on this kind of machinery fig 73 be a representation of one of the messr latta 's fire engine of which there be many of different class accord to the requirement they say that they can furnish engine as low as $ 1000 and have make some for $ 10000 the first peculiar feature of this engine be the boiler it differ entirely from all boiler now in use -lrb- illustration : fig 73 -rrb- the fire box or furnace be simply a square box or furnace of any require dimension it be nothing more than a water space surround the fire stay-bolted as all water space be it be make of boiler plate in the usual manner the water space extend only 2\/3 of the height the balance be a single sheet the bottom of this fire box be cross by grate bar to support the fuel in its rear side be fire door insert for firing the internal arrangement of the boiler be compose of a large number of tube lie across in a horizontal position put together in section with return bend resemble the coil for heating building these coil be of small pipe -lrb- say one inch in diameter -rrb- and as numerous as may be necessary they give the require amount of steam they be secure to wrought-iron plate at each end by rivet these plate lie close to the box and be secure to it top and bottom these tube be work iron firmly screw into the bend so as to prevent any possible break the box have a hole through both sheet in the same manner as a hollow stay-bolt through which the coil pipe pass have no connection with the box after pass into the box it divide into two pipe then subdivide into four and so on until its number equal the number of coil in the box and to which each limb be attach the upper end of these coil be the same in number and be carry through at the top or nearly the top of the box they then run down outside to the steam chamber or rather water space as the box be both steam chamber and water space these pipe empty they contents into the box steam and water as it may come all together it will be observe that these coil of tube be sufficiently separate to allow the fire to pass between they freely and cover they whole surface the mode of operation of this boiler be this : the fire box be fill 2\/3 full of water the coil be dry at start the space for fuel be fill with good wood the fire be light and in a few moment the engineer move he hand pump which take its water from the box to which it be attach and force it through the coil by this mean steam be generate in from 3 to 5 minute so as to start the engine it will be see that the water perform a complete circuit it be take from the box and pass through the coil what be steam remain in the steam chamber and what be not -lrb- if any -rrb- drop back into the box from where it start hence it will be see that a large surface be expose to a small quantity of water and in a way that it be entirely controllable all the engineer have to do to surcharge he steam be to reduce the speed of the pump -lrb- which be independent of the main engine -rrb- by raise the heat and quantity of water any degree of elasticity can be give to the steam and that too with the least amount of waste heat in give a natural draft hence the great economy of this boiler the next feature of this engine be it have no wood work about it to perish with the heat and roughness of the street all the wheel be work iron and as yet these be the only one that have stand a steam fire engine the frame be work iron truck on which the front wheel be hung work iron the axle be cast steel the engine and pump be a double-acting piston pump direct without any rotary motion with a perfect balance valve it be balance at all time and hence the engine remain quiet without block when at work the engine be mount on three wheel which enable it to be turn in a very short space many engine have be construct by the messr latta for the fire company of different city and have be in successful competition with other engine the farthest throw ever make by one of they first-class engine be 310 foot from a 1-5\/8 inch nozzle steam time start from cold water 3-1\/2 minute -lrb- illustration : fig 74 amoskeag steam fire engine -rrb- fig 74 be a representation of one class of steam fire engine as build by the amoskeag manufacture company at manchester nh the boiler be a upright tubular boiler of a peculiar construction the patent right to which be vest in the amoskeag manufacture company this boiler be very simple in its combination and for safety strength durability and capacity for generate steam be unsurpassed no fan or artificial blower be ever use or need the natural draft of the boiler be always sufficient start with cold water in the boiler a work head of steam can be generate in _ less than five minute _ from the time of kindle the fire the engine amoskeag own by the city of manchester have play two stream in _ three minute and forty seconds _ after touch the match at the same time draw she own water the boiler be make and prove so as to be safely run at a steam pressure of 140 to 150 lb to the square inch but the engine be construct so as to give the best stream at a pressure of about 100 lb to the square inch and for service at fire a steam pressure of about 60 lb to the square inch be all that be require the various style of engine be all _ vertical _ in they action and in all the pump and steam cylinder be firmly and directly fasten to the boiler the steam cylinder be attach directly to the steam dome this arrangement obviate the necessity of carry steam to the cylinder through pipe of considerable length and the machine have very little vibratory motion when in operation -- so little that it be not necessary to block its wheel to keep it in its place or to take the weight off the spring before commence work the pump be place on the engine as near the ground as they can be with safety and be arrange so as to attach the suction and lead hose to either or both side of the machine as may be most convenient or desirable so that less difficulty will be find in place a engine for work and when require to draw its own water it have only to draw it the shortest possible distance each engine have two feed pump for supply the boiler and also a connection between the main force pump and the boiler so that it can be supply from that source if desirable the tank which carry the water for supply the boiler be so place that the water in it be always above the feed pump a advantage that insure the almost certain working of these pump these pump be of brass the best locomotive pattern and one of they run with the engine when at work furnish a ample supply of water to the boiler -lrb- illustration : fig 75 -rrb- the engine be exceedingly portable they can be turn about or place for service in as contract a space as any hand engine and two good horse will draw a first-class engine with the greatest ease carry at the same time water for the boiler a supply of fuel sufficient to run the engine two hour the driver the engineer and the fireman fig 75 be a representation of the class of steam fire engine build by silsbee mynderse & co seneca fall n y under holly 's patent the boiler be vertical with vertical water tube pass directly through the fire these tube be close at the bottom and open at the top where they pass through a water-tight plate and communicate with the water in the boiler the arrangement of the tube cause a constant current the water rise on the outside of the tube as they be heated and its place be supply by a current flow downward through the tube to the boiler the smoke and flame pass among the tube up through flue both engine and pump be rotary and of the same type they consist essentially of two elliptical rotary piston cogg and work into one another in a air-tight case the piston fit close to the inside of the case and gear into each on the line of they conjugate diameter the action be somewhat similar to the old-fashioned rotary pump consist of two cog wheel in gear with each other the space at the side of the case be fill with water which at the center be occupy by the tooth in gear in holly 's pump instead of uniform tooth and depend on the fit of the tooth with the side of the case and with each other for the packing there be two large tooth in each piston opposite each other which have slide piston and intermediate with these large tooth be small cog which continue the motion of the rotary piston the machine work very smoothly and perform the work necessary in ordinary service under a pressure of 50 to 60 lb there be many other maker of fire engine in this country but sufficient example be give to illustrate the class so successful have they be that they be fast supersede hand engine even in the smaller city under a pay department the follow be in the city of boston mass the comparative cost of run the two kind of engine viz : steam fire engine 1 engineer $ 720 00 1 fireman 600 00 1 driver 600 00 1 foreman of hose 150 00 8 hoseman

bucket full of dredge per minute from a depth of 30 foot below the water or lift 10 bucket full of mud per minute from a depth of 18 foot below the water chapter xii manufacture and management of steam engine construction of engine 700 _ q _ -- what be the quality which should be possess by the iron of which the cylinder of steam engine be make _ a _ -- the general ambition in make cylinder be to make they sound and hard but it be expedient also to make they tough so as to approach as nearly as possible to the state of malleable iron this may be do by mix in the furnace as many different kind of iron as possible and it may be set down as a general rule in iron founding that the greater the number of the kind of metal enter into the composition of any cast the denser and tougher it will be the constituent atom of the different kind of iron appear to be of different size and the mixture of different kind maintain the toughness while it add to the density and cohesive power hot blast iron be at one time generally believe to be weaker than cold blast iron but it be now question whether it be not the stronger of the two the cohesive strength of unmixed iron be not in proportion to its specific gravity and its elasticity and power to resist shock appear to become greater as the specific gravity become less no 3 and 4 be the strongest iron in most case iron melt in a cupola be not so strong as when remelt in a air furnace and when run into green sand it be not reckon so strong as when run into dry sand or loam the quality of the fuel and even the state of the weather exert a influence on the quality of the iron : smelting furnace on the cold blast principle have long be know to yield better iron in winter than in summer probably from the existence of less moisture in the air and it would probably be find to accomplish a improvement in the quality of the iron if the blast be make to pass through a vessel contain muriate of lime by which the moisture of the air would be extract the expense of such a preparation would not be considerable as by subsequent evaporation the salt might be use over and over again for the same purpose 701 _ q _ -- will you explain the process of cast cylinder _ a _ -- the mould into which the metal be pour be build up of brick and loam the loam be clay and sand ground together in a mill with the addition of a little horse-dung to give it a fibrous structure and prevent crack the loam board by which the circle of the cylinder be to be sweep be attach to a upright iron bar at the distance of the radius of the cylinder and a cylindrical shell of brick be build up which be plaster on the inside with loam and make quite smooth by traverse the perpendicular loam board round it a core be then form in a similar manner but so much smaller as to leave a space between the shell and the core equal to the thickness of the cylinder and into this space the melt metal be pour whatever nozzle or projection be require upon the cylinder must be form by means of wooden pattern which be build into the shell and subsequently withdraw but where a number of cylinder of the same kind be require it be advisable to make these pattern of iron which will not be liable to warp or twist while the loam be be dry before the iron be cast into the mould the interior of the mould must be cover with finely powdered charcoal -- or blacken as it be technically term and the secret of make finely skin casting lie in use plenty of blacken in loam and dry sand casting the charcoal should be mix with thick clay water and apply until it be a eighth of a inch thick or more the surface should be then very carefully smooth or sleek and if the metal have be judiciously mixed and the mould thoroughly dry the casting be sure to be a fine one dry sand and loam casting should be as much as possible make in box the mould may thereby be more rapidly and more effectually dry and better casting will be get with a less expense 702 _ q _ -- will you explain the next operation which a cylinder undergo _ a _ -- the next stage be the boring and in boring cylinder of 74 inch diameter the boring bar must move so as to make one revolution in about 4-1\/2 minute at which speed the cutter will move at the rate of about 5 foot per minute in boring brass the speed must be slower the common rate at which the tool move in boring brass air pump be about 3 foot per minute if this speed be materially exceed the tool will be spoil and the pump make taper the speed proper for bore a cylinder will answer for bore the brass air pump of the same engine a brass air pump of 36-1\/2 inch diameter require the bar to make one turn in about three minute which be also the speed proper for a cylinder 60 inch in diameter to bear a brass air pump 36-1\/2 inch in diameter require a week a iron one require 48 hour and a copper one 24 hour in turn a malleable iron shaft 12-3\/4 inch in diameter the shaft should make about five turn per minute which be equivalent to a speed in the tool of about 16 foot per minute but this speed may be exceed if soap and water be plentifully run on the point of the tool a boring mill of which the speed may be vary from one turn in six minute to twenty-five turn in one minute will be suitable for all ordinary want that can occur in practice 703 _ q _ -- be there any precaution necessary to be observe in order that the boring may be truly effect _ a _ -- in fix a cylinder into the boring mill great care must be take that it be not screw down unequally and indeed it will be impossible to bear a large cylinder in a horizontal mill without be oval unless the cylinder be carefully gauge when stand on end and be set up by screw when lay in the mill until it again assume its original form a large cylinder will inevitably become oval if lay upon its side and if while under the tension due to its own weight it be bore round it will become oval again when set upon end if the bottom be cast in the cylinder will be probably find to be round at one end and oval at the other unless a vertical boring mill be employ or the precaution here suggest be adopt 704 _ q _ -- do the boring tool make the cylinder sufficiently smooth for the reception of the piston _ a _ -- many engine maker give no other finish to they cylinder but messr penn grind they cylinder after they be bore by lay they on they side and rub a piece of lead with a cross iron handle like that of a rolling stone and smear with emery and oil backward and forward -- the cylinder be gradually turn round so as to subject every part successively to the operation the lead by which this grind be accomplish be cast in the cylinder whereby it be form of the right curve but the part of the cylinder in which it be cast should be previously heat by a hot iron else the metal may be crack by the sudden heat 705 _ q _ -- how be the part of a piston fit together so as to be perfectly steam tight _ a _ -- the old practice be to depend chiefly upon grind as the means of make the ring tight upon the piston or upon one another but scrape be now chiefly rely on some maker however finish they steam surface by grind they with powdered turkey stone and oil a slight grind or polish with powdered turkey stone and oil appear to be expedient in ordinary case and may be conveniently accomplish by set the piston on a revolving table and hold the ring stationary by a cross piece of wood while the table turn round piece of wood may be interpose between the ring and the body of the piston to keep the ring nearly in its right position but these piece of wood should be fit so loosely as to give some side play else the disposition would arise to wear the flange of the piston into a groove 706 _ q _ -- what kind of tool be use for finish surface by scrape _ a _ -- a flat file bent and sharpen at the end make a eligible scraper for the first stage or a flat file sharpen at the end and use like a chisel for wood a three-cornered file sharpen at all the corner be the best instrument for finish the operation the scrape tool should be of the best steel and should be carefully sharpen at short interval on a turkey stone so as to maintain a fine edge 707 _ q _ -- will you explain the method of fitting together the valve and cylinder face _ a _ -- both face must first be plane then file accord to the indication of a metallic straight edge and subsequently of a thick metallic face plate and finally scrape very carefully until the face plate bear equally all over the surface in plane any surface the catch which retain the surface on the plane machine should be relax previously to the last cut to obviate distortion from spring to ascertain whether the face plate bear equally smear it over with a little red ochre and oil and move the face plate slightly which will fix the color upon the prominent point this operation be to be repeat frequently and as the work advance the quantity of color matter be to be diminish until finally it be spread over the face plate in a thin film which only dim the brightness of the plate the surface at this stage must be rub firmly together to make the point of contact visible and the higher point will become slightly cloud while the other part be leave more or less in shade if too small a quantity of color matter be use at first it will be difficult to form a just conception of the general state of the surface as the prominent point will alone be indicate whereas the use of a large quantity of color matter in the latter stage would destroy the delicacy of the test the face plate afford the number of bear point which it be desirable to establish on the surface of the work depend on the use to which the surface be to be apply but whether it be to be finish with great elaboration or otherwise the bearing point should be distribute equally over the surface face plate or planometer as they be sometimes term be supply by most of the maker of engineering tool every factory should be abundantly supply with they and also with steel straight edge and there should be a master face plate and a master straight edge for the sole purpose of testing from time to time the accuracy of those in use 708 _ q _ -- be the operation of surface which you have describe necessary in the case of all slide valve _ a _ -- yes and in fitting the face of a d valve great care must in addition be take that the valve be not make conical for unless the back be exactly parallel with the face it will be impossible to keep the packing from be rapidly cut away when the valve be lay upon the face plate the back must be make quite fair along the whole length by draw filing accord to the indication of a straight edge and the distance from the face to the extreme height of the back must be make identical at each extremity 709 _ q _ -- when you describe the operation of bore the cylinder you state that the cylinder when lay upon its side become oval will not this change of figure distort the cylinder face _ a _ -- it be not only in the boring of the cylinder that it be necessary to be careful that there be no change of figure for it will be impossible to face the valve truly in the case of large cylinder unless the cylinder be place on end or internal prop be introduce to prevent the collapse due to the cylinder 's weight it may be add that the change of figure be not instantaneous but become greater after some continuance of the strain than it be at first so that in gauge a cylinder to ascertain the difference of diameter when it be place on its side it should have lie some day upon its side to ensure the accuracy of the operation 710 _ q _ -- how be any flaw in the valve or cylinder face remedy _ a _ -- should a hole occur either in the valve in the cylinder or any other part where the surface require to be smooth it may be plug up with a piece of cast iron as nearly as possible of the same texture bear out the faulty part and afterward widen the hole with a eccentric drill so that it will be of the least diameter at the mouth the hole may go more than half through the iron : fit then a plug of cast iron roughly by filing and hammer it into the hole whereby the plug will become rivet in it and its surface may then be file smooth square piece may be let in after the same fashion the hole be make dovetail and the piece thus fit will never come out 711 _ q _ -- when cylinder be face with brass how be the face attach to the cylinder _ a _ -- brass face be put upon valve or cylinder by means of small brass screw tap into the iron with conical neck for the retention of the brass : they be screw by means of a square head which when the screw be in its place be cut off and file smooth in some case the face be make of extra thickness and a rim not so thick run round it form a step or recess for the reception of brass rivet the head of which be clear of the face 712 _ q _ -- what be the best material for valve face _ a _ -- much trouble be experience with every modification of valve face but cast iron work upon cast iron be perhaps the best combination yet introduce a usual practice be to pin brass face on the cylinder allow the valve to retain its cast iron face some maker employ brass valve and other pin brass on the valve leave the cylinder with a cast iron face if brass valve be use it be advisable to plane out two groove across the face and to fill they up with hard cast iron to prevent rutting speculum metal and steel have be try for the cylinder face but only with moderate success in some case the brass get into rut but the most prevalent affection be a degradation of the iron owe to the action of the steam and the face assume a granular appearance something like loaf sugar this action show itself only at particular spot and chiefly about the angle of the port or valve face at first the action be slow but when once the steam have work a passage for itself the cut away become very rapid and in a short time it will be impossible to prevent the engine from heating when stop owe to the leakage of steam through the valve into the condenser copper steam pipe seem to have some galvanic action on valve face and malleable iron pipe have sometimes be substitute but they be speedily wear out by oxidation and the scale of rust which be carry on by the steam scratch the valve and cylinder so that the use of copper pipe be the least evil 713 _ q _ -- will you explain in what manner the joint of a engine be make _ a _ -- rust joint be not now much use in engine of any kind yet it be necessary that the engineer should be acquaint with the manner of they formation one ounce of sal-ammoniac in powder be mingle with 18 ounce or a pound of boring of cast iron and a sufficiency of water be add to wet the mixture thoroughly which should be do some hour before it be want for use some person add about half a ounce of flower of brimstone to the above proportion and a little sludge from the grindstone trough this cement be caulk into the joint with a caulking iron about three quarter of a inch wide and one quarter of a inch thick and after the caulking be finish the bolt of the joint may be try to see if they can not be further tighten the skin of the iron must in all case be break where a rust joint be to be make and if the place be greasy the surface must be well rub over with nitric acid and then wash with water till no grease remain the oil about engine have a tendency to damage rust joint by recover the oxide coppersmith staunch the edge of they plate and rivet by means of a cement form of pounded quicklime with serum of blood or white of egg and in copper boiler such a substance may be useful in stop the impalpable leak which sometimes occur though roman cement appear to be nearly as effectual 714 _ q _ -- will you explain the method of case harden the part of engine _ a _ -- the most common plan for case harden consist in the insertion of the article to be operate upon among horn or leather cutting hone dust or animal charcoal in a iron box provide with a tight lid which be then put into a furnace for a period answerable to the depth of steel require in some case the plan pursue by the gunsmith may be employ with convenience the article be insert in a sheet iron case amid bone dust often not burn the lid of the box be tie on with wire and the joint lute with clay the box be heat to redness as quickly as possible and keep half a hour at a uniform heat : its contents be then suddenly immerse in cold water the more unwieldy portion of a engine may be case harden by prussiate of potash -- a salt make from animal substance compose of two atom of carbon and one of nitrogen and which operate on the same principle as the charcoal the iron be heat in the fire to a dull red heat and the salt be either sprinkle upon it or rub on in a lump or the iron be rub in the salt in powder the iron be then return to the fire for a few minute and finally immerse in water by some person the salt be suppose to act unequally as if there be greasy spot upon the iron which the salt refuse to touch and the effect under any circumstance be exceedingly superficial nevertheless upon all part not expose to wear a sufficient coating of steel may be obtain by this process 715 _ q _ -- what kind of iron be most suitable for the work part of a engine _ a _ -- in the malleable iron work of engine scrap iron have long be use and consider preferable to other kind but if the part be to be case harden as be now the usual practice the use of scrap iron be to be reprehend as it be almost sure to make the part twist in the case harden process in case harden iron absorb carbon which cause it to swell and as some kind of iron have a greater capacity for carbon than other kind in case harden they will swell more and any such unequal enlargement in the constituent portion of a piece of iron will cause it to change its figure in some case case hardening have cause such a twist of the part of a engine that they could not afterward be fit together it be preferable therefore to make such part as be to be case harden to any considerable depth of lowmoor bowling or indian iron which be homogeneous will absorb carbon equally and will not twist 716 _ q _ -- what be the composition of the brass use for engine bearing _ a _ -- the brass bearing of a engine be compose principally of copper and tin a very good brass for steam engine bearing consist of old copper 112 lb tin 12-1\/2 lb zinc 2 or 3 oz and if new tile copper be use there should be 13 lb of tin instead of 12-1\/2 lb a tough brass for engine work consist of 1-1\/2 lb tin 1-1\/2 lb zinc and 10 lb copper a brass for heavy bearing 2-1\/2 oz tin 1\/2 oz zinc and 1 lb copper there be a great difference in the length of time brass wear as make by different manufacturer but the difference arise as much from a different quantity of surface as from a vary composition of the metal brass should always be make strong and thick as when thin they collapse upon the bearing and increase the friction and the wear 717 _ q _ -- how be babbitt 's metal for line the bush of machinery compound _ a _ -- babbitt 's patent lining metal for bush have be largely employ in the bush of locomotive axle and other machinery : it be compose of 1 lb of copper 1 lb regulus of antimony and 10 lb of tin or other similar proportion the presence of tin be the only material condition the copper be first melted then the antimony be add with a small proportion of tin-charcoal be strew over the surface of the metal in the crucible to prevent oxidation the bush or article to be line have be cast with a recess for the soft metal be to be fit to a iron mould form of the shape and size of the bearing or journal allow a little in size for the shrinkage drill a hole for the reception of the soft metal say 1\/2 to 3\/4 inch diameter wash the part not to be tin with a clay wash to prevent the adhesion of the tin wet the part to be tin with alcohol and sprinkle fine sal-ammoniac upon it heat the article until fume arise from the ammonia and immerse it in a kettle of banca tin care be take to prevent oxidation when sufficiently tin the bush should be soak in water to take off any particle of ammonia that may remain upon it as the ammonia would cause the metal to blow wash with pipe clay and dry then heat the bush to the melting point of tin wipe it clean and pour in the metal give it sufficient head as it cool the bush should then be scour with fine sand to take off any dirt that may remain upon it and it be then fit for use this metal wear for a longer time than ordinary gun metal and its use be attend with very little friction if the bearing heat however from the stop of the oil hole or otherwise the metal will be melt out a metallic grease contain particle of tin in the state of a impalpable powder would probably be preferable to the lining of metal just describe 718 _ q _ -- can you state the composition of any other alloy that be use in engine work _ a _ -- the ordinary range of good yellow brass that file and turn well be about 4-1\/2 to 9 ounce of zinc to the pound of copper flange to stand brazing may be make of copper 1 lb zinc 1\/2 oz lead 3\/8 oz brazing solder when state in the order of they hardness be : - three part copper and one part zinc -lrb- very hard -rrb- eight part brass and one part zinc -lrb- hard -rrb- six part brass one part tin and one part zinc -lrb- soft -rrb- a very common solder for iron copper and brass consist of nearly equal part of copper and zinc muntz 's metal consist of forty part zinc and sixty of copper any proportion between the extreme of fifty part of zinc and fifty part copper and thirty-seven zinc and sixty-three copper will roll and work at a red heat but forty zinc to sixty copper be the proportion prefer bell metal such as be use for large bell consist of 4-1\/2 ounce to 5 ounce of tin to the pound of copper speculum metal consist of from 7-1\/2 ounce to 8-1\/2 ounce of tin to the pound of copper erection of engine 719 _ q _ -- will you explain the operation of erect a pair of side lever engine in the workshop a -- in begin the erection of side lever marine engine in the workshop the first step be to level the bed plate lengthway and across and strike a line up the center as near as possible in the middle which indent with a chisel in various place so that it may at any time be easily find again strike another line at right angle with this either at the cylinder or crank center by draw a perpendicular in the usual manner lay the other sole plate alongside at the right distance and strike a line at the cylinder or crank center of it also shift either sole plate a little endway until these two transverse line come into the same line which may be ascertain by apply a straight edge across the two sole plate strike the rest of the centre across and drive a pin into each corner of each sole plate which file down level so as to serve for point of reference at any future stage next try the cylinder or plumb it on the inside roughly and see how it be for height in order to ascertain whether much will be require to be chip off the bottom or whether more require to be chip off the one side than the other chip the cylinder bottom fair set it in its place plumb the cylinder very carefully with a straight edge and silk thread and scribe it so as to bring the cylinder mouth to the right height then chip the sole plate to suit that height the cylinder must then be try on again and the part file wherever they bear hard until the whole surface be well fitted next chip the place for the frame set up the framing and scribe the horizontal part of the jaw with the scriber use for the bottom of the cylinder the upright part be set to suit the shaft centre and the angular flange of cylinder where the stay be attach have be previously chip plumb and level the stake wedge with which the framing be set up preparatorily to the operation of scribe must be set so as to support equally the superincumbent weight else the framing will spring from rest unequally and it will be altogether impossible to fit it well these direction obviously refer exclusively to the old description of side lever engine with cast iron framing but there be more art in erect a engine of that kind with accuracy than in erect one of the direct action engine where it be chiefly turn or bore surface that have to be deal with 720 _ q _ -- how do you lay out the position of the centre of a side lever engine _ a _ -- in fix the position of the centre in side lever engine it appear to be the most convenient way to begin with the main center the height of the center of the cross head at half stroke above the plane of the main center be fix by the drawing of the engine which give the distance from the center of cross head at half stroke to the flange of the cylinder and from thence it be easy to find the perpendicular distance from the cylinder flange to the plane of the main center merely by put a straight edge along level from the position of the main center to the cylinder and measure from the cylinder flauge down to it raise or lower the straight edge until it rest at the proper measurement the main center be in that plane and the fore and aft position be to be find by plumbing up from the center line on the sole plate to find the paddle shaft center plumb up from the center line mark on the edge of the sole plate and on this line lay off from the plane of the main center the length of the connect rod if that length be already fix or otherwise the height fix in the drawing of the paddle shaft above the main center to fix the center for the parallel motion shaft when the parallel bar be connect with the cross head lay off from the plane of main center the length of the parallel bar from the center of the cylinder deduct the length of the radius crank and plumb up the central line of motion shaft lay off on this line measure from the plane of main center the length of the side rod this give the center of parallel motion shaft when the radius bar join the cross head as be the preferable practice where parallel motion be use the length of the connect rod be the distance from the center of the beam when level or the plane of the main center to the center of the paddle shaft the length of the side rod be the distance from the center line of the beam when level to the center of the cross head when the piston be at half stroke the length of the radius rod of the parallel motion be the distance from the point of attachment on the cross head or side rod when the piston be at half stroke to the extremity of the radius crank when the crank be horizontal or in engine with the parallel motion attach to the cross head it be the distance from the center of the pin of the radius crank when horizontal to the center of the cylinder have fix the center of the parallel motion shaft in the manner just describe it only remain to put the part together when the motion be attach to the cross head but when the motion be attach to the side rod the end of the parallel bar must not move in a perpendicular line but in a arc the verse sine of which bear the same ratio to that of the side lever that the distance from the top of the side rod to the point of attachment bear to the total length of the side rod 721 _ q _ -- how do you ascertain the accuracy of the parallel motion _ a _ -- the parallel motion when put in its place should be test by raise and lower the piston by means of the crane first set the beam level and shift in or out the motion shaft plummer block or bearing until the piston rod be upright then move the piston to the two extreme of its motion if at both end the cross head be throw too much out the stud in the beam to which the motion side rod be attach be too far out and must be shift nearer to the main center if at the extremity the cross head be throw too far in the stud in the beam be not out far enough if the cross head be throw in at the one end and out equally at the other the fault be in the motion side rod which must be lengthen or shorten to remedy the defect 722 _ q _ -- will you describe the method pursue in erect oscillate engine _ a _ -- the column here be of work iron and in the case of small engine there be a template make of wood and sheet iron in which the hole be set in the proper position by which the upper and lower frame be adjust but in the case of large engine the hole be set off by means of trammel the hole for the reception of the column be cast in the frame and be recess out internally : the boss encircle the hole be make quite level across and make very true with a face plate and the pillar which have be turn to a gauge be then insert the top frame be next put on and must bear upon the collar of the column so evenly that one of the column will not be bind by it harder than another if this point be not attain the surface must be further scrape until a perfect fit be establish the whole of the bearing in the best oscillating engine be fit by means of scrape and on no other mode of fitting can the same reliance be place for exactitude 723 _ q _ -- how do you set out the trunnion of oscillate engine so that they shall be at right angle with the interior of the cylinder _ a _ -- have bore the cylinder face the flange and bore out the hole through which the boring bar pass put a piece of wood across the mouth of the cylinder and jam it in and put a similar piece in the hole through the bottom of the cylinder mark the center of the cylinder upon each of these piece and put into the bear of each trunnion a iron plate with a small indentation in the middle to receive the center of a lathe and adjust screw to bring the center into any require position the cylinder must then be set in a lathe and hang by the centre of the trunnion and a straight edge must be put across the cylinder mouth and level so as to pass through the line in which the center of the cylinder lie another similar straight edge and similarly level must be similarly place across the cylinder bottom so as to pass through the central line of the cylinder and the cylinder be then to be turn round in the trunnion centres-the straight edge remain stationary which will at once show whether the trunnion be in the same horizontal plane as the center of the cylinder and if not the screw of the plate in the trunnion must be adjust until the central point of the cylinder just come to the straight edge whichever end of the cylinder be present to ascertain whether the trunnion stand in a transverse plane parallel to the cylinder flange it be only necessary to measure down from the flange to each trunnion center and if both these condition be satisfy the position of the centre may be suppose to be right the trunnion bearing be then turn and be fit into block of wood in which they run while the packing space be be turn out where many oscillate engine be make a lathe with four centre be use which make the use of straight edge in set out the trunnion superfluous 724 _ q _ -- will you explain how the slide valve of a marine engine be set _ a _ -- place the crank in the position correspond to the end of the stroke which can easily be do in the shop with a level or plumb line but in a steam vessel another method become necessary draw the transverse center line answering to the center line of the crank shaft on the sole plate of the engine or on the cylinder mouth if the engine be of the direct action kind describe a circle of the diameter of the crank pin upon the large eye of the crank and mark off on either side of the transverse center line a distance equal to the semi-diameter of the crank pin from the point thus find stretch a line to the edge of the circle describe on the large eye of the crank and bring round the crank shaft till the crank pin touch the stretch line the crank may thus be set at either end of its stroke when the crank be thus place at the end of the stroke the valve must be adjust so as to have the amount of lead or opening on the steam side which it be intend to give at the beginning of the stroke the eccentric must then be turn round upon the shaft until the notch in the eccentric rod come opposite the pin on the valve lever and fall into gear : mark upon the shaft the situation of the eccentric and put on the catch in the usual way the same process must be repeat for go astern shift round the eccentric to the opposite side of the shaft until the rod again fall into gear in set valve regard must of course be have to the kind of engine the arrangement of the lever and the kind of valve employ and in any general instruction it be impossible to specify every modification in the procedure that circumstance may render advisable 725 _ q _ -- be a similar method of set the valve adopt when the link motion be employ _ a _ -- each end of the link of the link motion have the kind of motion communicate to it that be due to the action of the particular eccentric with which that end be in connection in that form of the link motion in which the link itself be move up or down there be a different amount of lead for each different position of the link since to raise or lower the link be tantamount to turn the eccentric round on the shaft in that form of the link motion in which the link itself be not raise or lower but be susceptible of a motion round a center in the manner of a double end lever the lead continue uniform in both form of the link motion as the stroke of the valve may be vary to any require extent while the lap be a constant quantity the proportion of the lap relatively to the stroke of the valve may also be vary to any require extent and the amount of the lap relatively with the stroke of the valve determine the amount of the expansion in set the valve when fit with the link motion the mode of procedure be much the same as when it be move by a simple eccentric the first thing be to determine if the eccentric rod be of the proper length and this be do by set the valve at half stroke and turn round the eccentric mark each extremity of the travel of the end of the rod the valve attachment should be midway between these extreme and if it be not so it must be make so by lengthen or shorten the rod the forward and backward eccentric rod be to be adjust in this way and this be do the engine be to be put to the end of the stroke and the eccentric be to be turn round until the amount of lead have be give that be desire the valve must be try by turn the engine round to see that it be right at both centre for go ahead and also for go astern in some example of the link motion one of the eccentric rod be make a little longer than the other and the position of the point of suspension or point of support powerfully influence the action of the link in certain case especially if the link and this point be not in the same vertical line to reconcile all the condition proper to the satisfactory operation of the valve in the construction of the link motion be a problem require a good deal of attention and care for its satisfactory solution and to make sure that this result be attain the engine must be turn round a sufficient number of time to enable we to ascertain if the valve occupy the desire position both at the top and bottom centre whether the engine be go ahead or astern this should also be try with the start handle in the different notch or in other word with the slide block in the slot or opening of the link in different position management of marine boiler 726 _ q _ -- you have already state that the formation of salt or scale in marine boiler be to be prevent by blow out into the sea at frequent interval a portion of the concentrated water will you now explain how the proper quantity of water to be blow out be determine _ a _ -- by means of the salinometer which be a instrument for determine the density of the water construct on the principle of the hydrometer for tell the strength of spirit some of the water be draw off from the boiler from time to time and the salinometer be immerse in it after it have be cool by the graduation of the salinometer the saltness of this water be at once discover and if the saltness exceed 8 ounce of salt in the gallon more water should be blow out of the boiler to be replenish with fresher water from the sea until the prescribe limit of freshness be attain should the salinometer be accidentally break a temporary one may be construct of a phial weighted with a few grain of shot or other convenient weight the weighted phial be first to be float in fresh water and its line of floatation marked then to be float in salt water and its line of floatation marked and another mark of a equal height above the salt water mark will be the blow off point 727 _ q _ -- how often should boiler be blow off in order to keep they free from incrustation _ a _ -- flue boiler generally require to be blow off about twice every watch or about twice in the four hour but tubular boiler may require to be blow off once every twenty minute and such a amount of blow off should in every case be adopt as will effectually prevent any injurious amount of incrustation 728 _ q _ -- in the event of scale accumulate on the flue of a boiler what be the best way of remove it _ a _ -- if the boiler require to be scale the best method of perform the operation appear to be the following : -- lay a train of shaving along the flue open the safety valve to prevent the existence of any pressure within the boiler and light the train of shaving which by expand rapidly the metal of the flue while the scale from its imperfect conduct power can only expand slowly will crack off the scale by wash down the flue with a hose the scale will be carry to the bottom of the boiler or issue with the water from the mud-hole door this method of scale must be practice only by the engineer himself and must not be intrust to the fireman who in they ignorance might damage the boiler by overheate the plate it be only where the incrustation upon the flue be considerable that this method of remove it need be practice in partial case the scale may be chip off by a hatch face hammer and the flue may then be wash down with the hose in the manner before describe 729 _ q _ -- should the steam be let out of the boiler after it have blow out the water when the engine be stop _ a _ -- no it be better to retain the steam in the boiler as the heat and moisture it occasion soften any scale adhering to the boiler and cause it to peel off care must however be take not to form a vacuum in the boiler and the gauge cock if open will prevent this 730 _ q _ -- be tubular boiler liable to the formation of scale in certain place though generally free from it _ a _ -- in tubular boiler a good deal of care be require to prevent the end of the tube next the furnace from become coated with scale even when the boiler be tolerably clean in other place the scale will collect here and in many case where the amount of blow off previously find to suffice for flue boiler have be adopt a incrustation five eighth of a inch in thickness have form in twelve month round the furnace end of the tube and the stony husk envelop they have actually grow together in some part so as totally to exclude the water 731 _ q _ -- when a tubular boiler get incrust in the manner you have describe what be the best course to be adopt for the removal of the scale _ a _ -- when a boiler get into this state the whole of the tube must be pull out which may be do by a spanish windlass combine with a pair of block and three man when thus provide will be able to draw out from 50 to 70 tube per day -- those tube with the thickest and firmest incrustation be of course the most difficult to remove the act of draw out the tube remove the incrustation but the tube should afterward be scrape by draw they backward and forward between the old file fix in a vice in the form of the letter v the end of the tube should then be heat and dress with the hammer and plunge while at a blood heat into a bed of sawdust to make they cool soft so that they may be rivet again with facility a few of the tube will be so far damage at the end by the act of draw they out as to be too short for reinsertion : this result might be to a considerable extent obviate by set the tube plate at different angle so that the several horizontal row of tube would not be originally of the same length and the damage tube of the long row would serve to replace the short one but the practice would be attend with other inconvenience 732 _ q _ -- be there no other means of keep boiler free from scale than by blow off _ a _ -- muriatic acid or muriate of ammonia commonly call sal-ammoniac introduce into a boiler prevent scale to a great extent but it be liable to corrode the boiler internally and also to damage the engine by be carry over with the steam and the use of such intermixture do not appear to be necessary if blow off from the surface of the water be largely practice in old boiler however already incrust with scale the use of muriate of ammonia may sometimes be advantageous 733 _ q _ -- be not the tube of tubular boiler liable to be choke up by deposit of soot _ a _ -- the soot which collect in the inside of the tube of tubular boiler be remove by means of a brush like a large bottle brush and the carbonaceous scale which remain adhering to the interior of the tube be remove by a circular scraper ferule in the tube interfere with the action of this scraper and in the case of iron tube ferule be now generally discard but it will sometimes be necessary to use ferule for iron tube where the tube have be draw and reinsert as it may be difficult to refix the tube without such a auxiliary tube one tenth of a inch in thickness be too thin : one eighth of a inch be a better thickness and such tube will better dispense with the use of ferule and will not so soon wear into hole 734 _ q _ -- if the furnace or flue of a boiler be injure how do you proceed to repair it _ a _ -- if from any imperfection in the roof of a furnace or flue a patch require to be put upon it it will be better to let the patch be apply upon the upper rather than upon the lower surface of the plate as if apply within the furnace a recess will be form for the lodgment of deposit which will prevent the rapid transmission of the heat in that part and the iron will be very liable to be again burn away a crack in a plate may be close by bore hole in the direction of the crack and insert rivet with large head so as to cover up the imperfection if the top of the furnace be bent down from the boiler have be accidentally allow to get short of water it may be set up again by a screw jack -- a fire of wood have be previously make beneath the injured plate but it will in general be nearly as expeditious a course to remove the plate and introduce a new one and the result will be more satisfactory 735 _ q _ -- in the case of the chimney be carry away by shot or otherwise what course would you pursue _ a _ -- in some case of collision the funnel be carry away and lose overboard and such case be among the most difficult for which a remedy can be seek if flame come out of the chimney when the funnel be knock away so as to incur the risk of set the ship on fire the uptake of the boiler must be cover over with a iron plate or be sufficiently cover to prevent such injury a temporary chimney must then be make of such material as be on board the ship if there be brick and clay or lime on board a square chimney may be build with they or if there be sheet iron plate on board a square chimney may be construct of they in the absence of such material the awning stanchion may be set up round the chimney and chain rove in through among they in the manner of wicker work so as to make a iron wicker chimney which may then be plaster outside with wet ash mix with clay flour or any other material that will give the ash cohesion war steamer should carry short spare funnel which may easily be set up should the original funnel be shoot away and if a jet of steam be let into the chimney a very short and small funnel will suffice for the purpose of draught management of marine engine 736 _ q _ -- what be the most important of the point which suggest themselves to you in connection with the management of marine engine _ a _ -- the attendant upon engine should prepare themselves for any casualty that may arise by consider possible case of derangement and decide in what way they would act should certain accident occur the course to be pursue must have reference to particular engine and no general rule can therefore be give but every marine engineer should be prepare with the measure to be pursue in the emergency in which he may be call upon to act and where everything may depend upon he energy and decision 737 _ q _ -- what be the first point of a marine engineer 's duty _ a _ -- the safe custody of the boiler he must see that the feed be maintain be neither too high nor too low and that blow out the supersalted water be practice sufficiently the saltness of the water at every half hour should be enter in the log book together with the pressure of steam number of revolution of the engine and any other particulars which have to be record the economical use of the fuel be another matter which should receive particular attention if the coal be very small it should be wet before be put on the fire next to the safety of the boiler the bearing of the engine be the most important consideration these point indeed constitute the main part of the duty of a engineer suppose no accident to the machinery to have take place 738 _ q _ -- if the eccentric catch or hoop be disabled how would you work the valve _ a _ -- if the eccentric catch or hoop break or come off and the damage can not readily be repair the valve may be work by attach the end of the start handle to any convenient part of the other engine or to some part in connection with the connect rod of the same engine in side lever engine with the start bar hanging from the top of the diagonal stay as be a very common arrangement the valve might be work by lead a rope from the side lever of the other engine through block so as to give a horizontal pull to the hang start bar and the bar could be bring back by a weight another plan would be to lash a piece of wood to the cross tail butt of the damage engine so as to obtain a sufficient throw for work the valve and then to lead a piece of wood or iron from a suitable point in the piece of wood attach to the cross tail to the start handle whereby the valve would receive its proper motion in oscillate engine it be easy to give the required motion to the valve by derive it from the oscillation of the cylinder 739 _ q _ -- what would you do if a crank pin break _ a _ -- if the crank pin break in a paddle vessel with two engine the other engine must be make to work one wheel in a screw vessel the same course may be pursue provide the broken crank be not the one through which the force of the other engine be communicate to the screw in such a case the vessel will be as much disabled as if she break the screw shaft or screw 740 _ q _ -- will the unbroken engine in the case of disarrangement of one of the two engine of a screw or paddle vessel be able of itself to turn the center _ a _ -- it will sometimes happen when there be much lead upon the slide valve that the single engine on be start can not be get to turn the center if there be a strong oppose wind and sea the piston go up to near the end of the stroke and then come down again without the crank be able to turn the center in such case it will be necessary to turn the vessel 's head sufficiently from the wind to enable some sail to be set and if once there be weigh get upon the vessel the engine will begin to work properly and will continue to do so though the vessel be put head to wind as before 741 _ q _ -- what should be do if a crack show itself in any of the shaft or crank _ a _ -- if the shaft or crank crack the engine may nevertheless be work with moderate pressure to bring the vessel into port but if the crack be very bad it will be expedient to fit strong block of wood under the end of the side lever or other suitable part to prevent the cylinder bottom or cover from be knock out should the damaged part give way the same remark be applicable when flaw be discover in any of the main part of the engine whether they be malleable or cast iron but they must be carefully watch so that the engine may be stop if the crack be extend further should fracture occur the first thing obviously to be do be to throw the engine out of gear and should there be much weigh on the vessel the steam should at once be throw on the reverse side of the piston so as to counteract the pressure of the paddle wheel 742 _ q _ -- have you any information to offer relative to the lubrication of engine bearing _ a _ -- a very useful species of oil cup be now employ in a number of steam vessel and which it be say accomplish a considerable saving of oil at the same time that it more effectually lubricate the bearing a ratchet wheel be fix upon a little shaft which pass through the side of the oil cup and be put into slow revolution by a pendulum attach to its outside and in revolve it lift up little bucket of oil and empty they down a funnel upon the center of the bearing instead of bucket a few short piece of wire be sometimes hang on the internal revolving wheel the drop of oil which adhere on rise from the liquid be deposit upon a high part set upon the funnel and which in they revolution the hang wire touch by this plan however the oil be not well supply at slow speed as the drop fall before the wire be in proper position for feed the journal another lubricator consist of a cock or plug insert in the neck of the oil cup and set in revolution by a pendulum and ratchet wheel or any other means there be a small cavity in one side of the plug which be fill with oil when that side be uppermost and deliver the oil through the bottom pipe when it come opposite to it 743 _ q _ -- what be the prevail cause of the heating of bearing _ a _ -- bad fitting deficient surface and too tight screw down sometimes the oil hole will choke or the syphon wick for conduct the oil from the oil cup into the central pipe lead to the bearing will become clog with mucilage from the oil in some case bearing heat from the existence of a cruciform groove on the top brass for the distribution of the oil the effect of which be to leave the top of the bearing dry in the case of revolving journal the plan for cut a cruciform channel for the distribution of the oil do not do much damage but in other case as in beam journal for instance it be most injurious and the brass can not wear well wherever the plan be pursue the right way be to make a horizontal groove along the brass where it meet the upper surface of the bearing so that the oil may be all deposit on the highest point of the journal leave the force of gravity to send it downward this channel should of course stop short a small distance from each flange of the brass otherwise the oil would run out at the end 744 _ q _ -- if a bearing heat what be to be do _ a _ -- the first thing be to relax the screw slow or stop the engine and cool the bearing with water and if it be very hot then hot water may be first employ to cool it and then cold oil with sulphur intermingle be then to be administer and as the part cool down the screw may be again cautiously tighten so as to take any jump off the engine from the bearing be too slack the bearing of direct act screw engine require constant watch as if there be any disposition to heat manifest by they they will probably heat with great rapidity from the high velocity at which the engine work every bearing of a direct act screw engine should have a cock of water lay on to it which may be immediately open wide should heating occur and it be advisable to work the engine constantly partly with water and partly with oil apply to the bearing the water and oil be mix by the friction into a species of soap which both cool and lubricate and less oil moreover be use than if water be not employ it be proper to turn off the water some time before the engine be stop so as to prevent the rusting of the bearing management of locomotive 745 _ q _ -- what be the chief duty of the engine driver of a locomotive _ a _ -- he first duty be those which concern the safety of the train he next those which concern the safety and right management of the engine and boiler the engine driver 's first solicitude should be relative to the observation and right interpretation of the signal and it be only after these demand upon he attention have be satisfy that he can look to the state of he engine 746 _ q _ -- as regard the engine and boiler what should he main duty be _ a _ -- the engineer of a locomotive should constantly be upon the foot board of the engine so that the regulator the whistle or the reverse handle may be use instantly if necessary he must see that the level of the water in the boiler be duly maintain and that the steam be keep at a uniform pressure in feed the boiler with water and the furnace with fuel a good deal of care and some tact be necessary as irregularity in the production of steam will often occasion priming even though the water be maintain at a uniform level and a excess of water will of itself occasion priming while a deficiency be a source of obvious danger the engine be generally furnish with three gauge cock and water should always come out of the second gauge cock and steam out of the top one when the engine be run : but when the engine be at rest the water in the boiler be lower than when in motion so that when the engine be at rest the water will be high enough if it just reach to the middle gauge cock in all boiler which generate steam rapidly the volume of the water be increase by the mingled steam and in feed with cold water the level at first fall but it rise on open the safety valve which cause the steam in the water to swell to a larger volume in locomotive boiler the rise of the water level due to the rapid generation of steam be term false water to economize fuel the variable expansion gear if the engine have one should be adjust to the load and the blast pipe should be work with the least possible contraction and at station the damper should be close to prevent the dissipation of heat 747 _ q _ -- in start from a station what precaution should be observe with respect to the feed _ a _ -- in start from a station and also in ascend inclined plane the feed water be generally shut off and therefore before stop or ascend inclined plane the boiler should be well fill up with water in descend inclined plane a extra supply of water may be introduce into the boiler and the fire may be feed as there be at such time a superfluity of steam in descend inclined plane the regulator must be partially close and it should be entirely close if the plane be very steep the same precaution should be observe in the case of curve or rough place on the line and in pass over point or crossing 748 _ q _ -- in approach a station how should the supply of water and fuel be regulate _ a _ -- the boiler should be well fill with water on approach a station as there be then steam to spare and additional water can not be conveniently supply when the engine be stationary the furnace should be feed with small quantity of fuel at a time and the feed should be turn off just before a fresh supply of fuel be introduce the regulator may at the same time be partially close and if the blast pipe be a variable one it will be expedient to open it widely while the fuel be be introduce to check the rush of air in through the furnace door and then to contract it very much so soon as the furnace door be close in order to recover the fire quickly the proper thickness of coke upon the grate depend upon the intensity of the draught but in heavily loaded engine it be usually keep up to the bottom of the fire door care however must be take that the coke do not reach up to the bottom row of tube so as to choke they up the fuel be usually dispose on the grate like a vault and if the fire box be a square one it be heap high in the corner the better to maintain the combustion 749 _ q _ -- how can you tell whether the feed pump be operate properly _ a _ -- to ascertain whether the pump be act well the pet cock must be turn and if any of the valve stick they will sometimes be induce to act again by work with the pet cock open or alternately open and shut should the defect arise from a leakage of steam into the pump which prevent the pump from draw the pet cock remedy the evil by permit the steam to escape 750 _ q _ -- what precaution should be take against priming in locomotive _ a _ -- should priming occur from the water in the boiler be dirty a portion of it may be blow out and should there be much boil down through the glass gauge tube the stop cock may be partially close the water should be wholly blow out of locomotive boiler three time a week and at those time two mud-hole door at opposite corner of the boiler should be open and the boiler be wash internally by means of a hose if the boiler be habitually feed with dirty water the priming will be a constant source of trouble 751 _ q _ -- what measure should the locomotive engineer take to check the velocity of the train on approach a station where he have to stop _ a _ -- on approach a station the regulator should be gradually close and it should be completely shut about half a mile from the station if the train be a very heavy one : the train may then be bring to rest by means of the break too much reliance however must not be put upon the break as they sometimes give way and in frosty weather be nearly inoperative in case of urgency the steam may be throw upon the reverse side of the piston but it be desirable to obviate this necessity as far as possible at terminal station the steam should be shut off earlier than at roadside station as a collision will take place at terminal station if the train overshoot the place where it ought to stop there should always be a good supply of water when the engine stop but the fire may be suffer gradually to burn low toward the conclusion of the journey 752 _ q _ -- what be the duty of a engine man on arrive at the end of he journey _ a _ -- so soon as the engine stop it should be wipe down and be then carefully examine : the brass should be try to see whether they be slack or have be heat and by the application of a gauge it should be ascertain occasionally whether the wheel be square on they axle and whether the axle have end play which should be prevent the stuffing box must be tighten and the valve gear examine and the eccentric be occasionally look at to see that they have not shift on they axle though this defect will be generally intimate by the irregular beating of the engine the tube should also be examine and clean out and the ash empty out of the smoke box through the small ash door at the end if the engine be a six-wheeled one with the drive wheel in the middle it will be liable to pitch and oscillate if too much weight be throw upon the drive wheel and where such fault be find to exist the weight upon the driving wheel should be diminish the practice of blow off the boiler by the steam as be always do in marine boiler should not be permit as a general rule in locomotive boiler when the tube be of brass and the fire box of copper but when the tube and fire box be of iron there will not be a equal risk of injury before start on a journey the engine man should take a summary glance beneath the engine -- but before do so he ought to assure himself that no other engine be come up at the time the regulator when the engine be stand should be close and lock and the eccentric rod be fix out of gear and the tender break screw down the cock of the oil vessel should at the same time be shut but should all be open a short time before the train start 753 _ q _ -- what should be do if a tube burst in the boiler _ a _ -- when a tube burst a wooden or iron plug must be drive into each end of it and if the water or steam be rush out so fiercely that the exact position of the imperfection can not be discover it will be advisable to diminish the pressure by increase the supply of feed water should the leak be so great that the level of the water in the boiler can not be maintain it will be expedient to drop the bar and quench the fire so as to preserve the tube and fire box from injury 754 _ q _ -- if any of the work part of a locomotive break or become deranged what should be do _ a _ -- should the piston rod or connect rod break or the cutter fall out or be clip off -- as sometimes happen to the piston cutter when the engine be suddenly reverse upon a heavy train -- the part should be disconnect if the connection can not be restore so as to enable one engine to work and of course the valve of the faulty engine must be keep close if one engine have not power enough to enable the train to proceed with the blast pipe full open the engine may perhaps be able to take on a part of the carriage or it may run on by itself to fetch assistance the same course must be pursue if any of the valve gear become deranged and the defect can not be rectify upon the spot 755 _ q _ -- what be the most usual cause of railway collision _ a _ -- probably fog and inexactness in the time keep by the train collision have sometimes occur from carriage have be blow from a siding on to the rail by a high wind and the slippery state of the rail or the fracture of a break have sometimes occasion collision at terminal station collision have also repeatedly take place from one engine have overtake another from the failure of a tube in the first engine or from some other slight disarrangement and collision have also take place from the switch have be accidentally so leave as to direct the train into a siding instead of continue it on the main line every train now carry fog signal which be detonate packet which be fix upon the rail in advance or in the rear of a train which whether from get off the rail or otherwise be stop upon the line and which be explode by the wheel of any approach train 756 _ q _ -- what other duty of a engine-driver be there deserving attention _ a _ -- they be too various to be all enumerate here and they also vary somewhat with the nature of the service one rule however of universal application be for the driver to look after matter himself and not delegate to the stoker the duty which the person in charge of the engine should properly perform before leave a station the engine-driver should assure himself that he have the requisite supply of coke and water besides the firing tool and rake for clear the tube he should have with he in the tender a set of signal lamp and torch for tunnel and for night detonate signal screw key a small tank of oil a small cask of tallow and a small box of waste a coal hammer a chip hammer some wooden and iron plug for the tube and a iron tube holder
