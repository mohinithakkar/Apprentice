war that he prepare for the resumption of hostility be indeed true but the reason which he give to the queen be satisfactory the improbability that this present treaty should produce a peace consider

-rrb- -rrb- such be the end of the unfortunate charle stuart a awful lesson to the possessor of royalty to watch the growth of public opinion and to moderate they pretension in conformity with the reasonable desire of they subject have he live at a more early period when the sense of wrong be quickly subdue by the habit of submission he reign would probably have be mark with fewer violation of the national liberty it be resistance that make he a tyrant the spirit of the people refuse to yield to the encroachment of authority and one act of oppression place he under the necessity of commit another till he have revive and enforce all those odious prerogative which though usually claim be but sparingly exercise by he predecessor for some year he effort seem successful but the scottish insurrection reveal the delusion he have part with the real authority of a king when he forfeit the confidence and affection of he subject but while we blame the illegal measure of charle we ought not to screen from censure the subsequent conduct of he principal opponent from the moment that war seem inevitable they act as if they think themselves absolve from all obligation of honor and honesty they never cease to inflame the passion of the people by misrepresentation and calumny they exercise a power far more arbitrary and formidable than have ever be claim by the king they punish summarily on mere suspicion and without attention to the form of law and by they committee they establish in every county a knot of petty tyrant who dispose at will of the liberty and property of the inhabitant such anomaly may perhaps be inseparable from the jealousy the resentment and the heart-burning which be engender in civil commotion but certain it be that right and justice have seldom be more wantonly outraged than they be by those who profess to have draw the sword in the defense of right and justice neither should the death of charle be attribute to the vengeance of the people they for the most part declare themselves satisfied with they victory they seek not the blood of the captive monarch they be even willing to replace he on the throne under those limitation which they deem necessary for the preservation of they rights the man who hurry he to the scaffold be a small faction of bold and ambitious spirit who have the address to guide the passion and fanaticism of they follower and be enable through they to control the real sentiment of the nation even of the commissioner appoint to sit in judgment on the king scarcely one-half could be induce to attend at he trial and many of those who concur in he condemnation subscribe the sentence with feeling of shame and remorse but so it always happen in revolution : the most violent put themselves forward they vigilance

triumphant party refuse to be content with anything less than the abolition of the old and the establishment of a new and more popular form of government some indeed still venture to raise they voice in favor of monarchy on the plea that it be a institution the most congenial to the habit and feeling of englishman by these it be propose that the two elder son of charle should be pass by because they notion be already form and they resentment already kindle that the young duke of gloucester or he sister elizabeth should be place on the throne and that under the infant sovereign the royal prerogative should be circumscribe by law so as to secure from future encroachment the just liberty of the people but the majority warmly contend for the establishment of a commonwealth why they ask should they spontaneously set up again the idol which it have cost they so much blood and treasure to pull down law would prove but feeble restraint on the passion of a proud and powerful monarch if they seek a insuperable barrier to the restoration of despotism it could be find only in some of those institution which lodge the supreme power with the representative of the people that they speak

justice piety and prudence and i fear there be very much in that transaction of ireland both before and since that you and i be never think wise enough to be advise with in oh mr secretary those stratagem have give I more sad hour than all the misfortune in war which have befall the king and look like the effect of god 's anger towards we -- clarendon papers ii 337 it appear that the king even after he have be deliver by the scot to the parliament still hope to derive benefit from the exertion of glamorgan about the beginning of June 1647 sir john somerset the brother of that nobleman arrive in rome with a letter from charle to innocent x the letter be not probably in existence but the answer of the pontiff show that the king have solicit pecuniary assistance and as a inducement have hold out some hint of a disposition on he part to admit the papal supremacy and the catholic creed less than this can not be infer from the language of innocent litera illa praecipuam tuam alacritatem ac propensionem ad obediendum deo in nobis qui ejus vice gerimus luculenter declarant a majestate tua enixe poscimus ut quod velle coepit mox et facto perficiat ut aliquo id aggrediari argumento quo te te ad catholicam fidem recepisse intelligamus undoubtedly charle be make the same experiment with the pontiff which he have just make with he presbyterian subject and as to propitiate they he have undertake to study the presbyterian doctrine so he hope to draw money from innocent by profess a inclination in favor of the catholic creed but the attempt fail the answer be indeed complimentary : it express the joy of the pontiff at the perusal of he letter and exhort he to persevere in the inquiry till he should come to the discovery of the truth but it dispose of he request as urban have previously dispose of a similar request by state that it be inconsistent with the duty of the pope to spend the treasure of he church in the support of any but catholic prince this answer be date 29th June 1647 note b p 136 1 the ordinance have distinguish two class of delinquent the one religious the other political the first comprise all catholic recusant all person whomsoever

personal estate which be seize for the benefit of the kingdom by the commissioner of sequestration appoint in each particular county the second comprehend all person who be know to have fight against the parliament or to have aid the royal party with money man provision advice or information and of these the whole estate both real and personal have be sequestrate with the sole exception of one-fifth allot for the support of they wife and child if the latter be educate in the protestant religion -- elsynge 's ordinance 3 22 et seq 2 these sequestrated estate not only furnish a yearly

it be calculate to create a deep sensation in favor of the royal sufferer and be say to have pass through fifty edition in the course of the first year during the commonwealth milton make a feeble attempt to disprove the king 's claim to the composition of the book : after the restoration dr gauden a clergyman of bocking in essex come forward and declare himself the real author but he advance he pretension with secrecy and receive as the price of he silence first the bishopric of exeter and afterwards when he complain of the poverty of that see the richer bishopric of worcester after the death of gauden he pretension begin to transpire and become the subject of a interesting controversy between he friend and the admirer of charle but many document have be publish since which be then unknown particularly the letter of gauden to the earl of clarendon -lrb- clarendon papers iii app xxvi-xxxi xcv -rrb- and other from he to the earl of bristol -lrb- maty 's review ii 253 clarendon papers iii app xcvi and mr todd memoirs of bishop walton i 138 -rrb- these have so firmly establish gauden 's claim that whoever deny it must be prepare to pronounce that prelate a impostor to believe that the bishop morley and duppa give false evidence in he favor and to explain how it happen that those the most interested to maintain the right of the king namely charle ii he brother the duke of york and the two earl of clarendon and bristol yield to the deception these difficulty however have not appal dr wordsworth who in a recent publication of more than four hundred page entitle who write -lrb- greek : eikon basilika -rrb- have collect with patient industry every particle of evidence which can bear upon the subject and after a most minute and laborious investigation have conclude by adjudge the work to the king and pronounce the bishop a impudent impostor still my incredulity be not subdue there be much in the -lrb- greek : eikon basilika -rrb- itself which forbid I to believe that charle be the real author though the latter whoever he be may have occasionally consult and copy the royal papers and the claim of gauden appear too firmly establish to be shake by the imperfect and conjectural improbability which have hitherto be produce against it note d p 276 _ the massacre at drogheda and wexford _ i drogheda be take by storm on the 11th of September 1649 cromwell on he return to dublin despatch two official account of he success one to bradshaw president of the council of state a second to lenthall the speaker of parliament they be date on the 16th and 17th of September which probably ought to have be the 17th and 18th for he repeatedly make such mistake in numbering the day of that month these two document on several account deserve the attention of the reader i both mention a massacre but with this difference that whereas the earlier seem to confine it to the man in arm against the commonwealth the second towards the end notice incidentally as it be the additional slaughter of a thousand of the townspeople in the church of st peter in the first cromwell as if he doubt how the shed of so much blood would be take appear to shift the origin of the massacre from himself to the soldiery who consider the refusal of quarter as a matter of course after the summons which have be send into the town on the precede day but in the next despatch he assume a bolder tone and take upon himself all the blame or merit of the proceed we man be order _ by I _ to put they all to the sword -- i forbid they to spare any that be in arm in the first to reconcile the council to the slaughter he pronounce it a marvellous great mercy for the enemy have lose by it they best officer and prime soldier : in the next he openly betray he own misgiving acknowledge that such action can not but work remorse and regret without sufficient grounds and allege as sufficient grounds in the present case -- 1 that it be a righteous judgment of god on barbarous wretch who have imbue they hand in so much innocent blood and 2 that it would tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future 2 now the insinuation convey in the first of these reason that the major part of the garrison have be engage in the outbreak of the rebellion and its accompany horror be in all probability a falsehood for the major part of the garrison be not compose of native soldier but of englishman serve under the marquess of ormond the king 's lord lieutenant this be plain from the evidence of person who can not be suppose ignorant of the fact the evidence of the royalist clarendon -lrb- history vol iii part i p 323 -rrb- and of the republican ludlow who soon afterwards be make general of the horse and become cromwell 's deputy in the government of the island -lrb- ludlow memoirs i 301 -rrb- but however groundless the insinuation might be it serve cromwell 's purpose it would array in he favor the fanaticism of the more godly of he party for the massacre of the townspeople in the church he offer a similar apology equally calculate to interest the feeling of the saint they have have the insolence on the last lord 's day to thrust out the protestant and to have the mass say there now this remark plainly include a paralogism the person who have order the mass to be say there on the 9th of September be undoubtedly the civil or military authority in the town theirs be the guilt if guilt it be and theirs should have be the punishment yet he argument suppose that the unarmed individual whose blood be shed there on the 12th be the very person who have set up the mass on the 9th 3 we know not how far this second massacre be originate or encourage by cromwell it be well know that in the sack of town it be not always in the power of the commander to restrain the fury of the assailant who abuse the license of victory to gratify the most brutal of they passion but here we have no reason to suppose that cromwell make any effort to save the life of the unarmed and the innocent both the commander and he man have a common religious duty to perform they be come in he own language to ask a account of the innocent blood which have be shed -- to do execution on the enemy of god 's cause hence in the case of a resist city they include the old man the female and the child in the same category with the armed combatant and consign all to the same fate 4 of the proceedings of the victor during that night we be ignorant but it do not suggest a very favourable notion of they forbearance that in the follow morning the great church of st peter 's be fill with crowd of townspeople of both sex and of every age and condition the majority of the woman and child seek protection within the body of the church a select party of female belong to the first family in the town procure access to the crypt under the choir which seem to offer more favourable chance of concealment and safety but the sacred edifice afford no asylum to either the carnage begin within the church at a early hour and when it be complete the bloodhound track they prey into the vault beneath the pavement among the man who thus descend into these subterranean recess be thomas wood at that time a subaltern afterwards a captain in ingoldsby 's regiment he find there accord to he own narrative the flower and choicest of the woman and lady belong to the town amongst whom a most handsome virgin array in costly and gorgeous apparel kneel down to he with tear and prayer to save she life and be strucken with a profound pitie he take she under he arme and go with she out of the church with intention to put she over the work to shift for herself but a soldier perceive he intention he run he sword up she belly or fundament whereupon mr wood see she gasping take away she money jewel & c and fling she down over the work -lrb- see the life of anthony a wood p xx in the edition by bliss of 1813 thoma be the brother of anthony the oxford historian -rrb- he tell they also that 3000 at least besides some woman and child be after the assailant have _ take part and afterwards all the towne _ put to the sword on the 11th and 12th of September 1649 he tell they that when they be to make they way up to the loft and gallery of the church and up to the tower where the enemy have flee each of the assailant would take up a child and use as a buckler of defense when they ascend the step to keep themselves from be shoot or brain -- wood ibid these anecdote from the mouth of one who be a eyewitness of probably a participator in the horror of that day will enable the reader to form a adequate notion of the thirst for blood which stimulate the soldiery and of the cruelty which they exercise on they defenceless victim 5 the term of indignation and abhorrence in which the sack of drogheda be describe by the royalist of that period be well know i shall add here another testimony not that it afford more important information but because i be not aware that it have ever meet the eye of more recent historian the testimony of bruodin a irish friar of great eminence and authority in the franciscan order quinque diebus continui haec laniena -lrb- qua nullo habito locorum sexus religioni aut aetati discrimine juvene et virgines lactante aeque ac senio confectus barbarorum gladii ubique trucidatus sunt -rrb- duravit quatuor milium catholicorum virorum

veritati lib iv c 14 p 678 6 here another question occur how do cromwell obtain possession of drogheda for there appear in he despatch a study evasion of the particulars necessary to give a clear view of the transaction the narrative be so confused that it provoke a suspicion of cunning and concealment on the part of the writer the royalist affirm that the place be win through promise of quarter which be afterwards perfidiously violate and they assertion be support by the testimony of ormond in a official letter write from the neighborhood to lord byron cromwell he say have be twice beat from the breach carry it the third time all he officer and soldier promising quarter to such as would lay down they arm and perform it as long as any place hold out which encourage other to yield but when they have all once in they power and fear no hurt that could be do they then the word no quarter go round and the soldier be many of they force against they will to kill they prisoner the governor and all he officer be kill in cold blood except some few of least consideration that escape by miracle -- sept 29 carte 's letter ii 412 it be possible though not very probable that ormond suffer himself to be mislead by false information it should however be observe that there be nothing in he account positively contradict by cromwell 's despatch cromwell have not forbid the grant of quarter before the storm it be afterwards in the heat of the action that he issue this order but at what part of the action on what account what have happen to provoke he to issue it he tell we that within the breach the garrison have throw up three entrenchment two of which be soon carry but the third that on the mill-mount be exceedingly strong have a good graft and strongly palisaded for additional particulars we must have recourse to other authority from which we learn that within this work be post a body of pick soldier with every thing requisite for a vigorous defense so that it could not have be take by force without the loss of some hundred of man on the part of the assailant it so happen however that the latter enter it without opposition and colonel axtell with some twelve of he man go up to the top of the mount and demand of the governor the surrender of it who be very stubborn speak very big word but at length be persuade to go into the windmill at the top of the mount and as many more of the chiefest of they as it could contain _ where they be disarm and afterwards all slay _ -- perfect diurnal from oct 1 to oct 8 now cromwell in he despatch say the governor sir arthur ashton and diver considerable officer be there -lrb- on the mill-mount -rrb- we man get up to they be order by I to put they all to the sword in my opinion this passage afford a strong corroboration of the charge make by ormond if the reader compare it with the passage already quote from the diurnal he will find it difficult to suppress a suspicion that axtell and he man have obtain a footing on the mill-mount through the offer of quarter and that this be the reason why cromwell when he know that they have obtain possession issue a order forbid the grant of quarter on any account the consequence be that the governor and he officer go into the mill and be there disarm and afterwards all slay the other prisoner be treat in the same manner as they officer 7 ormond add in the same letter that the sack of the town last during five day mean probably from September 11 to September 15 or 16 inclusively the same be assert by most of the royalist but how could that be when the storm begin on the 11th and the army march from drogheda on the 15th the question may perhaps be solve by a circumstance accidentally mention by dr bate that on the departure of the army several individual

constantly have two swift-sailing vessel station one at holyhead the other at dublin ready to put to sea on the arrival of despatch for the service of the state -- lord ' journ ix 617 from a accidental entry in whitelock it would appear that the letter from cromwell reach london on the 27th of September on the 28th parliament without any cause assign in the journal be adjourn to October 2nd and on that day the official account of the massacre at drogheda be make public at the same time a order be obtain from the parliament that a letter should be write to the lord lieutenant of ireland to be communicate to the officer there that the house doth approve of the execution do at drogheda both as a act of justice to they and mercy to other who may be warn by it -lrb- journal vi 301 -rrb- which be the very reason allege by cromwell in he despatch he conduct be now sanction by the highest authority and from that moment the saint in the army rejoice to indulge the yearning of they zeal for the cause of god by shed the blood of the irish enemy nor have they long to wait for the opportunity on the 1st of October he arrive in the neighborhood of wexford on the 9th he open a cannonade on the castle which completely command the town on the 11th synnot the military governor offer to capitulate four commissioner one of whom be stafford the captain of the castle wait on cromwell to arrange the term he be dissatisfy with they demand pronounce they abominable and detain they till he have prepare he answer by that answer he grant life and liberty to the soldier life but not liberty to the commission officer and freedom from pillage to the inhabitant subject however to the decision of parliament with respect to they real property he require a immediate acceptance of these term and the delivery to he of six hostage within a hour -- -lrb- compare the letter of October 16 in the king 's pamphlet no 442 with the document publish by mr carlyle ii 79 which appear to I nothing more than a rough and incorrect draft of a intended answer -rrb- but stafford be a traitor in the interval be fairly treat he accept without communication with the governor the term grant by cromwell and open the gate of the fortress to the enemy from the castle they scale a undefended wall in the vicinity and pour into the town a paper contain the term be now deliver to the other three commissioner but they commissioner this while not have heart to put themselves into the town again with out offer -- ibid letter of October 16 thus synnot and the other authority remain in ignorance of cromwell 's decision 2 at the first alarm the garrison and burgher assemble in the market-place to which they be accompany or follow by crowd of old man woman and child for a while the progress of the enemy be retard by barricade of cable at the entrance of the market-place they meet with a stiff resistance as it be call by cromwell the action last about a hour but the assailant receive continual reinforcement obtain at last fall possession of the place and put to the sword every human be find upon it the governor and the mayor perish with the rest 3 but how could these bloody proceedings be reconcile with the term of capitulation which have be already grant if we may believe cromwell 's official account a matchless specimen of craft and mystification _ he _ be not to blame that they have be break he be perfectly innocent of all that have happen could he not then have order he man to keep within the castle or have recall they when they force a entrance into the town undoubtedly he might but the pious man be unwilling to put himself in opposition to god he study have be to preserve the place from plunder that it might be of more use to the commonwealth and the army but he see that god would not have have it so the event which so quickly follow each other be to he a proof that god in he righteous judgment have doom the town and its defendant to destruction on which account he think it not good nor just to restrain off the soldier from they right of pillage nor from do of execution on the enemy -- letter of 16th of October he conclude he despatch to the government with these word : -- thus it have please god to give into you hand this other mercy for which as for all we pray god may have all the glory indeed you instrument be poor and weak and can do nothing but through believe and that be the gift of god also -- cary 's memorial ii 180 do then the fanatic believe that perfidy and cruelty be gift of god for at wexford he could not plead as at drogheda that he summons have be contemptuously reject it have be accept and he have himself dictate the term of capitulation be he not oblige to carry they into execution even if as be pretend in defiance of all probability he man have take possession of the castle and force a entrance into the town without he knowledge or connivance would any honest man have release himself from such obligation under the flimsy pretext that it would be act against the will of god to recall the soldier and prevent they from do execution on the enemy 4 cromwell 's minister of the divine will perform they part at wexford as they have do at drogheda do execution not on the armed combatant only but on the woman and child also of these helpless victim many have congregate round the great cross it be a natural consequence in such a emergency hitherto they have be accustom to kneel at the foot of that cross in prayer now with life itself at stake they would instinctively press towards it to escape from the sword of the enemy but as far a regard the atrocity of the thing it make little difference on what particular spot they be murder you can not relieve the memory of cromwell from the odium of such murder but by prove what it be impossible to prove that at wexford the woman and child be specially except out of the general massacre 5 i have already copy bruodin 's description of the sack of drogheda here i may transcribe he account of the sack of wexford ipse strategus regicidarum terrestrus itinere dublinium praetergressus wexfordiam -lrb- modicam quidem et maritimam munitam et

soe powerfully assault they that he enter the toune and put man woman and child to a very few to the sword where among the rest the governor lose he life and other of the soldier and inhabitant to the

war in ireland they will give little satisfaction to the worshipper of the hero but he character be not a mere matter of taste or sympathy it be a question of historic inquiry much indeed have be write to vindicate he from the imputation of cruelty at drogheda and wexford but of the argument hitherto adduce in he defense it will be no presumption to affirm that there be not one among they

the follow statement of the principle maintain by the leveller be extract from one of they publication which appear soon after the death of cromwell entitle the leveller or the principle and maxim concern government and religion which be assert by those that be commonly call leveller 1659 _ principle of government _ 1 the government of england ought to be by law and not by man that be the law ought to judge of all offence and offender and all punishment and penalty to be inflict upon criminal nor ought the pleasure of he highness and he council to make whom they please offender and punish and imprison whom they please and during pleasure 2 all law levy of money war and peace ought be make by the people 's deputy in parliament to be choose by they successively at certain period therefore there should be no negative of a monarch because he will frequently by that mean consult he own interest or that of he family to the prejudice of the people but it would be well if the deputy of the people be divide into two body one of which should propose the law and the other adopt or reject they 3 all person without a single exception should be subject to the law 4 the people ought to be form into such a military posture by and under the parliament that they may be able to compel every man to obey the law and defend the country from foreigner a mercenary -lrb- standing -rrb- army be dangerous to liberty and therefore should not be admit _ principle of religion _ 1 the assent of the understanding can not be compel therefore no man can compel another to be of the true religion 2 worship follow from the doctrine admit by the understanding no man therefore can bind another to adopt any particular form of worship 3 work of righteousness and mercy be part of the worship of god and so far fall under the civil magistrate that he ought to restrain man from irreligion that be injustice faith-breaking oppression and all other evil work that be plainly evil 4 nothing be more destructive to true religion than quarrel about religion and the use of punishment to compel one man to believe as another note k p 608 that sir anthony ashley cooper be deeply engage in the intrigue of this busy time be sufficiently manifest he appear to have hold himself out to every party as a friend and to have finally attach himself to the royalist when he see that the royal cause be likely to triumph charle acknowledge he service in the patent by which he be create lord ashley mention in particular he prudent and seasonable advice with general monk in order to the king 's restoration -- dugd ii 481 from this passage we may infer that cooper be one of monk 's confidential adviser but he admirer have go much farther attribute to he the whole merit of the restoration and represent the lord-general as a mere puppet in the hand of they hero in proof they refer to the story tell by locke -lrb- iii 471 -rrb- -- a story which can not easily be reconcile with the more credible and unpretending narrative of clarge in baker 's chronicle p 602 edit 1730 but that the reader may form he own judgment i shall subjoin the chief head of each in parallel column clarge 1 scot hazlerig and other seek and obtain a private interview with monk at whitehall and clarge from they previous conversation with himself have no doubt that they object be to offer the government of the kingdom to the general 2 the council of state be sit in another room and clarge send for sir aa cooper communicate he suspicion to he 3 after some consultation it be agree that as soon as monk have dismiss scot and hazlerig should enter the council-room cooper should move that the clerk be order to withdraw 4 when this be do cooper say that he have receive notice of a dangerous design that some seditious person have make indecent proposal to the general and of such proposal he desire that the council might have a full discovery 5 monk unwilling to expose they reply that there be very little danger in the case that some person have indeed be with he to be resolve in scruple respect the present transaction in parliament but that he have send they away well satisfied -lrb- p 602 -rrb- 6 bordeaux offer to monk through clarge the aid of mazarin whether it be he object to restore the king or to assume the government himself monk refuse but consent to receive a visit of civility from the ambassador on condition that politics should not be introduce -lrb- p 604 -rrb- locke 1 bordeaux the french ambassador visit monk one evening and mr monk who have secrete herself behind the hanging hear he offer the aid of mazarin to she husband if he be willing to take the government on himself which offer the general accept 2 mr monk send she brother clarge to communicate the discovery of she husband 's ambitious design to sir aa cooper 3 cooper cause a council to be call and when they be meet move that the clerk should withdraw because he have matter of consequence to communicate 4 he then charge monk not openly but by insinuation that he be play false with they so that the rest of the council perceive there be something in it though they know not what be mean 5 monk reply that he be willing to satisfy they that he be true to he principle then say ashley replace certain officer of suspicious character by other of known fidelity this be do on the spot the command of the army by the change be virtually take from monk and he be compel to declare for charle stuart it may be think that locke 's narrative derive confirmation from another version of the same story in the life of lord shaftesbury lately edit by mr cooke with the follow variation bordeaux be make to accompany the republican the greater part of the night be spend in consultation and monk not only consent to assume the government but resolve to arrest in the morning cooper and several other influential individual -lrb- p 233-235 -rrb- but that life can not be consider as a authority for the document from
