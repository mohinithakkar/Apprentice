which he have pass some time divide between pleasure and improvement the important question if the throne be vacate or not by the sudden departure of the unfortunate king jame be then upon the tapi on which to avoid interesting himself on either side he forbear come to london and cross the country to a fine feat he have about some forty mile distant where he resolve to stay as privately as he could till the great decision should be make and the public affair settle in such a manner as not to lay he under a necessity of declare he sentiment upon they he be young and gay loved magnificence and the pomp of court and be far from be insensible of those joy which the conversation of the fair sex afford but have never so much enslave he reason to any one pleasure as not to be able to refrain it hunting and reading be very favorite amusement with he so that the solitude he now be in be not at all disagreeable or tedious to he tho ' he continue in it some month a little time before he departure a accident happen which give he a opportunity of exercise the benevolence of he disposition and tho ' it then seem trivial to he prove of the utmost consequence to he future life as well as furnished matter for the follow page as he be walk pretty early one morning in he garden very intent on a book he have in he hand he meditation be interrupt by a unusual cry which seem at some distance but as he approach a little arbor where he be sometimes accustom to sit he hear more plain and distinct and on he entrance be soon convinced whence it proceed just at the foot of a large tree the extensive bough of which greatly contribute to form the arbor be place a basket closely cover on the one side and partly open on the other to let in the air tho ' the sound which still continue to issue from it leave dorilaus no room to doubt what it contain he stoop down to look and see two beautiful babe neatly dress in swadle cloath : between they and the pillow they be lay upon be pin a paper which he hastily take off find in it these word _ to the generous _ dorislaus : ` irresistible destiny abandon these helpless infant to you care -- they be twin beget by the same father and bear of the same mother and of a blood not unworthy the protection they stand in need of which if you vouchsafe to afford they will have no cause to regret the misfortune of they birth or accuse the author of they be -- why they seek it of you in particular you may possibly be hereafter make sensible -- in the mean time content yourself with know they be already baptize by the name of horatio and louisa ' the astonishment he be in at so unexpected a present be make he may more easily be imagine than express but he have then no time to form any conjecture by whom or by what mean it be leave there : the child want immediate succor and he hesitate not a moment whether it would become he to bestow it : he take the basket up himself and run as fast as he could with it into the house call he maid-servant about he and command they to give these little stranger what assistance be in they power while a man be send among the tenant in search of nurse proper to attend they to what person soever say he i be indebted for this confidence it must not be abuse -- besides whatever stand in need of protection merit protection from those who have the power to give it this be he way of thinking and in pursuance of these generous sentiment he always act the report of what happen in he house be soon spread thro ' the country there be not want several who come to offer they service to the child out of which he select two of whom he hear the best character and be most likely to be faithful to the trust repose in they give as great a charge and as handsome a allowance with they as could have be expect from a father indeed he doubtless have pass for be so in the opinion of every body have he arrive sooner in the kingdom but the shortness of the time not permit any such suggestion he be look upon as a prodigy of charity and goodness have in this handsome manner dispose of he new guest he begin to examine all he servant think it impossible they should be bring there without the privity of some one of they but all he endeavor could get he no satisfaction in this point he read the letter over and over yet still he curiosity be as far to seek as ever -- the hand he be entirely unacquainted with but think there be something in the style that show it write by no mean person : the hint contain in it that there be some latent reason for address he in particular on this account be very puzzling to he : he could not conceive why he any more than any other gentleman of the county should have a interest in the welfare of these child : he have no near relation and those distant one who claim a almost forget kindred be not in a condition to abandon they progeny -- the thing appear strange to he but all he endeavor to give he any farther light into it be unsuccessful he begin to imagine the parent of the child have be compel by necessity to expose they and have have only write in this mysterious manner to engage a better reception : he also account in he mind for they be leave with he as he be a batchelor and have a large estate it might naturally be suppose there would be fewer impediment to they be take care of than either where a wife be in the case or a narrow fortune oblige the owner to preserve a greater oeconomy in expence be at last convinced within himself that he have now explain this seeming riddle he take no farther trouble about whose or what these child be but resolve to take care of they during they infancy and afterwards to put they into such a way as he should find they genius 's render they most fit for in order to provide for themselves on he leave the county he order he housekeeper to furnish every thing needful for they as often as they want it and to take care they be well use by the woman with whom he have place they and deliver these command not in a cursory or negligent manner but in such term as terrify any failure of obedience in this point would highly incur he displeasure nothing material happen during they infancy i shall pass over those year in silence only say that as often as dorilaus go down to he estate -lrb- which be generally two or three time a year -rrb- he always send for they and express a very great satisfaction in finding in they look the charge he have give concern they so well execute : but when they arrive at a age capable of entertaining he with they innocent prattle what before be charity improve into affection and he begin to regard they with a tenderness little inferior to paternal but which still increase with they increase of year have give they the first rudiment of education in the best school those part afford he place louisa with a gentlewoman who deservedly have the reputation of be a excellent governess of youth and bring horatio in he own chariot up to london where he put he to westminster school under the care of doctor busby and agree for he board in a family that live near it and have several other young gentleman on the same term what more could have be expect from the best of father what more could child bear to the highest fortune have enjoy nor be they happiness like to be fleeting : dorilaus be a man steady in he resolution have always declare a aversion to marriage and by reject every overture make he on that score have make he friend cease any farther importunity he have besides -lrb- as have already be observe -rrb- no near relation so that it be the opinion of most people that he would make the young horatio heir to the greatest part of he estate and give louisa a portion answerable to she way of bring up what he intend for they however be uncertain he never have declare he sentiment so far concern they and the strange revolution happen afterwards in both they fortune prevent he from act as it be possible he might design the education he allow they indeed give very good grounds for the above-mentioned conjecture -- louisa be teach all the accomplishment that become a maid of quality to be mistress of and horatio have go thro ' all the learning of the school be take home to he own house from whence he be to go to oxford in order to finish he study in the character of a gentleman-commoner but when every thing be prepare for this purpose he come one morning into the chamber of he patron and throw himself on he knee -- think I not sir say he too presume in the request i be about to make you -- i know all that i be be yours -- that i be the creature of you bounty and that without be a father you have do more for I than many of those who be so do for they most favorite son -- i know also that you be the best judge of what be fit for I and have not the least apprehension that you will not always continue the same goodness to I provide i continue as i have hitherto do the ambition of merit it -- yet sir pardon I if i now discover a desire with which i long have labor of do something of myself which may repair the obscurity of my birth and prove to the world that heaven have endue this foundle with a courage and resolution capable of undertake the greatest action in speak these last word a fire seem to sparkle from he eye which sufficiently denote the vehemence of he inward agitation dorilaus be extremely surprized but after a little pause what be it you request of I say that noble gentleman -lrb- at the same time raise he from the posture he be in -rrb- or by what means than such as i have already take can i oblige you to think that in be my foundling fortune deal not too severely with you ah sir mistake I not i beseech you reply the young horatio or think I want in my gratitude either to heaven or you -- but sir it be to you generous care in cultivate the talent i receive from nature that i owe this emulation this ardor for do something that might give I a name which be the only thing you bounty can not bestow -- my genius incline I to the army -- of all the accomplishment you have cause I to be instruct in geography fortification and fencing have be my darling study -- of what use sir will they be to I in a idle life permit I then the opportunity of show the expense you have be at have not be throw away -- i know they will say i be too young to bear a commission but if i have the means of go a volunteer i can not help think but i should soon give proof the extreme desire i have to serve my country that way would well attone for my want of year the more he speak the more the astonishment of he patron increase : he admire the greatness of he spirit but be trouble it lead he to a desire of run into so dangerous a way of life -- he represent to he all the hardship of a soldier the little regard that be sometimes pay to merit and give he several instance of gentleman who have pass they youth in the service and behave with extreme bravery yet have no other reward than they fear and a consciousness of have do more than be they duty : in war say he the superior officer carry away all the glory as well as profit of the victory whereas in civil employment it be quite otherwise : in physic in law in divinity or in the state you merit will be immediately conspicuous to those who have the power to reward you and if you be desirous of acquire a name by which i suppose you mean to become the head of a family any of these afford you a much greater prospect of success and it lie much more in my power of assist you promotion to these he add many other argument but they be not of the least weight with the impatient horatio he be obstinate in he entreaty which he even with tear enforce and dorilaus consider so strong a propensity as something supernatural at last consent -- never be joy more sincere and fervent than what this grant occasion and he tell he benefactor that he doubt not but that hereafter he should hear such a account of he behavior as would make he not repent he have comply with he request the preparation for he go to oxford be now convert into other of a different nature -- several of we troops be already send to flander and other about to embark in order to open the campaign so that there be but a small space between the time of horatio 's ask leave to go and that of he departure which dorilaus resolve should be in a manner befitting a youth whom he have breed up as he own he provide he a handsome field-equipage rich cloath horse and a servant to attend he and while these thing be get ready have master to perfect he in ride and those other exercise proper for the vocation he be now enter into all which he perform with so good a grace that not only dorilaus himself who might be suspect to look on he with partial eye but all who see he be perfectly charm he be more than ordinarily tall for he year admirably well proportioned and have something of a grave fierceness in he air and deportment that tho ' he be not yet sixteen he might very well have pass for twenty : he be also extremely fair have regular feature and eye the most penetrate mixed with a certain sweetness so that it be difficult to say whether he seem most form for love or war dorilaus think it highly proper he should take he leave of louisa send for she from the boarding-school that she might pass the short time he have to stay with she brother at he house not without some hope that the great tenderness there be between they might put horatio out of he resolution of go to the army who be grow now extremely dear to he he could not think of parting with tho ' he have yield to it without a great deal of reluctance it be certain indeed that when she first hear the motive which have occasion she being send for she gentle breast be fill with the most terrible alarm for she dear brother 's danger but the little regard he seem to have of it and the high idea he have of future greatness soon bring she to think as he do and instead of dissuade he from prosecute he design she rather encourage he in it : and in this give the first testimony of a greatness of soul no less to be admire than the courage and laudable ambition which actuate that of she brother dorilaus beheld with a infinity of satisfaction the success of he endeavor in favor of these amiable twin and say within himself how great a pity would it have be if capacity such as theirs have be deny the means of improvement after the departure of horatio he keep louisa some time with he under pretence of show she the town which before she have never see but in reality to alleviate that melancholy which parting from she brother have cause in he he could not have take a more effectual way for there be such a engaging and sweet cheerfulness in she conversation add to many personal perfection that it be scarce possible to think of any thing else while she be present she have also a excellent voice and play well on the bass viol and harpsicord so that it be hard to say whether he find most satisfaction in hear she or discourse with she but how dangerous be it to depend on one 's own strength against the force of such unite charm dorilaus who in the midst of a thousand temptation have maintain the entire liberty of he heart and tho ' never insensible of beauty have never be enslave by it be now by charm he least suspect and at a age when he believe himself proof against all the attack of love subdue without know that he be so -- the tender passion steal into he soul by imperceptible degree and under the shape of friendship and paternal affection meet with no opposition from he reason till it become too violent to be restrain then show itself in the whole power of restless wish fear hope and impatience which he have often hear other complain of but not till now experience in himself : all that he before have feel of love be languid at best aim only at enjoyment and in the gratification of that desire be extinguish but the passion he be possess of for louisa be of a different nature and accompany with a respect which would not suffer he to entertain a think in prejudice of she innocence many reason besides he natural aversion to marriage concur to hinder he from make she he wife and as there be yet more to deter he from be the instrument of she dishonor the situation of he mind be very perplexing -- he blush within himself at the inclination he have for a girl whom he have always behave to as a child of he own and who look upon he as a father : not only the disparity of they year make he consider the passion he be possess of as ridiculous there be one circumstance which if at any time a thought of marry she enter into he head immediately extirpate it which be that there be a possibility of she be bear not only of the meanest but the vilest parent who on hear she establishment might appear and claim the right they have in she and lo say he i shall ally myself to perhaps a numerous family of vagabond at least whether it be so or not the manner in which these child be expose be publicly know may furnish a pretence for any wretch to boast a kindred he be therefore determine to suppress a passion which as he have too much honor to seek the gratification of by one way he prudence and character in the world would not allow he to think of by the other : and as absence seem to he the best remedy he send she down into the country again with a precipitation which make she -lrb- wholly ignorant of the real motive -rrb- fear she have do something to offend he at parting she entreat he to let she know if he have be dissatisfy with any thing in she behavior -- wherefore do you ask say he with some emotion which the poor innocent still mistook for displeasure because answer she drop some tear at the same time that you banish I from you presence why would you be glad to continue with I always again demand he yes indeed say she and if you love I as well as you do my brother you would never part with I for i see with what regret you let he go this tender simplicity add such fewel to the fire with which dorilaus be enflame that it almost consume he resolution : he walk about the room some time without be able to speak much less to quiet the agitation he be in at last louisa say he i be only concerned you brother make choice of a avocation so full of danger -- but i never intend to keep he at home with I : -- he should have go to oxford to finish he study and the reason i send you again to the boarding-school be that you may perfect yourself in such thing as you may not yet be mistress of : -- as for any apprehension of my be offend with you i would have you banish they entirely for i assure you i can find nothing in you but what both merit and receive my approbation she seem extremely comfort with these word and the coach be at the door go into it with she accustomed chearfulness leave he in a state which none but those who have experience the severe struggle between a violent inclination and a firm resolution to oppose it can possibly conceive chap ii _ relate the offer make by dorilaus to louisa and the manner of she receive they _ louisa be no sooner go than he wish she with he again and be a thousand time about to send and have she bring back but be as often prevent by the apprehension of she discover the motive -- he be now convince that love do not always stand in need of be indulge to enforce its votary to be guilty of extravagancy -- he have banish the object of he affection from he presence he have paint all the inconvenience of pursue he desire in the worst color they would bear yet all be insufficient -- louisa be absent in reality but she image be ever present to he -- whatever company he engage himself in whatever amusement he endeavor to entertain himself with he could think only of she -- the town without she seem a desart and every thing in it rather seem irksome than agreeable for several month do he endure this cruel conflict but love and nature at last get the victory and all those consideration which have occasion the opposition subside : he find it impossible to recover any tranquility of mind while he continue in this dilemma and therefore yield to the strongest side all the argument he have use with himself in the beginning of he passion seem now weak and trifling : the difference of age which he have think so formidable a objection appear none in the light with which he at present consider it : he be now but in he fortieth year and the temperance he have always observe have hinder any decay either in he look or constitution -- what censure the world might pass on he marry one of she age and obscure birth he think be of little weight when balance with he internal peace -- thus be he enable to answer to himself all that could be offer against make she he wife and have thus settle every thing as he imagine to the satisfaction of he passion become no less resolute in follow the dictate of it than he have be in combate it while there be a possibility of do so to this end he go down to he country seat and as soon as he arrive send to let louisa know he would have she come and pass some time with he she readily obey the summons and find by he manner of receive she that she be no less dear to he than she brother as she have always consider he as a father tho ' she know all she claim in he be compassion she be far from suspect the motive which make he treat she with so much tenderness but he suffer she not long to remain in this happy ignorance as he be walk with she one day in the garden he purposely lead she on that side where he have find horatio and herself in the manner already related and as they come towards the arbor it be here say he that heaven put into my power the opportunity of afford my protection to two person whom i think will not be ungrateful for what i have do -- i hope louisa continue he you will not at least deceive my good opinion of you but as you have always find in I a real friend you will testify the sense you have of my good wish by readily follow my advice in any material point i should be else unworthy sir answer she of the life you have preserve and i flatter myself with be guilty of nothing which should give you cause to call in question either my gratitude or duty i insist but on the former resume he nor can pretend to any claim to the latter -- look on I therefore only as you friend and let I know you sentiment plainly and sincerely on what i think proper to ask you this she have assure he she would do he pursue he discourse in these or the like term : you be now say he arrive at a age when person of you sex ordinarily begin to think of marriage -- i need not ask you if you have ever receive any address for that purpose the manner in which you have live convince I you be yet a stranger to they but i would know of you whether a overture of that kind in favor of a man of honor and who can abundantly endow you with the goods of fortune would be disagreeable to you alas sir reply she blush you command I to answer with sincerity but how can i resolve a question which as yet i have never ask myself -- all that i can say be that i now be happy by you bounty and have never entertain one wish but for the continuance of it on that you may depend say he while you continue to stand in need of it but would it not be more please to find yourself the mistress of a ample fortune and in a condition to do the same good office by other as you have find from I -- in fine louisa the care i have take of you would not be complete unless i see you well settle in the world -- i have therefore provide a husband for you and such a one as i think you can have no reasonable objection to sir it would ill-become I to dispute you will answer she modestly but as i yet be very young and have never have a thought of marriage nor even converse with any who have experience that fate i should be too much at a loss how to behave in it without be allow some time to consider on its respective duty -- i hope therefore sir continue she you will not oblige I to act with too much precipitation in a affair on which the happiness or misery of my whole future life depend you very think it of consequence say he be enough to make you behave so as to allure you happiness with a man of honor and indeed louisa i love you too well to propose one to you whose principle and humor i could not answer for as well as my own yet sir reply she i have read that a union of heart as well as hand be necessary for the felicity of that state -- that there ought to be a simpathy of soul between they and a perfect confidence in each other before the indissoluble knot be tie : -- and this accord to my notion can only be the result of a long acquaintance and accompany with many proof of affection on both side be all young woman to think as you do say he with a smile we would have much fewer marriage they would indeed be happier therefore i be far from condemn you precaution nor would wish you should give yourself to one till well assure he be incapable of treat you with less regard after marriage than before : -- no no louisa i will never press you to become a wife till you shall yourself acknowledge the man i offer to you as a husband be not unworthy of that title thro ' a want of honor fortune or affection as louisa think this must be the work of time the chagrin she feel at the first mention of marriage be greatly dissipate and she tell he that when she be once convinced such a person as he describe honor she so far as to think she merit he affection she would do all in she power to return it the enamoured dorilaus have now bring she to the point he aim at think it best to throw off the mark at once and leave she no longer in suspence -- behold then in I say he the person i have mention : nor think I vain in ascribe those merit to myself which i would wish to be the loadstone of you affection -- my honor i believe you will not call in question : -- my humor you have never find capricious or difficult to please and as for my love you can not but allow the conquer that aversion which myself as well as all the world believe unalterable for a marriage state besides a thousand other scruple oppose my enter into it with you be a proof greater than almost any other man could give you -- there require therefore my dear louisa no time to convince you of what i be or assure you of what i may be and i hope the affection you bear I as a faithful friend and the protector of you innocence will not be diminish on my make this declaration the confusion in which this speech involve she be even impossible to be conceive much less can any word come up to its description : she blush -- she tremble -- she be ready to die between surprize grief and shame : -- fain she would have speak but fear lest what she should say would either lose he friendship or encourage he passion -- each seem equally dreadful to she : -- no word present themselves to she distract mind that she could think proper to utter till he press she several time to reply and seem a little to resent she silence -- oh sir cry she how be it possible for I to make any answer to so strange a proposition -- you be not use to rally my simplicity nor can i think you mean what you now mention if there want no more say he than to prove the sincerity of my wish in this point to gain you approbation of they my chaplain should this moment put it past a doubt and confirm my proposal : -- but pursue he i will not put you modesty to any farther shock at present -- all i intreat be that you will consider on what i have say and what the passion i be possess of merit from you in conclude these word he kiss she with the utmost tenderness and quit she to speak to some man who be at work in another part of the garden leave she to meditate at liberty on this surprize turn in she affair it be indeed necessary he should do so for the various agitation she labor under be so violent as to be near throw she into a swoon -- she no sooner find herself alone than she fly to she chamber and lock herself in to prevent be interrupt by any of the servant and as in all emotion of the mind especially in that of a surprize tear be a very great relief she 's find some ease from the source of she eye -- never have the most dutiful child love the tenderest of father more than she do dorilaus but then it be only a filial affection and the very thought of he regard she with that sort of passion she now find he do have somewhat in they terribly alarming -- all she could do to reconcile herself to what seem to be she fate be in vain -- this generous man who offer I he heart say she be not my father or any way of my blood : -- he have all the accomplishment of he whole sex centered in he -- i could wish to be for ever near he -- all that i be be owe to he goodness -- how wretched must i have be but for he bounty -- what unaccountable prejudice be this then that strike I with such horror at he love -- what maid of birth and fortune equal to he own but would be proud of he address and shall i a poor foundle the creature of he charity not receive the honor he do I with the utmost gratitude -- shall i reject a happiness so far beyond my expectation -- so infinitely above any merit i can pretend to -- what must he think of I if i refuse he -- how madly stupid how blind to my own interest how thankless to he must i appear -- how will he despise my folly -- how hate my ingratitude thus do she reason combat with she prejudice and she suffer much the same agony in endeavor to love he in the manner he desire as he have do to conquer the inclination he have for she and both alike be fruitless yet be she condition much more to be commiserate : he have only to debate within himself whether he should yield or not to the suggestion of he own passion : she to subdue a aversion for what a thousand reason concur to convince she she ought rather to be ambitious of and which in refuse she run the risque of be cast off and abandon to beggary and ruin and what be still more hateful to she be hate by that person who next to she brother she love above the world tho ' in a different way from that which could alone content he dorilaus who have take the disorder he perceive in she for no other than the effect of a surprize which a declaration such as he have make might very well occasion be perfectly contented in he mind and pass that night with much more tranquility than he have do many precede one while he suffer he cruel reason to war against the dictate of he heart but have now wholly give himself up to the latter the sweet delusion fill he with a thousand please idea and he think of nothing but the happiness he should enjoy in the possession of the amiable louisa but how confound be he when the next day accost she with all the tender transport of a lover she turn from he and burst into a flood of tear how be this louisa say he do the offer i make you merit to be treat with disdain have my submit to be you lover forfeit that respect you be wont to pay I as a guardian o do not sir accuse I of such black ingratitude reply she heaven know with what sincere and humble duty i regard you and that i would sooner die than wilfully offend you but if i be so unfortunate as not to be able to obey you in this last command impute it i beseech you to my ill fate and rather pity than condemn I you can not love I then cry he somewhat feircely no otherwise than i have ever do answer she my heart be fill with duty reverence and gratitude of which you goodness be the only source : as for any other sort of love i know not what it be be it a voluntary emotion believe I sir i gladly would give it entrance into my soul but i well see it be of a far different nature yet be you person at you own disposal resume he and when possess of that the flame which burn so fiercely in my breast in time may kindle one in yours in speak these word he take she in he arm and kiss she with a vehemence which the prodigious respect she bear to he as the patron and benefactor of herself and brother could alone have make she suffer -- she eye however sparkle with indignation tho ' she tongue be silent and at last burst from he embrace this sir cry she be not the way to make I think as you would have I as in this action he have no way transgress the rule of decency he could ill brook the find she so much alarm at it and would have testify he resentment have not the excess of he love which be ever accompany with a adequate share of respect oblige he to stifle it well louisa say he look earnestly upon she ungenerously do you requite what i have do for you but i perhaps may bring myself to other sentiment -- none interrupted she embolden by the too great freedom she think he have take with she can be so dreadful to I as those you now seem to entertain the look he give she on hear she speak in this manner make she immediately repent have be so open and in the same breath because pursued she i look on it as the worst evil could befal I that i be compel to oppose they come say he again soften by these last word you will not always oppose they : the fervor and constancy of my passion join with a little yielding on you side will by degree excite a tender impulse in you and whatever be disagreeable at present either in my person or behavior will wear of -- permit I at least to flatter myself so far and refuse I not those innocent endearment i have be accustom to treat you with before you know I as a lover or i indeed suspect i should be so he then kiss she again but tho ' he constrain himself within more bound than before those caress which she receive with pleasure when think they only demonstration of friendship be now irksome as know they the effect of love : she suffer he however to embrace she several time and hold one of she hand close press between he while he endeavor to influence she mind by all the tender argument he passion back with a infinity of wit inspire to all which she make as few reply as possible but he contented himself as love be always flattering with imagine she be less refractory to he suit than when he first declare it every day and almost the whole day do he entertain she on no other subject but gain not the least ground on she inclination and all he could get from she be the wish of be less insensible without the least indication of ever be so in this manner do they live together near three week and how much longer he would have be able to restrain he impatience or she to conceal the extreme regret in be compel to listen to he be uncertain : a law-suit require he presence to town and louisa be in hope of be relieve for some time but he passion be arrive at such a height that he could not support the least absence from she and therefore bring she to london with he so that she persecution cease not he never stir from she but when the most urgent business oblige he to it one night happen to have stay pretty late abroad and in company which occasion he drinking more plentifully than he be accustomed louisa be retire to she chamber in order to go to bed : he love ever uppermost in he head would not permit he to think of sleep without see she accordingly he run up into she room and finding she be not undressed tell she he have something to acquaint she with on which the maid that wait on she withdraw tho ' the passion he be inspire with could not be heighten he behavior now prove it might at least be render more ungovernable by be enflame with wine : he no sooner be alone with she than he throw himself upon she as she be sit in a chair cry o when my angel my dear adore louisa will you consent to make I bless -- by heaven i can no longer wait the tedious formality you modesty demand -- i can not think you hate I and must this night ensure you mine while he speak these word he lip be so closely cement to she 's that have there be no other hindrance it would have be impossible for she to have reply would -- but terrify beyond measure at the wild disorder of he look the expression he make use of and the action that accompany they she want even the power of repulse till see she almost breathless he withdraw he arm which he have throw round she neck and content himself with hold one of she hand -- tell I pursue he when may i hope a recompence for all i have suffer -- i must i will have a end of all these fear of offend -- this cruel constaint -- this distance between we -- few man louisa in the circumstance we both be would like I so long attend a happiness in my power to seize -- trifle not therefore with a passion the consequence of which there be no answering for o sir say she with a tremble voice you can not from the most generous virtuous and honorable man living degenerate into a brutal ravisher -- you will not destroy the innocence you have cherish and which be all that be valuable in the poor louisa she end these word with a flood of tear which together with the sight of the confusion he have occasion make he a little recollect himself and to prevent the wildness of he desire from get the better of those rule he have resolve to observe he let go she hand and have tell she that he would press she no farther that night but expect a more satisfactory answer the next day go out of she chamber and leave she to enjoy what repose she could after the alarm he have give she chap iii _ dorilaus continue he importunity with some unexpected consequence that attend they _ poor louisa conceal the distraction she be in as much as possible she could from the maid who immediately come into the room on dorilaus have quit it and suffer she to undress and put she to bed as usual but be no sooner there than instead of compose herself to sleep she begin to reflect on what he have say : -- the word _ that there be no answering for the consequence of a passion such as he _ give she the most terrible idea -- he action too this night seem would to threaten she with all a virgin have to fear -- she know he a man of honor but think she have too much reason to suspect that if she persist in refuse to be he wife that passion which have influence he contrary to he character to make she such a offer would also be too potent for any consideration of she to restrain he from proceed to extremity have debate every thing within she own mind she think she ought not to continue a day longer in the power of a man who love she to this extravagant degree : where to go indeed she know not -- she have no friend or even acquaintance to whom she might repair or hope to be receive -- how should she support herself then -- which way procure even the most common necessaries of life -- this be a dreadful prospect yet appear less so than that she would avoid : even starve lose its horror when compare either to be compel to wed a man whom she could not affect as a husband or by refuse he run the risque of forfeit she honor -- she therefore hesitate but a small time and have once form the resolution of quit dorilaus 's house immediately set about put it into execution in the first place not to be ungrateful to he as a benefactor she sit down and write the following letter to be leave for he on she table : sir ` heaven have render I of a disposition utterly incapable of receive the honor you would do I it would be a ill return for all the unmerited favor you have heap upon I to prolong the disquiet i have unhappily occasion by continue in you presence -- besides sir the education you have vouchsafe to give I have be such as inform I a person of my sex make but a odd figure while in the power of one of yours possess of the sentiment you be ' ` these sir be the reason which oblige I to withdraw and i hope when well consider will enough apologize for my do so to keep you from hate what you have but too much loved for i beseech you to believe a great truth which be that the most terrible idea i carry with I be lest while i fly the one i should incur the other and that wheresoever my good or ill star shall conduct I my first and last prayer shall be for the peace health and prosperity of my most generous and ever honor patron and benefactor ' ` judge favourably therefore of this action and rather pity than condemn the unfortunate louisa ' have seal and direct this she dress herself in one of the least remarkable and plainest suit she have take nothing with she but a little linnen which she cram into she pocket and so sit wait till she hear some of the family be stir then go down stair and be see by one of the footman she tell he she be not very well and be go to take a little walk in hope the fresh air might relieve she he offer to wait upon she but she refuse say she choose to go alone thus have she make she escape but when in the street be seize with very alarming apprehension -- she be little acquaint with the town and know not which way to turn in search of a retreat -- resolve however to go far enough at least from the house she have quit she wander on almost tire to death without stop any where till chance direct she to a retired nook where she see a bill for lodgings on one of the door -- here she go in and find the place convenient for she present circumstance hire a small but neat chamber tell the people of the house that she be come to town in order to get a service and till she hear of one to she liking would be glad to do any needle-work she should be employ in the landlady who happen to be a good motherly sort of woman reply that she be please with she countenance or she would not have take she in without enquire into she character and as she seem not to be desirous of a idle life she would recommend she to those that should find she work if she stay with she never so long this be joyful news to we fair fugitive and she bless heaven for so favourable a beginning of she adventure the woman be punctual to she promise and be acquaint with a very great milliner soon bring she more work than she could do without encroach into those hour nature require for repose : but she seem not to regret any fatigue to oblige the person who employ she and send home all she do so neat so curious and well work that the milliner easily see she have not be accustom to do it for bread and be very desirous of have she into the house and secure she to herself louisa think it would be live with less care agree to go on this condition that she should be free to quit she in case any offer happen of wait upon a lady this be consent to by the other who tell she that since she have that design she could no where be so likely to succeed as at she house which be very much frequent by the greatest lady in the kingdom she have the most curiosity of any woman of she trade which they come there to raffle for on this louisa take leave of she kind landlady who have take a great fancy to she and believe it would be for she advantage be not sorry to part with she a quite new scene of life now present itself to she : -- she find indeed the milliner have not make a vain boast for she house be a kind of rendezvous where all the young and gay of both sex daily resort -- it be here the marquis of w -- r lose he heart for a time to the fine mr s -- ge : -- here that the duke of g -- n first declare he amorous inclination for mr c -- r : -- here that the seemingly virtuous lady b -- n receive the address of that agreeable rover mr d -- n : -- here that the beautiful dutchess of m -- give that encouragement which all the world have sigh for to the more fortunate than constant mr c -- : in fine it might properly enough be call the theater of gallantry where love and wit join to display they several talent either in real or pretended passion louisa usually sit at work in a back parlor behind that where the company be but into which some of they often retire to talk to each other with more freedom this give she a opportunity of see in what manner too many of the great world pass they time and how small regard some of they pay to the marriage vow : everyday present she with example of husband who behave with no more than a cold civility to they own wife and carry the fervor of they address to those of other man and of wife who seem rather to glory in than be ashamed of a train of admirer how senseless would these people think I say she to herself do they know i choose rather to work for my bread in mean obscurity than yield to marry where i could not love -- tenderness mutual affection and constancy i find be thing not think requisite to the happiness of a wed state and interest and convenience alone consult yet be she far from repent have reject dorilaus or be in the lead influence by the example of other -- the adventure she be witness of make she indeed more know of the world but be far from corrupt those excellent moral she have receive from nature and have be so well improve by a strict education that she not only love virtue for its own sake but despise and hate vice tho ' disguise under the most specious pretence she youth beauty and a certain sprightliness in she air be too engaging to be in the house of such a woman as mr c -- ge -lrb- for so this court-milliner be call -rrb- without be very much take notice of and tho ' most of the gentleman who come there have some particular object in view yet that do not hinder they from say soft thing to the pretty louisa as often as they have opportunity among the number of those who pretend to admire she be mr b -- n afterwards lord f -- h but he address be so far from make any impression on she in favor of he person or suit that the one be wholly indifferent to she and the other so distasteful that to avoid be persecute with it she entreat mr c -- ge to permit she to work above stair that she might be out of the way of all such solicitation for the future either from he or any other this request be easily comply with and the rather because she who know not the strength of she journey-woman 's resolution nor the principle she have be breed in be sometimes in fear of lose so great a help to she business by the temptation that might be offer in a place so much expose to sight mr b -- n no sooner miss she than he enquire with a good deal of earnestness for she and on mr c -- ge 's tell he she be go away from she house become so impatient to know where and on what account she have leave she that this woman think it would be of advantage to she to own the truth -lrb- for she do nothing without that view -rrb- turn off the imposition with a smile and say that perceive the inclination he have for she she have send she upstairs that no other address might be a hindrance to he design -- this pleased he very well and he run directly to the room where he be inform she be and after some little discourse which he think be become enough from a person of he condition to one of she 's begin to treat she with freedom which she could not help resist with more fierceness than he have be accustom to from woman of a much higher rank but as he have no great notion of virtue especially among people of she sphere he mistake all she say or do for artifice and imagine she enhance the merit of the gift only to enhance the recompence he tell she he would make she a handsome settlement and offer as a earnest of he future gratitude a purse of money the generous maid fire with a noble disdain at a proposal which she look on only as a additional insult strike down the purse with the utmost indignation and cry she be not of the number of those who think gold a equivalent for infamy and that mean as she appear not all he wealth should bribe she to a dishonourable action at first he endeavor to laugh she out of such idle notion as he call they and be so far from be rebuff at any thing she say that he begin to kiss and toy with she more freely than before tell she he would bring she into a better humor but he be wholly deceive in he expectation if he have any of the nature he pretend for she become so irritated at be treat in this manner that she call out to the servant to come to she assistance and protect she would not stay a hour longer in the house if she could not be secure from such impertinency on which he say she be a silly romantic fool and fling out of the room mr c -- ge hearing there have be some bustle come up soon after and find louisa in tear : she immediately complain of mr b -- n 's behavior to she and say tho ' she acknowledge herself under many obligation to she for the favor she have confer on she she could not think of remain in a place where tho ' she could not say she virtue have any severe trial because she have a natural detestation to crime of the kind that gentleman and some other have mention yet she person be liable to be affront the milliner who be surprize to hear she talk in this manner but who understand she trade perfectly well answer that he be the best condition civil gentleman in the world -- that she do not know how it happen -- that she be certain indeed he love she and that it be in he power to make she a very happy woman if she be incline to accept he offer -- but she would perswade she to nothing these kind of discourse create a kind of abhorrence in louisa as they plainly shew she what before she have some reason to believe that she be in the house of one who would think nothing a crime that she find it she own interest to promote however she think it would be imprudent to break too abruptly with she and contented herself for the present with encase she promise that neither mr b -- n nor any other person should for the future give she the least interruption of the like sort from this day however she be continually ruminate how she should quit she house without run the risque of disoblige she so far as not to be employ by she for tho ' she find herself at present free from any of those importunity to which both by nature and principle she be so averse yet she could not answer to herself the continue in a place where virtue be treat as a thing of little or no consequence and where she know not how soon she might again be subject to affront amidst these meditation the thought of dorilaus frequently intervene : she reflect on the obligation she have to he and the mighty difference between the moral of that truly noble and generous man and most of those she have see at mr c -- ge 's : she wonder at herself at the antipathy she have to he as a husband whom she so dearly love and honor as a friend yet nothing could make she wish to be again on the same term with he she have lately be it also greatly add to she affliction that she know not how to direct to she brother for at the time of he departure little suspicious of have any occasion to change the place of she abode she have leave the care of that entirely to dorilaus she be one morning very much lose in think on the odd circumstance of she fortune when a gazette happen to lye upon the table she cast she eye without design upon the follow advertisement ` whereas a young gentlewoman have lately think fit to abscond from she best friend and with the most diligent search that could possibly be make after she have not yet be hear of this be to acquaint she that if she please to return she shall hereafter have no disturbance of that nature which it be suppose occasion she withdraw herself but live entirely accord to she own inclination and this the advertiser hereof give he word and honor -lrb- neither of which she have any cause to doubt -rrb- faithfully to adhere to ' ` it shall also be at she choice to live either at the house she quit or to be again under the care of that gentlewoman who be entrust with she education : she be therefore request to conceal herself no longer lest she youth beauty and inexperience of the town should betray she innocence into those very snare she fear to fall into ' the very beginning of this paragraph give she a conjecture it be mean for no other than herself and the more she read the more she grow convinced of it -- it must be so cryed she every word -- every circumstance confirm it -- how unhappy be i that i can not return so perfect a affection -- instead of detest my ingratitude he only fear i should receive the punishment of it -- what man but dorilaus would behave thus to the creature of he benevolence -- if i have any merit do not i owe they to he goodness -- my brother and myself two poor expose and wretched foundling what but he bounty rear would we to what we be -- hard fate -- unlucky passion that drive I from he presence and protection yet would she say again if he have indeed subdue that passion -- if he resolve to think of I as before he entertain it if i be certain he would receive I as a child how great would be the blessing this confederation have so much effect on she that she be half determine to comply with the advertisement but when she remember to have read that where love be sincere and violent it require a length of time to be erase and that those possess of it be incapable of know even they own strength and as he have say to she himself _ that there be no answering for the consequence _ she grow instantly of another mind and think that put herself again into the power of such a passion be run too great a hazard the continual agitation of she mind join to want of air a quite different way of life and perhaps fitting more closely to work than she have be accustom throw she at length into a kind of languish indisposition which tho ' it do not confine she to she bed occasion a loss of appetite and frequent fainting which be very alarming to she mr c -- ge be extremely concern to observe this change in she and would have the opinion of she own physician who say that she have symptom of a approach consumption and that it be absolutely necessary she should be remove into the country for some time louisa readily comply with this advice not only because she imagine it might be of service for the recovery of she health but also as it furnish she with a pretence for leave mr c -- ge 's house to which she be determine to return no more as a boarder the good woman with whom she have lodge at first recommend she to a friend of she 's at windsor where she immediately go and be very kindly receive chap iv _ louisa become acquaint with a lady of quality part of whose adventure be also related and go to travel with she _ change of place afford but small relief to those whose distemper be in the mind : louisa carry with she too many perplexing thought to be easily shake off tho ' the queen and court be then at windsor she have the opportunity of see a great many of the gay world pass daily by she window -- there also lodge in the same house with she a young widow of quality who be visit by person of the first rank but as she be not of a condition to make one in any of these conversation she reap no other satisfaction from they than what the eye afford as she be not however of a temper to indulge melancholy she make it she endeavor to banish as much as possible all idea which be displease from she mind : to this end a fine harpsicord happen to stand in the dining-room whenever the lady be abroad she go in and divert herself with play she be one day entertain the woman of the house with a tune which she accompany with she voice when the lady return sooner than be expect and hear the instrument before she come up stair would need know who it be have be make use of it for louisa hurry out of the room before she come in : the landlady as there be no occasion to disguise the truth tell she that it be a young woman who not be very well have come down into the country for air she have have a excellent education i be certain say the lady -lrb- who henceforward we shall call melanthe -rrb- for in my life i never hear any body play or sing better : -- i must be acquaint with she on which the other say she would let she know the honor she intend she that very evening as great lady no sooner think of any thing but they must have it perform be louisa send for into she apartment and she countenance and behavior so well second the good impression she skill in music have begin that melanthe become charm would with she and from that time oblige she to come to she every morning and whenever she be without company make she dine and sup with she be curious to know she circumstance louisa make no scruple of acquaint she with the truth only instead of relate how she have be expose in she infancy say that have the misfortune to be deprive of she parent it be she intention to wait on a lady and till she hear of one who would accept she service she have work would at she needle melanthe then ask if she would live with she to which the other gladly answer she should think herself happy in such a lady but you must go abroad then say she for i be weary of england and be prepare to travel : as it be a route of pleasure only i shall stay just as long as i find any thing new and entertaining in one place then go to another till i be tire of that and so on i know not how long for unless my mind alter very much i shall not come back in some year louisa be perfectly transport to hear she say this she have a great desire to see foreign part and think she never could have a better opportunity : she express the pleasure she should take in attend she wherever she go with so much politeness and sincerity that melanthe tell she it should be she own fault if she ever quit she and withal assure she she never would treat she in any other manner than a companion and that tho ' she would make she a yearly allowance for cloath and card-money yet she would expect no other service from she than fidelity to she secret and affection to she person from the moment this agreement be make the young louisa regain she complection and she appetite and be now initiate into the family of this lady have no longer any care to take than to oblige she a thing not difficult melanthe be good-natured and strongly prepossess in favor of she new friend for so she vouchsafe to call she and to use she accordingly as a proof of it she make she in a very short time the confident of she dearest secret : they be one day sit together when accidentally some mention be make of the power of love you be too young louisa say melanthe to have experience the wonderful effect of that passion in yourself and therefore can not be expect to have much compassion for what it can inflict on other indeed madam answer she tho ' i never have yet see a man who give I a moment 's pain on that score yet i believe there be no emotion whatever so strong as those of love and that it be capable of influence people of the best sense to thing which in they nature they be most averse to well my dear resume the other since i find you have so just a notion of it i will confide in you discretion so far as to let you know that but for a ungrateful man i have not look on my native country as a desart and resolve to seek a cure for my ill-treated and abused tenderness in foreign part my quality continue she i need not inform you of you have doubtless hear that my family yield to few in antiquity and that there be a estate belong to it sufficient to support the dignity of its title but my father have many child could not give very great portion to the daughter : i be therefore dispose of much against my inclination to a nobleman whom my unlucky charm have so much captivate as to make he not only take I with no other dowry than my cloath and jewel but also to settle a large jointure upon I which he be dead i at present enjoy i can not say that all the obligation he lay upon I could engage a reciprocal regard : -- i behave with indifference to he while live and little lament he when dead : not that i be prepossess in favor of any other man -- my heart entirely free be reserve to be the conquest of the too charming perfidious henricus who arrive soon after my lord 's decease and bring with he all the accomplishment which every different court he have visit could afford join would to the most enchanting person nature ever form soon make I know i be not that insensible creature i have think myself i happen to be at court when he come to kiss she majesty 's hand on he return and whether it be that my eye testify too much the admiration this first sight of he strike I with or that he really discover something more attractive in I than any lady in the presence i know not but he seem to distinguish I in a particular manner and i hear he say to my lord g -- n in a whisper that i be the finest woman he have ever see but what give I more pleasure than even this praise be a agreement i hear make between he and the same lord to go that evening to a raffle at mr c -- rt-s -- r 's i be one of those who have put in tho ' if i have not i should certainly have go for a second sight of he who when he go out of the drawing-room seem to have leave I but half myself in fine i go and have there want any thing to have entirely vanquish I my conqueror 's manner of address have do it with a form less agreeable -- o louisa pursue she with a sigh if you have never see or hear the charming henricus you can have no notion of what be excellent in man such flow wit -- such softness in he voice and air -- but there be no describe what he be he seem all transport at meeting I there among a number of lady i alone engross he : he scarce speak to any other and be so fortunate to win the raffle which be a fine inlaid indium cabinet instead of send it to he own house he privately order he servant to leave it at mine lord g -- n have as he afterwards tell I inform he where i live and also all the particulars he want to know concern I i be prodigiously surprize when i come home and find the cabinet which my woman imagine i have win by its be bring thither it be indeed a piece of gallantry i have no reason to expect from one so perfect a stranger to I and this join with the many complaisant thing he say to I at mr c -- rt-f -- r 's flattered my vanity enough to make I think he be no less charm with I than i too plainly find i be with he i sleep little that night and pretty early the next morning receive a billet from he to this effect : madam ' i think the cabinet we raffle for be more properly the furniture of a lady 's closet than mine especially one who must daily receive a great number of such epistle as it be doubtless intend by the maker to contain : happy should i think myself if any thing of mine might find room among those which for they wit and elegance may be more worthy of prefer tho ' none can be for they sincerity more so than those which be dictate by the eternally devoted heart of henricus ' you can not imagine my dear louisa how delighted i be with these few line i enclose they indeed in the cabinet give I by the author of they but lay up they meaning in my heart : -- i be quite alert the whole day but infinitely more so when in the evening my admire henricus make I a visit introduce by lord h -- who have be one of my late husband 's particular friend and have ever keep a good correspondence with I henricus take not the least notice either of the cabinet or letter before he and as i imagine he have he reason for it i too be silent on that head he take the opportunity however while lord h -- be speak to a young lady who happen to be with I to ask permission to wait on I with the hope of be receive on he own score as he be now on that of he friend i tell he that merit such as he be sufficient to recommend he any where and besides i have a obligation to he which i ought to acknowledge this be all either of we have time to say but it be enough to make I convinced he desire a more particular conversation and he that it would not be unwelcome to I thus begin a acquaintance equally fatal to my peace of mind and reputation and have say that it would be needless to repeat the circumstance of it therefore shall only tell you i be so infatuate with my passion that i never give myself the trouble to examine into the nature of he pretension and lull would with the vow he make of everlasting love resent not that he forbear press to that ceremony which could alone ensure it : -- yes my louisa i will not wrong he so far as to say he deceive I in this point for tho ' he protest with the most solemn imprecation that he would never address any either woman than myself yet he never once mention marriage to I -- alass he too well see into my heart and that all my faculty be too much he to be able to refuse he any thing : -- even so it prove -- he triumph over all in my power to yield -- nay be so far subdue that i neither regret my loss nor use any endeavor to conceal it -- vain of be he at any rate i think he love more glory to I than either fame or virtue and while i be know to enjoy the one despise whatever censure i incur for parting with the other : -- in the mall the play-house the ring at bath or tunbridge he be always with I nor would any thing indeed have be a diversion to I have he be absent for upward of a year i have no reason to complain of he want of assiduity to I tho ' i have since hear even in that time he have other amours with woman who carry they on with more prudence than i be mistress of but i have afterwards a stab proof of he insincerity and inconstancy perceive a great alteration in he behavior that he visit I less frequently and when he come the ardor he be accustom to treat I with still more and more languid and enforced i upbraid he in term which tho ' they shew more love than resentment and have he retain any tolerable remains of tenderness for I must have be rather oblige than the contrary he affect to take extremely ill and tell I plainly that nothing be so dear to he as he peace -- that he be not of a temper to endure reproach and that if i desire the continuance of we amour i must be satisfy with he as he be these cool and indeed insolent reply make I almost distract and begin to suspect he have some new engagement i talk to he in a manner as if i have be assure of it : -- he perhaps imagine it be so make no effort to cure my jealousy but behave with so cruel a indifference as confirm my apprehension resolve to be convinced whether i really have any rival or not i employ spy to observe where-ever he go and to whom but alass there require little pain to acquire the intelligence i fight -- i be soon inform that he be every day with the daughter of a little mechanic -- that he make she very rich present procure a commission in the army for one of she brother and in fine that he be as much devoted to she as a man of he inconstant temper could be to any woman how severe a mortification be this to my pride but it have this good attend it that it very much abate my love : -- to be abandon for so mean a creature and who have nothing but youth and a tolerable face to recommend she shewed such a want of taste as well as gratitude as render despicable in my eye what have lately engross all my love and admiration -- the moment i receive the information i send for he -- and force my countenance to a serenity my heart be a stranger to tell he it be only to take a last leave of a person whom i have be so far mistake in as to think deserving my affection : that i desire to see he once more but have now see my error desire he would desist he visit for the future he ask I with the same calmness he have lately behave with what whim i have get in my head now i who have before determine not to feed my rival 's pride by shew any jealousy of she only reply that as amours such as ours have be must have a end some time or other -- i think none could be more proper than the present because i believe both of we could do it without pain answer for yourself madam cry he with some emotion for i could perceive my behavior have a little flung he vanity and resolute to give he in my turn all the mortification in my power nay say i with a disdainful toss of my head i do not enquire into you sentiment -- it be sufficient mine be to break entirely off with you -- neither be it any concern to I how you may resent this alteration in my conduct or dispose of yourself hereafter but i once more assure you with my usual frankness that i now can see none of those perfection my foolish fancy formerly find in you and can not be complaisant enough to counterfeit a tenderness i neither feel nor think you worthy of the surprize he be in keep he silent for some moment but recover himself as well as he could he tell I that if the levity of my nature have make I cease to love he he could not have expect endearment should be convert into affront that if i be determine to see he no more he must submit and should endeavor to make himself as easy as he could under the misfortune these last word be utter with a kind of sneer which be very provoking however i restrain my passion during the little time he stay but as soon as i find myself alone give it vent in tear and exclamation -- since which i have be mere at peace within myself for tho ' i can not say i hate he i be now far from love he and hope that time and absence may bring I to a perfect indifference thus louisa continue she you see the beginning and end of a adventure which have make some noise in town to be out of which i have take a resolution to travel till the whole shall be forget and i have entirely root out of my heart all manner of consideration for this ungrateful man louisa thank she for the condescension I have make she in entrust she with so important a secret and say every thing she could in praise of the resolution she have take to leave england for a time not only because it be exactly conformable to she own desire but also that she think it so laudable in itself melanthe then assure she that she be not capable of change she mind in this particular and that she equipage be get ready at london for that purpose so that she believe they should embark in a few day louisa on hearing this say that she must then provide herself with some thing it would be necessary for she to have in order to appear in the station she ladyship be please to place she but the other who as may be see by she history never preserve a medium in any thing would not suffer she to be at the least expence on that account but take the care of furnish she with every thing on herself and accordingly send a man and horse to town directly to she mercer 's draper 's milliner 's and other tradesman with order to send down silk lace holland and whatever else be requisite which be bring be put to be make fit for wear by workwoman at windsor so that now we louisa make as good a figure and have as great a variety of habit as when under the guardianship of dorilaus and to complete she happiness this new benefactress grow every day more and more delighted with she company all be now prepare they come to london where they lay but one night before they take shipping for helvoetsluy in holland where be safely land they proceed to utrecht and so to aix-la-chappelle there they stay some week for the sake of the water air and good company and louisa think it so pleasant that she would have be glad not to have remove for some time longer but melanthe be yet restless in she mind and require frequent change of place here it be however that louisa think she might venture to write to dorilaus to ease he of that kind concern she doubt not but he be in for she welfare by the advertisement already mention in the gazette the purport of she letter be as follow : _ ever honor sir _ ` child of you bounty as i be i flatter myself that in spight of my enforc would disobedience it would be a trouble to you to hear i should do any thing unworthy of that education you be please to bestow on I : i therefore take the liberty of acquaint you that heaven have raise I a protectress in a lady of quality with whom i now be as you will see by the date of this at aix-la-chappelle as all the favor i receive from she or all the good that shall happen during my whole life be and will be entirely owe to you as the fountain-head it will be always my inclination as well as duty to pay you the tribute of grateful thanks -- poor recompence alas for all you have do for I yet those with my incessant prayer to heaven be all in the power of _ you most dutiful _ louisa ' she take no notice of the advertisement not only as she could not be positive it related to herself as also because she think if he be certain she have read it he might resent she not answer it as discover a too great diffidence of he honor she add however a postscript entreat he to let she brother know that whatever happen he should have no reason to find fault with she conduct after they leave aix-la-chappelle they take bye road to avoid the army yet notwithstanding all they care they now and then meet party who be out on forage but as it happen they be always under the conduct of officer who prevent any ill accident so that we traveller meet with no manner of interruption but arrive safely at the magnificent city of vienna where be at that time a extreme gay court afford every thing capable of divert a much more settle melancholy than either melanthe or she fair companion be possess of the arch-dutchess mary elizabeth and mary anna josepha afterward queen of portugal have frequent ball and entertainment in they different drawing-room to all which melanthe be a stranger and a woman of quality be invite : she keep she promise with louisa and treat she as a young lady whose friendship for she and a desire of see the world have engage to accompany she she be receive and respect as such and by this mean have a opportunity of shew the skill she have in dancing singing music and indeed all the accomplishment that a woman bear and educate to the best expectation be usually instruct in as neither she lady nor herself understand the german language and she speak infinitely the best french she conversation be the most agreeable which join with a most engaging manner and a peculiar sweetness in she voice attract all those civility which the rank of the other demand possess of so many charm it would have be strange if in a city throng would like vienna with young nobleman who be continually come from all part of the empire she have live without some who pretend to somewhat more than mere admiration but she heart have not refuse the worthy dorilaus to become the conquest of a german nor be it here she be ordain to experience those anxiety in herself she could but imperfectly conceive by the description she have from other melanthe however whose sole aim be to drive all perplexing thought from she mind encourage a great number of visitor so that she lodgings seem a perfect theater of gallantry and louisa have she share in all the amusement this lady prepare for the reception of those that come to see she or be contrived for she entertainment by other past she time in the most gay and agreeable manner imaginable and by this mean acquire the knowledge of almost the only thing she before be ignorant in how to receive a multiplicity of company yet to behave so be each should imagine themselves most welcome -- to seem perfectly open without discover any thing improper to be reveal -- to use all decent freedom with the man yet not encourage the least from they and to seem to make a friend of every woman she converse with without put truth in any -- and in fine all the little policy which make up the art of what be call a polite address and which be not to be attain without a acquaintance with the court and great world this i say we amiable foundling be now well ver would in and practice among those who she find make a practice of it but yet retain the same sincerity of mind love of virtue and detestation of vice she bring with she from the house of dorilaus : -- neither be she youth too much dazle with the exterior splendor she behold and tho ' she be well enough pleased with it yet it do not in the least take she off from the duty of religion or inspire she with any ambitious or aspiring wish to become what the remembrance of what she be forbid any probable expectation of she know the present fashion of she life be not a assure settlement and therefore set not she heart upon it few at she year would have have the like prudence or in time armed themselves as she do against any change that might befal she in this happy situation let we leave she for a while : the young horatio claim he share of attention and it be time to see what encouragement and success he martial ardor meet with on the bank of the danube chap v _ horatio 's reception by the officer of the army he behavior in the battle he be take prisoner by the french he treatment among they and many other particulars _ the extreme graceful person of horatio he youth handsome equipage and the letter send by dorilaus to several of the principal officer in he favor engage he a reception answerable to he wish : but none be of greater service than the recommendation he have to colonel brindfield who be in great favor with the duke of marlborough be highly respect by the whole army this gentleman make he dine frequently with he and testify the regard he have for dorilaus by do all the good office he could to a youth whom he perceive by he letter he have a great concern for he not only introduce he to the acquaintance of many officer of condition but take a opportunity of present he to the duke himself give at the same time he grace a account that he be a gentleman whose inclination to arm and the honor of serve under he grace have make he renounce all other advantage for the hope of do something worthy of he favor the duke look all the time he be speak very attentively on the young horatio and finding something in he air that corroborate the colonel 's description be please to say that he be charm would with he early thirst after same and then turn toward he you will soon pursue he have a opportunity of see how the face of war look near at hand : -- i can tell you that you must not always expect smile no my lord reply he without be at all daunt at the presence of so great a man but where we love all countenance be agreeable he arrive indeed opportunely to be a witness of the danger of that glorious campaign which bring such shame to the french such honor to the english and such real advantage to the empire prince eugene of savoy and prince lewi of baden be come to the duke 's quarter which be then at mondesheim to consult on proper operation the result be that the duke and prince lewi should join army and command each day alternately and that prince eugene should head a separate army and repair towards philipsburg to defend the passage of the rhine the line of stolhoffen and the country of wirtenberg the two army join at westerstretton thence proceed by easy march towards donawert between which and scellenberg the enemy be encamp fatigue as they be the duke make they pass over a little river and endeavor to force the intrenchment which enterprize succeed notwithstanding all the disadvantage the confederate army be in and the other be oblige to retire with great precipitation many of whom be drown in endeavor to pass the danube in this action be we young soldier unlisted and have the glory to be signalize by two remarkable accident one be that press among the foremost in this hazardous attempt he have he hat take off by a cannon ball and the other be that see a standard about to be take by the enemy the person who carry it happen to be kill would he run among those who be carry it away and be second by some other retrieve that badge of english honor and as this be do in sight of the duke he ride up to he directly and present it to he take it for you pain cry he you have venture hard and well deserve the prize there be no time for thanks the duke who be almost every where at once be immediately go where he find he presence necessary and horatio return to take the place of the dead cornet doubly animated by the encouragement he have receive this victory open a way into the elector of bavarium 's dominion that poor country be terribly ravage no less than 300 town village and castle be utterly consume by a detachment of horse and dragoon the duke send for that purpose some old officer tell horatio that now would be the time to make he fortune if he go with these squadron there be many rich thing which would fall to the share of the plunderer to which he answer that he come to fight for the honor of he country and not to rob for its disgrace this they laugh at and endeavor to make he sensible that the take away a enemy 's treasure be to take away they strength but all they could say be ineffectual he be not to be perswade out of what he think reason and justice : and this conversation be afterward repeat to the duke he smil would and say he be yet too young to know the value of money after this prince lewi of baden divide from the duke in order to undertake the siege of ingoldstadt we young cornet attend he grace to the relief of prince eugene who expect to be attack by the unite army of bavarian and french then encamp near hockstadt it would be needless to give any description of this famous battle few of my reader but must be acquaint with it so i shall only say that among the number of those few prisoner the french have to boast of in attonement for so great a defeat be the young brave horatio who fall to the lot of the baron de la valiere nephew to the marquis of sille this nobleman be extremely take with he person and behavior treat he in the politest manner and tho ' he carry he with he into france assure he that it be more for the pleasure of entertaining he there than any other consideration horatio be not much afflict at this misfortune because it give he a opportunity of see a country he have hear so much commend and also to make himself master of a language which tho ' he understand he speak but imperfectly the baron be not only one of the most gallant but also one of the best humor man in the world he spare nothing during the whole time they tarry in he quarter nor in they journey to pari which might contribute to make he prisoner easy under he present circumstance and among other thing often say to he if you and some other have fall under the common chance of war you have yet the happiness of know you army in general have be victorious and that there be infinitely a greater number of ours who against they will must see england than there be of yours conduct into france on they arrival horatio write a account to dorilaus of all have happen to he not doubt but he would use he interest to have he either mention when there should come a exchange of prisoner or that he would randsom he himself but receive no answer he conclude he letter by some accident have miscarry and send another but that meet the same fate as the former he write a third accompany with one to he sister direct to the boarding-school where he imagine she still be : to this last after some time he have the follow return from the governess : sir ' a letter direct for miss louisa come to my house i be in debate with myself what to do with it that young lady have be go from I last September since which time i have never hear any thing of she : -- at last i send it to dorilaus 's country seat by a messenger who bring it to I again with intelligence that he be go with some friend into the north of ireland and that it be probable they have take miss with they : -- i then think proper to open it believe she have no secret i might not be entrust with and find it come from you could do no less than give you this information to prevent you be under any surprize for not receive answer to you letter i be sorry to find by yours that you have have such ill success in you first campaign but would not have you be cast down since you need not doubt but on the return of dorilaus you will have remittance for you ransom or whatever else you may have occasion for ' _ i be _ sir _ you most humble and obedient servant _ a trainwell this letter make he perfectly contented he have no reason to question the continuance of dorilaus 's goodness to he nor that he should attend this new proof of it any longer than the return of that gentleman to england should make he know the occasion he now have for it he therefore have no anxious thought to interrupt the pleasure the place he be in afford in such variety he be every evening with the baron either at court the opera the comedy or some other gay scene of entertainment be introduce to the best company and he young heart charm would with the politeness and gallantry of that nation and the little vanity to which a person of such early year be incident be flatter with the complaisance he be treat with give he in a short time a very strong affection for they but there be yet another and more powerful motive which render he captivity not only please but almost destroy in he a inclination ever to see he native country again the baron de la valiere have long be passionately in love with a young lady who be one of the maid of honor to king jame 's queen : he go almost every day to st germain in order to prosecute he address and frequently take horatio with he the motive of he first introduce he to that court be perhaps the vanity of shew he that no reverse of fate could make the french regardless of what be due to royalty since the chevalier st george seem would to want no requisite of majesty but the power but he afterwards find the pleasure he take in those visit infinitely surpass what he could have expect and that he heart have a attachment which make he no sooner quit that palace than he would ask with impatience when they should go thither again the baron have a great deal of penetration and as those who feel the power of love in themselves can easily perceive the progress it make in other a very few visit confirm he that horatio have find something there more attractive than all he could behold elsewhere : nor be he long at a loss to discover among the number or beauty which compose the train of the queen and princess which of they it be that have lay he prisoner under a more lasting captivity than war have do princess louisa marium teresa daughter of the late king jame be then but in she thirteenth year the lady who attend she be all of they much of the same age and to shew the respect the french have for this royal family tho ' in misfortune be also the daughter of person whose birth and fortune might have do honor to the service of the greatest empress in the world nor be any of they want in those perfection which attract the heart beyond the pomp of blood or title but she who have influence that of we horatio be likewise in the opinion of those who feel not she charm in the same degree he do allow to excel she fair companion in every captivating grace and to yield in beauty to none but the princess herself who be esteem a prodigy this amiable lady be call charlotta de palfoy only daughter to the baron of that name and have from she most early year discover a genius above what be ordinarily find in she sex have be educate by she indulgent parent in such a manner as nature leave nothing for want of the improvement of art yet do not all the accomplishment she be mistress of give she the least air of haughtiness on the contrary there be a certain sweetness of temper in she which give a double charm to every thing she say or do : she be all affability courtesy and chearfulness she could not therefore avoid treat so agreeable a stranger as horatio with all imaginable mark of civility but she have be a very small time acquaint with he before she liking ripen into a kind of tenderness little inferior to what he be possess of for she and tho ' both be then too young to be able to judge of the nature of this grow inclination yet they find they love without know to what end as both the chevalier st george and the princess he sister be instruct in the english language and besides many of they court be native of great britain whose loyalty have make they follow the exil would monarch the french belong to they have also a ambition to speak in the same dialect : mademoiselle charlotta be but lately come among they have not yet attain the proper accent any more than horatio have that of the french so they agree that to improve each other in the different language he should always speak to she in french and she should answer he in english this succeed not only for the purpose it be intend but likewise draw on a greater intimacy between they than might otherwise have happen at least in so short a time the baron have a real friendship for horatio rejoice to find he have so powerful a attachment to continue among they and without take any notice how far he see into he sentiment encourage he visit at st germain all he could thus indulge in every thing he wish he begin insensibly to lose all desire of return to england and receive no letter either from dorilaus or he sister be as it be wean from that affection he have formerly bear to they and in the room of that the new friendship he be every day contracting take up he mind he be indeed use with so much love and respect by people in the most eminent station to whom the baron have introduce he that it would have be ungrateful in he not to have return it with the greatest good-will express one day some surprize at be so far forget by he friend in england de la valiere tell he that he would not have he look on himself as any other than a guest in france and that if he choose to quit that country he should not only be at he liberty to return to england whenever he please but also should be furnish with a sum sufficient for the expence of he journey but add that the offer he now make of deprive himself of so agreeable a companion be a piece of self-denial than which there could not be a greater proof of a disinterested regard horatio reply in the manner this generosity demand and say that if there be any thing irksome to he in france it be only he inability of return the favor he have receive : believe I sir pursue he be i master of a fortune sufficient to put I above the necessity of receive the obligation i now do it would not be in the power of all i leave in england to prevail on I to return -- it be here and in the society of that company i at present thro ' you means enjoy that i would wish to pass my whole life the baron then tell he he would find a way to make all thing easy to he and accordingly go the same day to monsieur the prince of contus to whom he give such a advantageous description of the courage and accomplishment of the english cornet and the inclination he have to stay among they that he highness tell the baron that he might acquaint he from he that if he be willing to serve under he he should have a commission or if he rather choose a civil employment he would use he interest to procure he such a one as might afford both honor and profit this the baron do not fail to communicate immediately to horatio who charm would with the generosity both of the one and the other break out into the utmost encomium of that nation : -- sure say he the french be a people bear to inspire and instruct virtue and benevolence to all the kingdom in the world after the first rapture of he gratitude be over be press by the baron to let he know which of the prince 's offer he would chuse to accept alas reply he this be a kind of a unfortunate dilemma i be in -- my inclination be for the army and it would be the height of my ambition to serve under such general as the french but it would be unnatural in I to draw my sword against the land which give I be : o would to god continue he there be a opportunity for I to do it in any other cause how gladly would i leave the best part of my blood to shew the sense i have of the generosity i have experience the baron have nothing to offer in opposition to a sentiment which he find have so much of honor in it and therefore acquaint the prince that he choose to accept of he highness 's favor in a civil employment on which he be order to attend he levee the next day he good friend accompany he and have present he with the form usual on such occasion the prince receive he very graciously and be please to ask he several question concern the government of england at that time the battle in which he have be take and many other thing to all which the young horatio answer with so much discretion and politeness as make the prince say to the baron you have not flatter this gentleman in you description of he for tho ' i believe you friendship ready enough to give a just idea of he yet i allure you he own behavior be he best recommendation and well entitle he to more than i find it in my power to do for he at present i have be think for you sir continue he turn to horatio and imagine that the employment i have find you will not be disagreeable to you : -- one of the gentleman of the bed-chamber to the chevalier st george be dead there be a vacancy which i will make interest shall be fill by no other than yourself -- you seem to be much of the same age with he and i dare say he will be extremely pleased in the choice i make of you to be near he : -- it be not indeed add he a place of so much advantage as i could wish but there be a handsome pension annex to it which with the honor will i believe content you till something better present itself from the first mention the prince make of the post he have find for he the heart of horatio leap would in he breast with a agitation he have never feel before : the thought of live at st germain in the same palace with mademoiselle charlotta so transport he that he scarce know what he say and the thanks he give the prince be express with such hyperbole of gratitude as make he highness think he have a higher idea of the employment than it indeed deserve but the baron who know the motive and could not help smile within himself to prevent any other from suspect it however tell the prince that it be not to be wonder at that he testify so high a satisfaction since he be now to serve a family he have by nature a strong attachment to and at the same time continue in a country he like much better than he own horatio by this time have a little recovered himself and sensible he have go rather too far second what the baron have say and no more observation be make on it that same evening the prince have make it he request be horatio permit to kiss the hand of the chevalier st george and the ensue day take possession of the apartment appropriate to the office bestow on he after have receive the congratulation of a whole court who testify a great deal of satisfaction in have he among they and pay he compliment in a particular manner to mademoiselle charlotta he take abundance of pleasure in view all the apartment of a palace famous for the birth of one of the greatest monarch of the age and for be the asylum of the distrest royal family of england : when he attendance on he master give he leisure he frequently pass many hour together in a closet where he be tell the late king jame use to retire every day to pray for the prosperity of that people who have abjur would he young as horatio be and gay by nature he sometimes love to indulge the most serious meditation and this place as well as the condition of those he serve remonstrate to he the instability of all human greatness he make this general reflection that there be nothing truly valuable but virtue because the owner could be deprive of that only by himself and not by either the fraud or force of other indeed the behavior of all the person who compose this court could not but inspire those who see it with sentiment of the nature i have describe : the queen herself tho ' of too great a soul to shew any mark of repine at she fate be never see to smile : even the chevalier st george and princess have both of they a very serious air which denote they have reflection more befitting they condition than they year and those about they be most of they person who have leave the greatest part of they fortune as well as kindred either in england scotland or ireland have they own misfortune as well as that of the royal cause to lament and therefore could not but wear a dejection in they countenance : in fine every thing he see seem would a emblem of fall majesty except on drawing-room night and then indeed the splendor of marlus and versaille shine forth at st germain in the person of those who come to pay they compliment among whom be not only the dauphine and all the prince of the blood but even the grand monarch himself think it not beneath he dignity to give this proof of he respect once or twice every week this way of living and the company he be now associate with give horatio a manly way of think much sooner than otherwise perhaps he might have have yet do not rob he of he vivacity : some of the queen 's woman and the young lady about the princess particularly mademoiselle charlotta have a thousand sprightly entertainment among themselves into which he the baron de la valiere and some other who have attachment at that court be always admit but now the time arrive in which he be to lose the society of that valuable friend the campaign be ready to open and he be oblige to head he troops and follow the marshal de villar and marsin into flander all the conversation turn now on war those martial inclination which love and the season of the year have occasion to lye dormant for a while in the bosom of horatio now revive in he : he embrace the baron at take leave of he with tear of affection and regret : how cruel be my fate say he to make I of a nation at enmity with yours and that i can neither fight for you nor against you well my dear horatio reply the other france may hereafter have occasion to employ you arm where there be no tie of duty to restrain you : -- in the mean time continue he with a smile softer engagement may employ you thought -- mademoiselle charlotta de palfoy be a conquest worth pursue this be the first hint the baron have ever give he of the discovery he have make of he sentiment and it so much the more surprized he that he be tell by another what he be not certain of himself : -- he know indeed the society of that young lady give he infinite satisfaction and that he be restless when absent from she but these word and the air with which they be speak shew he more of he own heart than he have before examine into -- he blush would excessively and make no answer on which you have no cause resume the baron to be asham would of the passion you be inspire with nor troubled at my discovery of it : -- i assure you i have see it a long time and tho ' you never honor I with you confidence in that point have take all opportunity of do justice to you merit in the conversation i have have with mademoiselle who i have the satisfaction to find be not displeased with what i say upon that head and i flatter myself with have a good account of the progress you have make at my return i have too much experience of you friendship and goodness to I reply horatio not to assure myself of you do I all manner of kind office -- i have indeed so great a regard for that lady you mention that i know none of she sex who i so much wish should think well of I yet be she utterly ignorant of the sentiment i have for she and if i be possess of that passion which they call love which i protest i be not certain of myself i have never make the least declaration that can give she room to imagine any such thing the baron laugh heartily to hear he speak in this manner and then tell he there be no need of word to make know a inclination of that kind -- it be to be see in every look and motion of the person inspire with it -- mademoiselle de palfoy continue he young as she be i dare answer have penetration enough to see the conquest she have make but have not yet learn artifice enough to conceal that she be at the same time subdue herself -- and if you would take the advice of a person who have some experience in these affair you will endeavor to engage she to a confession before too much observation on the behavior of other to they lover shall teach she those imperious air by which woman frequently torment the heart that adore they tho ' they own perhaps in do so feel a equal share horatio who have see something like this between the baron and he mistress find a great deal of reason in what he say and promise to be guide by he especially as he have encouragement enough to hope by all the treatment he have find from charlotta that a declaration of love from he would not offend she beyond forgiveness from that time forward he therefore begin to think in what manner he should first disclose the tender secret to the dear object of he affection : when absent from she he easily find word but when present that awe which be inseparable from a real passion strike he entirely dumb and whenever he be about to open he mouth to utter what he intend he have neither word nor voice and tho ' he see she every day be often alone with she and have opportunity enough to have reveal himself yet could he not get the better of he timidity for a great while and perhaps should have be much longer under this cruel constraint have not a accident favor he wish beyond what he could have hope or even imagine and by shew he part of what pass in she soul embolden he to unfold what he own labor with on she account chap vi _ describe the masquerade at the dutchess of main 's the character and intrigue of several person of quality who be there the odd behavior of a lady in regard to horatio and charlotta 's sentiment upon it _ the dutchess of main be one of the gayest and most gallant lady at the court of lewi xiv she be for ever entertain the nobility with ball masquerade or concert and as she be of the blood royal and highly respect not only on that score but by the distinguish would favor of the king the chevalier st george and the princess he sister frequently honor she assembly with they presence to divert those lady whose husband be go to flander as she say she now propose a masquerade and the day be fix it be the sole business of the young and gay to prepare habit such as be most suitable to they inclination or as they think would be most advantageous to they person the chevalier st george be dress in a rich grecian habit of sky-coloured velvet embroider with large silver star : the top of he cap be encompass with diamond ruby emerald saphir amythist and other precious stone of various color set in row in the exact form of a rainbow : a light robe of crimson taffaty fringe with silver be fasten by a knot of jewel on he left shoulder and cross he back to the right side where it be tuck into a belt of the finest oriental pearl and thence hang down and trail would a little on the ground : in fine there be nothing that exceed the magnificence and eloquence of he appearance or be in any measure equal to it in the whole assembly except that of the princess louisa he sister she would need go as a diana and oblige all she lady to be habit like nymph : no idea of this goddess inspire either by the painter or the poet 's art can in any degree come up to that which the fight of this amiable princess give every beholder conformable to the character she assume she have a large crescent of diamond on she head which have no other cover than a great quantity of the finest hair in the world partly braid with pearl and emerald and partly flow in ringlet down on she alabaster neck : she garment be silver tissue white and shine as the moon on a clear frosty night and be button up a little at the bottom as for the conveniency of the chace shew great part of she fine proportioned ankle in she hand she hold a ivory bow and a arrow of the same head with gold and on she shoulder be fix a quiver curiously work and beset with jewel : she attendant which be six in number have they habit green but make in the same fashion of the princess 's with bow and arrow in they hand and quiver at they back : all of they have they hair turn up under a caul of silver net from which hang little tossel of pearl intermix with diamond next to this fair troop the duchess of main herself attract the attention of the assembly : she be habit like a indian queen with robe compose of feather so artfully place that they represent a thousand different kind of bird and beast which as she move seem to have motion in themselves : on she head she have a lofty plume support by a cap and richly ornamented with precious stone as be all she garment wherever the propriety of the fashion of they would give leave the young mademoiselle de bourbon in the habit of a sea-nymph and mademoiselle de blois in that of a minerva ornamented and decorate accord to they several character have also they share of admiration nor do the marchioness of valloi and lucerne both in the garb of shepherdess serve as mere foil to those i have mention : there be something even in this plainness that shew the elegance of the wearer 's taste the prince of conde the duke of berry vendosine and chartre the young marquis de montbausine the count de chenille de ranbeau and the baron de roche have all of they habit extremely rich and well fancy as be many other of whom it would be too tedious to make particular mention and be likewise digressive to the matter i take upon I to relate i shall therefore only say that there be not one person of either sex who do not endeavor to set themselves forth to all possible advantage those gentleman who attend the chevalier st george be at they liberty to appear in what habit they please : horatio know he charming charlotta be a nymph of the forest choose to be a hunter and be accordingly dress in green with a little cap on he head and a javelin in he hand as acteon be generally portray and indeed have he study what garb would have become he best he could not have fix on one more proper for that purpose fine madamoiselle de sanserre at least think he more worthy she regard than any of those the richness of whose habit make she know be of a higher rank : -- she take particular notice of he make he dance with she and say a thousand gallant thing to he but he could very well have dispense with hear they and find little satisfaction in any thing that deprive he of entertain he dear charlotta who he easily know by she air and shape from all those who be habit in the same manner as he doubt not however but the person who have thus single he out be a lady of condition he return she civility with a politeness which be natural to he but which have receive great improvement since he arrival in france she be no less charm would with he conversation than she have be with he person and impatient to know who he be make a offer of shew he she face on condition he would pluck off he mask at the same time : but this he would by no means agree to because still hope to get rid of she and have some discourse with mademoiselle charlotta he do not think proper he should be know by any other who might perhaps make remark on he behavior and therefore excuse himself from comply with she desire in term as oblige as the circumstance would admit as she have display all she talent of wit and eloquence to engage he she look on the little curiosity she have be able to inspire in he as a affront and vex she have throw away so much time on a insensible as she call he fling hastily away and join with some other company leave he at liberty to pursue he inclination this lady have be a royal mistress but not have the good fortune to be make a mother be not honor with any title she being forsake by the king who indeed have few amours of any long continuance do not in the least abate the good opinion she have of she beauty and to fee herself follow by a train of lover be the supreme pleasure of she life she spare nothing to attract and engage : whenever she fail in this expectation it be a severe mortification but she vanity and the gaity of she humor would not suffer it to prey upon she spirit for above a minute and she divert the shock of a rebuff in one place by new attempt to conquer in another therefore it be probable think no more of horatio after she have turn from he he now carefully avoid all that might interrupt he wish and see charlotta have just break off some conversation she have be entertain with make what haste he could to prevent she from be re-engage : -- she immediately know he and as they mutual innocence make they perfectly free in express themselves to each other she tell he she be glad he be come that they would keep together the whole masquerade provide he do not think it a confinement to prevent she be persecute with the impertinency of some people there who she find think a masque a kind of sanction for say any thing it be not to be doubt but horatio give she all the assurance that word could form of feel the most perfect pleasure in she society and that he should not without the extremest reluctance find himself oblige to abandon the happiness she offer he to any other person in the company : to recompence this complaisance as she call it she give he a brief detail of the character of as many as she know thro ' they habit and in do this discover a sweet impartiality and love of truth which be no small addition to she other charm she blame the baroness de guiche for not be able to return the affection of a husband who have marry she with a inconsiderable fortune and have since she have be he wife pardon a thousand miscarriage in she conduct : -- she praise the virtue of mademoiselle de mareau who be at fifteen the bride of a man of seventy behave to he with a tenderness and exact conformity to he will which if owing alone to duty be not to be distinguish from inclination : -- she express a concern that the gaity of the dutchess of vendome give the world any room for censure and highly condemn the duke for be guilty of action which have make she sometimes give into party of pleasure by way of retaliation : -- but she be more severe on the indecorum of mademoiselle de renville who be know for the mistress of the duke of chartre and that she be support by he be fond of appear in all public place she could not help testify a good deal of surprize that any woman who pretend to virtue would admit she into they assembly : not but she say the case of that lady be greatly to be pity who be high-born and breed have be reduce to the lowest exigency of life and from which to be relieved she have only consent to assist the looser pleasure of the amorous duke but add she i would not methink have she seem to glory in she shame and in a manner of life which she misfortune alone can render excusable nor can i approve of the indulgence she mistaken triumph meet with because it may not only destroy all notion of regret in herself for what she necessity oblige she to but also make other who have not the same pretence find a kind of sanction for they own error : -- vice say she ought at lead to blush and hide itself as much as possible from view leave by be tolerate in public it should become a fashion horatio be so much take up with admire the justness of she sentiment that awed by they as it be he could not yet tho ' mask would make any discovery of he own : she be about enter into a discourse with he concern the first motive which have render some person she point out to he unhappy in the marriage-state which perhaps might have give he a opportunity for explain himself when a lady richly dress would come up to they and give horatio a sudden pluck by the arm villain cry she madam return he strongly amaze be the trifling conversation of sanserre resume she or this little creature to be prefer to a woman of that quality you have dare to abuse -- but this night have convince she of you perfidy : -- she send you this continue she give he a slap over the face as hard as she could and be assure it be the last present you will ever receive from she she have no sooner utter these word than she fly quick as lightning out of the room leave horatio in such a consternation both at what she say and do as deprive he even of the thought of follow she or use any means to solve this riddle -- he be in a deep muse when mademoiselle charlotta possess that moment with a passion she till then be ignorant of say to he i find horatio you have wonderfully improve the little time you have be in france to gain you a multiplicity of mistress but i be sorry my inadvertency in talk to a man so doubly pre-engaged should cause I to be reckon among the number in speak this she turn away with a confusion which be visible in she air and the scarlet color with which she neck be dye by heaven cry he in the utmost agitation i know so little the meaning of what i have just now hear that it seem rather a dream than a reality o the deceiver return she a little slacken she pace will you pretend to have give no occasion for the reproach you have receive : -- great must have be you profession to draw on you a resentment such as i have be witness of -- but i shall take care to give the lady whoever she be no farther room for jealousy on my account and as for mademoiselle sanserre i believe the stock of reputation she have will not suffer much from the addition of one more favorite to the number the world have already give she the oddness of this adventure and the vexation he be in to find charlotta seem incense against he for a crime of which he know himself so perfectly innocent destroy at once all the consideration he timidity have inspire and aim only to be clear in she opinion -- if there be faith in man cry he i know nothing of what i be accuse : no woman but you charming self ever have the power to give I a uneasy moment -- it be you alone have teach I what it be to love and as i never feel i never pretend to that passion for any other I reply charlotta extremely confused if it be so you take a strange time and method to declare it in -- but i know of no concern i have in you amours you gratitude or you perfidy and you have better follow and endeavor to appease you enraged mistress than lose you time on I in vain excuse ah mademoiselle cry he how unjust and cruel be you and how severe my fate which not content with the despair my real unworthiness of adoring you have plunge I in but also add to it a imputation of crime my soul most detest : -- i never hear even the name of the lady you mention till you lip pronounce it and if it be she i dance with i protest i never see she face : and as for the meaning of the other lady 's treatment of I it must certainly be occasion by some mistake have offer nothing to any of the sex that could justify such a proceed all the time he be speak charlotta be endeavor to compose herself -- the hurry of spirit she have be in at the apprehension of horatio 's have any amorous engagement shew she how much interest she take in he make she blush at have discover herself to he so far and tho ' she could not be any more tranquil yet she think she would for the future be more prudent to this end she now affect to laugh at the dilemma into which she tell he he have bring himself by make address in two place at the same time and advise he in a gay manner to be more circumspect thus be this beautiful lady by she jealousy convince of she sensibility and as difficult as horatio find it to remove the one he find he consolation in the discovery of the other from the time he have be disengage from mademoiselle sanferre he have retire with charlotta to one corner of the room and the greatest part of the company be in a grand dance the other be take up in look on they so that we young lover have the opportunity of talk to each other without be take much notice of but several of the masquer now draw nearer that way prevent horatio from say any thing farther at that time either to clear he innocence or prosecute he passion and charlotta glad to avoid all discourse on a subject she think herself but ill prepare to answer join some lady with whom she stay till the ball be near conclude horatio after this withdraw to a window and flicker behind a large damask curtain throw himself on a sopha he find there and ruminate at full on the adventure have happen to he in which he find a mixture of joy and discontent : the behavior of charlotta assure he he be not indifferent to she but then the thought that he appear in she eye as ungrateful inconstant and perfidious make he tremble leave the idea of what he seem to be should utterly erase that favourable one she have entertain of what he truly be by what mean he should prove he sincerity he know not and as he be utterly unpracticed in the affair of love lament the absence of he good friend the baron de la valiere who he think might have be able to give he same advice how to proceed he remain bury as it be in these cogitation when a lady pluck back the curtain which screen have he and without see any one be there throw herself on the sopha almost in he lap -- oh heaven cry she perceive what she have do and immediately rise but horatio start up would not suffer she to quit the place tell she that since she choose it it be he business to retire and leave she to indulge whatever meditation have bring she thither she thank would he in a voice which by its tremble testify she mind be in some very great disorder and add if you good nature say she be equal to you complaisance you will do I the favor to desire a lady dress in pink and silver with a white sattin scarf cross she shoulder to come here directly : -- you can not continue she be mistake in the person because there be no other in the same habit tho ' horatio be very loth to engage himself in the lady 's affair fear to give a second umbrage to mademoiselle charlotta yet he know not how to excuse grant so small a request and therefore assure she of he compliance accordingly he send he eye in quest which soon point out to he the person whom she have describe : have deliver he message to she horatio cry she somewhat astonish how come you employ in this errand he know she voice and that it be mademoiselle de coigney the mistress of he friend the baron on which he immediately tell she how the lady have surprize he : she laugh heartily and say no more but leave he and go to the window he have direct for a long time he seek in vain for a opportunity of speak to the object of he affection : she be still engage either in dancing or in different party and as he eye continually follow she he easily perceive she purposely avoid he a magnificent collation be prepare in a great drawing-room next to that in which the company be they all go in to partake of it the entertainment be serve up on two large table but as every one be mask would and the vizard so contriv would that those who wear they could eat without pluck they off they sit down promiscuously without ceremony or any distinction of degree none be oblige to know another in these disguise only the attendant of the chevalier st george and the princess louisa take care not to place themselves at the same they be so by this mean sit together but a great number of other be mingle with they no particular conversation could be expect supper be over they all return to the ballroom and horatio have contrived it so as to get next charlotta she could not refuse the offer he make she of he hand to lead she in but as he be about say something to she in a low voice a man come hastily to he and take he a little on one side present he with a letter and then retire with so much precipitation that horatio could neither ask from whom it come nor well discern what sort of person it be that give it he he put it however in he pocket design to read it at more leisure he curiosity for the contents not equal he desire of entertaining mademoiselle charlotta but that young lady whose jealousy receive new fewel from this object have slipt away before he could turn from the man and have already mix with a cluster of both sex who have get into the room before they horatio find all attempt to speak to she that night would be ineffectual go back into the drawing-room where they sup and where but few people remain he might examine the letter with more freedom he see it have no superscription but suppose the inside would give he some satisfaction he break it open hastily and find in it these line ` whether false or faithful still be you dear to I and if i be in the least so to you the treatment you receive will be pardon for the sake of the occasion : -- i own that at a place where you might have be as particular as you pleased with I without suspicion it enrage I to see you waste those precious moment with other which i flattered myself to have solely engross -- besides the character of mademoiselle sanserre be so well know that i think you would have avoid she of all other yet have she force herself upon you sure you might afterwards have come to I when i have give you so particular a description of the habit i should wear but instead of make any excuse for a first transgression you hurry to a second and pay all you devoir to another whom indeed i know not at that time but be since inform she be one of the maid of honor to princess louisa -- i must confess i have not resolution enough to suffer so cruel a injustice and be too much overcome by my passion to resent it as i ought i leave the place and desire we friend to do it for I -- i find she somewhat exceed she commission but you must forgive she since it be she love for I : -- i be now at she house where i impatiently expect you -- the baron be secure for some hour -- those we may pass together if you still think there be any thing worth quit the masquerade for to be find in the arm of _ yours _ & c _ p _ if you now fail no excuse hereafter shall ever plead you pardon ' this letter confirm horatio in the belief he have before that he have be mistake by the lady for some favorite person but who the lady be he be as much in the dark as ever nor would he have give himself any trouble concern it if he have not hope by that mean to have retrieve the good opinion of charlotta he be however impatient to shew she the letter as he doubt not but she have see it deliver to he but with all he assiduity he could not obtain one word in private during the masquerade and when it be break up which be not till near morning and they return to st germain it be impossible because he know she must be in the princess 's chamber as he in that of the chevalier st george : he be therefore oblige to content himself with the hope that the next day would be more favourable chap vii _ a explanation of the foregoing adventure with a continuation of the intrigue of some french lady and the policy of mademoiselle coigney in regard of she brother _ it can not be suppose that either of we young lover enjoy much true repose that night tho ' the fatigue of the dance might naturally require it : the one do but just know herself a lover before she feel the worst torment of that passion in she jealousy and the other have be compel as it be to lay open he heart in order to convince he charmer it have no object but herself in view know not but he temerity in do so might be imputed to he as no less a crime than that from which he attempt to be clear : each have they different anxiety but those of horatio be the least severe because thro ' all the indignation of he mistress he see mark of a affection which he could not have flatter himself with if they have not be evident and conscious of he innocence doubt not but time would both explain that and reconcile the offended fair : -- whereas charlotta be far from be able to assure herself of she lover 's fidelity : she could not conceive how in the compass of one night such a plurality of mistake should happen to the same man and tremble at the reflection that this man who possibly be the falsest of he sex should not only have make a impression on she heart but also by the concern she have so unwarily express have reason to triumph in he conquest : -- ashamed therefore of what she feel and determine to make use of she utmost effort to conceal it for the future if not to conquer it she think to shun all occasion of see or speak to this dangerous invader of she peace be the first step she ought to take but how little be a heart possess of the passion she 's be capable of judge for itself or maintain any resolution in prejudice of the darling object -- she have no sooner set it down as a rule to avoid he than she begin to wish for he presence and contented herself with think she desire it only out of curiosity to hear what he would say and to have a opportunity by a rally manner of behavior to destroy whatever conjecture he might have form would in favor of he passion but all this time she deceive herself and in reality only long for a interview with he in hope he would find means to justify himself horatio who be impatient to attempt it see she at a distance walk on the terrass with no other company than mademoiselle de coigney go immediately to join they think that if the presence of this lady might be a bar to many thing he want to say to charlotta it would be of service to he another way by prevent she from make he any reproach as soon as he come near i owe you little thanks horatio say mademoiselle de coigney laugh for the interruption you give I last night in the multiplicity of those reflection which he own affair have occasion he he have entirely forget the lady in the window and imagine some other accident have happen which should make he appear yet more guilty in the eye of charlotta ask would she with some impatience what she mean do not you remember answer she that you bring I a message from a certain lady yes madam say he and in that thought i do no more than my duty oblige I to as she seem under some perplexity which i suppose she be impatient to acquaint you with you judge rightly indeed resume de coigney but have you known how gladly i would have dispense with the honor of she confidence i dare answer you would have spare it I : -- i 'll tell you my dear pursued she turn to charlotta for the secret of this lady be pretty universal and i be certain that i have hear from no less than fifty different person that very affair she be in such a hurry to inform I of last night : you must need have hear of the amour between madam la boissy and the chevalier de mourenbeau frequently reply charlotta she ridiculous jealousy of he have long be the jest of the whole court and i never go to marlus or versaille but i be tell of some new instance of it and yet to relate a long story of she passion and he ingratitude say mademoiselle de coigney be i last night drag into a dark corner and deprive for a hour together of all the pleasure of the masquerade : it seem she have over-hear some gallant thing between he and the daughter of the count de granpree and that give she the occasion of run into a recapitulation of all the profession of constancy he have make to herself the proof she have give he of a too easy belief and the little regard he now pay to she peace of mind -- i be oblige to affect a pity for she misfortune and gratitude for the trust she repose in I tho ' neither the one or the other merit in reality any thing but contempt one often suffer a good deal from one 's complaisance this way say charlotta and for my part there be nothing i would more carefully avoid than secret of this nature but you have not tell I how far horatio be accessary to bring you into this trouble he they say that he would save mademoiselle de coigney the labor and immediately related how the lady they be speak of throw herself upon he and afterwards enjoin he to deliver the message but add he i think last night be one of the most unfortunate one i have ever know since with all the care i could take i be continually prevent by other people 's concern from prosecute my own -- i be not only insult and reproach for be mistake for some other person for it could happen no other way but also soon after receive a letter no less mysterious to I than the blow which doubtless come from the same quarter : as there be no name subscribe or if there be i should look on myself as under no obligation of secrecy i will beg leave to communicate it to you lady with these word he take the letter out of he pocket and hold it open between they : charlotta conquer she impatience so far as not to take it out of he hand but mademoiselle coigney snatch it hastily imagine she know the hand nor be she deceive in she conjecture : she have no sooner read it slightly over -- see here mademoiselle charlotta say she a new proof of madam de olonne 's folly and my brother 's continued attachment to that vile woman charlotta then look over the letter with a satisfaction that be visible in she countenance and as soon as she have do then it be plain say she that horatio be mistake for monsieur de coigney : but how it happen so be what i can not conceive i can easily solve the riddle reply mademoiselle de coigney : i hear my brother say he intend to wear a hunting dress at the masquerade but be disappoint of go to it by he most christian majesty send for he to marli i suppose too suddenly for he to give notice of he enforced absence to madame d' olonne and horatio by chance appear in the same habit which he have doubtless tell she he would be in and they size be pretty much alike she might very well be deceive and also have a seeming reason for the jealousy and rage she letter testify nothing could exceed the joy horatio feel at this unexpected eclaircisement of he innocence which be also double by the pleasure which in spight of all she endeavor to restrain it he see sparkle in the eye of he beloved charlotta neither of they however have any opportunity of express they sentiment at this time de coigney continue with they till dinner when they all separate to go to they respective table the next day afford what in this he have seek in vain : -- he find she alone in she own apartment and have break the ice be now grow bold enough to declare he passion with all the embellishment necessary to render it successful : mademoiselle charlotta know very well what become the decorum of she sex and be too nice a observer of it not to behave with all the reserve imaginable on this occasion all the freedom she have be accustom to treat he with while ignorant of he or she own inclination be now banish from she word and action and she gravely tell he that if he be in earnest it be utterly improper for she to receive any profession of that kind without the approbation of monsieur de palfoy she father and as there be but very little probability of he grant it on many consideration she would wish he to quell in its infancy a affection which might otherwise be attend with misfortune to they both it be certain indeed that in this she speak no more than what she reason suggest : she know very well that she father have much higher expectation in view for she and that on the least suspicion of she entertaining a foreigner and one who seem to have no other dependance than that of favor she should be immediately remove from st germain so that it behove she to be very circumspect in any encouragement she give he : but tho ' she speak to he in this manner it be not as she action afterwards fully demonstrate that she really design what she say should make he desist he pretension but that he should be careful how he let any one into the secret of he heart she foresee little prospect of they love ever be crown would with success yet find too much pleasure in indulge it to be able to wish a extinction of it either in he or herself and in spight of all the distance she assume he easily perceive that whatever difficulty he should have to struggle with in the prosecution of he address they would not be owe to she cruelty they be both of they too young to attend much to consequence and as secure the affection of each other be what each equally aim at neither of they reflect how terrible a separation would be and how great the likelihood that it must happen they know not how soon as the remonstrance of mademoiselle charlotta have all the effect she intend they for on horatio he so well commanding himself that no person in the world except the baron de la valiere who be absent have the least intimation of he passion they might probably have live a long time together in the contentment they now enjoy have not a accident of which neither of they could have any notion put a stop to it horatio think no more on the affair of madame de olonne and monsieur de coigney from the time he have be clear of have any concern with that lady yet be that night 's adventure productive of what he look upon as the greatest misfortune could befal he but to make this matter conspicuous to the reader it be necessary to give a brief detail of the circumstance that lead to it this lady who be wife to the baron de olonne be one of the most beautiful and most vicious woman in the kingdom she entertain a great number of lover but there be none more attach to she or more loved by she than young monsieur de coigney : he have for a long time maintain a criminal correspondence with she to the great trouble of all he friend who endeavor all they could but in vain to wean he from she : he have lately a recounter with one of she former lover which have like to have cost he he life and it be with great difficulty and as much as the relation on both side could do by represent to the king that they be set upon by street-robber that they avoid the punishment the law inflict on duelist de coigney be but just recover of the hurt he have receive when so far from resolve to quit the occasion of they he make a appointment to meet she at the masquerade : -- they have describe to each other the habit they intend to wear when as he be prepare for the rendezvous a express come from the king command he immediate attendance at marlus where the court then be : this be occasion by old monsieur de coigney who have by some spy he keep about he son receive intelligence of this assignation have no other way to disappoint it than by the royal authority which he easily procure as he be very much in favor with he majesty and have lay the matter before he the person who come with the mandate have order not to quit the presence of young coigney but bring he directly by which mean he be deprive of all opportunity of send he excuse to madame de olonne who come to the masquerade big with expectation of see she favorite lover and find he as she imagine engage with other and wholly regardless of herself be seize with the most violent jealousy and not able to continue in a place where she have receive so manifest a slight desire mademoiselle de freville she confidant and companion to upbraid he with he inconstancy which request she comply with in the manner already related and which give mademoiselle charlotta such matter of disquiet the amorous madame de olonne however have give vent to the first transport of she fury could not hinder those of a softer nature from return with the same violence as ever and for the gratification of they write that letter which horatio receive and occasion afterward the explanation of the whole affair which explanation he then think fortunate for he but by a whimsical effect of chance it prove utterly the reverse mademoiselle de coigney who have the most tender affection for she brother and passionately wish to make he break off all engagement with a woman of madame de olonne 's character and who might possibly bring he under many inconveniency take the hint which mademoiselle charlotta unthinkingly give by tell she how she have be affront on he account by de freville of put something into he head which might probably succeed better than all the attempt have hitherto be practice to make he quit he present criminal amour the first time she see mademoiselle de freville she tell she as a great secret that she brother be fall in love with mademoiselle charlotta and that she believe it would be a match for he have already engage friend to sollicit monsieur de palfoy on that score this she know would be carry directly to madame de olonne and doubt not but it would so increase she jealous rage that all he could say in he defense would pass for nothing : she also add that he be in the masquerade that night tho ' for some private reason best know to himself say she he have order he people to give out he be go to marli de freville who be the creature of madame de olonne no sooner receive this intelligence than she fly with it to she as mademoiselle de coigney have imagine : neither do it fail of the desire effect when he come to visit she as he do on the moment of he return from marlus the violence of she temper make she break out into such reproach and exclamation as a man have need be very much in love to endure : he endeavor to make she sensible of she error by a thousand protestation but the more he talk would of marlus and the king 's command the more she tell he of charlotta and the masquerade and almost distract to find he still persist in deny he be there or have ever make any tender profession to that lady she proceed to such extravagancy as he who know himself innocent could not forbear reply to in term which be far from be softening : -- in fine they quarrel to a very high degree and some company happen to come in at the same time hinder either of they from say any thing which might palliate the resentment of the other before they have a opportunity of meeting again mademoiselle de coigney see she brother and artfully introduce some discourse of mademoiselle charlotta de palfoy begin to run into the utmost encomium on that lady 's beauty virtue wit and sweetness of disposition and at last add that she should think herself happy in have she for a sister young de coigney listen attentively to what she say : he have often be in she company but be prepossess with he passion for madame de olonne she charm have not that effect on he as now that the behavior of the other have very much lessen he esteem of she he reply that he know no lady more deserving than the person she mention and should be glad if by she interest he might have permission to visit she : this be all mademoiselle de coigney want she doubt not but if he be once engage in a honorable passion it would entirely cure he of all regard for madame de olonne and as she know he have a good share of understanding think that when he should come to a more near acquaintance with the perfection of charlotta the loose air of the other would appear in they true color and become as odious to he as once they have be infatuate find he so well incline to she purpose she take upon herself the care of introduce he as it be indeed easy to do consider the intimacy there be between she and charlotta that young lady receive he as the brother of a person she extremely love and little suspect the design on which he come treat he with a gaity which heighten she charm and at the same time flatter he hope that there be something in he person not disagreeable to she mademoiselle de coigney take care that every visit he make to charlotta should be report to de olonne which still heighten she resentment together with he little assiduity to moderate it make a total breach between they to the great satisfaction of all he friend in general those of they whom mademoiselle have acquaint with the stratagem by which she bring it about praise she wit and address and as they know the family and fortune of mademoiselle charlotta encourage she to do every thing in she power for turn that into reality which she at first have make use of only as a feint for the reclaim of she brother the young gentleman himself stand in need of no remonstrance of the advantage he might propose by a marriage with charlotta she beauty and the charm of she conversation have make a conquest of he heart far more complete than any prospect of interest could have do : not only de olonne but the whole sex would now in vain have endeavor to attract the least regard from he and as he be naturally vain he think nothing but charlotta de palfoy worthy of he the success he have be accustom to meet in he love affair embolden he to declare himself much sooner than he would have do have he follow the advice of he sister and too soon to be receive in a manner agreeable to he wish by a lady of charlotta 's modesty and delicacy even have she not be prepossess in favor of another for tho ' she respect he as the brother of she friend that consideration be too weak to hinder she from let he know how displease he pretension be to she and that if he persist in they she should be oblige to refuse see he any more he be now sensible of he error and endeavor to excuse it by the violence of he passion which he say would not suffer he to conceal what he feel but as when a heart be truly devote to one object the sound of love from any other mouth be harsh and disagreeable the more he aim to vindicate himself in this point the more guilty he become and all he say serve only to increase she dislike mademoiselle de coigney after this take upon she to intercede for she brother 's passion but with as ill success as he have do and be one day more importunate than usual mademoiselle charlotta grow in so ill a humor that she tell she she be determine to give no encouragement to the amorous address of any man unless command to do so by those who have the power of dispose she but add she i would not have monsieur de coigney make any effort that way for be he to gain the consent of my father which i be far from believe he would do i have so little inclination to give he those return of affection he may expect that in such a case i should venture be guilty of disobedience be there any thing so odious then madam in the person of my brother say de coigney with a tone that shew how much she be picque i never give myself the trouble of examine into the merit either of he person or behavior reply she but to deal sincerely with you i have a perfect aversion to the thought of change my condition and if you desire the friendship between we should subsist you will never mention any thing of it to I -- and as to you brother when i be convinced i shall receive no farther persecution from he of the nature i have lately have he may depend on my treat he with my former regard till then you will do I a favor and he a service to desire he would refrain he visit these expression may be think little conformable to the natural politeness of the french or to that sweetness of disposition which mademoiselle charlotta testify on other occasion but she find herself so incessantly press both by the brother and the sister and that all the denial she have give in a different manner have be without effect therefore be oblige to assume a harshness which be far from be natural to she in order to prevent consequence which she have too much reason to apprehend horatio soon discover he have a rival in monsieur de coigney and tho ' he easily see by charlotta 's behavior that he have nothing to fear on this score yet the interruption he receive from the address of this new lover make he little able to endure he presence and he sometimes could not refrain himself from say such thing as have not the other be too much buoy up with he vanity to take they as mean to himself must have occasion a quarrel she make use of all the power she have over he in order to curb the impetuosity of he temper whenever he meet this disturber of he wish but he jealousy would frequently get the better of the respect he pay she and they never be together in she apartment without fill she with mortal fear she therefore find it absolutely necessary to get rid of a adorer she hate in order to hinder one she love from do any thing which might deprive she of he and tho ' she have a real friendship for mademoiselle de coigney yet she choose rather to break with she than run the hazard she be continually expose to by she brother 's indefatigable pursuit but all she precaution be of no effect as well as the enforced patience of horatio : what most she tremble at now fall upon she and by a means she have least thought of madame de olonne full of malice at be forsake by she lover and soon inform by whose charm she misfortune be occasion get a person to represent to the baron de palfoy the conquest he daughter have make in such term as make he imagine she encourage he passion neither the character family or fortune of de coigney be equal to what he think charlotta might deserve make he very uneasy at this report and as he look on she not have acquaint he with he pretension as a indication of she have a affection for he he resolve to put a stop to the progress of it at once which could be do no way so effectually as by remove she from st germain to this end the careful father come himself to that court and wait on the princess : he tell she highness that be in a ill state of health and oblige to keep much at home charlotta must exchange the honor she enjoy in she service for the observance of she duty to a parent who be now incapable of any other pleasure than she society the princess to whom she be extremely dear could not think of parting with she without a extreme concern but after the reason he have give for desire it would offer nothing for detain she on which she be immediately call in and make acquaint with this sudden alteration in she affair chap viii _ the parting of horatio and mademoiselle charlotta and what happen after she leave st germain _ a peal of thunder burst over she head could not have be more alarming to mademoiselle charlotta than the news she now hear but she father command the princess have consent and there be no remedy to be hope : she take leave of she royal mistress with a shower of unfeigned tear after which she retire to she apartment to prepare for quit it while the baron go to pay he compliment to some of the gentleman at that court to be remove in this sudden manner she could impute to no other motive than that the love of horatio have by some accident be betray to she father -lrb- for she never so much as thought of monsieur de coigney -rrb- and the thought of be separate from he be so dreadful that till this fatal moment she know not how dear he be to she : -- to add to the calamity of she condition he be that morning go a hunting with the chevalier st george and she have not even the opportunity of give he the consolation of know she bear at least a equal part in the grief this unexpected accident must occasion mademoiselle de coigney come to take leave of she as do all the lady of the queen 's train as well as the princess 's and express the utmost concern for lose so agreeable a companion but these ceremony be tedious to she and as she could not see horatio she dispatch every thing with as much expedition as she secret discontent would permit she to do and then send to let she father know she be ready to attend he when they be in the coach both observe a profound silence for some time at last i hope charlotta say the baron you have no extraordinary reason to be trouble at leave st germain none my lord answer she of so much moment to I as the fear my sudden removal be owe to you be dissatisfy with my conduct i flatter myself resume he you be conscious of nothing which should authorize such a apprehension : -- you have have a education which ought to inform you that person of you sex and age be never to act in any material point of themselves : -- but court be place where this lesson be seldom practice and tho ' the virtue of the english queen and princess be a shine example to all about they yet i be of opinion that innocence be safest in retirement as she be fully convince in she mind that it be only owe to some jealousy of she behavior that she have be take from st germain and also that it be on the score of horatio she would not enquire too deeply for fear of give she father a opportunity of enter into examination which she think she could not answer without either injure the truth or avow what would not only have incense he to a very great degree but also put he upon measure which would destroy even the most distant hope of ever see horatio more he on he side would not acquaint she with the sentiment which the above-mentioned suggestion have inspire he with think he should discover more of the truth by keep a watchful eye over she behavior without seem to do so during the time of they little journey from the palace of st germain to pari where monsieur the baron de palfoy ordinarily reside nothing farther be discourse on : but when they arrive and mademoiselle charlotta have opportunity of reflect on this sudden turn she give a loose to all the anxiety it occasion : -- she be not only snatch would from the presence of what be most dear to she on earth but as she have no confidante nor durst make any be also without any means either of convey a letter to he or receive the least intelligence from he she have be in pari but a very little time before she perceive the baron artfully keep she in the most severe restraint under a shew of liberty pretend to she as he have do to the princess that he be not well enough to go abroad he would stay at home whole day together and oblige she to read or play to he on the spinnet which frequently she do with a ake heart and when she go out it be always in company with a relation whom he keep at he house on purpose as he say as a companion to divert she but in reality to be a spy over all she action and have order to dive by all the insinuation she be mistress of into she very thought all this mademoiselle charlotta have penetration enough to discover and spite of the discontent she labor under so well conceal what they endeavor to find out that all the trap lay for she be wholly ineffectual but in what manner do the enamoured horatio support so cruel a affliction he be no sooner inform at he return from hunting of what have happen than he be seize with agony which in the force he do himself to conceal throw he into a fever that confine he to he bed for several day : as he passion for mademoiselle charlotta be not in the least suspect every body imputed he disorder to be occasion by have over-heated himself in the chace and during he indisposition be visit by all the court : -- the chevalier st george send two or three time a day to enquire of the health of he countryman as he be please to call he and give he many other token how greatly he be in he favor but all the civility he receive be not capable of lessen the anguish of he mind which keep he body so weak that tho ' youth and a excellent constitution throw off the fever in a short time yet he be unable to quit he chamber in near three week and when he do appear so wan and so dejected that he seem no more than the shadow of the once gay and sprightly horatio but while he be thus sink under the burden of he grief and despair ever to see he adorable charlotta any more fate be provide for he a relief as unexpected as the cause of he present unhappy situation have be and to the very same person also be he indebted both for the one and the other young monsieur de coigney be not less alarmed than horatio at the removal of charlotta tho ' it have not the same effect on he he be continually teize he sister to make she a visit and repeat she intercession in he behalf but she have receive such tart answer on that score that she be very unwilling to undertake the embassy : however she comply at last and be receive by mademoiselle charlotta in the most obliging manner but have not the least opportunity of execute she commission that lady have a good deal of company with she whom she purposely detain to avoid enter into any particular conversation with she till the hour in which she know she attendance on the queen would oblige she to take leave the baron de palfoy be at that time abroad but when he be inform who have be there be a little disturbed that the sister of de coigney endeavor still to keep up she intimacy with he daughter not doubt but she have either bring some letter or message from he as he be fully persuade in he mind that there be a mutual affection between they but he take no notice of it as yet think that probably she might make a second visit and that then he should be better able to judge of the motive in the mean time the father of monsieur de coigney be inform of these proceedings think it beneath he son to carry on a clandestine courtship and the great share he possess of the royal favor he have be instrumental in gain some point in the parliament of pari render he vain enough to imagine he alliance would not be refuse tho ' there be a superiority both of birth and fortune on the side of monsieur the baron de palfoy in a perfect confidence of succeed in he request he go to he house and after some little preparation propose a match between he son and mademoiselle de palfoy the baron be not at all surprize at what he say because he expect if the young people be keep asunder a offer would be make of this kind and after hear calmly all he have to say in order to induce he to give he consent he tell he that he be very sorry he have ask a thing which it be impossible to grant because he have already determine to dispose otherwise of he daughter monsieur de coigney then ask to whom i know not as yet reply the other but when i say i have determine to dispose she otherway i only mean to one who be of blood at least equal to she own and who have never by any public debauchery render himself contemptible to the discreet part of mankind de coigney know not how either to put up or resent this affront he know very well that he son have behave so as to give cause for it yet think he have other perfection which might over-balance what by a partial indulgence he look upon only as the folly of youth and as for the reflection on he family he tell the other that whatever he be he owe to the merit of he ancestor not he own and that he doubt not but he son would one day raise he name equal to that of palfoy in fine the pride of the one and the vanity of the other occasion a contest between they which might have furnish matter for a scene in a comedy have any poet be witness of it : the result of it be that they agree in this to be mutually dissatisfied with each other never to converse together any more and to forbid all communication between they family the baron go immediately to he daughter 's chamber and have order she maid who be then do something about she to leave the room i have wonder charlotta say he with a countenance that be far from betray the secret vexation of he mind that you have never since you come to paris express the least desire of make a visit at st germain tho ' the duty you owe a princess who seem to have a very great affection for you might well have excuse any impatience you might have testify on that score besides you owe a visit to mademoiselle de coigney the princess merit doubtless all the respect i be able to pay she answer she but my lord as it be you pleasure to remove I from that palace i wait till you command should licence my return as for mademoiselle de coigney the intimacy between we will excuse those ceremony which be of little weight where there be a real friendship these word confirm all the baron 's suspicion he think there be no need of farther dissimulation and the long-conceived indignation burst out in look more furious than the tremble charlotta have ever see in he before -- yes degenerate girl say he i have but too plain proof of the friendship in which you have link yourself with the family of the de coigney 's -- but tell I continue he how dare you engage yourself so far without my knowledge could you ever hope i would consent to a alliance with de coigney de coigney cry she much more assure than she have be before the mention of that name heaven forbid you should have such a think the resolution and disdain with which she speak these word a little surprized he : what cry he have you not encourage the address of young de coigney and even proceed so far as to make he father imagine there require no more than to ask my consent to a marriage between you how much courage do innocence inspire charlotta of late so timid and alarmed while she think horatio be in question be now all calmness and composure when she find de coigney the person for whom she have be suspect she confess to she father with the most settled brow that he have indeed make some offer of a affection for she but say she have give he such answer as nothing but the height of arrogance and folly could interpret to he advantage and then on the baron 's command she acquaint he with every particular that have pass between that young gentleman he sister and herself touch the affair she be accuse of she be so minute in every circumstance answer with such readiness to all the question he ask of she and seem so perfectly at ease as indeed she be that the baron could no longer have any doubt of she sincerity and be sorry he have take she so abruptly from st germain : he now tell she that she be at liberty to visit there as frequently as she please only as he have be affront by old monsieur de coigney as well as to silence all future report concern the young gentleman he expect she would break off all acquaintance with mademoiselle she assure he of she obedience in this point and add that she could do it without any difficulty for tho ' she be a lady who have many good quality and one for whom she once have a friendship yet the take upon she to forward she brother 's design have occasion a strangeness between they which have already more than half anticipated he command monsieur the baron de palfoy be now as well satisfy with he daughter as he have lately be the reverse and she be allow once more all those innocent liberty which the french lady above those of any other nation in the world enjoy it be not to be doubt but that the first use she make of liberty be to go to st germain : she have hear from mademoiselle de coigney when she come to visit she that horatio have be very much indispose and at that time be not quite recover and be impatient to give he all the consolation that the sight of she could afford but fear she should not have a opportunity of speak to he in private she write a letter contain a full recital of the reason which have induce she father to take she from st germain and the happy mistake he have be in concern de coigney conclude with let he know he might sometimes visit she at paris as a indifferent acquaintance not the least suspicion be entertain of he and the baron now in so good a humor with she that it would not be easy for any one to make he give credit to any information to she prejudice the whole be dictate by a spirit of tenderness which tho ' it do not plainly confess a affection imply every thing a honorable lover could either expect or hope on she arrival at st germain where there be a extreme full court to congratulate the princess louisa on the great victory lately gain by charle xii the brave king of sweeden to whom she have be some time contract she pass directly to she highness 's apartment and the chevalier st george be then with she those of he gentleman who have attend he thither be wait in the antichamber : among they be horatio : the alteration of he countenance on sight of she after this absence be too visible not to have be remark have not all present be too busy in pay they compliment to she to take any notice of it he be one of the last that approach be willing to recover the confusion he feel himself in lest it should have a effect on he voice in speak to she she more prepared receive he salute with the same gay civility she do the other but at the same instant slip the letter she have bring with she into he hand any one who be in the least acquaint with the power of love may guess the transport of horatio at this condescension but impatient to know the dear contents he go out of the room as soon as he find he could do it without be observe and have peruse this oblige billet find in it a sufficient cordial to revive that long languishment he spirit have be in at he return he find she engage in conversation with several gentleman and lady : he mingle in the company but could expect no other satisfaction from it than be near he dear charlotta and hear she speak the chevalier st george soon after come out and he be oblige with the rest of he train to quit the place which at present contain the object of he wish she go in immediately after to the princess so he see she no more that day at st germain all that now employ he thought be a pretence to visit she at she father 's house for tho ' she have tell he in she letter that he might come as a ordinary acquaintance yet know that the continuance of they conversation depend wholly on the secrecy of it he be willing to avoid give even the most distant occasion of suspicion fortune hitherto favourable to he desire now present he with one more ample than any thing he own invention could have supply he with : happen to be at paris in the company of some friend with whom he stay later than ordinary he be hurry thro ' the street in order to go to the inn where he servant and horse wait for he when he hear the clashing of sword at some distance from he : guide by he generosity he fly to the place where the noise direct he and saw by the light which hang out very thick in that city one person defend himself against three who press very hard upon he and have get he down just as horatio arrive to he relief : he run among the assaillant and either the greatness of he courage or the belief that other would come to he assistance throw they into such a consternation that they all seek they safety in they flight while the person they have attack get up again and thank he deliverer without whose timely aid he say he could have expect nothing but death : those who set upon he be robber and as he perceive by they behavior desperate wretch who be for secure themselves by take the life as well as money of those who be too weak to resist they : he point to a dead body on the ground who he tell horatio be he servant and have be kill in he defense but how transport be we young lover when he find that the person to whom he have do so signal a piece of service be the father of he mistress as he perceive he have some wound tho ' they prove but slight he compleat the obligation he have begin to confer by support he under the arm till he get home where the baron make he enter with he and would have prevail with he to stay all night but horatio tell he he could not well dispense with be absent from he post that it be highly proper he should return to st germain that night late as it be but would do himself the honor of wait on he the next day to enquire after the state of the wound he have receive mademoiselle charlotta be go to bed but be rouze by the accident no sooner be inform by the surgeon who be immediately send for that there be nothing dangerous in the hurt she father have receive than she bless heaven for make horatio the instrument of he preservation the sense the baron seem to have of this obligation and the praise he bestow on the gallant manner in which the young gentleman come to he relief make she almost ready to flatter herself that fate interested itself in behalf of they love and indeed monsieur the baron notwithstanding the haughtiness of he nature have the most just notion of gratitude and to testify it to horatio would have refuse he scarce any thing except he daughter but however that should happen she still find more and more excuse for indulge the inclination she have for he and tho ' she yet have never give he any such assurance yet she resolve in she own mind to live only for he the baron be oblige to keep he bed for several day horatio have a pretence for repeat he visit to he during this time of he confinement and afterwards go often by invitation the other besides the obligation he have to he find something extremely please in he conversation to which -lrb- not to take from horatio 's merit -rrb- the obsequiousness he find no difficulty in himself to behave with towards a man of he age he quality and above all the father of charlotta not a little contribute the lover have now frequent opportunity of entertaining each other both at pari and st germain : nor be any of those demonstration which virtue and innocence permit want between they to render they as perfectly easy as people can possibly be who have yet something to desire and much to fear but as smooth as now they fortune seem they know not how soon a storm might rise and give a sudden interruption to that felicity they enjoy -- the charm of charlotta be every day make new conquest and among the number of those who pretend to admire she how probable be it that some one might be think worthy by she father and she be compel to receive the address of a rival these be reflection too natural not to occur to they both and whenever they do could not fail of embitter those sweet the certainty of a mutual affection have otherwise afford they have now no trouble from monsieur de coigney he father in order to make he forget a hopeless passion have find a employment for he which oblige he to go many league from pari and once the conversation already mention at the baron 's he sister and mademoiselle charlotta by command of they respective parent as well as they own inclination break off all correspondence nor even speak to each other unless when happen to meet in a visit there be no avoid it and then it be in such a distant manner and with so much indifference that none would have imagine they ever have be intimate friend and companion chap ix _ a second separation between horatio and charlotta with some other occurrence _ the season of the year now have put a end to the campaign and the french as well as confederate army be retire into they winter quarter the baron de la valiere who have always a special permission from the general return to paris : horatio promise himself much satisfaction in the renew society of this friend and no sooner hear he be on the road than he go to meet he the baron charm would with this proof of he affection and respect receive he as a brother and there be little less freedom use between they after the mutual testimony and good-will be over de la valiere begin to ask he concern mademoiselle charlotta on which horatio acquaint he with she be remove from st germain and the occasion of it not omit the arrogance with which old monsieur de coigney have behave to she father and the resentment now between the family well say the baron but i hope you have be more successful at least with the young lady : i will never more trust the intelligence of eye if yours do not hold a very tender intercourse and i protest to you my dear horatio that amidst all the toil and danger of war my thought be often at st germain not envy but congratulating the pleasure you enjoy in the conversation of that amiable lady i doubt not reply horatio with a smile but we have you with we at a place which contain mademoiselle de coigney and i be of opinion too she be no less frequently in the camp with you for in spite of all the reserve she affect while you be present she never hear the bare mention of you name without emotion which be very visible in she countenance i would not be vain reply the baron but i sometimes have flatter myself with the hope i be not altogether indifferent to she tho ' for two whole year that i have constantly make my address to she i never could obtain one soft confession to assure my happiness : -- but let I know how you have proceed on the score of mademoiselle charlotta believe I i be not so engross by my own affair as not to give attention to those of a friend horatio who have be engage by charlotta to preserve a inviolable secrecy in every thing that have pass between they without any exception of person would fain have turn the conversation on some other topic : he truly love the baron have the highest opinion of he discretion and would have trust he with the dearest secret of he life provide they related to himself alone but he have give he word he oath he honor to charlotta and durst not violate they on any consideration yet loth to refuse or to deceive he friend he find himself in the most perplexing dilemma as often as the other speak of charlotta he answer with something of de coigney but all he artifice be ineffectual and the baron at last saw thro ' it and assume a very grave countenance i perceive horatio say he you do not think I worthy you confidence and i be to blame to press you to reveal what you resolve to make a mystery of these word make a very deep impression on the grateful soul of he they be address to and equally distressed between the necessity of either disoblige a person whose generosity he have experience or falsify the promise he have make to charlotta at last a expedient offer to he mind how to avoid both and yet not be guilty of injure the truth alas my lord answer he you little know the heart of horatio if you imagine there be any thing there that would hide itself from you : -- i freely confess the charm of mademoiselle charlotta have such a effect on I that have i be in circumstance which in the least could have flatter I with success i should long ago have avow myself she lover : but when i reflect on the disparity between we the humor of she father and a thousand other impediment i endeavor to banish so hopeless a passion from my breast and be the more confirm in my resolution to do so by the ill treatment monsieur de coigney receive : -- besides she removal from st germain deprive I in a great measure of those opportunity i have before of entertaining she might very well contribute to wean off a passion not settle either by time or expectation of ever be gratify and i hope continue he i shall always have so much command over myself as not to become ridiculous by aim at impossibility whether the baron give any credit to what he say on this account or not he have too much politeness to press he any farther and the discourse soon after take another turn horatio be very well pleased to think he have get off so well de la valiere have relate to he some particulars of the late campaign which the public account have be deficient in they pass from that to some talk of the brave young king of sweden a topic which fill all europe with admiration : but the french be a people in whom the love of glory be the predominant passion be more than any other nation charm with the greatness of that prince 's soul what indeed have any hero of antiquity to boast of in competition with this northern monarch who conquer and give away kingdom for the benefit of other disdain to receive any other reward for all he vast fatigue than the pleasure of give a people that person whom he judge most worthy to reign over they the baron who have attend the count de guiscard when he be residentiary ambassador from he most christian majesty at the swedish court have a opportunity of see more of this monarch than any other that horatio be acquaint with he therefore on he request it inform he how at the age of eighteen he throw off all magnificence forsake the pomp and delicacy of a court he have be breed in and undertake and compleat the delivery of he brother-in-law the duke of holstein from the cruel incursion of the dane who have well nigh either take or ravage the greatest part of he territory he also set forth in its proper color the base part which peter alexowitz czar of muscovy and augustus king of poland act against a prince who be then employ he arm in the cause of justice the latter of these bring a powerful army to take from he one part of he dominion and the former at the head of a 100000 man be plunder the other : but when he conclude he little narrative by recite how this young conqueror with a handful of brave swede animated by the example of they king put entirely to route all that oppose he horatio feel he soul glow with a ardor superior even to that of love : he long to behold a prince who seem to have all the virtue comprize in he and whose very thought as well as action might be look upon as super-natural he be however greatly to be pity say the baron de la valiere that the war he be engage in and which in all probability will be of long continuance hinder he from the possession of the most amiable princess in the world and i dare answer at least if i may credit those about she she wish he be of a less martial disposition he will be the more worthy of she cried horatio interrupt he and the immortal fame of he action be a sufficient attonement for all the year of expectation that may be its purchase from the time horatio have this discourse with the baron the king of sweden be ever uppermost in he thought : he have always reflect that in the station he then be it would be impossible to obtain any more of mademoiselle charlotta than she heart at least while the baron de palfoy live and that a thousand accident might deprive he of all hope of ever be more happy but say he to himself be i among the number of those who attend this hero in he martial exploit i might at least have a opportunity of prove how far fortune would befriend I -- who know but i might be able to do something which might engage that just and generous monarch to raise I to a degree capable of avow my pretension even to she father and the same bless day that join we principal might also make I bless in the possession of my dear charlotta with these idea do he often flatter himself but the manner in which he should accomplish he desire be yet doubtless to he the chevalier st george treat he with so much kindness that he have no room to doubt he have a great share in he favor and be fully perswade that if he communicate he intention to he he would vouchsafe to give he letter of recommendation to a prince who be to be he brother-in-law : but this he fear to ask lest it should be look upon as ingratitude in he to desire to leave a court where he have be so graciously receive and have many favor besides the perquisite of he post heap upon he not only by the chevalier himself but also by the queen and princess who follow the example of the late king behave with a kind of natural affection to all the english he sometimes communicate he sentiment on this head to mademoiselle charlotta who be too discreet not to allow the justness of they and well know that in the station she lover now be they never could be on any term with each other than those they be at present : she reason therefore and the advantage of she love make she sometimes wish he would follow the dictate of so laudable a ambition but then the danger he must inevitably be expose to in follow a monarch who never set any bound to he courage and the thought how long it might possibly be before she see he again alarm all she tenderness and he have the satisfaction of see the tear stand in she eye whenever they have any discourse of this nature and tho ' she word assure he that it be she opinion he could not take a more ready way to raise he own fortune yet she look at the same time make he plainly see how much she would suffer in he take that step many reason both for and against follow he inclination in this point present themselves to he and he have no sooner as he think determine for the one than the other rise with double vehemence and overthrow the former in this fluctuate situation of mind do he remain for some time and perhaps have do so much longer have not a accident happen which prove decisive and indeed leave he no other party to take than that he afterwards do charlotta be now entirely mistress of herself give he frequent meeting in the tuillery judge it safer to converse with he there than at the house of any person whom in such a case must be the confidante of the whole affair whereas if they be see together in the walk it might be judge they meet by accident and not give any grounds of suspicion which hitherto they have be so fortunate as to avoid it be in one of those appointment when enter into a very tender conversation they forget themselves so far as to suffer the moon to rise upon they : the stillness of the evening and the little company which happen to be there that night seem to indulge they inclination of continue in so sweet a recess : -- they be seat on a bench at the foot of a large tree when charlotta in answer to some tender profession he have be make say depend on this horatio that as you be the first who have ever be capable of make I sensible of love so nothing shall have power to change my sentiment while you continue to deserve or to desire i should think of you as i now do he shall not long continue to desire it -- cry a voice behind they and immediately rush from the other side of the thicket a man with he sword draw and run full upon horatio who not have time to be upon he guard have certainly fall a victim to he rival 's fury have not a gentleman seize he arm and by superior strength force he some pace back -- be you mad monsieur say he do you forget the place you be in or the danger you so lately escape for a enterprize of this nature mademoiselle charlotta now a little recovered from she first surprize and know it be young monsieur de coigney who have give she this alarm have presence enough of mind to ask how he dare after he know she own and father 's resolution to disturb she or any company she have with she he make no reply but reflect that there be other way than fight by which he might be revenge go hastily away with that friend who have hinder he from execute he rash purpose but they could hear that he mutter something which seem a menace against they both how impossible be it to express the consternation we lover now be in : they find by the repetition monsieur de coigney make of the word she speak that what they have so long and so successfully labor to conceal be now betray : -- betray to one who would not fail to make the most malicious use of the discovery and doubt not but the affair would become the general talk perhaps to the prejudice of charlotta 's reputation but the least thing either could expect be to be separate for ever horatio full of disturbed emotion conduct he disconsolate mistress to the gate of the tuillery and there take a farewel of she which he have too much reason to fear would be he last at least for a long time he be tempt by he first emotion to seek de coigney and call he to account for the affront he have put upon he and either lose he own life or oblige the other to secrecy but then he consider that there be some probability he would not dare to own that he have give himself any concern about mademoiselle charlotta after the injunction lay on he by he father much less as he have attempt a duel in she cause have as have be already mention be before guilty of a like offence against the law which in that country be very strict on account of madame de olonne and this prevail with he to be passive as to what have happen till he should hear how the other would behave and find what turn the affair would take charlotta in the mean time be in the most terrible anxiety : -- she could not imagine what have bring monsieur de coigney who she think have be many mile distant so suddenly to paris : but on make some private enquiry she be inform that have meet some difficulty in the execution of he office he have take post in order to lay he complaint before the king and have arrive that very day -- she now blame she own inadvertency in hold any discourse with horatio of a nature not proper to be over-heard in a place so public as the tuillery where other as well as he might have possibly be witness of what be say young monsieur de coigney suffer little less from the turbulence of he nature and the mortification it give he vanity to find a person whom he look upon as every way he inferior prefer to he he thought be wholly bent on revenge but in what manner he should accomplish it he be for some time uncertain : when he acquaint he father with the discovery he have make and the resentment he have testify against this unworthy rival as he call he the old gentleman blame he for take any notice of it let they love on son say he let they marry -- we shall then have a fine opportunity of reproach the haughty baron with he new alliance this do not however satisfy monsieur de coigney : all the love he once have for mademoiselle charlotta be now turn into hate and in spite of he father 's command not to meddle in the affair he could not help throw out some reflection among he companion very much to the disadvantage of the young lady 's reputation but these might possibly have blow over as he have but a small time to vent he malice he father know the violence of he temper in order to prevent any ill consequence compel he to return to he employment take upon himself the management of that business which have bring he so unluckily to pari but mademoiselle de coigney have no sooner be inform by she brother of the discovery he have make than she doubt not that it be on the score of horatio that he have meet with such ill success in he courtship and also imagine that it have be owe to some ill impression mademoiselle charlotta have give the baron de palfoy that she father have be treat by he in the manner already recite she complain of it to the baron de la valiere and tell he she whole family have be affront and she brother render miserable for the sake of a young man who say she can neither have birth or fortune to boast of since he have be so long a prisoner without any ransom pay or interposition offer to redeem he the baron be too generous not to vindicate the merit of horatio as much as be consistent with he love and complaisance for he mistress : he be notwithstanding very much picque in he mind that a person to whom he have give the greatest proof of a sincere and disinterested friendship should have conceal a secret of this nature from he and the more so as he have seem to expect and desire he confidence from this time forward he behave to he with a coldness which be sufficient to convince the other of the motive especially as he find mademoiselle de coigney take all opportunity of throw the most picquant reflection on he it be certain that lady be so full of spight at the indignity she think she family have receive that she could not help whisper the attachment of horatio and charlotta not only at st germain but at paris also with inunendo 's little less cruel than those she brother have make use of to he companion so that between they the amour be talk of among all who be acquaint with either of they at length the report reach the ear of the baron de palfoy who tho ' he do not immediately give a entire credit to it think it become he to do every thing in he power to silence it accordingly he call he daughter to he one day and have tell she the liberty which the world take in censure she conduct on horatio 's account command she to avoid all occasion of it for the future by see he no more the confusion she be in and which she have not artifice wholly to conceal from the penetrate baron more convinced he than all he have be tell that there be in reality some tender intercourse between they but resolve to be fully ascertain he say no more to she at that time but dispatch a messenger immediately to st germain desire horatio to come to he the same day the lover readily obey this summons but not without some apprehension of the motive : the hint daily give he join to the alteration not only in the behavior of mademoiselle de coigney but likewise of the baron de la valiere give he but too just room to fear he passion be no longer a secret the father of charlotta receive he with great courtesy but nothing of that pleasantness with which he have look on he ever since he have defend he from the robber horatio say he i be indebted to you for my life and would willingly make what recompence be in my power for the obligation i have to you : -- think therefore what i can do for you and if you demand exceed not what be fit for you to ask or would become I to grant you may be assure of my compliance the astonishment horatio be in at these word be impossible to be express but have a admirable presence of mind my lord answer he i should be unworthy of the favor you do I could i be capable of presume on they so far as to make any request beyond the continuance of they no horatio resume the baron i acknowledge my gratitude have be too deficient since it have extend only to those civility which be due to you merit exclusive of any obligation the conversation we have have together have hitherto afford a pleasure to myself and it be with a good deal of mortification i now find a necessity to break it off : -- i would therefore have the satisfaction of do something that might convince you of my esteem at the same time that i desire you to refrain you visit not all horatio 's courage could enable he to stand this shock without testify some part of what pass in he mind : -- he be utterly incapable of make any reply tho ' the silence of the other shewed he expect it but stand like one confound and conscious of deserving the banishment he hear pronounced against he -- at last recollect himself a little -- my lord say he i see not how i can be happy enough to preserve any part of you esteem since look upon as unworthy a honor you be once pleased to confer upon I you affect say the baron a slowness of apprehension which be far from be natural to you and perhaps imagine that by not seem to understand I i should believe there be no grounds for I to forbid you my house but young man i be not so easily deceive and since you oblige I to speak plain must tell you i be sorry to find you have entertain any project which if you have the least consult you reason you would have know could never be accomplish -- in fine horatio what you make so great a mystery of may be explain in three word : -- i wish you well as a friend but can not think of make you my son : -- i would recompence what you have do for I with any thing but my daughter and as a proof of my concern for you happiness i exclude you from all society with she in order to prevent so unavailing a passion from take too deep a root ah my lord cry horatio perceive all dissimulation would be vain the man who once adore mademoiselle de palfoy can never cease to do so he ought therefore reply the baron without be move to consider the consequence well before he begin to adore : -- if i have be consult in the matter i should have advise you better but it be now too late and all i can do be to prevent you ever meet more : -- this horatio be all i have to say and that if in any other affair i can be serviceable to you communicate you request in write and depend on its be grant in speak these last word he withdraw and leave horatio in a situation of mind not easy to be conceive -- he be once about to entreat he to turn back but have nothing to offer which could make he hope would prevail on he to alter he resolution -- he never have be insensible of the vast disparity there be at present between he and the noble family of de palfoy : he could expect no other or rather worse treatment than what he have now receive if he passion be ever discover and have no excuse to make for what himself allow so great a presumption with a countenance dejected and a heart oppress with various agitation do he quit the house which contain what be most valuable to he in the world while poor charlotta endure if possible a greater shock the baron de palfoy now convince that all he have be inform of be true be more incense against she than he have be on the mistaken supposition of she be influence in favor of monsieur de coigney : he have no sooner left horatio than he fly to she apartment and reproach she in term the most severe that word could form -- it be in vain she protest that she never have any design of give herself to horatio without have first receive he permission -- he look on all she say as a augmentation of she crime and soon come to a determination to put it past she power to give he more than she have already do early next morning he send she under the conduct of a person he could confide in to a monastry about thirty mile from pari without even let she know whither she be about be carry or give she the least notice of she departure till the coach be at the door into which he put she himself with these word -- adeiu charlotta expect not to see pari or I again till you desire no more to see horatio chap x _ the reason that induce horatio to leave france with the chevalier st george 's behavior on know he resolution he receive a unexpected favor from the baron de palfoy _ while charlotta under the displeasure of she father and divide as she believe for ever from she lover be pursue she melancholy journey horatio be give way to a grief which know no bound and which prey with the greater feirceness on he soul as he have no friend to whom he could disburden it the baron 's estrang would behavior be no small addition to he other discontent and he lament the cruel necessity which have enforce he to disoblige a person to whom he owe so many favor and whose advice would now have be the greatest consolation he could not now hope charlotta would be permit to come to st germain and doubt not but she father would take effectual method to prevent she visit at any place where even accident might occasion a meeting between they : he know the watch have be set over she on the account of monsieur de coigney and might be assure it would not now be less strict and that it would be equally impossible for either to communicate they thought by write as it be to see each other he be in the midst of these reflection when he hear by some people who be acquaint with the baron de palfoy that he have send he daughter away but none know where : this instead of lessen he despair be a very great aggravation of it : -- he imagine she be confine in some monastry and be not insensible of the difficulty that attend see a young lady who be send there purposely to avoid the world yet say he to himself could i be happy enough to discover even to what province she be carry i would go from convent to convent till i have find which of they contain she it be in vain that he make all possible enquiry : every one he ask be in reality as ignorant as himself -- the baron de palfoy have trust none so could not be deceive but by those person who have the charge of conduct she and of they fidelity he have many proof yet how impossible be it for human prudence to resist the decree of fate -- the secret be betray without any one be guilty of accuse the confidence repose in they and by the strangest accident that perhaps ever be horatio learn all he wish to know when he have give over all he endeavor for that purpose and be totally despairing of it he come one day to pari in order to alleviate he melancholy in the company of some young gentleman who have express a very great regard for he but he mind be take up with various and perplexed thought on he entrance into that city he mistake he way and turn into the rue st dennis instead of the rue st honore where he have be accustom to leave he horse and servant -- he find he error just as he be pass by a large inn and it be a matter of indifference to he where he put up would not turn back but order he man to alight here -- i forget where i be go say he but i suppose the horse will be take as much care of at this house as where we use to go i shall see to that reply the fellow horatio step into a room to take some refreshment while he servant go to the stable but have not be there above a minute before he hear very high word between some people in the yard and as he turn towards the window see a man in the livery of the baron de palfoy and whom he presently know to be the coachman of that nobleman he be hot in dispute with the innkeeper concern a horse which he have hire of he and as the other insist drive so hard that he have kill he the coachman deny the accusation but the innkeeper tell he he have witness to prove the horse die two hour after he be bring home and declare that if he have not satisfaction for he beast he would complain to the baron and if he do not do he justice have recourse to law -- there be a long argument between they concern the number of mile the hour they drive and the weight of the carriage -- among other thing the innkeeper alledge that he see they as he pass he corner and there be so many trunk box and other luggage behind and before the coach besides the company that be in it that it require eight horse instead of six to draw it why then say the coachman do it not kill we horse as well as yours if they have be equally good they would have hold out equally -- i do not pretend mine be as good reply the innkeeper i can not afford to feed my horse as my lord do but yet he be a stout gelding and if he have not be drive so very hard and perhaps otherwise ill use into the bargain he would have be alive now all this be sufficient to make horatio imagine it be for the journey which deprive he of he dear charlotta that this horse have be hire so tarry in the place where he be till the debate be over which end not to the satisfaction of the innkeeper who swear he would not be fool out of he money as soon as the coachman be go horatio call he in and ask what be the matter and who it be that endeavor to impose upon he on which the innkeeper readily tell he that on such a day this coachman come to he and hire a horse in order to make up a set to go to rheine in champaigne my lord-baron have three or four sick in the stable at that time -- two day after say he my horse be bring home all in a foam and fall down dead in less than three hour and yet this rascally coachman refuse to pay I for he horatio humored he in all he say and let he go on he own way till he have vent he whole stock of railing and then ask he what company be in the coach the innkeeper reply that there be one man and two woman but do not know who they be for they face be muffle up in they hood this be sufficient for he to be assure it be no other than charlotta with she woman and some friend whom the baron have send with they the day mention be the very same he have be inform she be carry away be also another confirmation and he have not only the happiness of know where he mistress be but of know it by such means as could give the baron no suspicion of he be acquaint with it and therefore make he think it necessary to remove she have gain this intelligence which yet he be no better for than the hope of be able to get a sight of she thro ' the grate which he be resolve to accomplish some way or other he resume he design of go into the army of the king of sweden as a perfect knowledge of the many excellent quality of the chevalier st george make he regard and love he with a affection beyond what be ordinarily to be meet with from a servant to he master he feel a extreme repugnance to quit he and yet more in break a matter to he which while it testify a confidence in the goodness of he whose assistance he must implore he think at the same time would be look on as ingratitude in himself and he be some time deliberate in what manner he should do it and it would have be perhaps a great while before he could have find word which he would have think proper for the purpose if he have not take a opportunity which without any design of he own offer itself to he the chevalier st george take a particular pleasure in the game of chess and horatio have learn it among the officer in campaine frequently play with he : they be one evening at this diversion when the lover of charlotta have he mind a little perplexed place he man so ill that the chevalier beat he out at every motion how be this horatio cry he you use to play better than i butt now i have the advantage of you -- may you always have it sir reply he with the utmost respect over all who pretend to oppose you -- chess be a kind of emblem of war where policy should go hand in hand with courage and there be a great master in that art whom if i be some time to serve under i flatter myself that i should be able to know how to move my man with better success than i have do to night but then my skill should be employ only against such as be you enemy you mean my brother charle of sweden say the chevalier smile but i believe he seldom play never but when kingdom be at stake resume horatio and if a day should come when you sir shall attempt the prize how fortunate would it be for I to have learn to serve you as i be oblige by much more than my duty by the most natural and inviolable attachment of my heart which would render it the greatest blessing i could receive from heaven i believe indeed return the chevalier st george you love I enough to fight in my cause whenever occasion offer i would not only fight but die cry horatio warmly yet i would wish to have the skill to make a great number of you enemy die before I well say the chevalier we will talk of this to-morrow in the mean time play as well as you can against I at st germain : in another place perhaps you may play for I horatio make no other reply to these word than a low bow and then elate he hand and eye to heaven as internally pray for the opportunity he master seem to hint at the impression this little conversation make on the mind of the chevalier st george prove itself in its effect the very next day horatio be order to come into he chamber early in the morning -- i have be think on what pass last night between we say he and if you have a serious intention of do what you seem to hint at will contribute all i can to forward you ah sir cry horatio fall at he foot impute not i beseech you this desire in I to any thing but the extreme desire i have to render myself worthy of the favor you have be please to confer upon I and to be able to serve you whenever any happy occasion shall present itself no more horatio reply the chevalier with a sweetness and affability peculiar to himself i be perfectly assure of you duty and affection to I and be so far from take it ill that you desire to quit my court on this score that i think you ambition highly laudable : -- i will write letter of recommendation with my own hand to my brother charle and to some other in he camp which i doubt not but will procure you a reception answerable to you wish : -- therefore as it be a long journey you be to take the sooner you provide for you departure the better : -- i will order you out of my privy purse 2000 crown towards you expence horatio find it impossible to express how much this goodness touch he soul nor could do it any otherwise than by prostrate himself a second time embrace he knee and utter some incoherent acclamation which more shewed to he master the sincerity of he gratitude and the perfect love he bear he than the most elegant speech could have do after all possible demonstration of the most gracious benignity on the one side and reverence on the other horatio quit the presence and go to sir thoma higgon who at that time be privy purse and one of the finest gentleman that ever england breed and acquaint he with the chevalier st george 's goodness to he and the change that be go to be make in he fortune : he thank he in the politest manner for be make the first that should congratulate he and tell he he do not doubt but he should see he return cover with laurel and enriched with honor by the most glorious and grateful monarch the world have to boast of the whole court whose esteem the good quality handsome person and agreeable behavior of horatio have entirely gain seem to partake in he satisfaction and he be so engross with the preparation for he departure and receive the compliment make he that tho ' he be far from forget charlotta yet the languishment which she absence have occasion be entirely banish and he now appear all life and spirit -- so true it be that idleness be the food of soft desire it must be confess indeed that love have a very great share in revive in he those martial inclination which for a time have seem lull to rest since it be to render himself in a condition which might give he hope of obtain the object of he love that now push he on to war he resolve also to make rheine in he way to poland where the king of sweden then be pursue he conquest and see if possible he dear charlotta before he leave france and as he be of a more than ordinary sanguine disposition he be much sooner elate with the prospect of success in any undertaking he go about than deject at the disappointment of it the baron de la valiere whose friendship over-balanced he resentment now give a instance of he generosity which as thing have stand of late between they horatio be far from expect that nobleman come to he apartment one day with a letter in he hand and accost he with the familiarity he have be accustom to treat he with before they estrangement -- horatio say he i can not suffer you to leave we without give you what testimony of good-will be in my power : -- you be now go among stranger and tho ' after the recommendation i hear you be to carry with you from the chevalier st george nothing can be add to assure you of the king of sweden 's favor yet as many brave action be lose for want of a proper representation of they and the eye of king can not be every where it may be of some service to you to have general renchild you friend : i once have the honor of a particular acquaintance with that great man and i believe this letter which i beg the favor of you to deliver to he will in part convince he of you merit before you may have a opportunity of prove it to he by you action horatio take the letter out of he hand which he have present to he at the conclusion of he speech and charm with this behavior the satisfaction i should take say he in this mark of you forgiving goodness would be beyond all bound be i not conscious how far i have be unworthy of it and that i fear the same goodness always partial to I may have in this paper -lrb- mean the letter -rrb- endeavor to give the general a idea of I which i may not be able to preserve i look upon myself to be the best judge of that reply the baron with a smile and you may remember that on a very different occasion i see into you sentiment before you be well acquaint with the nature of they yourself as horatio know these word refer to the discourse that have pass between they concern he then infant passion for mademoiselle charlotta he could not help blush but de la valiere perceive he have give he some confusion would have turn the discourse have not the other thought fit to continue it by let he know the real motive which have constrain he to act with the reserve he have do on that score the baron de la valiere assure he that he should think no more of it and tho ' at first he have take it a little amiss yet when he come to reflect on the circumstance he could not but confess he should have behave in the same manner himself the renewal of the former friendship between they greatly add to the contentment horatio at present enjoy but soon after he receive such a augmentation of it as he could never have imagine much less have flatter himself with the hope of some few day before he departure a servant of the baron de palfoy come to he to let he know he lord send he compliment and desire to speak with he at he own house the message seem so improbable that horatio could scarce give credit to it and imagine the man have be mistake in the person to whom he deliver it till he repeat over and over again that it be to no other he be send have it be any other than the father of mademoiselle charlotta who have invite he to a house he have be once forbid he scarce would have obey the summons but as it be he the awful person who give be to that charmer of he soul he send the most respectful answer and the same day take horse for pari and attend the explanation of a order which at present seem so misterious to he the baron be no sooner inform he be there than he come into the parlor with a countenance which have in it all the mark of good humor and satisfaction horatio say he after have make he seat himself i doubt not but you think I you enemy after the treatment i give you the last time you be here but i assure you i suffer no less myself in forbid you my house than you could do in have what you might think a affront put upon you : -- but continue he after a pause you ought to consider i be a father that charlotta be my only child that my whole estate and what be of infinite more consideration with I the honor of my family must all devolve on she and that i be under obligation not to be dispense with to dispose of she in such a manner as shall not any way degrade the ancestry she be spring from -- i own you merit : -- i also be indebted to you for my life : -- but you be a foreigner you family unknown -- you fortune precarious : -- i could wish it be otherwise -- believe i find in myself a irresistable impulse to love you and i know nothing would give I greater pleasure than to convince you of it -- in fine there be nothing but charlotta i would refuse you the old lord utter all this with so feel a accent that horatio be very much move at it but unable to guess what would be the consequence of this strange preparation and not have any thing to ask of he but the only thing he have declare he would not grant he only thank he for the concern he be please to express and say that perhaps there might come a time in which the obscurity he be in at present would be enlighten at least cry he i shall have the satisfaction of endeavor to acquire by merit what i be deny by fortune i admire this noble ambition in you reply the baron de palfoy pursue these laudable view and doubt not of success : -- it would be a infinite pleasure to I to see you raise so high that i should acknowledge a alliance with you the greatest honor i could hope : and to shew you with how much sincerity i speak -- here be a letter i have write to count piper the first minister and favorite of the king of sweden when you deliver this to he i be certain you will be convince by he reception of you that you be one whose interest i take no inconsiderable part in with these word he give he a letter direct as he have say but not seal which horatio after he have manifest the sense he have of so unhoped a obligation remind he of as it concern only yourself say the baron it be proper you should read it first and i will then put on my signet horatio on this unfold it and find it contain such high commendation of he and such press entreaty to that minister to contribute all he could to he promotion that it seem rather dictate by the fondness of a parent than by one who have take so much pain to avoid be so o my lord cry he as soon as he have do peruse it how much do you over-rate the little merit i be master of yet how little regard a passion which be the sole inspirer of it what will avail all the glory i can acquire if unsuccessful in my love let we talk no more of that say the baron de palfoy you ought to be satisfied i do all for you in my power to do at present : -- other opportunity may hereafter arrive in which you may find the continuance of my friendship and a grateful remembrance of the good office you do I but to engage I to fulfil my obligation without any reluctance on my part you must speak to I no more on a theme which i can not hear without emotion such as i would by no means give way to horatio give a deep sigh but presume not to reply the other to prevent he turn the conversation on the wonderful action of that young king into whose service he be go to enter but the lover have contemplation of a different nature which he be impatient to indulge therefore make he visit as short as decency and the favor he have just receive would permit the baron at parting give he a very affectionate embrace and tell he he should rejoice to hear of he success by letter from he as often as the place and employment he should be in would allow he to write let any one form if they can a idea suitable to the present situation of horatio 's mind at so astonishing a incident : impossible it be for he to form any certain conjecture on the baron de palfoy 's behavior some of he expression seem to flatter he with the highest expectation of future happiness while other he think give he reason to despair : -- sometimes he imagine that it be to he pride and the greatness of he spirit which would not suffer he to let any obligation go unrequited that he owe what have be just now do for he -- but when he reflect on the contents of the letter to count piper he could not help think they be dictate by something more than a enforced gratitude : -- he remember too that he promise he the continuation of he friendship and have give some hint during the conversation as if time and some accident which might possibly happen might give a turn to he affair even on charlotta 's account -- on the whole it appear most reasonable to conclude that if he could by any means raise he fortune in the world to the pitch the baron have determine for he daughter he would not disapprove they love and in this belief he could not but think himself as fortunate as he could expect to be since he never have be vain enough to imagine that in he present circumstance he might hope either the consent of the father or the ratification of the daughter 's affection every thing be now ready for he departure he take leave of the chevalier st george who seem to be under a concern for lose he which only the knowledge how great a advantage this young gentleman would receive by it could console : the queen also give he a letter from herself to she intended son-in-law and the charming princess louisa with blush bid he tell the king of sweden he have she prayer and wish for success in all he glorious enterprize thus laden with credentials which might assure he of a reception equal to the most ambitious aim of he aspiring soul he set out from paris not without some tender regret at quit a place where he have be treat with such uncommon and distinguished mark of kindness and respect but these emotion soon give way to other more transport : -- he be on he journey towards rheine the place which contain he beloved charlotta and the thought that every moment bring he still nearer to she fill he with extacy which none but those who truly love can have any just conception of chap xi _ horatio arrive at rheine find mean to see mademoiselle charlotta and afterwards pursue he journey to poland _ the impatience horatio have to be at rheine make he travel very hard till he reach that city nor do he allow himself much time for repose after he fatigue till have make a strict enquiry at all the monastery he at length discover where mademoiselle charlotta be place hitherto he have be successful beyond he hope but the greatest difficulty be not yet surmount : he doubt not but as such secrecy have be use in the carry she from pari and of the place to which she have be convey that the same circumspection would be preserve in conceal she from the sight of any stranger that should come to the monastry : -- he invent many pretence but none seem satisfactory to himself therefore could not expect they would pass upon other -- sometimes he think of disguise himself in the habit of a woman he youth and the delicacy of he complexion make he imagine he might impose on the abbess and the nun for such but then he fear be betray by not be able to answer the question which would in all probability be ask he -- he endeavor to find out some person that be acquaint there but tho ' he ask all the gentleman which be a great many that dine at the same hotel with he he be at as great a loss as ever he go to the chapel every hour that mass be say but could flatter himself with no other satisfaction from that than the empty one of know he be under the same roof with she for the gallery in which the lady sit pensioner as well as those who have take the veil be so closely grate that it be impossible for those below to distinguish any object he be almost distract when he have be there three or four day without be able to find any expedient which he could think likely to succeed : -- he know not what to resolve on -- time press he to pursue he journey -- every day every hour that he lose from prosecute the glorious hope he have in view strike ten thousand dagger to he soul : -- but then to go without inform the dear object of he wish how great a part she have in inspiring he ambition -- without assure she of he eternal constancy and faith and receive some soft condescension from she to enable he to support so long a absence as he in all probability must endure -- all this i say be a shock to thought which have he not be relieve from would have perhaps abate great part of that spirit which it be necessary for he to preserve in order to agree with the recommendatory letter he carry with he he be just go out of the chapel full of unquiet meditation when pass by the confessional a magdalen curiously paint which hang near it attract he eye : as he be admire the piece something fall from above and hit against he arm he stoop to take it up and find it a small ivory tablet : he look up but could see the shadow of nothing behind the grate : imagine it only a accident and not know to whom to return it he put it in he pocket but be no sooner out of the chapel than curiosity excite he to see what it contain which he have no sooner do than in the first leaf he find these word : as i imagine you do not come this long journey without a desire to see I it would be too ungrateful not to assist you endeavor : -- come a little before vespers and enquire of the portress for mademoiselle du pont -- say you be she brother and leave the rest to I there be no name subscribe but the dear character tho ' evidently write in haste and with a pencil which make some alteration in the fineness of the stroke convinced he it come from no other than charlotta and never be any hour so tedious to he as those which past between the receive this appointment and that of the fulfil it at length the wish would - for time arrive and he repair to the gate where tell the portress as he be order that he be the brother of mademoiselle du pont he be immediately bring into the parlor where he have not wait long before a young lady appear behind the grate : as he find it be not she he expect he be a little at a loss and not without some apprehension that he imagination have deceive he : i know not madame say he if chance have not make I mistaken for some happier person : -- i think to find a sister here -- no reply she laugh horatio shall find I a sister in my good office -- mademoiselle charlotta will be here immediately -- she have counterfeit a indisposition to avoid go to vespers and obtain permission for I to stay with she -- so that every thing be right and as soon as the choir be go into chapel you will see she it would be needless to repeat the transport horatio utter on this occasion so i shall only say they be such as convinced mademoiselle du pont that she fair friend have not make this condescension to a man ungrateful for or insensible of the obligation he be indeed so lose in they that he scarce remembered to pay those compliment to the lady for she generous assistance which it merit from he but she easily forgive any unpoliteness he might be guilty of on that score and he so well attoned for it after he have give vent to the sudden emotion of he joy that she look upon he as the most accomplish as well as the most faithful of he sex they have enter into some discourse of the rule of the monastry and how impossible it would have be for he to have gain a interview with mademoiselle charlotta but by the means she have contrived -- she tell he that young lady have see he for several day and not double but it be for she sake he come have resolve to run any risque rather than he should depart without obtain so small a consolation as the sight of she be capable of afford horatio by the most passionate expression testify how dearly he prize what she have seem to think of so little value when the expect charmer of he soul draw near the grate -- all that can be conceive of tender and endearing past between they but when he relate to she the occasion of he come and that change of life he now be enter upon she listen to he with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety : -- she rejoice with he on the great prospects he have in view but the terror of the danger he be plunge in be all she own she be far however from discourage he in he design and conceal not she admiration of the greatness of he spirit and that love of glory which seem to render he capable of undertake any thing but when she hear in what manner she father have treat he she be all astonishment : as she know he temper perfectly well she be certain he would not have act in the manner he do without be influence to it by a very strong liking for horatio for tho ' gratitude for the good office he have receive at he hand might have engage he to make some requital yet there be several expression which horatio who remember all he say with the utmost exactness repeat to she that convince she he would not have make use of if he have not mean the person better than he at present would have he think he do and that there be in reality nothing restrain he from make they as happy as they mutual affection could desire but the pride of blood and the talk of the world which the disparity of they present circumstance would occasion as she doubt not but the courage and virtue of horatio would remove that impediment by acquire a promotion sufficient to countenance he pretension she have now no other disquiet than what arise from she fear for he safety which she over and over repeat conjure he in the most tender term not to hazard himself beyond what the duty of he post oblige he to : -- this say she shall be the test of my affection to you for whenever i hear you run yourself into unnecessary danger i will conclude from that moment you have cease to remember or pay any regard to my injunction or repose horatio kiss she hand thro ' the grate and tell she he would always set too great a value on a life she be so good to with the continuance of not to take all the care of it that honor would admit but she would not give he leave to add any asseveration to this promise which say she you will every day be tempt to break -- the enterprize disposition of the prince you be go to serve add to you own sense of glory

manner such as will in all probability place you near he person methink it would be easy for you by now and then mention the princess louisa to rouse in he these soft emotion which might prevent he from too rashly expose a life she have so great a interest in how great a pity be it this tender conversation between two person who have so pure a passion for each other who have be absent for some time and who know not when or whether ever they should meet again could not be indulge with no longer continuance but now mademoiselle du pont who have be so good as to stand at some little distance while they entertain each other as a watch to give they notice of any interruption now warn they that they must part : -- divine service be over and the abbess and nun be return from chapel short be the farewel the lover take mademoiselle charlotta have tell he it would be highly improper he should run the hazard of a discovery by come there a second time which would probably incense she father so much as to convert all the favourable intention he now might have towards they into the reverse and he be therefore oblig would to content himself with print with he lip the seal of he affection on she hand which he have scarce do before on a second motion by mademoiselle du pont she shoot suddenly from the place and go to she chamber that no suspicion might arise on she be find so well as to have be able to quit it as he have pass for the brother of mademoiselle du pont she stay some little time with he : this lady whom charlotta in this exigence have make she confidant have a great deal of good nature and see the agony horatio be in endeavor to console he by all the argument she think might have force -- she tell he that in the short time she have be make partaker of mademoiselle charlotta 's secret she have express herself with a tenderness for he with which he ought to be satisfied and that she be convinced nothing would ever be capable of make the least alteration in she sentiment while she be speak in this manner horatio remember that he have not give charlotta she tablet which he now take out of he pocket and with the same pencil she have make use of and which be fasten to it write in the next leaf to that she have employ these word i go most dear and most adorable charlotta whether to live or die i know not but which ever be my portion the passion i have for you be root in my soul and will be equally immortal : life can give no joy but in the hope of be yours nor death any terror but be separate from you : -- o let nothing ever prevail on you to forget so perfect a attachment but in the midst of all the temptation you may be surround with think that you have vouch-safe to encourage my hope presume as they be and if once lose to they what must be the destiny of horatio have thus pour out some part of the over-flowing of he heart he entreat mademoiselle du pont to give it she which she assure he she would not only do but also be a faithful monitor for he during the whole time she should be happy enough to enjoy the company of that lady horatio have now fulfil all he passion require of he quit rheine the next day no less impatient to pursue he other mistress glory but let we now see in what manner he beautiful sister louisa whom we leave at vienna be all this while engage chap xii _ continuation of the adventure of louisa : she quit vienna with melanthe and go to venice with some accident that there befel they _ not all the gaiety of the court of vienna have power to attach the heart of melanthe after she hear that a great number of young officer just return from the campaign in italy and other person of condition be go to venice in order to partake the diversion of the near approach carnival : she be for follow pleasure every where and have see all that be worth observe in germany be impatient to be go where new company and new delight excite she curiosity have therefore obtain proper passport they set out in company with several other who be take the same rout and by easy journey thro ' tyrol at length arrive at that republic so famous over all europe for its situation antiquity and the excellence of its constitution here seem to be at this time a assemblage of all that be to be find of grand and polite in the whole christian world but none appear with that splendor and magnificence as do lewis de bourbon prince of contus : he have in he train above fifty nobleman and gentleman of the best family in france who have commission under he in the army and seem proud to be of he retinue less for he be of the blood royal than for the many great and amiable quality which adorn he person this great hero have be a candidate with augustus elector of saxony for the crown of poland but the ill genius of that kingdom would not suffer it to be govern by a prince whose virtue would doubtless have render it as flourish and happy as it have since that unfortunate rejection be impoverished and miserable bigott to a family whose design be plainly to render the crown hereditary they not only set aside that great prince under the vain and common-place pretence that on elect he they might be too much under the influence of france but also afterward as resolve to push all good fortune from they with both hand refuse stanislaus a native of poland a strict observer of its law and a man to whose courage virtue and every eminent qualification even envy itself could make no objection and thereby render they country the seat of war and theater of the most terrible devastation of all kind but of this infatuation of the pole i shall have occasion hereafter to speak more at large and should not now have make any mention of it have not the presence of that hero whom they first reject render it the general subject of discourse at venice numberless be the instance he give of a magnanimity and greatness of mind worthy of a more exalted throne than that of poland but i shall only mention one which like the thumb of hercule may serve to give a picture of he in miniature have the good fortune one night to win a very great sum at a public gaming just as he sweep have the stake a noble venetian who by some casualty in life be reduce in he circumstance could not help cry out heaven how happy would such a chance have make I these word which the extreme difficulty he be under force from he without be sensible himself of what he say be over-heard by the prince who turn hastily about instead of put the money into he own pocket present it to he say i be doubly indebted to chance sir which have make I master of this since it may be of service to you i beseech you therefore to accept it with the respects of a prince whose greatest pleasure in life be to oblige a worthy person it would take up too much time to expatiate on the grateful acknowledgment make by the venetian or the admiration which the report of this action be immediately spread occasion but add to other of a little less conspicuous nature it greatly serve to convince those who before be ignorant of it how blind the polander have be to they own interest among the concourse of nobility and gentry whom merely the love of pleasure have draw hither and for that end be continually form party melanthe never fail of make one either in one company or other : louisa whom that lady still treat with she former kindness or rather with a increase of it be also seldom absent and when she be so the fault be wholly she own inclination : but in truth that hurry of incessant diversion which at first have seem so ravishing to she young and unexperienced mind begin by a more perfect acquaintance with it to grow tiresome to she and she rather choose sometimes to retire with a favorite book into she closet than to go to the most elegant entertainment it be certain indeed that she disposition be rather incline to serious than the contrary and that join with the reflection which she good understanding be perpetually present she with on the uncertainty of she birth the precariousness of she dependance and she enforced quit the only person from whom she could expect the means of any solid establishment in the world have render she sometimes extremely thoughtful even in the midst of those pleasure that be ordinarily most enchanting to one of she sex and age but as she never be elate with the respect pay to she suppose condition so she never be mortify with the consciousness of she real one to a behavior such as might have degrade the highest birth neither appear to expect it or be covetous of honor nor meanly ashamed of accept they when offer and while by this prudent management she secure herself from any danger of be insult whenever it should be know who she be she also give no occasion for any one to make too deep a enquiry into she descent or fortune but now the time be arrive when those deficiency give she more anxiety than hitherto they have do and love in one moment fill she with those repining at she fate which neither vanity or ambition would ever have have power to do melanthe here as at vienna receive the visit of all whose birth fortune or accomplishment give they a pretence but there be none who pay they so frequently or which she encourage with so much pleasure as those of the count de bellfleur a french nobleman belong to the above-mentioned prince of contus : she often tell louisa when they be alone that there be something in the air and manner of behavior of this count which have so perfect a resemblance with that of henricus that tho ' it remind she of that once dear and perfidious man she could not help admiring and wish a frequent sight of he this be speak at she first acquaintance with he but after some little time she inform she that he have declare a passion for she he be not only like henricus in he person say she but appear to have the same inclination also : -- he pretend to adore I continue she with a sigh and spare no vow nor present to assure I of it : -- something within tempt I to believe he and yet i fear to be a second time betray ah madam cry louisa in the sincerity of she heart i beseech you to be cautious how you too readily give credit to the protestation of a sex who by the little observation i have make take a pride in deceive ours -- besides the count de bellfleur be of a nation where faith i have hear be little to be depend on those who give they that character reply melanthe do they a infinite injustice : -- in politics i allow they have they artifice they subterfuge as well as in war but then they put they in practice only against they enemy or such as be likely to become so : -- wherever they love or have a friendship they generosity be beyond all bound -- she pursue this discourse with a long detail of all she have ever read or hear in the praise of the french and do not forget to speak of the prince of contus as a instance of the gallant spirit with which that people be animated louisa know she temper and that it would be in vain to urge any thing in contradiction to a inclination she find she be resolve to indulge but she secretly tremble for the consequence the count have say many amorous thing to herself before he pretend any passion for melanthe and tho ' he have of late desist on find how little she be please with they yet that he have do so be sufficient to convince she he be of a waver disposition melanthe be not however to be trust with this secret she love he and jealousy add to a good share of vanity would instead of engage any grateful return for a discovery of that nature have make she hate the person he have once think of as worthy of come in any competition with herself she therefore indeed think it best not to interfere in the matter but leave the event wholly to chance the evening on the day in which this discourse have past between they they go to a ball to which they have be invite by one of the magnifico 's the honor of the prince 's company have be request but he excuse himself on account as it be imagine of he be engage with a certain german lady who also be absent give room for this conjecture : most of the gentleman who have follow he highness from france be there among whom be the count de bellfleur and a young gentleman call monsieur du plessis who by a fall from he horse have be prevent from appear in public since he arrival the gracefulness of he person the gallant manner in which he introduce himself and the brilliant thing he say to the lady on have be so long deprive of the happiness he now enjoy very much attract the admiration of the company but louisa in particular thought she have never see any thing so perfectly agreeable : a sympathy of sentiment more than accident make he chuse she for he partner in a grand dance then lead up and the distinction now pay she by he give she a secret satisfaction which she have never know before on such a occasion tho ' often single out by person in more eminent station the mind which whenever agitate by any degree of pain or pleasure never fail to discover itself in the eye now sparkle in those of louisa with a uncommon lustre nor have less influence over all she air : -- she motion always perfectly easy gentle and graceful especially in dancing be now more spirituous more alert than usual and she so much excel herself that several who have before praise she skill in this exercise seem ravish as if they have see something new and unexpected : -- she partner be lavish in the testimony of he admiration and say she as much excel the lady of he country as they have be allow to excel all other the encomium bestow on she and more particularly those she receive from he still add fresh radiance to she eye and at the same time diffuse a modest blush in she check which heighten all she charm -- never have she appear so lovely as at this time and the count de bellfleur in spight of he attachment to melanthe feel in himself a strong propensity to renew those address which she reserved behavior alone have make he withdraw and carry to another but the lady to whom for some day past he have make a shew of devote himself be present and he be ashamed to give so glare a instance of he infidelity which must in all probability render he the contempt of both this night however lose melanthe the heart she have think herself so secure of but little suspect she misfortune she treat the inconstant count with a tenderness he be far from deserving and have transplant all the affection she once have for henricus on this new object tell he at a time that such discovery be least welcome to he that she be not insensible of he merit nor could be ungrateful to he passion provide she could be convince of the sincerity of it he have go too far with she now to be able to draw back therefore could not avoid repeat the vow he before have make tho ' he heart be far from give any asient to what he tongue be oblige to utter but blind by she own desire she perceive not the change in he and appoint he to come the next day to she lodgings promise to be deny to all other company that she might devote herself entirely to he it be possible he be so lose in he passion for louisa as not to be sensible of the condescension make he by melanthe but it be certain by the sequel of he behavior that he be much less so than he pretend the ball be end these lady carry with they very different emotion tho ' neither communicate to the other what she feel melanthe have a kind of awe for those virtuous principle she observe in louisa tho ' so much she inferior and dependant and be ashamed to confess she liking of the count should have bring she to such length not that she intend to keep it always a secret from she but choose she should find it out by degree and these thought so much engross she that she say little to she that night louisa for she part have lose the presence of she agreeable partner be busy in supply that deficiency with the idea of he so that each have meditation of she own of the most interesting nature have not leisure to observe the thoughtfulness of the other much less to enquire the motive of it one of the great reason that we find love so irresistable be that it enter into the heart with so much subtilty that it be not to be perceive till it have gather too much strength to be repulse if louisa have imagine herself in any danger from the merit of monsieur du plessis she would at least have be less easily overcome by they : -- she have be accustom to be please with the conversation of many who have entertain she as he have do but think no more of they or any thing they say when out of they company but it be otherway with she now : not a word he have speak not a glance he have give but be imprint in she mind : -- she memory run over every little action a thousand and a thousand time and represent all as augmented with some grace peculiar to himself and infinitely superior to any thing she have ever see : -- not even sleep could shut he out -- thro ' she closed eye she see the please vision and fancy active in the cause of love form new and various scene which to she waking thought be wholly stranger melanthe also past the night in idea which tho ' experience in be not less ravishing : she be not of a temper to put any constraint on she inclination and have entertain the most amorous one for the count de bellfleur easily overcome all scruple that might have hinder the gratification of they : -- she head run on the appointment she have make he : -- the means she would take to engage he constancy -- resolve to sell the reversion of she jointure and accompany he to france and flattered herself with the most please image of a long series of continued happiness in the arm of he who be now all to she that henricus ever have be full of these meditation she rise and soon after receive from the subject of they a billet contain these word : _ to the charming _ melanthe madam tho ' the transport promise you make I of refuse admittance to all company but mine be a new instance of you goodness yet i can not but think we should be still more secure from interruption at a place i have take care to provide might i therefore hope you would vouchsafe to meet I about five in the evening at the dome of st mark i shall be ready with a gondulum to conduct you to a recess which seem form by the god of love himself for the temple of he purest offering than which which none can be offer with greater passion and sincerity than those of the adorable melanthe 's _ most devoted and everlasting slave _ de bellfleur _ p _ to prevent you fair friend louisa from any suspicion on account of be leave at home i have engage a gentleman to make she a visit in form just before the time of you come out : -- favor I i beseech you with know if my contrivance in both these point have the sanction of you approbation tho ' melanthe as may have be already observe in the foregoing part of she character be no slave to reputation in england and think herself much less oblige to be so in a place where she be a stranger and among people who when she once quit she might probably never see again yet she look on this caution in she lover as a new proof of he sincerity and regard for she she be also fond of every thing that have a air of luxury and doubt not to find the elegance of the french taste in the entertainment he would cause to be prepare for she reception therefore hesitate not a moment to send he the follow answer : _ to the engaging count _ de bellfleur sensible as you be of the ascendant you merit have gain over I you can not doubt of my compliance with every thing that seem reasonable to you : -- i will not fail to be at the place you mention but oh my dear count i hope you will never give I cause to repent this step -- if you should i must be the most miserable of all create being but i be resolve to believe you be all that man ought to be or that fond tenacious woman can desire and in that confidence attend with impatience the hour in which there shall be no more reserve between we and i be wholly yours melanthe thus every thing be fix for she undoing she spend the best part of the day in prepare for the rendezvous : nothing be omit in the article of dress which might heighten she charm and secure she conquest : -- the glass be consult every moment and every look and various kind of languishment essay in order to continue in that which she think would most become the occasion as she ordinarily past a great deal of time in this employment louisa be not surprize that she now waste somewhat more than usual and the discourse they have together while she be dress and all the time of dinner be very much on the ball and the company who be at it she thought be so much take up with the remembrance of du plessis that she perceive not the hurry of spirit which would else have be visible enough to she in all the word and motion of the other and which increase in proportion as the hour of she appointment draw nearer at length it arrive and a servant come into the room and acquaint louisa a gentleman desire to speak with she she be a little surprized it be usual for all those who visit there to expect they reception from melanthe but that lady who doubt not but it be the same person the count have mention in he letter prevent she from say any thing by immediately give order for the gentleman to be admit but with what strange emotion be the heart of louisa agitate when she see monsieur du plessis come into the room and after pay he respects to melanthe in the most submissive manner accost she with say he take the liberty of enquire of she health after the fatigue of the last night but add he the question now i have the happiness of see you be altogether needless those fine eye and that sprightly air declare you form for everlasting gaiety and that what be apt to throw the spirit of other into a languor serve but to render yours more sparkling louisa in spite of the confusion she feel within answer this compliment with she accustomed ease and be all seat they begin to enter into some conversation concern the state with which the magnifico 's of venice be serve the elegance with which they entertain stranger and some other topic relate to the custom of that republic when all on a sudden melanthe start up cry bless I i have forget a little visit be in my head to make to a monastery hard by : -- you will excuse I monsieur continue she i leave you partner to entertain you and fancy you two may find sufficient matter of conversation without a third person she have no sooner speak this than she go out of the room and leave louisa at a loss how to account for this behavior as she have not before mention any thing of go abroad she would have imagine she vanity have be picque that monsieur du plessis have particularize she in this visit but as she seem in perfect good humor at go away and know she think it beneath she to put any disguise on she sentiment she be certain this sudden motion must have proceed from some other cause which as yet she could form no conjecture of this deceive lady however be no sooner out of the room than monsieur du plessis draw nearer to louisa how hard be my fate madame say he in a low voice that i be compel to tell you any other motive than my own inclination have occasion my wait on you : -- heaven know it be a honor i should have seek by the lowest submission and all the way that would not have render I unworthy of it but i now come madame not as myself but as the ambassador of another and be engage by my word and honor to plead a cause which if i succeed in must be my own destruction louisa be in the utmost consternation at the mystery which seem contain in these word : she look earnestly upon he while he be utter the latter part and see all the token of a serious perplexity in he countenance as well as in the accent with which he deliver they but not be willing to be the dupe of he diversion think it best to answer as to a piece of railery and tell he laugh she imagine this be some new invention of the frolic of the season but that she be a downright english-woman understand nothing beyond plain speaking and could no way solve the riddle he propose what i say may doubtless appear so madame reply she and i could wish it have not be my part to give the explanation but i can not dispense with the promise i have make and must therefore acquaint you with the history of it after the ball continue he monsieur the count de bellfleur desire I to accompany he to he lodgings and as soon as we be alone tell I he have a little secret to acquaint I with but that before he reveal it he must have the promise of my assistance as he speak this with a gay and negligent air i imagine it a thing of no great consequence or if it be he be a man of too much honor and also know I too well to desire or expect i would engage in any thing unbecome that character : indeed i could think of nothing but a amour or a duel tho ' i be far from be able to guess of what service i could be to he in the former i be however unwarily draw in to give my word and he then make I the confident of a passion which he say have receive its birth from the first moment he behold the belle angloise for by that term pursue he bow he distinguish the adorable louisa : that he have make some discovery of he flame but that find himself reject as he think in too severe a manner and without afford he opportunity to attest he sincerity he have convert he address tho ' not he passion to a lady who he perceive have the care of she acting in this manner partly thro ' picque at you disdain and partly to gratify he eye with the sight of you which he have reason to fear you have totally deprive he of but for this stratagem he confess to I that he find the object of he pretended ardor infinitely more kind than she who inspire the real one : but this gratification of he vanity be of little consequence to he peace -- he engage I to attend you this day to conjure you to believe he heart be incapable of be influence by any other charm and whatever he make shew of to melanthe he heart be devoted wholly to you -- beg you to permit he to entertain you without the presence of that lady the means of which he will take care to contrive and charge I to assure you that there be no sacrifice so great but he will readily offer it to convince you of the sincerity of he attachment this madame add he be the unpleasing task my promise bind I to perform and which i have acquit myself of with the same pain that man would do who by some strange caprice of fate be constrain to throw into the sea the sum of all he hope the indignation which fill the virtuous foul of louisa while he be give she this detail of the count 's presumption falsehood and ingratitude prevent she from give much attention to the apology with which he conclude never since the behavior of mr b -- n at mr c -- g -- 's have she meet with any thing that she think so much merit she resentment : -- so great be she disdain she have not word to express it but by some tear which the rise passion force from she eye : -- heaven cry she which of my action have draw on I this unworthy treatment -- this be all she be able to utter while she walk backward and forward in the room endeavor to compose herself and form some answer befitting of the message monsieur du plessis look on she all this while with admiration : all that seem lovely in she when he know no more of she than that she be young and beautiful be now heighten in he eye almost to divine by that virtuous pride which shew he some part of she more charming mind what he extremely like before he now almost adore and have by the loose manner in which the count have mention these two english lady imagine they woman of not over-rigid principle now find he mistake at least as concern one of they be so much ashamed and angry with himself for have be the cause of that disorder he be witness of that he for some moment be equally at a loss to appease as she who feel be to express it but be the first that recover presence of mind madame i beseech you say he involve not the innocent with the guilty : -- i acknowledge you have reason to resent the boldness of the count but i be no otherwise a sharer in he crime than in report it and if you know the pain it give my heart while i comply with the promise i be unhappily betray into i be sure you would forgive the misdemeanor of my tongue sir answer she i can easily forgive the slight opinion one so much a stranger to I as yourself may have of I but monsieur the count have be a constant visitor to the lady i be with ever since we arrival at venice and be very certain he never find any thing in my behavior to he or any other person which could justly encourage he to send I such a message : -- a message indeed equally affrontive to himself since it shew he a composition of arrogance vanity perfidy and every thing that be contemptible in man -- this sir be the reply i send he and desire you to tell he withal that if he persist in give I any farther trouble of this nature i shall let he know my sense of it in the presence of melanthe monsieur du plessis then assure she he would be no less exact in deliver what she say than he have be in the observance of he promise to the other and conjure she to believe he should do it with infinite more satisfaction he then make use of so many argument to prove that a man of honor ought not to falsify he word tho ' give to a unworthy person that she be at last win to forgive he have undertake to mention any thing to she of the nature he have do indeed the agitation she have be in be more owe to the vexation that monsieur du plessis be the person employ than that the count have the boldness to apply to she in this manner but the submission she find herself treat with by the former convince she that he have sentiment very different from those the other have entertain of she render she more easy and she not only forgive he share in the business which have bring he there but also permit he to repeat he visit on condition he never give she any cause to suspect the mean opinion the count have of she conduct have any influence on he chap xiii _ louisa find herself very much embarrass by melanthe 's imprudent behavior monsieur du plessis declare a honorable passion for she : she sentiment and way of act on that occasion _ after the departure of monsieur du plessis louisa fall into a serious consideration of what have pass between they : not all the regard which she could not hinder herself from feel for that young gentleman nor the pleasure she take in reflect on the respect he pay she make she unmindful of what she owe melanthe : the many obligation she have receive from she and the friendship she have for she in return make she think she ought to acquaint she with the baseness of the count de bellfleur in order to prevent a affection which she find she have already too much indulge from influence she to grant he any farther favor but this she know be a very critical point to manage and be not without some apprehension which afterward she experience be but too well ground that when that lady find herself oblige to hate the man she take pleasure in loving she would also hate the woman who be the innocent occasion of it few in the circumstance louisa be but would have be sway by this consideration and choose rather to see another become the prey of perfidy and deceit than fall the victim of jealousy herself but the generosity of she nature would not suffer it to have any weight with she and she think she could be more easy under any misfortune the discovery might involve she in than in the consciousness of not have discharge the obligation of duty and gratitude in reveal what seem so necessary to be know with this resolution finding melanthe be not come home she go into she chamber in order to wait she return and relate the whole history to she as she should undress for bed but hour after hour elapse without any appearance of the person she expect she think to beguile the tedious time by reading and remember that melanthe have a very agreeable book in she hand that morning she open a drawer where she know that lady be accustom to throw any thing in which she have no occasion to conceal but how great be she surprise when instead of what she seek she find the letter from count de bellfleur which melanthe in the hurry of spirit have forget to lock up as it lay open and be from he she think it no breach of honor to examine the contents but in do so be ready to faint away between grief and astonishment she be not insensible that melanthe be charm with this new lover and have always fear she liking he would sway she to some imprudency but could not have imagine it would have carry she at least so soon to such a guilty length as she now find it do convince by the hour in which she go out and alone that she have comply with the appointment and that all she would have endeavor to prevent be already come to pass she now consider that the discovery she have to make would only render this indiscreet lady more unhappy and therefore no longer thought herself oblige to run any risque of incure she ill-will on the occasion but in she soul extremely lament this second fall from virtue which it be impossible should not bring on consequence equally if not more shameful than the first good god cry she how be it possible for a woman of any share of sense and who have be bless with a suitable education to run thus counter to all the principle of religion honor virtue modesty and all that be valuable in we sex and yet that many do i have be a melancholy witness : -- and then again what be there in this love resume she that so infatuate the understanding that we doat on we dishonor and think ruin please -- can any personal perfection in a man attone for the contempt he treat we with in court we to infamy -- the mean opinion he testify to have of we sure ought rather to excite hate than love we very pride methink should be a sufficient guard and turn whatever favourable thought we might have of such a one unknow he design into aversion when once convinced he presume upon we weakness in these kind of reasoning do she continue some time but reflect that the trouble she be in might put melanthe on ask the cause it seem best to she to avoid see she that night so retire to she own room and go to bed order the servant to tell they lady in case she enquire for she that she be a little indisposed while louisa be thus deplore a misfortune she want power to remedy the person for whom she be concerned past she time in a far different manner : the count omit nothing that might convince she of he gallantry and give she a pretence for flattering herself with he sincerity : -- he swear ten thousand oath of constancy and she easily give credit to what she wish and have vanity enough to think she merit : -- he have prepare every thing that could delight the sens for she reception at the house to which he carry she and she find in herself so little inclination to quit the pleasure she enjoy that it be as much as the little remains of decency and care of reputation could do to make she tear herself away before midnight in the fullness of she heart she have doubtless conceal no part of this adventure from louisa but on hearing she be go to rest and not very well would not disturb she the first thing she do in the morning be to run into the chamber and enquire after she health which she do in so affectionate and tender a manner that it very much heighten the other 's trouble for she it be certain that set aside too loose a way of thinking of virtue and religion and adhering to that false maxim that a woman of rank be above censure melanthe have many amiable quality and as she truly love louisa be alarm at she suppose indisposition which to conceal the perplexity she mind be in she still continue to counterfeit as well as to avoid go to a masquerade to which they have some day before be invite and which the present situation of she thought leave she no relish for melanthe would fain have perswade she that this diversion would contribute to restore she but she entreat to be excuse and the other go without she monsieur du plessis in the mean time have inform the count de bellfleur how much it be in vain for he to flatter himself with any hope of louisa that proud and inconstant nobleman be extremely mortified and say that since she be so haughty he be resolve to contrive some way or other to get she into he power as well out of revenge as inclination this the other represent to he would be a very ungenerous way of proceeding and say that as she refuse he address merely out of a principle of virtue and not for the sake of a more favored rival he ought to content himself but these argument be lose on a man whom pride of blood and a affluence of fortune have render too insolent and head-strong to think any thing reason which oppose he will and they part not well satisfy with each other tho ' du plessis conceal part of the dislike he have of he principle and manner of behavior on account of a long friendship between they family and also as the count be he superior in birth in year and in the post he hold in the army he have no sooner leave he than he come to louisa think it he duty to give she warning of the count 's design and that it would be a proper prelude to something else he have to say as the servant know she be not perfectly well they tell he they believe she would see no company but on he entreat it and say he have something of moment to impart one of they go in and repeat what he have say on which she give leave for he admission he rejoice to find she alone as he come prepare to reveal to she more secret than that of the count 's menace but the pleasure he take in have so favourable a opportunity be very much damp by see she look more pale than usual and that she be in a night-dress fearful that this change proceed from what have pass between they the day before he ask with a hastiness that shew the most kind concern if she be well no otherway disorder answer she than in my mind and that not sufficiently to have any effect over my health but to confess the truth monsieur say she the continual round of diversion this carnival afford have make what the world call pleasure cease to be so with I and i find more solid satisfaction in retirement where i be in no danger of be too much flattered or affronted ah madam cry he i see the audacity of the count dwell too much upon you thought and tremble to relate the business on which i come and which it be yet necessary you should know you mistake I monsieur reply she a common foe of virtue such as the count be incapable of take up my thought one moment it be only those i love can give I real pain i understand you madam resume he and be too much interested in you concern not to simpathize on the occasion : the misfortune such as i fear will attend the too great sensibility of melanthe may give you so terrible a idea of love in general that it will be difficult to persuade you there can be any lasting happiness to be find in that passion : -- but charming louisa continue he if you will make the least use of you penetration and examine with a desire of be convince you will easily distinguish the real passion from the counterfeit : that love whose supremest pleasure be in be capable to give felicity to the beloved object and that wild desire which aim at no more than a self-gratification : -- the one have the authority of heaven for its sanction -- the other no excuse but nature in its depravity from all attempt of the one i be confident you virtue and good sense will always defend you but to fly with too great obstinacy the other be not to answer the end of you creation and deny yourself a blessing which you seem form to enjoy in the most extensive degree both the voice and manner in which monsieur du plessis speak give louisa some suspicion of what he aim at in this definition and fill she at the same time with emotion of various kind but dissemble they as well as she could and endeavor to turn what he say into raillery you argue very learnedly on this subject it must be confess answer she smile but all you can urge on that head nor the compliment you make I can win I to believe that love of any kind be not attend with more mischief than good : -- where it be accompany with the strictest honor constancy purity and all the requisite that constitute what be call a perfect passion there be ordinarily so many difficulty in the way to the completion of its wish that the breast which harbor it must endure a continual agitation which surely none would chuse to be involve in ah madam how little be you capable of judge of this passion say he there be a delicacy in love which render even its pain please and how much soever a lover suffer the thought of for whom he suffer be more than a compensation i be myself a instance of this truth : -- i be a lover : -- conscious unworthiness of a suitable return of affection and a thousand other impediment lie between I and hope yet would i not change this dear anxiety for that insipid case i live in before i see the only object capable of make I a convert to love -- it be certain my passion be yet young but a few day have give it root which no time no absence no misfortune ever can dislodge -- the charming maid be ignorant of she conquest : -- the carnival draw near to a conclusion -- i must return to the army and these cruel circumstance oblige I either to make a declaration which she may possibly condemn as too abrupt or go and leave she unknowing of my heart and thereby deprive myself even of she pity : -- which party madam shall i take -- will the severe extreme to which i be drive be sufficient to attone for a presumption which else would merit she disdain louisa must have be as dull as she be really the contrary not to have know all this be mean to herself and the please confusion which this discovery infuse thro ' all she vein make she at the same time sensible of the difference she put between he and all those who before have entertain she on that subject but not know presently whether she ought to attribute it to she good or ill fortune she be wholly at a loss how to behave and to avoid give any direct answer still affect a air of pleasantry see cry she the little reason you have to speak in the praise of love for if pity be all you have to hope for from you mistress i be afraid the consolation will be no way adequate to the misfortune yet if you vouchsafe I that reply he kiss she hard i never shall complain I interrupted she pretend the utmost astonishment and draw she chair somewhat farther from he yes beautiful louisa resume he it be you alone who have be capable of teach I what love truly be : -- you eye at first sight subdue my heart but you virtue have since make a conquest of my soul : -- if i dare hope to make you mine it be only by such way as heaven and those who have the power of dispose you shall approve : -- in the mean time i implore no more than you permission to admire you and to convince you by all the honorable service in my power to do you while you continue here how much my word be deficient to denote my meaning louisa now find herself under a necessity of answer seriously tell he that if it be true that he have sentiment for she of the nature he pretend they would not only merit but receive the most grateful acknowledgment on she part but at the same time she should be sorry he have entertain they and would wish he not to indulge a prospect which could last no longer than while both remain in venice and must infallibly vanish on they separation no madam reply he when the next campaign be over i shall return to france and sure the distance between that kingdom and england be not so great but a less motive than yourself would easily carry I thither and such credentials also of who and what i be as i flatter myself would not appear contemptible in the eye of you friend : -- the prospect therefore be not so visionary as you seem to think provide i have you consent the mention he make of she friend remind she of she destitute condition give she the utmost shock which not be able to overcome she remain silent some moment but at last perceive he wait she reply monsieur say she there may be a thousand indissoluble bar between we which you do not think of none interrupted he eagerly but what such love as mine will easily surmount : -- it be true i be ignorant of you condition in the world but if it be superior to mine the passion i be possess of will inspire I with means to raise I to a equality and if inferior which heaven grant may be the case it will only give the opportunity of prove that i love louisa for louisa 's self and look upon every thing she bring beside as nothing the emphasis he give these word manifest they sincerity could not but give new charm to the person who speak they : louisa think she might without a blush testify the sense she have of he generosity but tho ' what she say be perfectly oblige to he yet she conclude with let he know there still be something that render the accomplishment of what he seem to wish impossible then you heart already be engage cry he or you be predestine by you parent to some happier man without either of these answer she there may be reason to prevent we ever meet more -- therefore i owe so much to the honorable offer you be pleased to make I as to wish you to overcome whatever inclination you may have for one who i once more assure you never can be yours it would be impossible to express the distraction monsieur du plessis testify at this expression : -- a thousand time over do he repeat that dreadful word never -- then add neither engage by love or promise yet never can be mine do my ill fate come wrap would to I in riddle -- yet many thing have seem impossible that be not so in themselves : -- o louisa continue he if there be any thing beside my want of merit that impede my wish and you delight not in my torment speak it i conjure you there be a necessity of deny you in this also say louisa but to shew you how little i be incline to be ungrateful be certain that i have the highest idea of you merit and prize they as much as i ought to do these last word oblige as they be could not console monsieur du plessis for the cruelty as he term it of refuse to let he know what this invincible obstacle be which put a stop to any further correspondence between they : he spare neither prayer nor tear to draw the secret from she but all be ineffectual and she at last tell he that if he press she any farther on that head she must for the future avoid he presence this be a menace which he have not courage to dare the execution of and he promise to conform to she will tho ' with such agony as shewed she how much he value even the little she be please to grant but it be not in the power of she perswasion to prevail on he to resolve to make any effort for the vanquish he passion he still protest that he neither could cease to love she and she alone nor even to wish a alteration in he sentiment by what have be already say of the extreme liking which the first fight of this young gentleman inspire louisa with it may easily be suppose she could not hear he complaint and be witness of the anxiety she be enforce to inflict on he without feel at least a equal share : she endeavor not to conceal the pity she have for he but he now find that be far from be all he want because it forward not as he at first imagine the progress of he hope but rather shew they at more distance than ever the business of he love so engross he thought during this visit that he almost forget to mention any thing of the count 's design upon she and she as little remembered to remind he of it tho ' he tell she on he entrance that he have something to acquaint she with on he subject and it be not till he be go to take leave that it come into he head when he have relate it to she she assure he that she take the caution he give she as a new proof of he friendship which say she i shall always prize at parting she permit he to salute she and give she promise not to refuse see he while they continue in that city but tell he at the same time that he must not expect any thing from he repeated visit more than she have already grant he dare not at that time press she any farther but fetch a deep sigh as he go out of the room accompany with a look more expressive than any word could be of the discontent he labor under while she oppress beneath the double weight of he and she own grief remain in a condition he be little able to form any conjecture of pleased as she be with the presence of the only man who have ever have power of inspiring she with one tender thought yet a thousand time she have wish he go before he go that she might be at liberty to give vent to the struggle passion which be more than once ready to throw she into a swoon the perfection she see in the person of she lover -- the respect he treat she with notwithstanding the violence of the passion he be possess of -- the sincerity that appear in all he look and word -- the generosity of he behavior in regard to she fortune -- all the qualification that would have make any other woman bless in the offer of such a heart serve but to make she wretched since she could not look on herself in a condition capable of accept it alas du plessis cry she little do you think to whom you would ally yourself : -- you would you say despise a portion but would you marry a foundling a child of charity one that have neither name nor friend and who in she best circumstance be but a poor dependant a servant in effect tho ' not in shew and owe she very cloath to the bounty of another -- oh why do the mistaken goodness of dorilaus give I any other education than such as befitted my wretched fortune better i have be breed a humble drudge and never be teach how to distinguish merit : -- what avail the accomplishment that cost he so much money and I so much pain to acquire but to attract a short-liv 'd admiration which when i be truly know will be succeed with a adequate derision : -- could i but say i be descend from honest tho ' mean parent i would not murmur at my fate but i have none -- none to own I -- i be a nothing -- a kind of reptile in humanity and have be shewn in a genteel way of life only to make my native misery more conspicuous thus do love represent she unhappy circumstance in they worst color and render she which till now she have never be thankless to heaven for all the good she have receive since it seem to deny she the only good she passion covet that of be in a condition to reward the affection of she dear du plessis a torrent of tear at length somewhat mitigate the violence of she passion and unwilling to be see by melanthe in the present confusion of she thought she go to bed leave the same order as she have do the night before chap xiv _ the base design of the count de bellfleur occasion a melancholy change in louisa 's way of life the generous behavior of monsieur du plessis on that occasion _ have the agony louisa suffer be of very long continuance she must have sink under they but grief be easily dissipate in a young heart and she awake more tranquil -- the principle of religion grow stronger as she passion weaker and she reflect that she ought to submit in every thing to the will of heaven which sometimes convert what seem the greatest evil into good -- the offer of such a match as monsieur du plessis a man she love and who be master of accomplishment which might excuse the most violent passion appear indeed a happiness she would have glory in have she be really such as he take she for but then she have know he but a very short time have no experience of he principle or humor and tho ' he seem all honor could not assure herself that the generosity which so much engage she might not be all artifice at least she find to think so would most contribute to she ease therefore indulge it as much as she be able she condemn herself for have give monsieur du plessis permission to continue he visit after have assure he he have nothing to hope from they because a further conversation might only serve to render both more unhappy she resolve however to give he no opportunity of talk to she of he passion and in order to avoid thinking of it herself as much as possible to go as usual into all company that come to melanthe and partake of every diversion that offer itself accordingly she force herself to a gaiety she be far from feel vainly imagine that by counterfeit a chearfulness she should in time be able to resume it but du plessis hang too heavy at she heart and when she affect the greatest shew of mirth it be often interrupted with sigh which she be not always sensible of herself he visit she almost every day under one pretence or other but she take such care never to be alone at the time that she could possibly expect he that he have not the least opportunity to renew he address any otherway than by he look which notwithstanding be perfectly intelligible to she tho ' she seem not to observe they melanthe no longer able to keep the secret of she amour find louisa as she think have entirely regain she former sprightliness acquaint she with all have pass between herself and count de bellfleur which tho ' the other be no stranger to she seem astonish at and could not help tell she that she fear the consequence of a intrigue of that nature would one day be fatal to she peace yet say melanthe where one love and be beloved it be hard to deny oneself a certain happiness for the dread of a imaginary ill -- in fine my dear louisa i find i could not live without he and heaven will sure excuse the error of a inclination which be bear with we and which not all we reason be of force to conquer -- but add she you always seem to speak of the count as of a man that want charm to excuse the tenderness i have for he and i have observe deny he those praise which i have hear you bestow very freely on person that have not half he merit louisa know how vain it be to contest with inclination in person who be resolve to indulge it and also that all advice be now too late begin to repent of what she say if madam reply she after a little pause i have seem unjust to the count 's perfection it be only because i fear you be but too sensible of they for otherwise it must be own he have a person and behavior extremely engaging but as the carnival will put a end to all the acquaintance we have contract here it give I pain to think how you will support a separation perhaps it may not happen so soon as you imagine say melanthe : -- tho ' the carnival and with it all the pleasure of this place will soon be over we love may be continue elsewhere : -- suppose louisa we go to france add she with a significant smile that shew it be she intention to do so some company come in prevent any farther discourse on this head for the present but afterward she confirm what she have now hint at and tell louisa that she have resolve to pass some little time in see those place which be in she way to france and afterwards meet the count at pari on he return from the campaign louisa unable to determine within herself whether she ought to rejoice or be sad at this intended journey fall into a sudden thoughtfulness which the other at that time take no notice of but it serve afterwards to corroborate the truth of something she be tell and prove of consequence little to be foresee the inconstant count in the mean time satieted with melanthe and as much in love with louisa as a man of he temper could be be contrive all the way he inventive wit could furnish he with to get handsomely rid of the one and attain the enjoyment of the other as he have spend many year in a continual course of gallantry and have make and break a thousand engagement he easily find expedient for throw off he intercourse with melanthe but none that could give he the least prospect of success in he design on louisa while they live together and continue friend : to part they therefore be he aim and to accomplish it the follow method come into he head on he first acquaintance with these lady he design be wholly on louisa but meet a rebuff from she he vanity rather than he inclination have make he turn he devoir to melanthe who too easily yield to he suit serve but to heighten he desire for the other : the extravagant fondness of that unhappy woman render she visibly uneasy at even the ordinary civility she see he behave with to any other discover to he that jealousy be not the least reign foible of she foul and the surest means to make she hate that person whom it be not the interest of he passion she should continue to love when they be alone together one day at the place of they usual rendezvous in the midst of the most tender endearment he ask suddenly if she have ever make louisa the confident of he happiness she be a little surprized at the question but answer that she have not and desire to know the reason of that demand because cry he i be very certain she be no friend to we love and by the manner in which she behave to I whenever she have the least opportunity of shew she ill humor i imagine she either know or suspect the affair between we melanthe conscious she have hide nothing from she and also sensible of the little approbation she give to she intrigue be very much picque that she should have do any thing to make the count perceive it -- whatever she suspect cry she haughtily she ought not to treat with any ill manners a person whom i avow a friendship for vanity answer he sometimes get the better of discretion in lady of she year : -- she know herself handsome and can not have a good opinion of the man who prefer any charm to she own -- i imagine this to be the cause why she look on I with such disdain and whenever you be not witness of she word be so keen in satyrical reflection -- on we first acquaintance she look and speak with greater softness and i can impute it to no other motive than the pride of beauty that this sudden change have happen all the time he be speak the soul of melanthe grow more and more fire with jealousy -- it be natural for every one to imagine whatever they like be agreeable to other the distaste which louisa have on many occasion testify for the count seem now to have be only affect : -- the melancholy she have be in and the deep resvery she remember she have fall into when first she inform she of they amour join to convince she that the advice she give proceed from a motive very different from what she pretend the wily count see into the workings of she soul and while he seem as if he would not discover the whole of he sentiment for fear of disoblige she throw out the plainest hint that louisa have make he advance which would have be very flattering to a heart not pre-engaged till melanthe not able to contain she rage break out into the fevered invective against the innocent louisa -- the ungrateful wretch cry she how dare she presume to envy much less to offer a interruption to my pleasure -- what have i raise the little wretch to such a forgetfulness of herself that she pretend to rival she mistress and benefactress in the height of she resentment she relate to the count in what manner she have take she into she service but that find she as she imagine a girl of prudence she have make she a companion during she travels and as such treat she with respect and make other do so too -- but say she i will reduce she to what she be and since she know not how to prize the honor of my friendship make she feel the severity of servitude nothing could be more astonishing and at the same time more please to count bellfleur than this discovery : what he feel for louisa could not be call love he desire only to enjoy she and the knowledge of she meanness together with melanthe 's resentment which he doubt not but he should be able to improve to the turn she out of door make he imagine she would then be humble enough to accept of any offer he might make she pursuant to this cruel aim he tell melanthe that now not think himself under any obligation to conceal the whole of the affair he must confess louisa have not only make he advance but go so far as to discover a very great passion for he -- as i have never say he give she the least room to hope i be ambitious of any favor from she of that nature i could not help think she be guilty of some indecency ill-becoming a woman of condition as well as infidelity to she friendship for you whom she might well see i adored : -- but alas i little suspect the obligation she have to you and now i know what she be be in the utmost consternation at she ingratitude impudence and stupidity heaven add he could she have the vanity to imagine that the genteel garb you have put she in could raise she to such a equality as to make I hesitate one moment if i should give the balance of merit on she side and quit the amiable melanthe for the pert charm of she woman melanthe believe every thing he say on this occasion be ready to burst with indignation which impatient to give vent to part from she lover much sooner than she be accustom in order to wreak on the poor louisa all that rage and malice could suggest that innocent maid little suspect the misfortune that be fall on she be at ombre with some lady who come to visit they when the furious melanthe come home and take this opportunity of heighten she intended revenge by make it more public -- so minx say she to she after have make she compliment to the company you ape the woman of fashion exceed well as you imagine but hereafter know yourself and keep the distance that become you with these word she give she a push from the table in so rough a manner that the card fall out of she hand it be hard to say whether louisa herself or the lady who be present be most astonished at this behavior every one look one upon another without speak for some time : at last louisa who want not spirit and on this occasion testify a uncommon presence of mind -- if i have seem otherway than what i be madam say she it be you command oblige I to it : -- i never yet forget myself and shall as readily resume what distance you be pleased to enjoin I insolent ungrateful wretch cry melanthe vex to the soul to find she seem so little shocked at what she have do if i permit you any liberty it be because i think you merit they -- but get out of my sight and dare not to come into it again till i send for you i shall obey you madam reply louisa and perhaps be as well pleased to be you servant as companion this resignation and seeming tranquility under a insult she expect would have be so mortifying be the greatest disappointment could be give to melanthe and increase she rage to such a degree that she fly to she as she be go out of the room and strike she several blow use at the same time expression not decent to repeat but such as in some unguarded moment woman of quality level themselves with the vulgar enough to be guilty of this be a behavior madam which demean yourself much more than I say louisa and when reason get the better of you passion i doubt not but you will be just enough to acknowledge you have injure I she get out of the room with these word but hear melanthe still outrageous in she reproach but determine not to answer make what haste she could into she own chamber where have shut herself in she give a loose to the distraction so unexpected a event must naturally occasion pride be a passion so incident to human nature that there be no breast whatever that have not some share of it and it would be to describe louisa such as no woman ever be or ever can be especially at she year to say she be not sensibly touch at the indignity she have receive from a person but a few hour before have treat she as pretty near a equality with herself -- nor be she amazement inferior to she grief when after examine with the utmost care all she word and action she could find nothing in either that could possibly give occasion for this sudden turn from the present she cast thought back on the past accident of she life and compare they together how cruelly capricious be my fate say she which never present I with a good but to be productive of a adequate evil -- how great a blessing be the protection and tenderness i find from dorilaus yet how unhappy do the too great increase of that tenderness render I -- what now avail all the friendship receive from melanthe but to make I the less able to support she ill usage -- and what of what advantage be it to I that i be beloved by a man the most worthy to be love since i be of a condition which forbid I to give any encouragement to he or my own wish in this manner do she pour forth the trouble of she soul till the hour of supper be arrive melanthe 's woman knock at the chamber and louisa have open it she tell she that she be sorry to see such a alteration in the family but it be she ladyship 's pleasure that she should eat at the second table it be very well say louisa resolve whatever she endure not to let melanthe see any thing she could do disturbed she too much and in say so go with she into the hall and sit down to table but with what appetite i leave the reader to guess melanthe who now hate she to a greater degree than ever she have love she give to the lady who be with she the whole history of louisa as far as she know of it and rather aggravate than any way soften the mean condition from which she have relieve she but when they ask she what that unhappy creature have do to forfeit a continuance of she goodness she only answer in general that she have find she to be a ungrateful and perfidious wretch as she mention no particular influence on which this accusation be ground every one be at liberty to judge of it as they please -- the accomplishment louisa be mistress of make every one convinced she have be educate in no mean way tho ' by some accident she might have be reduce to the calamity melanthe have so largely expatiate upon and more there be who pity she than approve the behavior of she superior : -- some indeed who have envy the praise they have hear bestow on she be rejoice at she fall and make it a matter of mirth wherever they come -- and other again think themselves affront by have a person who they now find be no more than a servant introduce into they company and would never visit melanthe afterward the whole time she stay in venice the affair however occasion a great deal of discourse : monsieur du plessis hear of it the next day relate after different fashion the concern he be in be conformable to the passion he have for the fair occasion and both beyond what be ordinarily to be find in person of he sex impatient to know the truth he go to melanthe 's and she happen to be abroad he desire to speak to louisa but be tell she be indispose and could see no company these order have be give by melanthe but be very agreeable to louisa herself who desire to avoid the sight of every one she have converse with in a different manner from what she could now expect but of the whole world this gentleman she most wish to shun he conceal the trouble he be in as well as he be able and affect a careless air tell the person who answer he that he only come to ask if she have hear the last new song and that he would send it to she the moment he come home he sit down and write the follow billet _ to the ever charming _ louisa that invincible bar you mention yet make so great a secret of be at last reveal and i should be unworthy of the blessing i aspire to if i be unable to surmount it cruel louisa you little know I or the force of that passion you have inspire to imagine that any difference which chance may have put between we can make the least alteration in my sentiment -- it be to you own perfection i have devote my heart not to the merit or grandeur of you ancestor what have my love to do with fortune or with family -- do a diamond lose any thing of its intrinsic value for be present by a unknown or a obscure hand -- my eye convince I of the charm of my adored louisa my understanding shew I those of she mind and if heaven vouchsafe to bless I with so rich a jewel i never shall examine whence it come -- if therefore i be not so unhappy as to be hate by you let not vain punctillo divide we and as the first proof of my inviolable passion permit I to remove you from a place where you have meet with such unworthy treatment : -- i hope you wrong I not so far as to suspect i any other design on you than such as be consistent with the strictest honor but to prevent all scruple of that nature from enter you gentle breast i would wish to place you in a convent the choice of which shall be you own provide it may be where i sometimes may be allow to pay my vow to you thro ' the grate till time shall have sufficiently prove my fidelity and you shall prevail on yourself to recempence my flame by bestow on I you hand and heart : -- the one i would not ask without the other but both together would render the happiest of mankind _ you eternally devoted _ du plessis _ p _ as i perceive it will be next to a impossibility to gain a sight of you while you continue with that ungenerous woman i entreat to know by a line how i stand in you opinion and if the offer i make you in the sincerity of my soul may be think worthy you acceptance this epistle he order he valet de chambre to give to she own hand if there be a possibility of it and the fellow so well execute he commission be acquaint with melanthe 's servant that he be carry directly up to she chamber she be a little surprized to see he because she know it be contrary to melanthe 's command that any one should see she and doubt not but to find she be treat with any kind of respect would enhance she ill humor to she but she say nothing that discover she sentiment on this point and with all the appearance of a perfect ease of mind ask what he have to deliver to she only a song mademoiselle answer he which my master order I to give you and to desire you will let he know how you like it : -- he say it might be turn into a admirable duetto and beg you would employ you genius on that score and send it by I poor louisa who take he word literally and think she present circumstance too discordant for the fulfil he request open the suppose piece of music with a ake heart but when she have peruse it and find the artifice she lover have make use of to communicate he generous intention to she it be extremely fine say she to the valet and i will do what he require to the best of my power but fear i shall not be able to give it such a turn as he may expect if you please continue she to wait a little i shall not be long before i dispatch you in speak these word she go into she closet and read over and over the offer he have make in which with the strictest examination she could find nothing but what indicate the most perfect love honor and generosity in the first transport of she soul she be tempt to comply but she second thought be absolutely against it -- those very reason which would have prevail with almost any other woman make she obstinate to refuse : -- the more she find he worthy the less could she support the thought of give he a beggar for a wife and the more she love he the less could she content to be oblige to he so she take but a small time for consideration before she return a answer in these term : _ to the most accomplished and most generous monsieur _ du plessis as it be not owe to my pride or vanity but merely compliance with the will of melanthe that my real meanness be make a secret i find it reveal without any mortification but monsieur the distance between we be not shorten by be know : as the consciousness of my unworthiness remain with I and ever must do so i again repeat the impossibility of accept you too generous passion and after this you will not wonder i should refuse those other oblige offer you be so good to make -- i leave my native country with melanthe devoted myself to she service while she be please to continue I in it and only wait she command for my do so or to return to england -- i believe by what she woman tell I this day the latter will be my fate -- think not however most truly worthy of you whole sex that i want eye to distinguish you merit or a heart capable of be influence by they perhaps too deeply for my own future peace : -- this be a confession i would not have make be i ever to see you more but as i be determine to shut myself from all the world during my abode at venice i think i owe this little recompence to the generous affection you express for I and have rather you should think any thing of I than that i be ungrateful louisa _ p _ i beg monsieur after this you will not attempt either to speak or write to I when she have send this away she fall into fresh complaining at the severity of she fate which constrain she to refuse what most she languish for : -- the uncertainty how she should be dispose of be also a matter of grief : -- she be at this time a prisoner in melanthe 's house : she have send several message to that lady by she woman entreat to know in what she have offend but could receive no other answer than abuse without one word which give she the least light into the cause of this strange treatment but that morning she be inform by the same woman that she lady protest she should never more come into she presence and that she would send she home : this as she have write to monsieur du plessis seem highly probable as there be no appearance of a reconciliation and the thought in what manner she should begin she life again on she return fill she with many anxiety which join to other of a different nature render she condition truly pitiable it be in the midst of these perplexing meditation that word be bring she from melanthe that she must prepare for she departure on the ensue day it be in vain she again beg leave to see she and to be make acquaint with the reason of she displeasure but the other would not be prevail upon but send she a purse sufficient to defray the expence of she journey to england and bid she woman tell she she have no occasion to repine for she turn she away in a much better condition than she have find she chap xv _ louisa be in danger of be ravish by the count de bellfleur be providentially rescue by monsieur du plessis with several other particulars _ louisa pack up she thing as she have be command tho ' with what confusion of mind be not easy to be express and when she be ready to go write a letter to melanthe thank she for all the favor she have receive from she acknowledge they to be as unmerited as she late displeasure which she conjure she to believe she have never even in thought do any thing justly to incur -- wish she prosperity and that she might never find a person less faithful to she interest than she have be have desire she woman to deliver this to she she take leave of the servant who all love she extremely and see she go with tear in they eye the rout she intend to take be to padua by water thence in a post chaise to leghorn where she be inform it would be easy to find a ship bind for england to what port be indifferent to she be now once more to seek she fortune tho ' in she native country and must trust wholly to that providence for she future support which have hitherto protect she accordingly she take she passage to padua in one of those boat which be continually go between venice and that city and it be near the close of day when she land be oblige to go into a inn design to lye there that night and early in the morning set out for leghorn she be no sooner in bed than have never be alone in one of those place before a thousand dreadful apprehension come into she head : all the story she have be tell when a child of robbery and murder commit on traveller in inn be now revive in she memory : -- every little noise she hear make she fall into trembling and the very whistle of the wind which at another time would have lull she to sleep now keep she waking : but these ideal terror have not long possess she before she have a occasion of real one more shocking than she most timid fancy could have suggest the wicked count de bellfleur who have take care to prevent the passion he have excite in melanthe against she from grow cool learn from that deceive lady in what manner she intend to dispose of she and no sooner hear which way she go than attend by one servant who be the confidant and tool of all he vice he take boat for padua and presently find out by describe she at what inn she be lodge come directly thither and have call the man of the house ask he if such a young woman be not lodge there to which be answer in the affirmative he tell he that she be he wife -- that be but lately marry to she in compliance with she request he have bring she to see the diversion of the carnival and that she be elope he doubt not but for the sake of a gallant since he love she too well to have give she any cause to take so imprudent a step the concern he seem to be under gain immediate credit to all he say which he easily perceive i know say he that if i have recourse to a magistrate i shall have a grant and proper officer to force she to return to she duty but i would feign reclaim she by fair means : -- it be death to I to expose she and if my perswasion will be effectual the world shall never know she fault the innkeeper then tell he she be go to bed but he would wait on he to she chamber and he might call to she to bid she open the door no answer the count if she hear my voice she may perhaps be fright enough to commit some desperate action : -- you shall therefore speak to she and make some pretence for oblige she to rise on this they both go up and the man knock softly at first but on she not answer immediately more loud -- she who hear he before but imagine something of what she have hear of other be now go to happen to herself be endeavor to assume all the courage she could for support she in whatever exigence heaven should reduce she to : -- at last she ask who be there and for what reason she be disturb the innkeeper then say he want something out of the room and she must need open the door this she refuse to do but get out of bed and begin to put on she cloath resolve to dye as decently as she could verily believe they be come to rob and murder she the man who speak all by the count 's direction then tell she that if she would not open the door he must be oblige to break it and presently beat so violently against it that the poor terrify louisa expect it to burst so think it would be better to unbolt it of she own accord than by a vain resistance provoke worse usage than she might otherwise receive : but what be she astonishment when she behold the count de bellfleur on the first moment the word monsieur du plessis repeat to she that _ he would have she one way or another _ come into she mind and make she give a great shriek but then almost at the same time the thought that he might possibly be send by melanthe to bring she back somewhat mitigate she fear -- unable be she to speak however and the consternation she appear to be in at he presence join with he take she by the hand and bidding she be under no apprehension confirm the truth of what he have tell the innkeeper who think he have no other business there and they would be soonest reconcile when alone leave they together and go down stair when the count see he be go -- i could not support the thought of see you no more my dear louisa say he i have hear melanthe 's cruel usage of you and also that you condition be such that you have no friend in england to receive you if you should prosecute you journey : -- i come therefore to make you a offer which in you present circumstance you will find it imprudent i believe to reject : -- i long have love you and if you will be mine will keep you conceal at a house where i can confide till my return to the army then will take the fame care of you and place you somewhere near my own quarter and as i shall go to pari as soon as the next campaign be over will there provide for you in as handsome a manner as you can wish -- for be assure dear lovely girl that no woman upon earth will ever be capable of make I forsake you that she have patience to hear he talk so long in this manner be wholly owing to the fear and surprize she have be in and perhaps have not yet recover enough from to make any reply to what he say if he have contented himself only with word but he action rouze a different passion in she soul she break from he arm into which he have snatch she at the conclusion of he speech and look on he with eye sparkling with disdain and rage -- perfidious man cry she be this -- this the consequence of the vow you make melanthe and do you think after this knowledge of you baseness i can harbor any idea of you but what be shocking and detestable i never love melanthe by heaven resume he she make I advance and not to have return they would have call even my common civility in question -- but from the first moment i see you beauty i be determine to neglect nothing that might give I the enjoyment of they : -- fortune have crown my wish you be in my power and it would be madness in you to lose the merit of yield and i compel I to be oblige to my own strength for a pleasure i would rather owe to you softness : -- come come continue he after have fasten the door let we go to bed -- i will save you modesty by pull you cloath off myself in speak this he catch hold of she again and attempt to untye a knot which fasten she robe de chambre at the breast on this she give such shriek and stamp with she foot so forcibly on the ground that the innkeeper fear the incensed husband as he suppose he to be be go to kill she run hastily up stair and call to have the door open say he would have no murder in he house the artful count immediately let he in and tell he he need be under no apprehension he wife be too dear to he to suffer any thing from he resentment and all the noise you hear say he be only because i insist on she go to bed by these word louisa discover how he have impose upon the man and cry out she be not he wife but as she speak very bad italian and the man understand no french the count be very fluent in that language have much the advantage the innkeeper be fully satisfied and they be again leave alone have a second opportunity to prosecute he villanous attempt you see say he how much in vain it be for you to resist : -- would it not be wiser in you therefore to meet my flame with equal warmth -- to feign a kindness even if you have none and thereby oblige I to use you with a future tenderness : -- believe i love you now with a extravagance of fondness : -- it be in you power to preserve that affection for ever : -- give I then willingly that charming mouth he have all this time be kiss she with the utmost eagerness so that with all she struggle she have not be able either to disengage herself from he embrace or to utter one word and he be very near force from she yet greater liberty when all at once heaven give she strength to spring suddenly from he and run to a table where he have lay he sword she draw it out of the scabbard with so much speed that he could not prevent she and make a push at he with one hand keep he from close with or disarm she till with the other she have pluck back the bolt of the door in this posture she fly down stair and reach the hall before he overtake she quite breathless and ready to faint he be go to lay hold of she when he find himself seize behind by two person whom on turn to examine the reason he find be monsieur du plessis and the innkeeper he start at the sight of that gentleman and be go to say somewhat to he in french when the innkeeper tell he the young woman should be molest no farther till he know the truth of the affair for say he there be a person mean monsieur du plessis who be just come in and say she have no husband and belong to a english lady of quality now at venice : -- i will therefore take care of she this night and if you have any real claim to she you may make it out before the magistrate to-morrow the count be so enraged to find it have be by monsieur du plessis he have be disappoint that he snatch he sword from louisa who have all this time hold it in she hand and make so furious a thrust at he that have he not be more than ordinary nimble in avoid it by step aside it must have infallibly go thro ' he body -- he immediately draw and stand on he defense but the innkeeper and several other people whom louisa 's cry have by this time bring into the hall prevent any mischief the confusion of voice and uproar which this accident occasion would suffer nothing to be hear distinctly but the guilt of count bellfleur might easily be read in he look and not able to stand the test of any enquiry he depart with he servant cast the most malicious reflection as he go out both on louisa and she deliverer du plessis less affect because innocent give every one the satisfaction they desire : he say that the young lady being of english birth come along with a lady of she own country to visit several part of europe merely for pleasure that the lady be still at venice and that on some little disgust between they she who be there mean louisa have quit she and be now return home by the way of leghorn of the truth of what he tell they he add they might be inform by send to venice the next day he also say that have a business to be negotiate in england he have follow this young lady in order to beg the favor of she to deliver letter to some friend he have there not have the opportunity of make this request before by reason of she departure have be so sudden that he know nothing of it before she be go the truth of all this louisa confirm and on farther talk of the affair acquaint they that the gentleman who have occasion this disturbance for she forbear mention he name have often sollicit she love on unlawful term and be reject by she have take this dishonourable way of compass he desire at a place where he know she be alone and wholly a stranger the fright and confusion she have be in have render she so faint that it be with infinite difficulty she bring out these word but have something give she to refresh she spirit and be conduct into another room out of the crowd she begin by degree to recover herself monsieur du plessis then inform she that on come to melanthe 's and hear she be go he immediately take boat resolve to prevail on she to alter she resolution of go to england or dye at she foot : that he easily find the inn she be at and that the man of the house presently tell he such a person as he describe be there but that he understand she have elope from she husband who have pursue and be now above with she never say this faithful lover do any horror equal what i feel at this intelligence -- the base count de bellfleur come presently into my mind : -- i think it could be no other who have take this abhored method of accomplish the menace you may remember i repeat to you : -- i be go to fly up stair that instant but be withhold and find it best to argue the man into reason who i find be fully prepossess you be he wife : as i be give some part of you history i see the count 's man pass thro ' the hall he see I too and would have avoid I but i run to he seize he by the throat and ask he what business have bring either he or he master to this place : the disorder he be in and the hesitation with which he speak together with refuse to give any direct answer very much stagger the innkeeper who be just consent to go up with I to you chamber and examine into the truth of this affair when we see you come down arm as you virtue prompt and at the same time fly from the villain 's pursuit louisa could not help confess that she owe the preservation of she honor wholly to he for say she the people be so fully persuade not only that i be he wife but also that i have flee from he on some unwarrantable intent that all i do or could have do would only have serve to render I more guilty in they opinion and it must have be by death alone i could have escape the monster 's more detested lust monsieur du plessis now make use of every argument that love and wit could inspire to prevail with she to accept of the offer contain in the letter he have write to she and conclude with remind she that if the charming confession she answer have make he be to be depend on and that she have indeed a heart not wholly uninfluenced by he passion she would not refuse agree to a proposal which not the most rigid virtue and honor could disapprove louisa on this reply with blush that since by the belief she should never see he more she have be unwarily draw in to declare herself so far she neither could nor would attempt to deny what she have say but add she it be perhaps by be too much influence by you merit that i find myself oblige to refuse what you require of I : -- i can not think cry she of render unhappy a person who so much deserve to be bless : -- and what but misery would attend a match so unequal as yours would be with I -- how would you kindred brook it -- how would the world confuse and ridicule the fondness of a affection so ill place -- what would they say when they should hear the nobly bear the rich and the accomplished monsieur du plessis have take for he wife a maid obscurely defend and with no other dowry than she virtue -- my very affection for you would in the general opinion lose all its merit and pass for sordid interest : -- i should be look upon as the bane of you glory -- as one whose artifice have ensnare you into a forgetfulness of what you owe to yourself and family and be despise and hate by all who have a regard for you -- this monsieur continue she be what i can not bear neither for you sake nor my own and entreat you will no farther urge a suit which all manner of consideration forbid I to comply with the firmness and resolution with which she utter these word throw he into the most violent despair and here might be see the difference between a sincere and counterfeited passion : the one be timid fearful of offend and modest even to its own loss -- the other presume bold and regardless of the consequence press in spight of opposition to its desire point louisa have too much penetration not to make this distinction : she see the truth of he affection in he grief and that awe which deter he from express what he feel : -- she sympathize in all he pain and for every sigh he oppressed heart send forth she own weep tear of blood yet not recede from the resolution she have form nothing could be more truly move than the scene between they at length he cease to mention marriage but conjure she to consider the snare which would be continually lay by wicked and design man for one so young and beautiful : -- that she could go no where without find other bellfleur and she might judge by the danger she have just now so narrowly escape of the probability of be involve again in the same : -- he represent to she in the most pathetic term that she innocence could have no sure protection but in the arm of a husband or the wall of a convent and on he knee beseech she for the sake of that virtue which she so justly prize since she would not accept of he for the one to permit he to place she in that other only asylum for a person in she circumstance difficult be it for she to resist a argument the reason of which she be so well convinced of and could offer nothing in contradiction to but that she have a certain aversion in she nature to receive any obligation from a man who have declare himself she lover and who might possibly hereafter presume upon the favor he have do she it be in vain he complain of she unjust suspicion in this point which to remove he protest to she that he would leave the choice of the monastry wholly to herself : that in whatever part she think would be most agreeable he would conduct she and that after she be enter he would not even attempt to see she thro ' the grate without have first receive she permission for he visit not all this be sufficient to assure she scrupulous delicacy : she remain constant in she determination and all he could prevail on she be leave to attend she as far as leghorn to secure she from any second attempt the injurious count might possibly make after this they enter into some discourse of melanthe and whether it would be proper for louisa to write she a account of this affair and the count 's perfidiousness monsieur du plessis say he think that the late usage she have receive from that lady deserve not she should take any interest in she affair but it be not this that hinder louisa from do it : -- the remembrance of the kindness she have once be treat with by she more than balance in she way of think all the insult that succeed it and when she reflect how much melanthe love the count and that she have already grant he all the favor in she power it seem to she rather a act of cruelty than friendship to acquaint she with this ingratitude and thereby anticipate a misfortune which perhaps by he artifice and continue dissimulation might be for a long time conceal : therefore for this reason she exact a promise from monsieur du plessis not to make any noise of this affair at he return to venice unless the count by some rash and precipitate behavior should enforce he to it this injunction discover so forgive a sweetness of disposition in the person who make it that monsieur du plessis could not refrain testify he admiration by the most passionate exclamation in which perhaps he have continue longer have not the eye of the fair object discover a certain languishment which remind he he should be want in the respect he profess to detain she any longer from that repose which seem necessary after the extraordinary hurry of spirit she have sustain therefore have take he leave of she for that night retire to a chamber he have order to be get ready for he as do she to that where she have be so lately disturb : but all those who be in the least capable of any idea of those emotion which agitate the mind of both these amiable person will believe neither of they sleep much that night chap xvi _ the innkeeper scruple oblige louisa to write to melanthe : she behavior on the discovery of the count 's falshood louisa change she resolution and go to bolognia _ monsieur du plessis have find it impossible to dissuade louisa from go to england now bent he whole thought to perform he promise of conduct she to leghorn in the most commodious manner he could accordingly he rise very early and call for the man of the house desire he would provide a handsome post chaise and if he know any fellow whose integrity might be rely on he think necessary to hire two such who furnish with fire-arm might serve as a guard against any attack the count might take it into he head to make but the innkeeper have now entertain notion that forbid he to correspond with the design of monsieur : some of he neighbor who have hear of last night 's accident whisper it in he ear that it would not be safe for he to let these young people depart together that he could not be assure the person who pretend to be the husband might not be so in reality and if he should come again with proper officer and proof to claim he wife it might be of dangerous consequence to he to have favor she escape and that the only way he have to secure himself from be bring into trouble be to lay the whole affair before the podestat this advice seem to he too reasonable not to be comply with : he go directly to that magistrate and while the lover be speak to he officer come in to seize both he and louisa and carry they before the podestat monsieur du plessis be very much surprize and vex at this interruption and the more so as he fear it would terrify louisa to a greater degree than the nature of the thing require but in this he do injury to she courage : when she be call up and inform of the business she surrender herself with all the dauntlessness of innocence to the officer and suffer they to conduct she with du plessis to the house of the podestat both of they flattered themselves with the belief that when he should come to hear the story they would be immediately discharge but he happen to be one of those who be over wary in the execution of they office and he only tell they that what they say might be true but he be not to take thing on the bare word of the party themselves and that therefore they must be confine till either the person who claim the woman for he wife should bring proof she be so or she should be able to make out he have no right over she that be easy for I to do say louisa i be only concerned that this gentleman meaning du plessis should be detain on a account he have no manner of interest in the podestat answer it be unavoidable because as the person who say he be she husband have accuse she of a elopement there be all the reason in the world to suppose that if it be so it be in favor of this gentleman by the rage he be inform he have testify at find he in padua louisa give only a scornful smile denote how much she disdain a crime of the nature she be suspect of and follow one of the officer who conduct she to the place appoint for she confinement monsieur du plessis be touch to the soul at the indignity he think offer to this sovereign of he affection but he restrain himself when he consider that it have the sanction of law which in all nation must be submit to and he only tell the podestat that the virtue of that lady would soon be clear to the confusion of those who have presume to traduce it as after they be under confinement they have no opportunity of advise each other what to do monsieur du plessis uneasy at the injustice do he write immediately to the prince of contus in these term : _ to he royal highness the prince of _ contus it be with the extremest reluctance i give you royal highness this trouble or find myself oblige to accuse the count de bellfleur of a action so dishonourable to we nation but as i be here under confinement for prevent he from commit a rape on a young english lady who fail to seduce at venice he follow hither and under the pretence of be she husband gain the people of the house on he side and have infallibly compassed he intent have it not be for my seasonable interposition : i be too well convinced of the justice i presume to implore to doubt if you highness will oblige he to clear up the affair to the podestat on which she will be at liberty to prosecute she journey and i to throw myself with the utmost gratitude and submission at you foot who have the honor to be _ you royal highness 's _ _ most devoted _ du plessis _ padua _ louisa who be ignorant what she lover have do and know no other way than by write to melanthe to extricate herself from this trouble send a letter to she the contents whereof be as follow : madam on what imagine cause whatever you be please to banish I i be certain you have too much goodness to suffer any one much less a person you have once honor with you friendship to remain in prison for a crime it be impossible for I to be guilty of : -- i be sorry i must accuse a person so dear to you -- but it be madam no other than the unworthy count de bellfleur who follow I hither come into the inn where i be lodge into the very chamber and oh i tremble while i relate it have proceed yet farther and i have be inevitably lose have not heaven send I a deliverer in the unexpected arrival of monsieur du plessis who be also a prisoner as well as myself for the timely rescue he give I you will wonder doubtless by what law either i should be confine for endeavor to defend my chastity or he for generously assist I but the detest artful count have pretend himself my husband and under the sanction of that name it be that he meet no opposition to he wicked will from the people of the house and render they regardless of my shriek and cry -- the magistrate be yet dubious of the truth and till it can be prove what i really be both myself and monsieur du plessis must continue where we be : -- have pity on I therefore i conjure you madam and write to the podestat : i have already tell he i have the honor to belong to you -- a line from you will confirm it and once more set at liberty a maid who will ever remember all you favor with the greatest gratitude and you withdraw they as the worst misfortune could have befall madam _ from the prison at padua you most faithful and most humble servant _ louisa these letter be send away by special messenger who have order to be as expeditious as possible in the delivery of they but while these accident happen at padua melanthe be not without she share of inquietude at venice : she have not see she beloved count in two whole day and tho ' she send several time to he lodgings could hear nothing but that he be not yet come home as she vanity would not suffer she to think herself neglect without have receive some glaring proof of it she fear some misfortune have befall he and expose herself not a little in the enquiry she make after he among all those who she could imagine be able to inform she any thing concern he at length some person who happen to see he take boat tell she he be go to padua which be the rout she know louisa have take and she have also inform he a sudden thought dart into she head that he be go in pursuit of she -- it now seem not impossible but that all he have say concern he dislike of she might be artifice and that the love of variety might prevail on he at last to comply with the advance he pretend she have make he -- the privacy with which he go none of he acquaintance know any thing of he journey seem to favor this opinion and never be a heart more rack with jealousy and suspence than that of this unhappy and too easily deceive lady she have sometimes a inclination to go to padua in person and endeavor to find out what business have carry he thither and she impatience have doubtless get the better of she prudence in this particular if send once more to he lodgings she have not hear he be return -- on this she expect to see he in the evening and flattered herself with he be able to make some reasonable excuse for he absence but find he come not she be all distraction and send a billet to he next morning require he to come to she immediately on the receipt of it but as he be at that time in too ill a humor to think of entertaining she send she a answer by word of mouth that he be indispose and would wait on she on he recovery -- this message seem so cold and so unlike the passion he have hitherto profess for she that it throw she into almost convulsive agony -- a masquerade be to be that night at the house of a person of quality : she send again to know if he intend to be there and if he do what habit he would wear it be customary with they ever since they amour to acquaint each other with they dress that they might not mistake by address to wrong person he reply be that he would go if health permit but as to what he should wear he have not as yet think of it what if he hat not think of it cry she haughtily when she hear these word -- the knowledge that i shall be there ought now to make he think of it -- pride love and the astonishment at this sudden change in he behavior render she wholly forgetful of what she owe she sex and rank and she be just go to he lodgings in order to upbraid he with he indifference and prove what it be she now have to depend on from he when the messenger from louisa arrive and deliver she the letter which contain a sad eclaircisement of all she want to be inform of at first reading it she seem like one transfix with a sudden clap of thunder : -- she have indeed be jealous suspicious fearful of she fate but so glaring so impudent a treachery have never enter she head that any man could be guilty of much less one whom she too fond passion have figure to she imagination as possess of all the virtue of he sex it seem too monstrous to be true and she have accuse the innocent louisa as the inventor of this falshood merely in revenge for she late treatment have there be the least shadow of a pretence for do so : -- gladly would she have encourage such a hope but common sense forbid it -- all circumstance seem to concur in prove that he be indeed that villain which the letter represent he and that surprize which have in a manner stupify she on the discovery be succeed by a storm of mingled grief and rage which no word can sufficiently describe : -- she exclaim against fate curse all mankind and accuse every thing as accessory to she misfortune but that to which alone she owe it she own imprudence the disorder of she mind have such a effect on she body that she fall into fit and a physician be send for who tho ' esteem the most skilful in that country find it require all he art to prevent a fever : she continue however for five day in a condition such as permit she not to do any thing either for the satisfaction of she own impatient curiosity or to comply with the just request louisa have make and have not monsieur du plessis 's letter to the prince be mere successful they must both have continue where they be perhaps for a considerable time that however have all the effect could be expect from a prince of so much honor : he immediately send for the count de bellfleur and easily finding by the confusion with which he reply to he examination and the little low evasion he be oblige to have recourse to that the affair be as monsieur du plessis have represent give he a severe check and order he to depart immediately from venice where he tell he he have give such occasion to call the honor of the french nation in general in question and to repair with all expedition to he winter quarter which command he instantly obey without take any leave of melanthe or perhaps even think on she at the same time the prince dispatch he gentleman of horse to padua with necessary instruction for clear up the affair on which the prisoner be discharge and they pardon ask by the podestat for do what he say the duty of he post have alone oblige he to tho ' it be certain he have exercise he authority with greater strictness than the necessity of the thing require since if the count have be in reality the husband of louisa it would have be more easy for he to bring proof of it than for those under confinement to invalidate he claim after the proper compliment to the gentleman who have take this trouble monsieur du plessis entreat he would excuse he to the prince that he retard the thanks he have to pay he royal highness till he return from conduct louisa some part of she journey which be a piece of gallantry the lady herself seem well please with be easily comply with by the other this faithful lover have now a full opportunity to entertain he mistress with he passion and represent it to she with so much force and eloquence together with the danger she would continually be expose to that she have at length no word to form denial and give he leave to conduct she to some monastry in italy the choice of which she leave to he till the campaign be over this be indeed all he presume to request of she at present it may happen say he that you lover may fall a victim to the fate of war among many other more brave and worthy man who doubtless will not survive the next battle and you will then be at liberty to pursue you inclination either to england or elsewhere and be assure of this that i shall take care before the hour of danger to leave you mistress of a fortune sufficient to protect you from any future insult of the nature you receive from melanthe the tender soul of louisa be so much dissolve at these word that she burst into a flood of tear and cry out oh too generous du plessis think not i will survive the cruel hour which inform I all that be valuable in man have cease to be -- take -- oh take no care for I when you be no more nothing this world afford can enable I to drag on a wretched life what must be the transport of a man who love like he to hear a mouth accustom to the greatest reserve utter exclamation so soft so engage so convincing to he that he be no less dear to she than he could even wish to be -- he throw himself at she foot and even think that posture not humble enough to testify as it deserve he gratitude and joy but she not suffer he to continue in it he take the hand that raise he kiss off the tear which have fall from she eye upon it with speechless extacy and seem almost beside himself at the concern she could not yet overcome on the bare imagination of lose he in the way he mention if you love I say she tenderly you will endeavor to preserve yourself : -- i have now put myself under you protection by consent to do as you would have I and have no other from whom i would receive those favor i expect from you : -- think not therefore that i will perform my promise unless you give I yours not to be so covetous of fame as to court danger nor in too eager a pursuit of glory to lose the remembrance of what you owe to love oh thou divinest softness cry he be assure i will put nothing to the venture that might take I from louisa -- you kindness my angel have shew I the value of life and almost make a coward of you lover : -- no farther will i go than the duty of my post oblige I and that honor which to forfeit would render I unworthy of you care louisa now find herself so much at ease in have discover a secret she have so long labor with and suffer a infinity of pain in the conceal of that nothing could be more chearful than she look and behavior he on the other hand be all rapture yet do it not make he in the least forgetful of the rule he have prescribe himself or give she modesty any room to repent the confession she have make in favor of he passion : -- the conversation between they be all make up of innocence and love and every hour they pass together render they still dearer to each other monsieur du plessis have thus gain the point he soul be let on begin to consider in what part of italy it would be best to place he dear louisa : as bolognium be a free country under the jurisdiction of the pope he think she would there be the least subject to alarm on account of the army 's continual march and countermarch thro ' most other part of italy he therefore get a post-chaise and by easy journey conduct she thither and have make a agreement with the lady abbess of the augustine she be welcome into the convent by the holy sisterhood with all imaginable good-nature and politeness it would be endless to recite the farewel of these equally sincere and passionate lover so i shall only say that never any parting be more truly touching and the grief which both of they endure be only alleviate by the confidence they have in each other 's affection and the mutual promise of communicate the assurance of persevere in it by letter as often as opportunity would permit melanthe be recover of the indisposition of she body tho ' not of she mind be inform of every particular of she perfidious lover 's conduct as he have quit venice before she do she chamber be oblige to bear the load of discontent she too easy belief have bring upon she without even the poor ease of vent it in reproach on he the carnival soon after end and find that change of place be no defense from misfortune of the kind she have sustain without she could also change she way of think take the first convenience that offer and return to england rather in worse humor than she have leave it chap xvii _ horatio arrive at warsaw see the coronation of stanislaus and he queen : he reception from the king of sweden : he promotion : follow that prince in all he conquest

the whole world but notwithstanding he eagerness which carry he thro ' marsh over mountain and way which to a ordinary traveller would have seem impassable he meet with several delay in he journey especially when he get into germany where they be extremely scrupulous and he be oblige to wait at some town two or three day before he could obtain passport : he also meet several party of fly horse and dragoon who be scout about the country as he draw nearer saxony but he policy furnish he with stratagem to get over these difficulty and he get safe to punitz in the palatinate of posnanium where a great part of the king of sweden 's army be encamp -- he immediately demand to be bring to the presence of the grand marshal renchild to whom he deliver the letter of the baron de la valiere and find the good effect of it by the civility with which that great general vouchsafe to treat he he would have have he stay with he but horatio know the king be at warsaw be too impatient of see that monarch to be prevail upon on which he send a party of horse to escort he to that city he have the good fortune to arrive on the very day that stanislaus and he queen be crown and be witness of part of the ceremony the king of sweden be there incognito and be shewn to horatio he could not forbear testify he surprize to see so great a prince and one who in every action of he life discover a magnamity even above he rank habit in a manner not to be distinguish from a private man but it be not in the power of any garb to take from he a look of majesty which shew he bear to command not only he own subject but king themselves when they presume to become he enemy there be a fierceness in he eye but temper with so much sweetness that it be impossible for those who most tremble at he frown to avoid loving he at the same time stanislaus have in he all that could attract respect and good wish beside the most graceful person that can be imagine he have a certain air of grandeur join with a openness of behavior that shew he equally incapable of do a mean or dishonourable action : he queen be one of the greatest beauty of she time and every one present at they coronation confess that never any two person more become a throne or be more worthy of the dignity confer upon they the whole court be too much take up that day for horatio to think of present himself before the king of sweden but the officer who command the party that general renchild have send with he introduce he in the evening to count hoorn governor of warsaw who provide he a appartment and the next morning introduce he to count piper that minister no sooner read the baron de palfoy 's letter and hear he have other to deliver to the king from the chevalier st george and the queen dowager of england than he treat he with the utmost mark of esteem and assure he that since he have a inclination to serve he majesty he would contribute every thing in he power to make he not repent the long fatigue he have undergo for that purpose but say he with a smile you will have no need of I you bring i perceive recommendation more effectual and have besides in yourself sufficient to engage all you have to wish from a monarch so just and generous as ours horatio reply to this compliment with all humility and as the count perceive by he accent that he be not a frenchman tho ' he speak the language perfectly well he ask he of what country he be to which horatio reply that he be of england but make he no farther acquaint with he affair nor that the motive of he have remain so long in france be because he be not ransom by he friend : not that he conceal this out of pride but he know the character of most first minister and think it not prudence to unbosom himself to one of those whose first study when they come into that employment be to discover as much as they can of other without reveal any thing of themselves for this reason he be also very spare of enter into any discourse of the chevalier 's court or of that of the king of france and answer all the question put to he by the count that he youth and being of foreign extraction hinder he from be let into any secret of state after a pretty long conversation the count lead he to the king of sweden 's apartment where just as they be about to enter he ask he if he could speak latin for say he tho ' he majesty understand french he never could be bring to speak it nor be pleased to be address in that language horatio thank he for this information and tell he that tho ' he could not boast of be able to deliver himself with a affluence become the presence of so great a prince yet he would chuse rather to shew he bad learning than he want of ambition to do every thing that might render himself acceptable as he speak these word he find himself in he presence -- the king be encompass by the officer of the army to whom he be give some direction but see count piper and a stranger with he he leave off what he be say and without give he time to speak cry count who have you bring I here one may it please you majesty reply he who bring he credentials with he and have no need of my intercession to engage he welcome while the count be make this reply the king who have a uncommon quickness in he eye measure horatio from head to foot and we young soldier of fortune without be daunt put one knee to the ground and deliver he packet with these word : -- the prince by whom i have the honor to be send command I to assure you majesty that they participate in all you danger rejoice in all you glory and pray that as you only conquer for the good of other the sword you draw in the cause of justice may at last be sheathe in a lasting and universal peace i be afraid it will be long before all that be necessary for that purpose be accomplish say the king wrong when establish not easily give place to right -- but we be yet young enough to hope it he break open he letter as he speak this and while he be examine they take he eye off the paper several time to look on horatio and then read again when he have do i be much oblige say he to the zeal these letter tell I you have express for my service and shall not be ungrateful : -- we be here idle at present but shall not long be so and you will have occasion enough to prove you courage and gratify that love of arm which my brother inform I be the predominant passion of you soul after this he ask he several question concern the chevalier st george the queen and princess louisa to which horatio answer with great propriety but mingle with such encomium of the royal person as testify he gratitude for the favor he receive from they but when he mention the princess and deliver the message she send by he a more lively color flush into the king 's cheek and he reply well we shall do all we can to comply with she command then turn quick about and resume the discourse he be in before horatio 's entrance with he officer as much as to say the business of he love must not interrupt that of the war and horatio have afterwards the opportunity of observe that tho ' he often look upon the picture of that amiable princess which he always wear in he bosom yet he would on a sudden snatch he eye away as fear to be too much softened horatio be order to be lodge in the castle where the garrison be keep but he be every day at the king 's levee and receive the most extraordinary mark of he favor and affection for which as he look upon himself entirely indebted to the recommendation of he friend in france he write letter of thanks and a account of all that happen to he poland be now entirely subdue by the valor and fortune of charle xii and have receive a king of he nomination submit cheerfully glad to see a end of devastation as they then flatter themselves but the trouble of that unfortunate kingdom be yet to endure much longer -- augustus impatient of recover what he have lose and the czar of muscovy jealous and envious of the king of sweden 's glory come pour with mighty army from saxony and russium shullenburgh the general of the former have pass the oder and the other at the head of a numerous body be plunder all that come in he way and put to the sword every one whom he even suspect of adhering to king stanislaus : so that nothing now be talk of but war and the means concerted how to put a stop to the misery these two ambitious prince make not only in that country but all the adjacent part it be agree that general renchild should go to meet shullenburgh and the two king drive out the muscovite who be divide into several party stanislaus go at the head of one army and the king of sweden lead another and take different rout have every day what he call skirmish but what the vanquish look upon as terrible battle the king of sweden before they departure from warsaw tell horatio that all he officer be gallant man and it be not he custom to displace any one for meer favor to another he must therefore wait till the fate of war or some other accident make a vacancy before he could give he a commission in the mean time say he with a great deal of sweetness you must be content to be only my aid-de-camp on this horatio reply to he majesty with as much politeness as sincerity that it be the post he wish tho ' dare not presume to ask for he look upon the honor of be near and receive the command of so excellent a monarch preferable to the highest commission in the army thus highly contented with he lot do he attend the king thro ' river lake marine and all the obstacle nature have throw in the way of this conqueror and whenever they come to any battle be so swift in bear he command to the general and in return to he in which line soever he be that poniatosky give he the name of the mercury to they jove nor do he less signalize he valor he fight by the side of the king like one who value not life in competition with the praise of he master in a engagement where they take the baggage of augustus he do extraordinary service and a colonel then be kill on the spot the king presently cry out now here be a regiment for my horatio we young warrior thank he on he knee but beseech he might not be remove from he again protest that he could no be deserve so well as where he be animated by he royal presence this charle xii take very kindly and tell he he should have he desire but say he i must also have mine : -- i will continue you my aid-de-camp but you shall accept the commission and the lieutenant colonel shall command the regiment in you absence he also allot he so large a share in the prize take in this battle that horatio be already become rich enough to avow he pretension to the daughter of the baron de palfoy but dear as she be to he he love and admiration of the king of sweden join to the ambition of desire still more than he have receive keep he from entertain the least desire of quit the service he be in in eight or nine week do the two king clear the country round and drive they enemy into the heart of lithuanium as they be about to return they be meet by the welcome news that general renchild have be no less successful and entirely route the whole army of shullenburgh and also that the diet of ratisbon fear the king of sweden would enter germany have come to a resolution to declare he a enemy to the empire in case he offer to pass the oder with he army they could not have take a more effectual step to bring on what they dread than by daring he to it by this menace he take but little time for consideration before he determine to carry the war into saxony and drive augustus from he electorate as he have do from he kingdom he have no sooner make know he resolution than the troops begin to march and with a chearfulness and alacrity which shew they have no will but that of they king : -- indeed he seem the soul of this mighty body of which every single man be a member and actuate only by he it be certain he heart be set on establish stanislaus on the throne and he know no better way of prevent augustus from molest he than by call off all communication between he electorate and poland : -- accordingly he bent he course to saxony march thro ' silesium and lusatium plunder the open country lay the rich city of leipsic and other town under contribution and at length encamp at alranstadt near the plain of lutsen whence he send to the estate of saxony to give he a estimate of what they could supply and oblige they to levy whatever sum he have occasion for : not that he have the least spark of avarice in he nature but he hatred to augustus who have by he injustice make he become he enemy be so great that it extend to all those of he country so far as to humble and impoverish the once opulent inhabitant make they not only support he numerous army but lay on they besides many unnecessary impost which he divide among he soldier so that they be all cloathe in gold and silver and every private man have the appearance of a general the king himself still prefer he usual plainness but he love he say to see the saxon riches upon swedish back horatio have now a second opportunity of write to france which he do not fail to do and as there be no talk of the army decamp for some time let he friend know he hope to hear from they at alranstadt augustus in the mean time deprive of every thing and a wanderer in that kingdom where he have lately reign send a mean submission to he entreat peace and that he might have leave to return to he electorate this be grant by the conqueror on condition he would renounce for ever all thought of re-enter poland or give any disturbance to stanislaus but as the treaty be go to be sign the czar send a army of 20000 man to he relief who defeat general mayerfield whom the king have leave to guard that kingdom and the dethrone monarch once more enter warsaw the capital of poland in triumph charle xii be so exasperated when he receive this intelligence that he give immediate order to decamp resolve he should not long enjoy the benefit of he breach of faith but the pusillanimity of augustus prevent he : that prince be afraid the czar should discover the peace he have be secretly negotiate and withdraw he troup and as he have neither any of he own nor money to assist he he send the article demand of he by the king of sweden sign with he own hand and set out to alranstadt hope by he presence and persuasion to mollify he indignation and be permit to enjoy he own saxony in peace what more could the utmost ambition of man require than the king of sweden now receive to see a prince so lately he equal and inveterate enemy come to solicite favor of he in he camp almost at he foot but whatever be he sentiment on this occasion he conceal they and tho ' he could not but despise such a act of meanness he treat he with the utmost politeness tho ' without make any abatement of the demand he have exact from he on the contrary he insist on he deliver up to he general patkul ambassador from the czar who at that time be a prisoner in saxony be determine to put he to death as a traitor have be bear he subject and now enter into the service of he swear enemy augustus beseech he in the most abject manner to relinquish this one point and remonstrate to he that the czar he present master would look on it as the utmost indignity offer to himself in the person of he ambassador : he assure he he hate patkul but fear the give he up would be resent by all the prince of europe all he could urge on this head be to no effect the king of sweden be not to be move from any resolution he have once make and the unfortunate patkul be send to alranstadt and chained to a stake for three whole month and afterwards conduct to casimir where he be to receive he sentence horatio who be a entire stranger to the motive of this behavior in the king and have never see any thing before in he that look like a cruel disposition be one day mention he surprize at it to a young officer with whom he have contract a great intimacy on which he give he the follow account : this patkul say he be a livonian bear which tho ' a free country be part of the dominion annex to the crown of sweden : charle xi begin to introduce a more absolute form of government than be consistent with the humor of that people he son have be far from recede in that point and patkul be a person of great consideration among they stand up for they liberty in a manner which we king could not forgive : -- he order he to be seize but he make he escape and be proscribe in sweden on which he enter into the service of king augustus and be make he general but on some misunderstanding between he and the chancellor he quit poland and go to russia where he get into great favor with the czar be highly promote and send he residentiary ambassador in saxony augustus whose fate it have be to disoblige every body on some pretence clapp would into prison the representative of he only friend and now we see have give he up to death to satiate the demand of he greatest enemy horatio could not keep himself from fall into a deep muse at the recital of this adventure : he think patkul worthy of compassion yet find reason to justify the king 's resentment and as this officer have often disburthened himself to he with the greatest freedom he have no reserve toward he and this lead they into a discourse on arbitrary power -- horatio say that he could not help believe that nature never intend million to be subject to the despotic will of one person and that a limited government be the most conformable to reason the officer agree with he in that except the person who rule have really more perfection than all those he rule over and if so say he and he command be always calculate for the happiness of the subject they can not be more happy than in a implicite obedience true reply horatio i be confident that such a prince as ours know how to chuse for he people much better than they do for themselves but how can they be certain that he descendant will have the same virtue and when once a absolute power be grant to a good prince it will be in vain that the people will endeavor to wrest it from the hand of a bad one -- never can any point be redeem from the crown without a vast effusion of blood and the endanger such calamity on the country that the relief would be as bad as the disease upon the whole therefore i can not think patkul in the wrong for attempt to maintain the liberty of he country tho ' i do for enter into the service of the avowed enemy of he master it be that i believe resume the other that the king chiefly resent : he majesty be too just to condemn a man for maintain the principle he be breed in however they may disagree with he own but to become he enemy to enlist himself in the service of those who aim at the destruction of he lawful prince be certainly a treason of the blackest dye as they be in this discourse colonel poniatosky come in and hear they be speak of patkul -- i have just now say he receive a letter from one of my friend in saxony concern that general which deeply affect I not for he own but for the sake of a lady to whom after a long series of disappointment he be just go to be marry when augustus against the law of nation make he a prisoner i will relate the whole adventure to you continue he on which the other assure he they should think themselves oblige to he he go on when he first enter into the service of augustus he become passionately in love with madam d' ensilden a young lady whose beauty birth and fortune render she worthy the affection of a man of more honor than he have testify in he public capacity : she friend at least think so and chancellor flemming make he address to she at the same time have the advantage in every thing but in she heart : there patkul triumph in spight of all objection : and tho ' king augustus vouchsafe himself to sollicite in behalf of he favorite she constancy remain unshaken as a rock which so incense a monarch haughty and imperious in he nature before humble by we glorious charle that he make use of he authority and forbid she to think of marry any other : to which she resolutely answer that she know no right prince have to interfere with the marriage of private person but since he majesty command it she would endeavor to obey and live single this not satisfy the king he hate patkul from that moment and the rival soon after meeting in madam d' ensilden 's apartment some hot word arise between they which be by flemm report to he master he send in the moment of he passion to require patkul to resign he office of general : he do so but with a murmur that be far from abate the royal resentment and he have then order he into confinement but that private intelligence be give he he make he escape before the officer commission for that purpose reach he house he then go to the czar who know he a experienced general of which at that time he stand greatly in need gladly receive he and it be there he first merit the hate of all good man by countenance and abet those ambitious project he new master be then form against the king of sweden : but see the fate of treason he persuade he to enter into a alliance with poland and saxony against sweden which lay the foundation of this unjust war and for which augustus have so dearly pay and be send ambassador in order to negotiate these affair again renew those of he love augustus now oblige to the czar for the preservation of he dominion dare not openly espouse chancellor flemming but no sooner hear that the marriage be near be compleat than he venture every thing to prevent it and under a pretence of he own forge confine patkul in the castle of konist where he lay a considerable time the czar be too much take up with combate the fortune of we victorious king to examine into this affair and besides unwilling to break with augustus as thing then stand madam d' ensilden do all this time whatever could be expect from a sincere affection in order to procure he enlargement but the interest of she friend at least of those who would be employ in this intercession be infinitely too weak to oppose that of flemming and the king 's own inclination so that he remain a prisoner without be permit either to write to madam d' ensilden or see she till the time of he be deliver into we hand but on hearing he be so my friend inform I she great spirit which till now have make she support she misfortune without discover to the world any part of the agony she sustain in a instant quite forsake she : she abandon herself to despair and grief equally exclaim against the czar augustus and charle xii have ever since shut herself up in she apartment which she have cause to be hang with black the window close and no light but what a small lamp afford and only add more horror to the melancholy scene : she weep incessantly and as she expect she lover will obtain no mercy declare she only wait till she hear the sentence of he fate be give to dye if possible at the same moment of he execution i must confess continued poniatosky the history of this lady 's suffering touch I very much and tho ' i think she lover well worthy of the death he will undoubtedly receive could wish some unexpected chance might once more set he free and in a condition to recompence so tender a passion which augustus have now no longer any power to oppose horatio have a heart too tender and too sensible of the woe of love not to be greatly affect with this passage and as they all be young and probably have each of they a lady to whom they affection be give could not help sympathize in the misfortune of two person who seem to have fall into they merely by the sincere attachment they have for each other chap xviii _ king stanislaus quit alranstadt to appease the trouble in poland : charle xii give law to the empire : a courier arrive from paris : horatio receive letter which give he great surprize _ augustus be able to obtain no better condition from the king of sweden than leave to return to he almost ruin electorate take leave of he conqueror with a almost broken heart -- intelligence soon after arrive that poland be half demolish by the violence of different faction who in the absence of both they king contend with equal fury for the sovereign power stanislaus take a affectionate farewell of he dear friend and patron and go to appease the trouble of that kingdom and make himself peaceably acknowledge for what he be they lawful king not only by election but by the gift of the conqueror charle xii of sweden he be attend by 10000 swedish horse and twice the number of foot in order to make good he claim against any of he rebellious subject charle have now accomplish all he could desire in relation to the polish affair begin to grow weary of the idle life he lead at alranstadt and be think which way he should turn he arm he have be use ill by the czar who as have be before observe plot he destruction while a minor and begin hostility when he think he not in a condition to defend himself much less to make any reprisal : he resentment therefore against he be no less implacable than it have be against augustus -- but the emperor have also disoblige he count zobor the chamberlain have take very indecent and unbecoming liberty with he character in the presence of he own ambassador at vienna and that court have give shelter to 1500 muscovite who have escape he arm flee thither for protection as he be now so near he therefore think best to call the emperor first to account and then proceed to attack the czar to this end he send to demand count zobor and the 1500 muscovite should be give into he hand : the timid emperor comply with the first and send he chamberlain to be punish as the king think fit but it be not in he power to acquiesce with the other the roman envoy then at vienna have intelligence of it provide for they escape by different rout the king of sweden then send a second mandate require protection for all the lutheran throughout germany particularly in silesium and that they should be restore to all the liberty and privilege establish by the treaty of westphalium the emperor who would have yield any thing to get the king of sweden out of he neighborhood grant even this disobliging as it be to the pope and he own catholic subject : and have ratify these concession the king vouchsafe to let he chamberlain return without any other punishment than imprisonment so long as these affair remain in agitation have thus give law to germany and terror to the emperor he resolve to turn where he might expect more opposition and accordingly he order count piper to acquaint the officer that they must now begin to think of prepare for a march in the mean time ambassador from all the court of europe be send to he camp most of they be apprehensive that they should be the next who feel the terror of he arm : but those who have nothing of this kind to dread and more really he friend make use of all the argument in they power to prevail on he to return to stockholm france in particular send courier after courier remonstrate to he that he glory be complete that he have already exceed alexander and should now return cover as he be with lawrel and let he subject enjoy the blessing of he presence the court of st germain add they entreaty to that of versaille but each be equally ineffectual nor could even the thought of the beautiful princess louisa he betrothed spouse and whom he be to marry at the end of this war put a stop to the vehemence of he impatience to revenge the many injury he have receive from the czar of muscovy these be the sentiment by which this conquer monarch be agitate but horatio tho ' no less fond of glory have a softness in he nature which make he languish for the sight of he dear charlotta whom he have be absent from near two year and be now bless with a fortune from the plunder of saxony which might countenance he pretension to she passionately long for a opportunity of return without incur the censure of cowardice or ingratitude by these courier he receive letter from the baron de la valiere and several other of he friend but none from the father of charlotta nor do any of they make any mention of that lady tho ' he know the passion he have for she be now no secret to any of they he be very much surprize that the baron de palfoy have not write because as he have in a manner promise to correspond with he by desire he to write he have a right to expect that favor when they come to alranstadt for till then it be scarce possible by reason of the army 's continual and uncertain motion but he be much more so that the baron de la valiere have not be so good as to give he some information of a affair of which he could not be insensible he peace so much depend : that he do not do it he therefore presently conclude be owe to the have nothing pleasing to acquaint he with as love be always apprehensive of the worst that can possibly befal he think now of nothing but she be oblige to give she hand to some rival approve by she father : -- what avail it cry he that fortune have raise I to a equality with she if by other means i be deprive of she he be begin to give way to a despair little befitting a soldier when another courier arrive from versaille with dispatch to the king he also receive a packet in which be three letter the first he cast he eye upon have on it the character of charlotta : amaze and transport he hastily break the seal and find it contain these line : _ to colonel _ horatio sir i have the permission of my father to pursue my inclination in give you this testimony how sincerely i congratulate you good fortune tho ' i ought not to call it by that name since i find every-body allow you reward have not exceed you merit but as neither have be find deficient either for you ambition or the satisfaction of you friend all who be truly such think you ought to be content and run no future hazard -- be assure you have many well-wisher here among the number of whom you will be guilty of great injustice not to place charlotta de palfoy how well be all the late anxiety he have endure atton for by this billet it be short indeed and write with a more distant air than he might have expect have the dear authoress be at liberty to pursue the dictate of she heart but as it inform he it be permit by she father and be doubtless under he inspection the knowledge that he have authorize she to write at all be more flattering to he hope of happiness than all she could have say without that sanction after have indulge the rapture this condescention excite he proceed to the rest and find the next he open be from the baron de palfoy who express himself to he in these term : _ to colonel _ horatio i think myself oblige to you for so much exceed the character i give you but i value myself on know mankind and be glad to find i be not deceive in you when i expect you to do more than i durst venture on my own opinion to assure the count he tell I in a letter i receive from he the last courier that the victorious charle xii himself can not behave with greater bravery in the time of action nor more moderation after it be over -- this be a great praise indeed from such a man as he and i acquaint you with it not to make you vain for that would blemish the lustre of you other good quality but that you may know how to make proper acknowledgment to that minister we court i know make press influence to the king of sweden not to carry on the way any farther : i wish they may succeed or if they should not that you might be able to find some opportunity of quit the service for reason which you will see in a letter that accompany this and to which nothing can be add to convince you what part you ought to take -- i shall therefore say no more than that i be with a very tender regard _ yours _ palfoy rejoice as he be at receive a letter from the father of he mistress write in a manner which he might look upon as a kind of confirmation he no longer would be refractory to he wish the latter part of it contain a enigma he could by no means comprehend -- it seem impossible to he there could be any reason prevalent enough to make he quit with honor a prince who have so liberally reward he service but hope a further explanation he lose not any time in conjecture and tear open the other letter without give himself time to examine the hand in which it be direct find to he inexpressible astonishment the name of dorilaus subscribe it be indeed write by that gentleman and contain at follow : _ dear horatio _ accident which at we parting neither of we could foresee have doubtless long since make you cease to hope any continuance of that kindness my former behavior seem to promise but never perhaps do heaven deal its blessing with a more mysterious hand than it have do to you -- that seem neglect in I at a time when you be a prisoner among stranger and have most need of my assistance have the appearance of the greatest misfortune could befall you yet have it be productive of the greatest good and lay the foundation of a happiness which can not be but last -- i reserve the explanation of this riddle till you arrive at pari where i now be and intend to continue my whole life -- that i impatiently desire to see you ought to be a sufficient inducement for you to return with as much expedition as possible : -- i will therefore make this experiment of that affection i might add duty you owe I and only give you leave to guess what recompence this proof of you obedience will entitle you to -- if therefore the king of sweden be resolute to extend he conquest entreat he permission to resign : i know the obligation you have to that excellent prince but i know also you have other to I which can not be dispense with : -- besides he majesty 's affair can not suffer by the loss of one man : yours will be in danger if not totally ruin by you continuance with he and myself deprive at the same time of the only remain comfort of my day -- you sister leave I soon after you do : -- she go to aix la chapelle since which i have never be able to hear any thing of she -- let I not lose you both if you have any regard for you own interest or the peace of he whom you have ever find a father in he care and affection and whom you will now find so more than you can possibly expect dorilaus impossible be it to conceive without be in the very circumstance horatio be what a strange variety of mingled passion agitate he breast on have to read and consider these letter : -- to find such unhoped condescension from the baron de palfoy and that dorilaus be still live and have the same if not more tender inclination for he than ever the latter of which he have long since cease to hope be sufficient to have overwhelm even the most phlegmatic person with a excess of joy : -- but then the dark expression in both these letter put he brain on the rack -- the baron have seem to refer to a explanation of what he darkly hint at in the letter of dorilaus but that he find rather more obsolete : he could imagine nothing farther than that dorilaus have resolve to make he he heir as he remember some people say before he leave england on the knowledge of that intelligence the baron de palfoy have consent to he marriage with mademoiselle charlotta and this she being permit to write to he confirm -- this indeed be the supreme aim of he desire and this it be that make he quit st germain in hope of raise himself to a condition which might enable she to own she affection to he without a blush : but transport as this idea be it be mingle with disquiet to reflect on the term which both the baron and dorilaus seem to insist on for the accomplishment of he wish tho ' he impatiently long to see dorilaus after so long a absence -- tho ' in the possession of charlotta all he hope be centered yet to leave a prince who have so highly favor he and under whose banner he have gain so much consideration be a piece of ingratitude which it be worse than death for he to be guilty of -- no say he it would be to render I unworthy of all the blessing they make I hope should i purchase they on such condition -- how can they demand they of I -- the baron charlotta and dorilaus have all of they the highest notion of honor generosity and gratitude and can they approve that in I which i be certain they would not be guilty of themselves -- sure it be but to try I they seem to exact what they be sensible i can not yield to without the breach of every thing that can entitle I to esteem or love thus do he argue within himself for one moment the next other reason directly opposite to these present themselves -- dorilaus cry he demand all my obedience -- all my gratitude : -- without protection i have be a outcast in the world -- whatever honor whatever happiness i enjoy be it not to he i owe they can i refuse then to comply with command which he say be necessary to he peace -- besides be it not charlotta that inspire this ardor in I for great action be not the possession of that charming maid the sole end i propose to myself in all i have undertake and shall i by refuse she request madly run the risque of lose she for ever -- do not she wish she father persuade and dorilaus enjoin I to return -- do not love friendship duty call I to partake the joy that each afford -- and shall i refuse the tender invitation -- no the world can not condemn I for follow motive such as these and even the royal charle himself be too generous not to acquit I of ingratitude or cowardice it must indeed be confess he have potent inducement for he return to pari to combat against those of continue in the king of sweden 's service and both by turn appear so prevalent that it be uncertain which would have get the better have not a accident happen which unhappily determine he in favor of the latter colonel poniatosky who have attend stanislaus into poland now the disturbance of that kingdom be quiet on hear the king of sweden be on some new expedition obtain leave of stanislaus to return to the camp and implore he majesty 's permission to be one of those who should partake the glorious toil he be now re-enter into to which he reply that he should be glad to have he near he person but fear he would be want in poland no may it please you majesty resume poniatosky there seem to be no longer any business in that kingdom for a soldier : -- all seem ready to obey the royal stanislaus out of affection to he person and admiration of those virtue they be now perfectly convince of nor be augustus in a condition to violate the treaty of resignation : -- refuse I not therefore i beseech you majesty continue he fall upon both he knee what i look on as my greatest happiness as it be my greatest glory the king seem very well pleased at the emphasis with which he express himself and have raise he from the posture he be in be it so cry he henceforward we will be inseparable horatio be charm with this testimony of love and zeal in a person who have doubtless friend and kindred who would have be glad he have less attachment to a service so full of danger as that of the king of sweden and somewhat ashamed he have ever entertain a thought of quit it resolve as he have be more obliged not to shew less gratitude than poniatosky therefore without any further deliberation retire to he quarter and prepare the follow answer to the letter have be bring he as all thing in a lover 's heart yield to the darling object the first he write be to he mistress _ to mademoiseile _ de palfoy with what transport i receive yours adorable charlotta i be little able to express -- to find i be not forget -- that what i have do be approve by she for whom alone i live and whose praise alone can make I vain so swallow up all other consideration that it have almost make I quit alranstadt that moment and fly to pour beneath you foot my gratitude and joy -- but glory tyrannic glory would not suffer I to obey the soft impulse nor re-enjoy that blessing till conscious i deserve it better -- my friend over-rate my service and tho ' that partial indulgence be the ultimate of my ambition i would dare not abuse what they be so good to offer to feast my long long famished sight with gaze once more on you charm i would forgo every thing but the hope of render myself one day more worthy of it -- too dear i prize the good wish you vouchsafe to have for I not to attempt every thing in my power to prevent the disappointment of they : the little i have yet do alas serve but to prove how much the man who have in view render himself acceptable to the divine charlotta dare to do when danger worthy of he courage present themselves -- a small time may perhaps afford I a opportunity : -- yet do you know how dear this self-denial cost I you would confess it the greatest proof of affection ever man give : -- permit I therefore to gratify a ambition which have no other aim than a justification of the favor i receive : -- continue to look with a favourable eye on my endeavor and they can not then fail of such success as may give I a claim to the glorious title of my most adored and love charlotta 's _ everlasting slave _ horatio to she father he write in the follow manner : _ to the baron _ de palfoy _ my lord _ the favor you goodness confer upon I be such as can be equal by but one thing in the world and that be my just and grateful sense of they -- charming would be the toil of war do all employ in they meet a recompence like mine -- be there a man so mean so poor in spirit that praise such as i receive might not animate to action worthy of they -- what acknowledgment can i make the count suitable to the immense obligation i owe he for inspiring you lordship with sentiment which tho ' the supreme wish of my aspiring soul i never durst allow myself to hope and which afford a prospect of future accumulate blessing such as i could scarce flatter myself with be real be not the transport idea in some measure confirm to I by you have give a sanction to a correspondence i so lately despair of ever obtain -- bless change -- extatic condescension -- fortune have do all she can for I and anticipate all the good that after a long train of service and approve fidelity i scarce should have presume to hope -- oh my lord i have no word to thank you as i ought it be deed alone and render myself worthy of you indulgence that must preserve you good opinion and keep you from repent have overwhelm I with this profusion of happiness -- yet how joyfully could i now pursue the rout to pari and content myself with owe every thing merely to you goodness be i not with-held by all the consideration that ought to have weight with a man of honor -- my royal general be inflexible to the persuasion of almost all the court in christendom and hurry by he thirst of fame or some other more latent motive have give order to prepare for a march where or against whom be yet a secret to the army but by the preparation for it we believe they be not short journey we be to take -- should i now quit a service where i have be promote so much beyond my merit what my lord but cowardice or ingratitude could be imputed to I as the motive -- not all my reason powerful as they be would have any weight with a prince who be deaf to every thing but the call of glory and i must return loaden with he displeasure and the reproach of all i leave behind -- now to return be certain infamy -- to go be in pursuit of honor -- you lordship will not therefore be surprize i make choice of the latter since no hazard can be equal to that of forfeit the little reputation i have acquire and which alone can render I worthy any part of the favor i have receive _ i be _ _ with the extremest respect and submission _ _ you lordship 's eternally devoted servant _

you be live and still remember I with kindness afford too great a transport to suffer I to throw away any thought either on the motive of you long silence or that happiness which you tell I i may expect have be the produce of it : -- it be sufficient for I to know i be still bless in the favor of the most excellent person that ever live and be not in the least anxious for a explanation of any farther good to tell you with how much ardency i long to throw myself at you foot to relate to you all the various accident that have befall I since first you condescend to put I in the path of glory and to pour out my soul before you with thanksgive would be as impossible as it be for I at present to enjoy that blessing -- the king 's affair it be true would suffer nothing by my absence but sir what would the world say of I if after a whole year of inactivity and idleness i fly on the first appearance of danger and forsake a prince by whom i have be so highly favor -- instead of the character i have always be ambitious of attain should i not be brand with everlasting infamy -- put not therefore i beseech you to so severe a test that love and duty to which you can not have a greater claim than i a readiness to pay -- do you command my life it be yours : -- i owe it to you and with it all that can render it agreeable but sir my honor my reputation must survive when i be no more it be the first and will be the last bent of my desire no peril can come in any degree of competition with those of be deprive of that nor any indulgency of fortune compensate for the loss of it : -- pardon then this enforced disobedience and believe it be the only thing in which i could be guilty of it -- i very much lament my sister 's absence as i find by yours she go without you permission : time and reflection will doubtless bring she to a more just sense of what she as well as myself ought to have of you goodness to we and make she return full of sincere contrition for have offend you i should implore you favourable opinion of she action in the mean time be not all the interest i have in you too little to apologize for my own behavior -- all sir i dare to implore be pardon for myself and that you will be assure no son no dependant whatever would more rejoice in a opportunity of testify he duty affection gratitude and submission than he who be now constrain by tie

safety and for that purpose halted for the space of two day then proceed towards grodno with such expedition that after-age will look upon it as incredible that so large a army and also encumber with a great quantity of baggage could have march in the time they do but the king of sweden be on fire to encounter in person the czar of muscovy who with about 2000 man be then in that city : so great be he impatience that he gallop before he troops not above 600 of those best mount be able to keep pace with he till he come in sight of the south gate which give he entrance without any opposition while the czar and he force make they escape out at the north gate not doubt but the king of sweden 's whole army be come up with he he be afterward so much vex and ashamed to think he have quit the town to no more than 600 of the enemy that to retrieve a mistake which he fear might be look upon as cowardice be inform the body of the army be near five league off he send a party of 1500 horse in order to surprize the king and he few guard the muscovite enter by night but the alarm be give the fortune which still have wait on the swedish army immediately put they all to the rout and the army soon after arrive the conqueror lose no time but pursue those that remain alive into the forest of mensky on the other side of which the czar have then entrenched himself and have make the general rendezvous of the russian army which be continually divide into party and sometimes fall on the swede in the rear and sometimes in the flank very much annoy they in they march : these brave man have also other difficulty to encounter with the forest be so extremely thick that the infantry be oblige to fall down tree every moment during the whole time of they passage to make way for the baggage and troops they industry and vigor surmount all these obstacle they once more find themselves in a open country but on the bank of a river on the opposite side of which be 20000 muscovite place to oppose they cross the king make no delay but quit he horse throw himself into the river and be instantly follow by all the foot while the troops under the command of general renchild and hoorn gallop round thro ' the morrass in which that river end and both together charge the enemy who after some faint shew of resistance flee with the utmost precipitation the whole army be now join march on toward the boristhene but with fatigue which be impossible to be describe : horatio keep still close to the king and whether he fight or march be on foot or on horsback be always in he fight ready to bear he command to the general or assist he in the time of danger more than once have the conqueror be indebted to this young warrior for turn the point of the destructive sword from give he the same death he be deal about to other yet in all the danger he have be in never have he receive one wound and this often make the king say who be a firm believer in predestination that heaven design he for a soldier : he fortune he valor he activity add to he oblige and modest behavior indeed render he so dear to he royal master that there be very few if any to whom he give greater mark of he favor and have dorilaus or even charlotta herself all tender as she be and tremble for the hazard she know he have be expose to see he thus caress and honor by the most glorious prince and greatest hero in the world they could scarce have wish he to quit the post he be in much less persuade he to do it he hitherto indeed have experience only the happiness of a martial life for the fatigue hardship and danger of it he as little regard as the intrepid and indefatigable prince he serve but now arrive the time which be to inflict on he the worst misery of it and make he almost curse a vocation he have be in he soul so much attach to the king of sweden with he usual success have pass the boristhene encounter a party of 10000 muscovite and 6000 calmuck tartar but they give way on the first onset and flee into a wood where the king follow the dictate of he great courage more than prudence pursue they fall into a ambuscade which throw themselves between he and three regiment of horse that be with he hem have he in and now begin a very unequal fight -- many of the gallant swede be cut to piece and the muscovite make quite up to he majesty : -- two aid-de-camp be kill within he presence he own horse be shoot under he and as a equerry be present he with another both horse and man be strike dead in the same moment -- horatio immediately alight in order to mount the king who now on foot behave with incredible valor in that action be surround and take prisoner as be several other that have fight near he person he have the satisfaction however while they be disarm and tie he hand to see colonel dardoff with he regiment force thro ' the calmuck and arrive timely enough to disengage the king after which the army recover its rank and pour in upon the enemy he be not without hope of regain he liberty but he be sit upon a horse and bind fast to the saddle and compel with the other that be take with he to accompany the muscovite in they flight so be ignorant in what manner this re-encounter end soon after repair to the czar 's quarter these unfortunate officer of the king of sweden be with some other who have before become they prize send under a strong guard to petersburgh and throw altogether into a miserable dungeon it would be impossible to describe the horror of this place : -- light there be but it be only so much as just serve to shew to each of these unhappy sufferer the common calamity of they all -- the roof be arched indeed but so low that the shortest among they could scarce stand upright : -- no kind of furniture not even straw to cover the damp earthen floor which serve they for a seat by day and bed at night inure as they have be to hardship the noisomeness of this dreadful vault kill many of they and among the rest a young swedish officer name gullinstern one with whom horatio have contract a very intimate friendship and who for he many excellent quality have be so dear to the king that see he one day greatly wound and in danger of be taker prisoner that generous prince oblige he to mount on he own horse and fight on foot himself till another could be bring the light of this gentleman expire in he arm fill horatio with so poignant a anguish that he want but little of follow he and indeed have it not be for the sanguine hope that the king would in a short time complete the ruin of the czar and not only restore they liberty but also add vengeance to it for the ill treatment they have find in he dominion few if any of they have be able to support the misery inflict on they by these inhuman wretch who not content with bury they in a manner alive for the dungeon they be in be deep underground and allow they no other food than bread and water once in four and twenty hour make savage sport at they condition ridicule the conquest of they king and speak in the most opprobrious term of he royal person which when some of they be unable to restrain themselves from answer in a manner befitting they duty and love of justice they be silence by the most cruel stripe thus be the officer of the king of sweden the meanest of whom be fit to be general in any other army subject to the servile taunt and insolent behavior of wretch undeserve to be rank among the human species a very little time have doubtless make they all find grave among these barbarian scarce a day pass over without they company decrease by two or three who be no sooner dead than drag out by the heel and throw like dog into a pit without the least funeral rite but providence at length think fit to send they a relief by means they least expect in one of the incursion make by the muscovite into poland a very beautiful lady whose father have be kill in assert the cause of stanislaus be make prisoner : prince menzikoff who command these batallion see she and become enamoured of she charm : she be destitute of all friend and in the conqueror 's power so think it best to yield what otherwise she find he determine to seize : in fine she be he mistress and she ready compliance with he desire together with the love she either have or feign to have for he afterward gain she a absolute ascendant over he every one know the interest he have with the czar and he so far exert it as to get this fair favorite lodge in the palace where she be serve with the same state and respect as if she have be he wife this lady whose name be edella happen to be walk with some of she attendant near where these unfortunate gentleman be bury at a time when three of they be drag to they wretched sepulchre be touch with compassion to see any thing that have a human shape thus coarsely treat tho ' after death and have the curiosity to order one of she people to enquire who those person be and what they have do which hinder they from be allow a christian burial she be no sooner inform that they be swedish prisoner than she soul shudder at the thought of the russian barbarity and not doubt but they usage during life have be of a piece with that after they death she resolve if possible to procure some abatement of the misery of those who yet survive to this end she make it she business to examine what number of prisoner have be bring of what condition they be and where lodge and be well acquaint with all she want to know go to the governor of petersburg and so well represent how dishonourable it be to the czar and how opposite to the law of nation to treat prisoner of war in a worse manner than they would do condemn felon that he know the power of prince menzikoff and fear to disoblige one so dear to he by a refusal consent they should be remove into a upper part of the prison where they would have more air and also that they should have a allowance of meat every day as the governor be a true muscovite in he nature and have a implacable hatred to the king of sweden and all that belong to he this be gain a great deal but it be not enough to satisfy the charitable disposition of edellum after they removal she go in person to visit those of they whom she hear be gentleman and find they cover only with rag which some of the soldier have put on they after have strip they of they own rich habit she order other line with fur to be make for they to defend they from the coldness of the season and not content to retrench a great part of she own table sell several fine jewel and other trinket the prince have bestow on she to supply they with wine and whatever necessaries she suppose they to be accustom to that she might be certain those entrust by she do not abuse she good intention she go often to the prison herself to see how they be serve and would sometimes enter into discourse with they concern the battle they have be in the settlement of stanislaus and many other thing relate to the polish affair the gallant and courtly manner in which horatio express himself on every occasion make she take a particular pleasure in hear he speak : that rough blunt behavior to which she have be accustom since she be bring a captive into muscovy give double charm to the politeness with which she find herself entertain by we young warrior he bloom year and the gracefulness of he person contribute not a little also towards render every thing he say more agreeable she liking of he grow by degree into a friendship no less tender than that one feel for very near relation and who have never do any thing to disoblige we be more endear by be under undeserved calamity : but as the inclination she have for he be perfectly innocent and no way prejudicial to the prince who be in possession of she person she make no secret of it either to himself or those she converse with and be always talk of the wit delicacy and handsomeness of one of those prisoner whom it be well know be pensioner to she bounty but how dangerous be it to be too open before person who void of all true generosity or the lead principle of honor themselves never fail to put the worst construction on the action of other edellum be very near be undo by she sincerity in acknowledge the distinction she pay to merit or the compassion she feel for misfortune in a country where humanity to enemy be look upon as a crime friendship to those of the same party altogether unknown and even common civility never practice but for the gratification of self-interest or some favorite passion this beautiful polander however be treat by the muscovite on account of the influence she have over the prince menzikoff with as much complaisance as it be in they power to shew imagine they disposition less savage than it be in reality and when she testify the pity she have for those unhappy gentleman it be with design to excite it in other and engage they to join with she in petition the czar at he return for they enlargement there be no cartel or exchange of prisoner subsist between he and the king of sweden among the number she hope to gain to she party be mattakesa the relique of a general who have be in great favor with he prince this lady who could speak french have learn it of a recusant that take shelter in russium consent to go with she one day to the prison and no sooner see horatio than unfortunately for he edella and herself she become charm with he : as she be of the number of those who think nothing a crime that suit they own inclination she take not the least pain to subdue the grow passion but rather indulge it in order to receive the highest degree of pleasure in the gratification she doubt not but edellum be she rival and that it be for he sake alone she have be so beneficent to he fellow-sufferer : to supplant she therefore be the first step she have to take and she resolve to omit nothing for that purpose chap xx _ the treachery of a russian lady to she friend : she passion for horatio : the method he take to avoid make any return and some other entertaining occurrence _ it be easy to believe that horatio tho ' relieve from that extremity of misery he suffer while in the dungeon be far from be able to content himself with he present condition : -- a thousand time he reproach himself for pursue the dictate of a glory which now seem so tyrannic : -- have i cry he hazard the eternal displeasure of the best of man -- refuse the invitation of the adorable charlotta -- slight the condescention of she father -- be deaf both to interest and love to become a prisoner to the worst of barbarian -- who now will pity I -- or if they yet would be so good how shall i acquaint they with my wretched fate -- nay be there even a possibility of that what would the compassion of the whole world avail since a slave to those who contrary to the law of nation and even common humanity refuse on any term to release the wretch fall into they savage power in this manner do he bewail himself night and day and indeed have but too just reason for do so : -- he have hear that the last time the czar have be at petersburg he have send all the prisoner he have then take to siberium and other province of the greater tartary where they be compel without any distinction to do the work of horse rather than man and doubt not but at he next return all those now in he power would meet the same fate tho ' the generous king of sweden have send back the muscovite he have take by 1500 and 2000 at a time -- this however may be say in favor of the czar that by the many attempt he make to civilize he barbarous subject it must be suppose he would have be glad to have imitate this generosity have it be confident with he safety but the case have this difference charle xii fear not the number of the muscovite but the czar fear the courage of the swede what also increase the affliction of these gentleman be that be debar from all intelligence they could hear nothing of they king whom each of they love with a kind of filial affection and duty -- horatio and two other have be witness of the extreme danger in which they leave he and tho ' at the time they be seize he have kill thirteen or fourteen muscovite with he own hand and they perceive general dardoff have come up to he relief yet they could not be certain of he safety till at length the sweet-conditioned edellum perceive the despair they be in on this account inform they that he majesty be not only well but as successful as ever that he have pass far into ukranium have defeat the muscovite in five battle and so far reduce the czar that he have condescend to make some overture of peace which have be reject it be the common opinion that in a very short time the swede would enter moscow and become arbiter of russium as they have be of poland adequate to they late grief be they satisfaction at this joyful news : -- horatio be transport above he companion and throw himself at the foot of the fair intelligencer but she desire they would all of they moderate they contentment so far as to hinder the guard who have the care of they from perceive it because say she it might not only draw on yourselve worse treatment but also render I suspect of be against the interest of a court on which my fate have reduce I to become a dependant horatio as well as the other assure she he would take care to manage the felicity she have bestow upon they so as not to be any way prejudicial to she and she take she leave promise to be with they again in a few day and bring they farther information a courier from the camp she say be expect every hour but while this compassionate lady be please herself by give all the ease in she power to the distressed the cruel mattakesa be plot she destruction -- she have several of she kindred and a great many acquaintance in the army who be in considerable post to all of whom she exclaim against the loose behavior as she term it of edelium and represent she charity to the prisoner as the effect of a wanton inclination : -- this she doubt not but would come to prince menzikoff 's ear and perhaps incense he enough to cause she to be privately make away with for as she imagine nothing less than the most amorous intercourse between she and horatio she think it unadvisable to declare the passion she have for he till a rival so formidable by the advantage she have over she in youth and beauty should be remove this base woman therefore impatiently wait the arrival of the next courier to find how far she stratagem have succeed and the moment she hear he have deliver he dispatch fly to the apartment of edellum in hope of be inform of what she so much desire to know she be not altogether deceive in she expectation : she find that lady drown in tear with a letter lie open before she and on she enquire with a shew of the utmost concern the motive of she grief the other who look on she as she real friend reply alas mattakesa i have cruel enemy i can not guess for what cause for willingly i never give offence to any one -- but see continue she how barbarously they have abuse my innocence and represent action which heaven know be influence only by charity and compassion as the worst of crime with these word she give she the letter which she have just receive from the prince mattakesa take it with a greedy pleasure and find it contain these line : _ to _ edellum madam i leave you in a place furnish as i think with every thing necessary for you satisfaction but i find i be mistake in you constitution and that there be something want which rather than not possess you must have recourse to a prison to procure : -- ungrateful as you be to the affection i have treat you with i be sorry for you ill conduct and could with you have be at least more private in you amours : few man but would have send a order for remove you and the person for whose sake you have make these false step into a place where you would have cause to curse the fatal inclination that seduce you : think therefore how much you owe a prince who instead of punish you fault contents himself with let you know he be not ignorant of they -- if you make a right use of the lenity i shew on this occasion you may perhaps retrieve some part of the influence you once have over I but see the swedish prisoner no more if you hope or desire ever to see menzikoff mattakesa affect the greatest astonishment on have read this letter and after have curse the person that put such vile suspicion into the prince 's head ask she what she intend to do what can i do answer the sorrowful edellum but write to my lord all the assurance that word can give he which heaven know i can truly do that i never wrong he even in wish or thought and that since there be people so cruel to misinterpret to my dishonor what be nothing but mere charity to obey he command with the utmost punctuality and never set my foot into that prison more she false friend could not but applaud she resolution yet tell she it be pity that ill tongue should deprive those unfortunate gentleman of the relief she have hitherto afford they or herself of the pleasure she take in they conversation as for the first say edellum heaven may perhaps raise the mother friend more capable of lift they and as to the other be it infinitely greater it would be my inclination as it be my duty to sacrifice every thing to the will of a prince whom i love and to whom i be so much obliged mattakesa have thus compare she design so far as to be under no apprehension of be interrupt by she imagine rival tho ' she have rather she have be poison or strangle go directly to the prison and tell the gentleman it be with the utmost concern she must acquaint they that edellum would never visit they any more nor continue the weekly pension she have hitherto allow they those among they who understand she and the other to whom horatio interpret what she say look one upon another with a great deal of consternation as imagine one of they have do something to offend she and thereby the rest be think unworthy of she favor -- everyone endeavor to clear himself of what he easily see he companion suspect he guilty of till mattakesa with a scornful smile tell they that it be not owe to the behavior of any of they but to edellum 's own inconstant disposition that they owe the withdraw of she bounty but to console they for the loss of it she promise to speak to some of she friend in they behalf and also to contribute something herself towards alleviate they misfortune but add she i be not the mistress of a prince and first favorite so have it not in my power to act as the generosity of my nature incline I to do she stay with they a considerable time and entertain they with little else than railing on edellum and to make she appear as odious and contemptible as she could to horatio insinuate that it be for the sake of a young needy favorite she have be oblige to withdraw the allowance they have from she on take leave she find mean to slip a little billet into horatio 's hand unperceived by any of the company which as soon as he have a convenient opportunity he open and find these word in french : _ to the agreeable _ horatio sir tho ' i have not perhaps so much beauty as edellum i have twice she sincerity and not many year older : such as i be however i fancy you will think a correspondence with I of too much advantage to be refuse : -- if you will counterfeit a indisposition to-morrow i will out of excessive charity visit you and bring you a refreshment i flatter myself will not be disagreeable to a man in you circumstance : -- farewell -- be secret -- and love as well as you can _ yours _ mattakesa of all the accident that have befall horatio since he leave england none ever so much surprize he as the prodigious impudence of this lady : he have hear talk of such adventure but never till now believe there could be any such thing in nature as a woman that offer herself in this manner without the least sollicitation from the person on whom she wish to lavish what ought only to be the reward of a approve or at least a shew of the most violent passion the dilemma he be in how to behave be also equal to he astonishment : -- have she be the most lovely of she sex as she be very much the reverse the ever present idea of he dear charlotta would have defend he heart from the invasion of any other charm but he need not that pre-engagement to make he look with detestation on a woman of mattakesa 's principle : -- when he reflect on what she have say concern edellum he find she base censorious and unjust : -- and when he consider the manner in which she proceed in regard to himself he see a lewdness and audacity which render she doubly odious to he : -- he doubt not but she be wicked and subtle enough to contrive some means of reveng herself in case she meet with a disappointment in she wish yet have too great a abhorrence to be able to entertain one thought of gratify they as he be young and unexperienced in the world he would have be glad of some advice how to act so as not to incur she resentment yet avoid she love but the strict notion he have of honor remonstrate to he that he ought not to betray a secret of that nature tho ' confide in he by a ill woman -- she baseness cry he to himself would be no excuse for mine and it be better for I to risque whatever she malice may inflict than forfeit my character by expose a woman who pretend to love I these thought keep he wake the whole night and he restlessness be observe by a old swedish officer who by with he he be very much importune by he to discover to he the occasion -- horatio defend himself for a good while by the consideration before recite but at length reflect that the person who be so desirous of be let into the secret have a great deal of discretion he at length suffer himself to be prevail upon and tell he what mattakesa have write to he for he do not understand a word of french so could not read the letter this officer no sooner hear the story than he laugh heartily at the scruple of horatio in think himself bind to conceal a affair of this nature with a woman of the character mattakesa must need be : -- he also rally he delicacy as he term it in hesitate one moment whether he should gratify the lady 's inclination -- one would imagine say he that so long a fall from love as we have have should render we appetite more keen : -- what tho ' mattakesa be neither handsome nor very young she be a woman and amorous and methink there should need no other excitement to a young man like you horatio tho ' naturally gay be not at present in a disposition to continue this raillery and tell he friend he look on this inclination of mattakesa to be as great a misfortune as could happen to they for say he as it be wholly out of my power to make she any return that violence of temper which have transport she to forget the modesty of she sex will probably when she find herself reject make she as easily throw off all the softness of it and you may all feel the effect of that revenge she will endeavor to take on I the other be entirely of he opinion and they both agree that some way ought to think on to avert the storm she resentment might in all probability occasion after many fruitless invention they at last hit upon one which have a prospect of success : they have in they company a gentleman call mullern nephew to chancellor mullern who have attend the king in all he war : he be handsome well make and he age tho ' much superior to that of horatio yet be not so far advance as to render he disagreeable to the fair sex : he be of a more than ordinary sanguine disposition and have often say of all the hardship they captivity have inflict on they he feel none so severely as be deprive of a free conversation with woman -- in the ravages the king of sweden 's arm have make in lithuanium saxony and poland he be sure to secure to himself three or four of the finest woman and tho ' he have be often check by he uncle and even by the king himself for give too great a loose to he amorous inclination yet all they admonition be too weak to restrain the impetuosity of he desire this way to he therefore they resolve to communicate the affair and as he be in other respects the most proper object among they to succeed in supplant horatio so he be also by be perfectly well verse in the french language which the rest be ignorant of accordingly they tell he what have happen shew he the letter and how willing horatio would be to transfer all the interest he have in this lady to he if he could by any means ingratiate himself into she favor mullern be transport at the idea and the stratagem contrived among they for this purpose be execute in the follow manner : mattakesa be punctual to the promise she have make in she letter and when she come into the room where she usually find the gentleman altogether it be that where they dine and see not horatio she doubt not but he have observe she direction and pretend himself indispose so ask for he expect to be tell that he be ill but when they answer that he be go with one of the keeper to the top of the round tower in order to satisfy he curiosity in take a view of the town she be confound beyond expression and could not imagine what have occasion he to slight a assignation she have flatter herself he would receive with extacy as she be in a little resvery endeavor to comprehend if possible the motive of so manifest a neglect mullern draw near to she and begin to speak of the beauty of that fine city which the czar have erect in the midst of war he tell she that have a little skill in draw he have venture to make a little sketch of it in chalk on the wall of the room where he lay and entreat she in the most gallant manner to look upon it and give he she opinion how far he have do justice to a edifice so much admire it can not be suppose that mattakesa have in she soul any curiosity to see a work of this nature yet to hide as much as she could the disorder she be in at she disappointment give he she hand in order to be conclude to the place where he pretend to have be exercise he genius as soon as they be enter he throw the door as if by incident which have a spring lock immediately be make fast -- she either do not or seem not to regard what he have do but cast she eye round the room and see nothing of what he have mention -- where be this draw cry she in my heart adorable mattakesa answer he fall at she foot at the same time : -- it be not the city of petersburg but the charming image of its brightest ornament that the god of love have engraven on my heart in character too indelible ever to be erase : -- from the first moment i beheld those eye my soul have be on fire and i must have consume with inward burning have i not reveal my flame : -- pardon continue he the boldness of a passion which know no bound and tho ' i may not be so worthy of you love as the too happy horatio i be certainly not less deserving of you pity surprize and perhaps a mixture of secret satisfaction prevent she from interrupt he during the first part of he discourse but rage at the mention of horatio force from she this exclamation : -- have the villain then betray I cry she -- no madam reply he justice oblige I to acquit he tho ' my rival -- he have the misfortune in put you billet into he pocket to let it fall i take it up unseen by he -- open it read it and must confess that all my generosity to my friend be wholly swallow up in my passion for you -- i return not to he that kind declaration you be please to make he and he be ignorant of the blessing you intend for he : -- if the crime i have be guilty of seem unpardonable in you eye command my death i will instantly obey you for life would be a torment under you displeasure and if in my last moment you vouchsafe some part of that softness to the occasion of my fate that you so lavishly bestow on the fortunate horatio i will bless the lovely mouth that doom I to destruction he pronounce all this with a emphasis which make she not doubt the power of she charm and survey he while he be speak find enough in he person to compensate for the disappointment she have meet with from horatio : besides she reflect that if what he have tell she concern the drop she letter be a fiction it be however a ingenious one and shew he wit as well as love in bring both himself and friend off in so handsome a manner she be infatuate with the praise he give she -- the pathetic expression he make use of assure she of the ardency of he desire and as she could not be certain of be able to inspire horatio with the same she wisely choose to accept the present offer rather than wait for what might perhaps at last deceive she expectation she make however no immediate answer but she eye tell he she be far from be displeased with what he have say and give he courage to take up one of she hand and kiss it with a eagerness which confirm he protestation at last -- well mullern say she look languishingly on he since chance have make you acquaint with my foible i think i must bribe you to secrecy by forgive the liberty you take with I : -- and if i be convince you really love I as well as you pretend might indulge you yet farther -- a unaccountable caprice indeed sway I in favor of horatio but i be now half inclinable to believe you be more deserving my regard -- but rise continue she i will hear nothing from you while in that posture mullern who be no less bold in love than war immediately obey she and testify he gratitude for she condescention by give a sudden spring and snatch she to he breast press she in so arduous a manner that she would have be incapable of resist even tho ' she have a inclination to do so : but she no less transport than himself return endearment for endearment and not only permit but assist all he rapture -- absolutely forget horatio as well as all sense of she own shame and yield he a full enjoyment without even a affectation of repugnance both party in fine be perfectly satisfy with each other and have mutually swear a thousand oath of fidelity which neither of they it be probable have any intention to keep mullern take upon himself the care of continue to entertain she in private as often as she come to the prison and in return she make he a present of a purse of gold after which they pass into the outer room to prevent censure on they stay too long together on they return they find horatio with the other gentleman abandon as mattakesa be she could not keep herself from blush a little at sight of he but soon recover herself by the help of she natural audacity -- well horatio say she what do you think of the little french epigram i put into you hand yesterday -- have it not a very agreeable point horatio have such a aversion to all kind of deceit that even here where it be so necessary he could not without some hesitation answer to what she say in these word -- some accident or other cry he deprive I of the pleasure you be so good to intend I for when i put my hand in my pocket think to read it i perceive i be so unhappy as to have lose it : -- i look for it in vain : -- it be irrecoverably go and i be a utter stranger to the contents and ever shall be so reply she tartly only to punish you carelessness of a lady 's favor know that it be a piece of wit which would have be highly agreeable to you : -- but do not expect i shall take the pain to write it over again or even tell you the subject on which it turn horatio cooly say he could not but confess he have be to blame and must therefore allow the justice of she proceeding as none present besides himself he bedfellow and mullern know the truth of this affair what pass between they be take by the other as literally speak and little suspect to couch the mystery it really do mullern after this by the assistance of horatio and the old officer have frequent opportunity of gratify he own and the amorous mattakesa 's desire -- the testimony she give he how well she be please with he conversation be for the common good of he companion -- horatio be easy in find himself out of all danger of any solicitation he be determine never to acquiesce in and those three who be in the secret pass they time pleasantly enough whenever they have a opportunity of talk on this adventure without any of the other be witness of what they say chap xxi _ the prisoner expectation raise : a terrible disappointment : some of the chief carry to prince menzikoff 's palace : they usage there horatio set at liberty and the occasion _ we captive have soon after a new matter of rejoice : a polander in the service of muscovy who have be take prisoner by the swede and be discharge and send home with a great number of other by the unparallell would generosity of charle xii be one of the guard who now do duty in the prison it be often he turn to bring they they poor allowance of provision and have some pity for they condition as well as gratitude for a people who have use he and he companion in a different manner tell they that they might be of good heart for say he you will soon be set at liberty : -- we emperor have enough to do to keep he ground in ukraina : charle be as victorious as ever : -- the prince of the cosaque one of the bravest man on earth next to himself have enter into a alliance with he : -- king stanislaus be send he succor from poland : -- a powerful reinforcement be come to he from lithuanium and when these army be join as i believe they already be nothing can withstand they : -- you will hear the swedish march beat from this prison wall -- and perhaps see you present conqueror change place with you and to confirm the truth of what i say continue he i can further assure you that the czar before i leave the camp be in the utmost confusion : -- he council as well as army be at a stand and he have twice make overture of peace and be refuse this be a intelligence which might well be transport to the king of sweden 's officer : -- the thought of see he enter petersburgh a conqueror -- of once more embrace they old friend and companion and of triumph over those who have so cruelly abuse the power the chance of war have put into they hand make they all in they turn hug and bless the kind informer : -- they also ask he several question concern the general and each be more particular concern those they have the greatest interest in receive from this honest soldier all the satisfaction they could desire as courier be continually arrive from the army there pass few day without hear some farther confirmation of they most sanguine expectation but at length the guard be again change they lose all further intelligence and be for several month without be able to hear any thing of what pass they doubt not however but as thing be in so good a disposition every day bring they nearer to the completion of they wish and it be this pleasing prospect which address they misfortune and enable they to sustain cheerfully those hardship which almost ever since the withdraw of edellum 's bounty they have labor under -- mattakesa in the beginning of she amours with mullern have indeed make he some present which he share with he companion but either the natural inconstancy of she temper make she grow weary of this intrigue for the sake of another or she circumstance not allow she to continue such donation she soon grow sparing of they and at length totally desist she visit at the prison as ever since the compassionate edellum have procure they to be remove from the dungeon they have enjoy the privilege of walk on the lead and go up to the round tower which be of a very great height not only overlook the town but the country round for a considerable distance they frequently make use of this indulgence at first for no other purpose than to have the benefit of the open air but now in hope of see they beloved prince at the head of a victorious army approach to give they liberty and relief -- but alas how terrible a reverse of they high-raised expectation have inconstant fortune in store for they -- one day as they be sit together discourse on the usual topic with which they entertain each other and endeavor to beguile the tedious time they hear a confused noise as of some sudden tumult -- tho ' they have now be above a year in russium none of they could speak the language well enough to be understand so could receive no information from the guard even should they have prove good-natured enough to be willing to satisfy they curiosity so they all run hastily up to the round tower whence they easily perceive the town in great confusion and the people run in such crowd that in the hurry many be trample to death in endeavor to pass the gate : -- at a distance they perceive standard wave in the air but could not yet distinguish what arm they bear -- a certain shiver and palpitation the natural consequence of suspence run thro ' all they nerve divide as they be at this sight between hope and fear but when it draw more near -- when instead of swedish color they behold those of russium -- when in the place where they expect to see they gallant king come to restore they once more to freedom they see the implacable czar enter in triumph follow by those hero the least of whom have lately make he tremble now in chain and expose to the ribald mirth and derision of the gaping crowd they lose at once they fortitude and even all sense of express they grief at this misfortune : -- the shock of it be so violent it even take away the power of feel it and they remain for some moment rather like statue carv would out by mortal art than real man create by god and animated with live soul a general groan be the first mark they give of any sensibility of this dreadful stroke of fate but when recruit spirit once more give utterance to word how terrible be they exclamation some of they in the extravagance of despair say thing relate to fate and destiny which on a less occasion could have little merited forgiveness unable either to remove from the place or view distinctly what they eye be fix upon they stay till the whole cavalcade be pass then go down and throw themselves upon the floor where they ear be deafen would by the noise of gun loud huzza 's and other testimony of popular rejoicing both within and without the prison wall -- what have we now to expect cry one -- endless slavery : -- chain infamy last as we life reply another then let we dye add a third right say he companion feircely -- the glory of sweden be lose -- let we disappoint these barbarian these russian monster of the pleasure of insulting we on we country 's fall in this romantic and distract manner do they in vain endeavor to discharge they breast of the load of anguish each sustain -- they misfortune be not of a nature to be alleviate by word -- it be too mighty for expression and the more they speak the more they have yet to say -- for three whole day they refuse the wretched sustenance bring to they neither do the least slumber ever close they eyelid by night : on the fourth the keeper of the prison come and tell they they must depart -- they endeavor not to inform themselves how or where they be to be dispose of in they present condition all place be alike to they so follow he without speak down stair at the bottom of which they find a strong guard of thirty soldier who have chained they in a link like slave go to be sell at the market conduct they to a very stately palace adjoining to that belong to the czar they be but eight in number out of fifty-five who have be take prisoner at the time horatio be and be throw altogether in the dungeon the other have perish thro ' cold and the noysomeness of the place before edellum have procure they a more easy situation but these eight that survive be all officer and most of they man of distinguished birth as well as valor tho ' they long imprisonment scanty food and more than all the grief they at present labor under make they look rather like ghost than man choose out of thousand to fight always near the king of sweden 's person in every hazardous attempt they be place in a stately gallery and there leave while the officer who command the party that come with they go into a inner room but soon after return and another person with he on which the first of this unhappy string be loose from he companion and a signal make to he to enter a door which be open for he and immediately close again for about half a hour there be a profound silence : we prisoner keep it thro ' astonishment and the other it be to be suppose have order for do so -- at the end of that time the door be again open and the chain which fasten the second swede to the other be untied and he in like manner as the former bid to go in -- in some time after the same ceremony be observe to a third -- then to a fourth fifth sixth and seventh : -- horatio chance to be the last who tho ' alarm to a very great degree at the thought of what fate might have be inflict on he companion go fearless in more curious to know the meaning of this mysterious proceeding than anxious for what might befal he he have no sooner pass the door than he find himself in a spacious chamber richly adorn at the upper end of which sit a man lean he head upon he arm in a thoughtful posture -- horatio immediately know he to be prince menzikoff whom he have see during a short truce between the czar and king charle of sweden when both they army be in lithuanium there be no other person present than one who have the aspect of a jew and as it prove be so that stand near the prince 's chair and a soldier who keep the door horatio be bid to approach and when he do so -- you be call hither say the jew in the swedish language to answer to such question as shall be ask you concern a conspiracy carry on between you and you fellow-prisoner with the enemy of russium horatio understand the language perfectly well have converse so long with swede but never could attain to a perfect pronounciation of it so reply in french that he know the prince could speak french and he would therefore answer to any interrogatory he highness should be please to make without the help of a interpreter be you not then a swede say the prince horatio then tell he that he be not but come from france into the service of the king of sweden merely thro ' he love of arm on these word menzikoff dismiss the jew and look earnestly on he wan and pale as he be grow thro ' he long confinement and the many hardship he have sustain this prince find something in he that attract he admiration -- methink say he since glory be you aim you might as well have hope to acquire it under the banner of we invincible emperor alas my lord reply horatio with a sigh that title till very lately be give to the king of sweden and i believe whatever fate have attend that truly great prince those who have the honor to be distinguish by he will never be suspect either of cowardice or baseness -- it be by brave and open mean we king teach he soldier the way to victory not by mean subterfuge and little plot : -- i can not therefore conceive for what reason i be bring hither to be examine on any score that have the appearance of a conspiracy yes reply the prince feircely you and you fellow-prisoner have endeavor to insinuate yourselve into the favor of person whom you imagine entrust with the secret of the government : -- be prisoner of war you form contrivance for you escape and attempt to inveigle other to accompany you flight that every tittle of this accusation be false my lord cry horatio there need no more than the improbability of it to prove -- indeed the cruel usage we sustain might have justify a attempt to free ourselves yet do such a design never enter we head : -- we be so far from make use of any stratagem for that purpose that we never make the least overture to any of the guard who be the only person we be allow to converse with how say the prince interrupt he be not you privilege enlarged by the interposition of a lady -- do she not make you considerable allowance out of she own purse and frequently visit you to receive you thanks -- and be you not embolden by these favor to urge she to reveal what secret be in she knowledge and even to assist you in you escape -- you doubtless imagine you could prevail on she also to go with you : -- part of this continue he she have herself confess : -- it will therefore be in vain for you to deny it : -- if you ingenuously reveal these particulars she have omit you may hope to find favor but it you obstinately persist as you companion have do in attempt to impose upon I you must expect to share the same fate immediately in speak these word he make a sign to the soldier who throw open a large folding door discover a rack on which one of the swedish officer be tie and the other stand near bind and in the hand of the executioner this sight so amaze horatio that he have not the power of speak one word -- till mullern who happen to be the person that be fasten upon the rack cry out to he -- be not lose in consideration horatio say he be we not in the hand of muscovite from whom nothing that be human can be expect -- rather prepare yourself to disappoint they cruelty by bravely suffer all they dare inflict hold then say horatio even muscovite would chuse to have some pretence for what they do and sure the first favorite and generalissimo of a prince who boast a inclination to civilize he barbarous subject will not without any cause torture they whom chance alone have put into he power and who have never do he any personal injury -- by heaven pursue he turn to the prince we all be innocent of any part of those crime lay to we charge : -- time perhaps if we declaration be ineffectual will convince you highness we be so and you will then regret the injustice you have do we you all be in one story cry the prince but i be well assure of the main point : -- the particulars be all i want to be inform of : -- but since i be compel to speak more plain which of you be it for whose sake you all receive such instance of edellum 's bounty -- whoever tell I that even tho ' it be the person himself shall have both pardon and liberty impossible it be to express the astonishment every one be in at this demand : five of they have not the least notion what it mean but mullern horatio and that friend to whom he have shew the letter of mattakesa have some conjecture of the truth and presently imagine that lady have be the incendiary to kindle the flame of jealousy in the prince 's breast the affair however be of so nice a nature that they know not how to vindicate edellum without make she seem more guilty so contented themselves with join with the other in protest they know of no one among they who could boast of receive any greater favor from she than he fellow but that what she do be instigate merely by compassion since she have never see or know who any of they be till after she have move the governor in they behalf : -- they acknowledge she have be so good as to come sometimes to the prison in order to see if those she entrust with she bounty have be faithful in the delivery of it but that she never make the least difference between they and never have conversation with any one of they that be not in the presence of they all mullern could not forbear add to this that he doubt not but the person who have incense he highness into groundless surmise be also the same who have hinder she by some false insinuation or other from continue the allowance she charity allow they and for the want of which they have since be near perish prince menzikoff listen attentively to what each say and with no less earnestness fix he eye on the face of every one as they speak -- find they have do he be about give some order on they account when the keeper of the prison come hastily into the room and have entreat pardon for the interruption present a letter to the prince direct for brigadier mullern and bring he say just after the prisoner be carry out menzikoff commend he zeal in receive and bring it to he as it might possibly serve to give some light to the affair he be examine have peruse it he demand which of they be name mullern i be reply the brave swede and neither fear nor be ashamed of any thing under that name hear then what be write to you by a lady resume the prince with a countenance more serene than he have worn since they be bring before he and presently read with a very audible voice these word : that you have be so long without see I my dear mullern or hearing from I be not owe to any decrease in my affection but to the necessity of my affair : -- if you have any regard for I remain i conjure you if ever you be ask any question concern the frequent visit i have make you to say i be send by edellum and that i be no more than she emissary in the assistance you receive from I : -- add also that you have reason to believe she charity be excite by she liking one of you company : -- mention who you think fit but i believe horatio as the youngest and most handsome will be the most likely to gain credit to what you say -- depend upon it that if you execute this commission artfully i will recompence it by procure you liberty : -- nor need you have any scruple concern it for no person will be prejudice by it and the reputation preserve of _ yours _ mattakesa i suppose say the prince as soon as he have do reading turn to horatio you be the person mention in the letter tho ' i neither desire nor deserve the epithet give I there my lord reply he yet i will not deny but i be call horatio well resume the prince with a half smile i be so well pleased with the conviction this letter have give I that i shall retain no resentment against the malicious author of it he then order mullern to be take from the rack which have never be strain nor have he any intention as he now assure he to put he to the torture but only to intimidate he be resolve to make use of every method he could think of for the full discovery of every thing relate to the behavior of he beloved edellum -- the other gentleman have also they fetter take off and the prince ask pardon of they severally for the injury he have do they then make they sit down and partake of a handsome collation at that table before which they have so lately stand as delinquent at a bar the russian be excessive in they carous and prince menzikoff be now in a admirable good humor make they drink very freely : -- to be the more oblige to he guest he begin the king of sweden 's health in a bumper of brandy protest at the same time that tho ' a enemy to he master he love and venerate the hero : horatio on this venture to enquire in what condition he majesty be to which the prince reply that be greatly wound he be oblige to leave the field and it be believe have take the load toward the dominion of the grand signior some of the russian troops have pursue he as far as the borysthene where by the incredible valor of a few that attend he they have be beat back the swedish officer know it must be bad indeed when they king be compel to fly and this renew in they a melancholy which it be not in the power of liquor or the present civility of the prince to dissipate : they also learn that the general renchild slipenbock hamilton hoorn leuenhaup and stackelburg with the prince of wirtemburg count piper and the flower of the whole army be prisoner at muscow the misfortune of these great man would have be very afflict to those who hear it could any thing have give addition to what they know before -- prince menzikoff be sensible of what they feel and to alleviate they grief assure they that he would take upon he to give they all they liberty without even exact a promise from they never more to draw they sword against the czar in case the king of sweden should ever be able to take the field again so generous a proceed both merit and receive they utmost acknowledgment : but he put a end to the serious demonstration they be about to make he of they gratitude by say -- i pay you no more than i owe you : -- i have wrong you : -- this be but part of the retaliation i ought to make : -- besides add he laugh mattakesa promise mullern he freedom and as she have do I the good office tho ' undesignedly of reveal to I she own treachery i can do no less than assist she in fulfil she covenant to prove how much he be in earnest he call he secretary and order he to make out they passport with all expedition that they might be ready to depart next morning after which he make they repose themselves in he palace the remainder of the night which be in a manner vastly different from what they have be accustom to of a long time indeed ever since they quit alranstadt they do not fail to do notwithstanding the discontent of they mind prince menzikoff be now convinced of the fidelity of edellum pass into she apartment where the reconciliation between they take up so much time that it be near noon next day before he appear : he new guest have not quit they chamber much sooner but after reproach themselves for have be so tardy go altogether to take leave of the prince and accept the passport he have be so good to order as they be get ready he give they immediately into they hand and tell they they be at liberty to quit petersburg that moment if they please or if they have any curiosity to take a view of that city they might gratify it and begin they journey next morning as it be now so late in the day they accept he highness 's offer and walk out to see a place which have excite so much admiration in the world since from a wild waste in ten year time a spacious and most beautiful city have arise in the midst of war and prove the genius of the founder greater in civil than in military art tho ' it must be own he be indefatigable in the study of both the officer of the king of sweden be entertain with the same

always ambitious of acquire the affection of those she convert with she have the secret to ingratiate herself not only to the youngest nun but also to the elder and most austere that the one be never pleased but when in she company and the other propose she as a example of piety and sweetness to the rest she have a very pretty genius to poetry and great skill in music both which talent she now exercise in such work as suit the place and company she be in -- the hymn and anthem she compose be not only the admiration of that convent but also of several other to whom they be show and she be speak of as a prodigy of wit and devotion in fine she behavior render she extremely dear to the superior and that affection join to a spiritual pride which those sanctify devotee be seldom wholly free from make she very desirous of retain she always in the convent : -- she be therefore continually preach up to she the uncertainty of those felicity which be to be find in the world and magnify that happy serenity which a total renunciation from it afford -- nay sometimes go so far as to insinuate there be scarce a possibility for any one encumber with the care and surround with the temptation of a public life to have those disposition which be requisite to enjoy the blessing of futurity -- ah my dear daughter would she say frequently to she how much should i rejoice to find in you a desire to forgo all the transitory fleeting pleasure of the world and devote yourself entirely to heaven -- what rapture would not you innocent soul partake when wholly devoid of all thought of sensual object you would be even while on earth a companion for angel and bless spirit and bear on the wing of heavenly contemplation have you dwelling above and be worship as a saint below all the old nun and some of the young one assist they abbess in endeavor to prevail on louisa to take the veil but all that they say make no impression on she mind not but she have more real piety than perhaps some of those who make so great a shew of it but she be of a different way of thinking and tho ' she know the world have its temptation have experience they in a very great degree yet she was-convince within herself that a person of virtuous principle might be no less innocent out of a cloyster than in one -- she see also among this sisterhood a great deal of envy to each other and perceive early that the flaming zeal profess among they be in some hypocrisy and enthusiasm in other so that have she have no prepossession in favor of du plessis or any engagement with he the life of a nun be what she never should have make choice of she keep she sentiment on this occasion entirely to herself however and make no shew of any repugnance to do as they would have she but whenever they become strenuous in they pressure tell they she doubt not but such a life as they describe must be very angelic but have already dispose of she vow it be not in she power to withdraw they nor would heaven accept so violate a offering this they tell she be only a suggestion of some evil spirit and that all engagement to a earthly object both might and ought to be dispense with for a divine vocation the argument they make use of for this purpose be artful enough to have impose on some mind but louisa have too much penetration not to see thro ' they and be unwilling to disoblige they by shew that she do so make use in she turn of evasion which the circumstance of the case render very excusable but fully persuade in they mind that it be solely she engagement with du plessis that render she so refractory to they desire they resolve to break it off if possible and to that end now intercept he letter two of which give a account that he be very much wound and unable to travel they renew they pressure in order to prevail on she to take the habit before he should be in a condition to come to bolognia these sollicitation however have no other effect than to embitter the satisfaction she would otherwise have enjoy during she stay among they -- the time of which begin now to seem tedious and she impatiently long for the end of the campaign which she expect would return she dear du plessis to she and she should be remove from a place where dissimulation a vice she detest be in a manner necessary she have receive several letter from he before the abbess take it in she head to stop they each more endearing than the former and last have flatter she with the hope of see he in a very short time day week and month pass over after a assurance so please to she wish without any confirmation of the repeat vow he have make and receive from he no account of the reason that delay he she begin to reproach herself for have place too much confidence in he -- the more time elapse the more cause she have to doubt he sincerity and believe she misfortune real : -- in fine it be near half a year that she languish under a vain expectation of see or at least hearing from he -- sometimes she imagine a new object have deprive she of he heart but when she call to mind the many proof he have give she of the most unparallell would generosity that ever be she could not think that if he even cease to love she he could be capable of leave she in so cruel a suspence : -- no say she to herself he would have let I know i have no more to depend on from he : -- paper can not blush and as he be out of the reach of my upbraiding he would certainly have acquaint I with my fate confess the inconstancy of he sex and exert that wit of which he have sufficient to have excuse he change : -- i will not therefore injure a man whom i have find so truly noble : -- death perhaps he deprive I of he the unrelenting sword make no distinction between the worthy and unworthy -- and the brave the virtuous du plessis may have fall a victim in common with the most vulgar these apprehension have no sooner gain ground in she imagination than she become the most disconsolate creature in the world the abbess take advantage of she melancholy as know the occasion of it and begin to represent in the strongest term the instability of all human expectation : -- you may easily see my dear child say she that monsieur either no longer live or cease to live for you : -- young man be waver every new object attract they wish -- they be impatient for a time but soon grow cool -- absence render they forgetful of they vow and promise -- there be no real dependance on they -- fly therefore to that divine love which never can deceive you -- give yourself up to heaven and you will soon be enable to despise the fickle hope of earth instead of say any thing to comfort she in this manner be she continually persecute and tho ' it be impossible for any one to have less inclination to a monastic life than she have yet the depression of she spirit the firm belief she now should never see du plessis more the misfortune of she circumstance join to the artifice they make use of and the repeat offer of accept she without the usual sum pay on such occasion might possibly at last have prevail on she -- she be half convinced in she mind that it be the only asylum leave to shield she from the want and insult of the world and the more she reflect on the change the perplexity and vexation of different kind the few year she yet have live have present she with the more reason she find to acquiesce with the persuasion of the abbess but heaven would not suffer the deceit practice on she to be crown with success and discover it to she timely enough to prevent she from give too much way to that despair which alone could have prevail with she to yield to they importunity there be among the sisterhood a young lady call donna leonora who be one of many daughter of a family more eminent for birth than riches be compel as too many be to become a nun in order to prevent she marry beneath she father 's dignity she have take a great liking to louisa from the moment she come into the convent and a farther acquaintance ripen it into a sincere friendship tho ' seclude from the world the austere air of a monastery have no effect upon she she still retain she former vivacity and it be only in the conversation these two have toge whenever they could separate from the other that louisa find any cordial to revive she now almost sink spirit one day as she be ruminate on she melancholy affair this young nun come hastily into she chamber and with a countenance that before she speak denote she have something very extraordinary to acquaint she with -- dear sister cry she i bring you the most surprising news but such as will be my ruin if you take the least notice of receive it from I and perhaps you own if you seem to be acquaint with it at all it be not to be doubt but louisa give she all the assurance she could desire of a inviolable secrecy after which know then resume this sweet-condition would lady that you lover monsieur du plessis be not only live but as faithful as you soul can wish or as you once believe : -- the cruelty of the abbess and some of the sisterhood in the plot with she have conceal the letter he have send to you in order to persuade you to become a nun : -- i tremble to think of they hypocrisy and deceit : -- but what continue she be not to be expect from bigotry and enthusiasm -- to increase the number of devotee they scruple nothing and vainly imagine the means be sanctify by the end little be it in the power of word to express the astonishment louisa be in to hear she speak in this manner but as she have no room to doubt she sincerity only ask by what mean she have attain the knowledge of what the person concern no doubt intend to keep as much a secret as possible on which the other satisfied she curiosity in these term : to confess the truth to you say she i steal this afternoon into the chapel in order to read a little book bring I the other day by one of my friend as it treat on a subject not allowable in a convent i think that the most proper place to entertain myself with it and be sit down in one of the confessional when hear the little door open from the gallery i see the abbess and sister clara who you know be she favorite and confidant come in together and as soon as they be enter shut the door after they i can not say i have any curiosity to hear they discourse but fear to be suspect by they in my amusement and not know what excuse to make for be there if i be see i slide down and lay close at the bottom of the confessional they happen to place themselves very near I and the abbess take a letter out of she pocket bad clara read it and tell she the substance of it as well as she could i find it be in french by some word which she be oblige to repeat over and over before not perfectly understand the language she could be able to find a proper interpretation of the abbess who have a little smattering of it herself sometimes help she out and between they both i soon find it come from monsieur du plessis and contain the most tender and compassionate complaint of you unkindness in not answer he letter -- that the symptom he have of approach death be not half so severe to he as you refuse he a consolation he stand for much in need of -- that if you find he unworthy of you love he be certainly so of you compassion and conclude with the most earnest entreaty you would suffer he to continue no longer in a suspence more cruel than a thousand death could be oh heaven cry louisa burst into tear how ungrateful must he think I and how can i return as it deserve so unexampled a constancy after such seeming proof of my infidelity -- cruel cruel treacherous abbess pursue she be this the fruit of all you boast sanctity -- this the return to the confidence the generous du plessis repose in you -- this you love and friendship to I -- do heaven to increase the number of its votary require you to be false perfidious and injurious to the world she be proceed in give vent to the anguish of she soul in exclamation such as these but leonora beg she would moderate she grief and for she sake as much as possible conceal the reason she have for resentment louisa again promise she would do she utmost to keep they from think she even suspect they have play she false -- then cry but tell I my dear leonora be they not a little move at the tender melancholy which i perceive run thro ' this epistle alas my dear reply the other they have long since forget those soft emotion which make we simpathize in the woe of love : -- inflexible by the rigid rule of this place and more by they own age they rather look with horror than pity on a tender inclination : -- they have a long conversation together the result of which be to spare nothing that might either persuade or if that fail compel you to take the order it be not in they power to do the latter interrupted louisa and this discovery of they baseness more than ever confirm I in the resolution never to consent you know not what be in they power say leonora they may make pretence for confine you here which as they be under no jurisdiction but the church the church will allow justifiable : -- indeed louisa continue she i should be loth to see you have recourse to force to get out of they hand which would only occasion you ill treatment : -- to whom alas can you complain -- you be a stranger in this country without any one friend to espouse you cause : -- be even du plessis here in person i know not as they have take it into they head to keep you here if all he could urge either to the pope or confessory would have any weight to oblige they to relinquish you a convent be the securest prison in the world and whenever any one come into it who by any particular endowment promise to be a ornament to the order can not without great difficulty disentangle themselves from the snare lay for they -- it be for this reason i have fear for you ever since you entrance for tho ' i should rejoice in so agreeable a companion i know too well the misery of a enforce attachment to wish you to be partaker of it louisa find too much reason in what she say to doubt the misery of she condition -- she know the great power of the church in all these country where the roman-catholic religion be establish more especially in those place under the papal jurisdiction and see no way to avoid what be now more terrible to she than ever those reflection throw she into such agony that leonora have much ado to keep she from fall into fit : -- she conjure she again and again never to betray what she have entrust she with assure she that if it be so much as guess at she should be expose to the worst treatment and punish as a enemy to the order of which she be a member louisa as often assure she that nothing should either tempt or provoke she to abuse that generous friendship she have testify for she but as she be not able to command she countenance tho ' she could she word she resolve to pretend herself indispose and keep she bed that she might be the less observe or the change in she should seem rather the effect of ill health than any secret discontent it be no sooner mention in the convent that she be out of order than the abbess herself as well as the whole sisterhood come to she chamber and shew the greatest concern : the tender care they take of she would have make she think herself infinitely oblige to they and perhaps go a great way in engage she continuance among they have she not be apprize of they falshood in a point so little to be forgive so great a enemy be she to all deceit herself that it be difficult for she to return the civility they treat she with as they might seem to deserve but whatever omission she be guilty of in this particular be imputed to she disposition and the whole convent continue to be extremely assiduous to recover she during the time of she feigned illness she thought be always employ on the means of get away whenever leonora and she be together a hundred contrivance be form which seem equally alike impracticable but at length they hit upon one which have a promising aspect and louisa after some scruple resolve to make trial of it be this : as hypocrisy be make use of to detain she hypocrisy be the only method by which she could hope to get she liberty : -- pretend therefore to be all at once restore to she former health she send to entreat the abbess and some other of the most zealous of the sisterhood to come into she chamber where as soon as they enter they find she on she knee before the picture of the virgin and seeming in a extacy of devotion : yes holy virgin cry she as if too much take up to see who enter i will obey you command -- i will devote myself entirely to thee -- i will follow where thou callest I : thou who hast restore I shalt have the first fruit of my strength : -- and oh that lorretto be at a greater distance -- to the utmost extent of land and sea would i go to seek thee -- in utter these ejaculation she prostrate herself on the floor -- then rise again as transport in a manner out of herself -- i come -- i come cry she -- still do i hear thy heavenly voice in this fit of enthusiasm do she remain for above half a hour and so well act she part that the abbess who would not offer to interrupt she believe it real and be in little less agitation of spirit than louisa pretend to be at length seem to come to herself she turn towards the company as tho ' she but just then discover they be in the room oh madam say she to the abbess how highly favor have i be this bless night -- the virgin have herself appear to I whether in a vision or to my wake eye i can not well determine but sure i have be in such extacy have feel such divine rapture as no word can express oh my dear daughter cry the abbess how my soul kindle to behold this change in thee -- but tell I what say the holy virgin she bad I wait on she at lorretto answer she and give I hope of do something wonderful in my favor : -- i will therefore with you permission undertake a pilgrimage and at she shrine expiate the offence of my past life in tear of true contrition and then return a pure and fearless partaker of the happiness you enjoy in a uninterrupted course of devotion : -- oh exclaim she exalt she voice how do i detest and despise the vanity and folly of the world -- how hate myself for have be too much attach to they and so long be cold and negligent of my only happiness the abbess and after she all the nun that be present embrace louisa -- praise to the sky this miraculous conversion as they term it and spare nothing to confirm the pious resolution she have take in fine they consent to she pilgrimage with a satisfaction equal to what she feel in undertake it -- they not in the least doubting but she would return to they as soon as she have fulfil she devotions and flattering themselves that the report of this miracle would do the greatest honor to they convent that it could possibly receive and she delight with the thought of be at liberty to enquire after she dear du plessis and be free from a dissimulation so irksome to she nature she pilgrim 's habit and a great crucifix to carry between she hand with another at she girdle and all the formality of that garb be prepare she set forward with the prayer and benediction of the whole sisterhood who tell she that they should be impatient till they see she again and expect great thing from she at she return which in reality they all do except leonora who laugh heartily at the deception she have put upon they and whisper in she ear as she give she the last embrace that she wish she a happy meeting with that saint she go in search of to prevent all suspicion of she intention she leave she cloath and every thing she have bring into the convent under the care of the abbess say that at she return she would have they disposed of and the money give to the poor : but unknown to any one except leonora she quilt some piece of gold and valuable trinket into she undergarment as not doubt but she should have occasion for much more than in effect she be mistress of when on she journey the pleasure she feel at see herself out of the wall of the monastery be very much abate by the uncertainty how she should proceed or where direct she way : and indeed let any one figure to themselves the condition she be in and they will rather wonder she have courage to go on than that she be sometimes daunt even to despair -- a young creature of little more than eighteen year old -- wholly unacquainted with fatigue -- delicate in she frame -- wander alone on foot in the midst of a strange country -- ignorant of the road or have she be acquaint with it at a loss where to go to get any intelligence of what she seek and even doubtful if the person she run such risque to hear of yet be in the world or not the letter leonora have inform she of give no account at least that she could learn either where he be or whether there be any hope of he recovery from that illness it mention she have therefore every thing to dread and little very little to hope : yet do she not repent she have quit the convent and the desire of get still farther from it make she prosecute she journey with greater strength and vigor than could have be expect : she pilgrim 's habit be not only a defense against any insult from person she meet on the road but also attract the respect and engage the civility of every one -- as that country abound with religious house she be not only lodge and feed without any expence but receive a piece of money at each of they she go to so that she little stock instead of be diminish be considerably increase when she come to lorretto for thither not to be false in every thing she go and be truly sorry for the hypocrisy which a sad necessity alone could have make she guilty of pay she devotion with a sincere heart tho ' free from that enthusiasm and bigotry which be too much practice in convent from lorretto she cross the country to florence every one be ready to direct a holy pilgrim on she way and assist she with all thing necessary as she go very easy journey never exceed four or five mile a day she easily support the fatigue and have she be certain at last of see du plessis it would have be rather a pleasure to she but she mind suffer much more than she body during this pilgrimage which she continue in the same manner she have begin till she reach leghorn where a ship lie at anchor and expect to sail in a few day for marseille she agree to give a small matter for she passage the sea-faring-men not pay altogether so much regard to she habit as the land one have do no ill accident intervene the vessel come safely into she desire port and louisa now find herself in the native country of the only person who engross she thought : as she have hear he say he be of paris she suppose that the most likely place to hear news of he but be in some debate within herself whether she should continue to wear she pilgrim 's habit or provide herself with other cloath at marseille she be weary of this mendicant way of travel and could have be glad to have exchange it for one more agreeable to the manner in which she have be accustom but then when she consider how great a protection the appearance she make have be from all those insult to which a person of she sex and age must otherwise infallibly have be expose in travel alone she resolve not to throw it off till she come to the place where she intend to take up she abode at least for some time young as she be she have well weigh what course to take in case du plessis should either be dead or by some accident remove where she could hear nothing more of he and all country and part be now equal to she as she must then be reduce once more to get she bread by she labor she doubt not but to find encouragement for she industry as well in pari as elsewhere with this resolution therefore after lay one night at marseille she proceed on she way in the same fashion as she have do ever since she leave bolognium and in about six week get safely to that great and opulent city where she take up she lodging at a hotel extremely fatigue as it be easy to believe have never even for one day cease walk but while she be on board the ship which bring she to marseille for the space of eight month a thing almost incredible and what perhaps no woman but herself would have have courage to undertake or resolution to perform but be in she circumstance infinitely the most safe and expedient that prudence could suggest chap xxiii _ shew by what mean louisa come to the knowledge of she parent with other occurrence _ the first thing she do on she arrival be to send for proper person to equip she in a manner that she might once more appear herself resolve that till she could do so not to be see in the street while these thing be prepare she send a person whom the people of the house recommend to she to the palace of the prince of contus not doubt but that some of the gentleman belong to he highness might give some intelligence where monsieur du plessis be to be find but the messenger return without any other information than that they know he very well but could give no direction in what part he be at present he not have be see in pari for a long time it be hard to say whether she most rejoice or grieve at this account : she imagine that have he be dead they would not have be ignorant of it therefore conclude he live to she infinite satisfaction but then he absent himself from the capital of the kingdom and from the presence of a prince who have so much love he fill she with a adequate disquiet as believe some very ill accident must have be the occasion : -- she dispatch the same person afterwards to all the public place that she hear gentleman frequent but meet not with the least success in she enquiry it would prolong this narrative to a tedious length should i attempt any description of what she feel in this situation or the reflection she make on the odd circumstance of she life : -- the greatness of she spirit and the most perfect resignation to the divine will however make she support even this last and severest trial with fortitude and patience and as soon as she have put herself into a convenient neat garb but plain befitting she condition she go out with a design to take a private lodging where she might live more cheaply than she could at the hotel till providence should throw some person in the way that might recommend she either to work or to teach young lady music she be wander thro ' several of the street of pari without be able as yet to find such a chamber as she want when a great shower of rain happen to fall she stand up under the porch of a large house for shelter till it should be over which it be not for a considerable time and the street be very dirty she return to the hotel intend to renew she search the next day : she have not be come in above half a hour before the man of the house tell she that a servant in a very rich livery who he perceive have follow she and have ask many question concern she be now return and desire to speak with she as du plessis be ever in she thought a sudden rush of joy overflow she heart which seem to she the presage of see he tho ' how he should imagine she be in paris be a mystery : -- but she give herself not much time for reflection before she order the man to be admit the manner of he approach she be very respectful but the message he have to deliver seem of a contrary nature -- after have ask if she name be louisa and she answer that it be i come madam say he from a gentleman who see you stand just now at the gate of a house in the fauxbourg st germain he command I to tell you that he have something of moment to acquaint you with and desire you will permit I to call a chair and attend you to he house where he be impatient to receive you what indeed could louisa think of a person who should send for she in this manner -- all the late transport she be in be immediately convert into disdain and vexation at be take as she have all the reason in the world to suppose for one of those common creature who prostitute they charm for bread -- tell you master say she that by whatever accident he have learn my name he be wholly ignorant of the character of the person he have send you to : -- that i be a entire stranger at paris and he must have mistake I for some other who perhaps i may have the misfortune to resemble and may be also call as i be -- at least i be willing to think so as the only excuse can be make for he offering this insult : -- but go continue she with that pride which be natural to affronted virtue -- go and convince he of he error -- and let I hear no more of it it be in vain he assure she that he master be a person of the highest honor and that he be not unknown to she all he could say have not the least effect unless to enflame she more when after ask he name the fellow tell she he be forbid to reveal it but that he be confident she would not deny have be acquaint with he when once she see he i shall neither own the one cry she nor consent to the other then bid he a second time be go with a air which shew she be not to be prevail upon to listen to he argument this man have no sooner leave she than she fall into a deep study from which a sudden thought make she immediately start : -- the count de bellfleur come into she head and she be certain it could be no other than that cruel persecutor of she virtue that she ill fate have once more throw in she way -- as she know very well by what he have do that he be of a disposition to scruple nothing for the attainment of he wish she tremble for the consequence of he discover where she be -- the only way she could think on to avoid the danger she might be expose to on he account be to draw up a petition to the prince of contus acquaint he that she be the person who be near suffer so much from the ill design he have on she at padua when so generously refer by monsieur du plessis and to entreat he highness 's protection against any attempt he might be safe enough to make she be just sit down in order to form a remonstrance of this kind when a chariot and six stop at the door she be inform the gentleman who have send to she be come in person and that they know it be the same by the livery -- louisa run hastily to the window and see a person alight whom by the bulk and stature she know could not be the count she so much dread this have much the advantage of the other in both somewhat reassure by this sight she order the master of the hotel to desire he to walk into a parlor and let he know she would attend he there as she see not the face of this visitor she could not be certain whether it be not some of those she have be acquaint with at venice who have by accident see she at pari might accord to the freedom of the french nation take the liberty of visit she -- but whoever it be or on what score soever bring she think it best to receive he in a place where in case of any ill usage she might readily have assistance the master of the hotel perceive she scruple readily do as he be order and louisa have desire that he or some of he people would be within call go down to receive this unknown gent tho ' not without emotion which at that moment she know not how to account for but soon after she be seize with infinitely greater when enter the parlor she find it be no other than dorilaus who have give she this anxiety -- surprize at the sight of a person whom of all the world she could least have expect in that place make she at first start back and conscious shame for have as she think so ill reward he goodness mix with a certain awe which she have for no other person but himself occasion such a tremble as render she unable either to retire or move forward to salute he as she otherwise would have do he see the confusion she be in and willing to give it a immediate relief run to she and take she in he arm -- my dear dear child say he be i so happy to see thee once more -- oh sir return she disengage herself from he embrace and fall at he foot -- how can i look upon you after have fly from you protection and give you such cause to think I the most ungrateful creature in the world it be heaven answer he that inspire you with that abhorrence of my offer which have you accept we must both have be eternally undo -- you be my daughter louisa pursue he my own natural daughter -- rise then and take a father 's blessing all that can be say of astonishment would be far short of what she feel at these word : -- the happiness seem so great she could not think it real tho ' utter from mouth she know unaccustomed to deceit : -- a hundred time without give he leave to satisfy she doubt do she cry out my father -- my father -- my real father -- how can it be -- be there a possibility that louisa owe she be to dorilaus yes my louisa answer he and flatter myself by what i have observe of you disposition you have do nothing since we parting that might prevent my glory in be the parent of such a child the hurry of spirit she be in prevent she from take notice of these last word or at least from make any answer to they and she still continue cry out -- dorilaus my father -- good heaven may i believe i be so bless -- who then be my mother -- wherefore have i be so long ignorant of what i be -- and how be the joyful secret at last reveal all these thing you shall be fully inform of answer he in the mean time be satisfied i do not deceive you and be indeed you father : transport to find my long lose child whom i myself know not be so till i believe she go for ever -- a thousand time i have wish both you and horatio be my child but little suspected you be so till after he too eager ambition deprive I of he and my mistaken love drive you to seek a refuge among stranger tear of joy and tenderness now bedew the face of both father and daughter : -- silence for some moment succeed the late acclamation but dorilaus at length find she fully convinced she be as happy as he say she be and entirely free from all those apprehension which have occasion she flying from he tell she he be settle in pari that he live just opposite to the house where she have stand up on account of the shower and happen to be at one of he window immediately know she that he send a servant after she who have enquire how long she have be arrive and in what manner she come that he have send for she with no other intent then to make trial how she would resent it and be transport to find she answer such as he hope and have expect from she : -- he add that he have all the anxiety of a father to hear by what mean she have be support and the motive which induce she to travel in the habit of a pilgrim as the matter of the hotel have inform he servant but that he would defer he satisfaction till she should be in a place more become he daughter on conclude these word he call for the master of the hotel and have defray what little expence she have be at since she come there take she by the hand and lead she to he chariot which soon bring they to a magnificent house and furnish in a manner answerable to the birth and fortune of the owner louisa have all this time seem like one in a dream : -- she have ever love dorilaus with a filial affection and to find herself really he daughter to be snatch at once from all those care which attend penury when accompany with virtue and a abhorrence of enter into measure inconsistent with the strictest honor to be relieve from every want and in a station which command respect and homage be such a surcharge of felicity that she be less able to support than all the fatigue she have go thro ' -- surprize and joy make she appear more dull and stupid than she have ever be in she whole life before and dorilaus be oblige to repeat all he have say over and over again to bring she into she usual composedness and enable she to give he the satisfaction he require but as soon as she have by degree recollect herself she modestly related all that have happen to she from the time she leave he -- the method by which she endeavor to earn she bread -- the insult she be expose to at mr c -- l -- ge 's -- the way she come acquaint with melanthe -- the kindness show she by that lady -- they travels together -- the base stratagem make use of by count de bellfleur to ruin she with that lady -- the honorable position monsieur du plessis have profess for she -- the seasonable assistance he have give she in that iminent danger she be in from the count 's unlawful design upon she -- he place she afterwards in the monastry -- the treachery of the abbess -- the artifice she have be oblige to make use of to get out of the nunnery -- she pilgrimage -- in fine conceal no part of she adventure only that which related to the passion she have for du plessis which she endeavor as much as she could to disguise under the name of gratitude for the obligation he have confer upon she and admiration of he virtue so different from what she have find in other who have address she dorilaus however easily perceive the tenderness with which she be agitate on the account of that young gentleman but he would not excite she blush by take any notice of it especially as he find nothing to condemn in it and have observe throughout the course of she whole narrative she have behave on other occasion with a discretion far above she year he be far from wrong she by suspect she have swerve from it in this but when he hear the vast journey she have come on foot he be in the utmost amazement at she fortitude and tell she he be resolve to keep she pilgrim 's habit as a relique to preserve to after-age the memory of a adventure which have really something more marvellous in it than many set down as miracle and now have fully gratify he own curiosity in all he want to be inform of he think proper to case the impatience she be in to know the history of she birth and on what occasion it have be so long conceal which he do in these or the like word : chap xxiv _ the history of dorilaus and matilda with other circumstance very important to louisa _ you know say he that i be descend of one of the most illustrious family in england tho ' by some imprudency on the one side and injustice on the other my claim be set aside and i deprive of that title which my ancestor for a long succession of year have enjoy so that the estate i be in possession of be derive to I in right of my mother who be a heiress it be indeed sufficient to have give I a pretence to any lady i should have make choice on and to provide for what child i might have have by she : but the pride of blood be not abate in I by be cut off from my birthright inspire I with a unconquerable aversion to marriage since i could not bequeath to my posterity that dignity i ought to have enjoy myself : -- i resolve therefore to live single and that the misfortune of my family should dye with myself in my younger year i go to travel as well for improvement as to alleviate that discontent which be occasion by the sight of another in possession of what i thought be my due -- have make the tour of europe i take france again in my way home : -- the gallantry and good breeding of these people very much attach I to they but what chiefly engage my continuance here much longer than i have do in any other part be a acquaintance i have make with a lady call matilda : she be of a very good family in england be send to a monastry merely for the sake of well-grounding she in a religion the free exercise of which be not allow at home and to seclude she from settle she affection on any other than the person she be destine to by the will of she parent and to whom she have be contract in she infancy : -- she be extremely young and beautiful as a angel and the knowledge she be pre-engaged could not hinder I from love she any more than the declaration i make in she hearing against marriage could the grateful return she be please to make I : -- in fine the mutual inclination we have for each other as it render we deaf to all suggestion but that of gratify it so it also inspire we with ingenuity to surmount all the difficulty that be between we wish and the end of they -- tho ' a pensioner in a monastry and very closely observe by the help of a confidant she frequently get out and many night we pass together -- till some business relate to my estate at length call I away we be oblige to part which we could not do without testify a great deal of concern on both side : -- mine be truly sincere at that time and i have reason to believe she 's be no less so but absence easily wear out the impression of youth : as i never expect to see she any more i endeavor not to preserve a remembrance which would only have give I disquiet and to confess the truth soon forget both the pleasure and the pain i have experience in this as well as some other little sally of my unthinking youth many year pass over without my ever hear any thing of she and it be some month after i receive you letter from aix-la-chappelle that the post bring I one from ireland : have no correspondence in that country i be a little surprized but much more when i open it and find it contain these word : _ to _ dorilaus sir this come to make a request which i know not if the acquaintance we have together in the early part of both we life would be sufficient to apologize for the trouble you must take in comply with it : -- permit I therefore to acquaint you that i have long labor under a indisposition which my physician assure I be incurable and under which i must inevitably sink in a short time but whatever they say i know it be impossible for I to leave the world without impart to you a secret wholly improper to be entrust in a letter but be of the utmost importance to those concern in it of whom yourself be the principal : -- be assure it regard you honor you conscience you justice as well as the eternal peace of she who conjure you with the utmost earnestness to come immediately on the receipt of this

know by the name of _ matilda _ now _ m -- e i will not repeat to you my dear louisa continue dorilaus the strange perplexity of idea that run thro ' my mind after have read this letter : -- i be very far from guess at the real motive of this invitation which however as i once have a regard for that lady i soon determine to obey and have leave the care of my house to a relation of mine by the mother 's side i go directly for ireland but when i come there be a little embarrassed in my mind what excuse i should make to she husband for my visit -- before i ventured to the castle i make a thorough enquiry after the character of this young lady and in what manner she live with she lord never do i hear a person more universally speak well of : -- the poor adore she charity affability and condescending sweetness of disposition : -- the rich admire she wit she virtue and good breeding : -- she beauty tho ' allow inferior to few of she sex be the least qualification that seem deserving praise : -- to add to all this they tell I she be a pattern of conjugal affection and the best of mother to a numerous race of child -- that she lord have all the value he ought to have for so amiable a wife and that no wed pair ever live together in greater harmony and it be with the utmost concern whoever i speak to on this affair conclude what they related of she with say that so excellent a example of all that be valuable in womankind would shortly be take from they -- that she have long with a unexampled patience linger under a severe illness which every day threaten dissolution these account make I hesitate no farther : -- i go boldly to the castle ask to speak with the lord m -- e who receive I with a politeness befitting he quality : i tell he that my curiosity of see foreign country have bring I to ireland and be in my tour thro ' those part i take the liberty of call at he seat have formerly have the honor of be know to he lady when at she father 's house and whom i now hear to my great concern be indispose otherwise have be glad to pay my respects to she the nobleman answer with tear in he eye that she be indeed in a condition such as give no hope of she recovery but that she sometimes see company tho ' oblige to receive they in bed have lose the use of she limb and would perhaps be glad of the visit of a person she have know so long on this i tell he my name which he immediately send in and she woman not long after come from she to let I know she would admit I my lord go in with I and to countenance what i say i accost she with the freedom of a person who have be acquaint when child speak of she father as of a gentleman who have favor I with he good-will tho ' in reality i have never see he in my life but remember well enough what she have mention to I concern he and some other of she family to talk as if i have be intimate among they i could perceive she be very well pleased with the method i have take of introduce myself and to prevent any suspicion that i have any other business with she than to pay my compliment make my visit very short that day not doubt but she would of herself contrive some means of entertaining I without witness as she easily find she lord have desire i would make the castle my home while i stay in that part of the country i be not deceive the next morning have be tell she lord be engage with he steward she send for I and make some pretence for get rid of she woman she pluck a paper from under she pillow and put it into my hand -- in that say you will find the secret i mention in my letter -- suspect not the veracity of it i conjure you nor love the unfortunate horatio and louisa less for they be mine i can not express the confusion i be in continue dorilaus at she mention you and you brother but i have no opportunity of ask any question : -- she woman that instant return after which i stay but a short time be impatient to examine the contents which as near as i can remember be to this purpose : you be scarce out of france before i discover we amour have produce such consequence as have my too fond passion give I leave to think of i never should have hazard : -- i will not repeat the distraction i be in -- you may easily judge of it : -- i communicate the misfortune to my nurse who you know i tell you go from england with I and have often bring you message from the convent : -- the faithful creature do she utmost to console I for a evil which be without a remedy : -- to complete my confusion my father command I home my lord m -- e be return from he travels : -- we be both of a age to marry and it be resolve by we parent no longer to defer the completion of a affair long before agree upon -- i be ready to lay violent hand on myself since there seem no way to conceal my shame but my good nurse have set all she wit to work for I find out a expedient which serve I when i could think of nothing for myself -- she bid I be of comfort that she think be send for home be the luckiest thing that could have happen since nothing could be so bad as to have my pregnancy discover in the convent as it infallibly must have be have i stay a very little time longer : she also assure I she would contrive it so as to keep the thing a secret from all the world -- i find afterwards she do not deceive I by vain promise -- we leave paris accord to my father 's order and come by easy journey befitting my condition to calai and embark on board the packet for dover but then instead of take coach for london hire a chariot and go cross the country to a little village where a kinswoman of my nurse 's live -- with these people i remain till horatio and louisa come into the world : -- i could have have they nurse at that place but i fear some discovery thro ' the miscarriage of letter which often happen and which could not have be avoid be send on such occasion -- so we contrived together that my good confident and adviser should carry they to you house and commit the care of they to you who equal with myself have a right to it : -- she find means by bribe a man that work under you gardener to convey they where i afterwards hear you find and receive they as i could wish and become the generosity of you nature -- i then take coach for london pretend at my arrival that i have be delay by sickness and to excuse my nurse 's absence say she have catch the fever of I -- so no farther enquiry be make and i soon after be marry to a man whose worth be well deserving of a better wife tho ' i have endeavor to attone for my unknown transgression by every act of duty in my power : -- nurse stay long enough in you part of the world to be able to bring I a account how the child be dispose of -- that i never give you a account they be you own be occasion by two reason first the danger of entrust such a thing by the post my nurse soon after die and secondly because as i be a wife i think it unbecoming of I to remind you of a passage i be willing to forget myself -- a long sickness have put other thought into my head and inspire I with a tenderness for those unhappy babe which the shame of be they mother hitherto deprive they of -- i hear with pleasure that you be not marry and be therefore at full liberty to make some provision for they if they be yet live that may alleviate the misfortune of they birth farewell if i obtain this first and last request i shall dye well satisfied _ p _ burn this paper i conjure you the moment you have read it but lay the contents of it up in you heart never to be forget i now no longer wonder pursued dorilaus at that impulse i have to love you -- i find it the simpathy of nature and adore the divine power -- after have well fix in my mind all the particulars of this amazing secret i perform she injunction and commit it to the flame : i have opportunity enough to inform she in what manner horatio have dispose of himself and let she know you be go with a lady on she travels : i conceal indeed the motive fear to give she any occasion of reproach herself for have so long conceal what my ignorance of might have involve we all in guilt and ruin i stay some few day at the castle and then take my leave : she say many tender thing at parting concern you and seem well satisfy with the assurance i give she of make the same provision for you as i must have do have the ceremony of the church oblige I to it this seem indeed the only thing for which she live and i be inform die in a few day after at my return to england i renew my endeavor to discover where you be but could hear nothing since you write from aix-la-chappelle and be equally trouble that i have receive no letter from you brother -- i doubt not but he have fall in the battle and mourn he as lose -- till a old servant perceive the melancholy i be in acquaint I that several letter have be leave at my house by the post during my absence but that the kinsman i have leave to take care of my affair have secrete they jealous no doubt of the fondness i have express for he -- this so enraged I when on examination i have too much reason to be assure of this treachery that i turn my whole estate into ready money and resolve to quit england for ever and pass my life here this be a country i always love and have many reason to dislike my own here i soon hear news of my horatio and such as fill I with a pleasure which want nothing of be complete but the presence of my dear louisa to partake of it dorilaus then go on and acquaint she with the particulars of horatio 's story as he have learn it from the baron de palfoy with whom he now be very intimate but as the reader be sufficiently inform of those transaction it would be needless to repeat they so i shall only say that dorilaus arrive in france in a short time after horatio have leave it to enter into the service of the king of sweden and have write that letter insert in the eighteenth chapter in order to engage that young warrior to return some little time before he meeting with louisa nothing now be want to the contentment of this tender father but the presence of horatio which he be every day expect when instead of himself those letter from he arrive which contain he resolution of remain with charle xii till the conquest he be in pursuit of should be accomplish this be some matter of affliction to dorilaus tho ' in he heart he could not but approve those principle of honor which detain he -- neither the baron de palfoy nor charlotta herself could say he could well have act otherwise and use they utmost endeavor to comfort a father in he anxiety for the safety of so valuable a son louisa be also very much trouble at be disappoint in she hope of embrace a brother whom she have ever dearly love and be now more precious to she than ever by the proof she have hear he have give of he courage and he virtue but she have another secret and more poignant grief that prey upon she soul and could scarce receive any addition from ought beside : -- she have be now near two month in pari yet could hear nothing of monsieur du plessis but that by the death of he father a large estate have devolve upon he which he have never come to claim or have be at paris for about eighteen month so that she have all the reason in the world to believe he be no more this throw she into a melancholy which be so much the more severe as she endeavor to conceal it : -- she make use of all she effort to support the loss of a person she so much loved and who prove himself so deserving of that love : -- she represent to herself that be relieve from all the snare and misery of a indigent life raise from a obscurity which have give she many bitter pang to a station equal to she wish and under the care of the most indulgent and best of father she ought not to repine but bless the bounty of heaven who have bestow on she so many blessing and with-held only one she could have ask -- these i say be the dictate of reason and religion but the tender passion be not always to be silence by they and whenever she be alone the tear in spight of herself would flow and she without even know she do so cry out oh du plessis wherefore do i live since thou art dead among the many acquaintance she soon contract at paris there be none she so much esteem both on the account of she own merit and the regard she have for horatio as mademoiselle de palfoy in this young lady 's society do she find more charm for she grief than in that of any other and the other truly loving she not only because she find nothing more worthy of be love but because she be the sister of horatio they be very seldom asunder louisa be one day at the baron 's enjoy that satisfaction which the conversation of he beautiful daughter never fail to afford when word be bring that madam the countess d'espargne be come to visit she -- mademoiselle charlotta run to receive she with a great deal of joy she be a lady she very much regard and who she have not see of a long time she immediately return lead a lady in deep mourning who seem not to be above five-and-twenty be extremely handsome and have beside something in she air that attach louisa at first sight mademoiselle charlotta present she to the countess say at the same time see madam the only rival you have in my esteem you do well to give I one reply the countess who look as if she would make I love she as well as you and so i should be even with you with these word she open she arm to embrace louisa who return the compliment with equal politeness when they be seat mademoiselle charlotta begin to express the pleasure she have in see she in pari on which the countess tell she that the affair she come upon be so disagreeable that nothing but the happiness of enjoy she company while she stay could attone for it you know my dear continue madam d'espargne i be always a enemy to any thing that have the face of business yet be i now against my will involve in it by as odd a adventure as perhaps you ever hear charlotta testify some desire to be inform of what nature the other immediately satisfied she curiosity in this manner : you know say she that on the late death of my father he estate devolve on my brother a officer in those troops in italy command by the prince of contus : -- some wound which be look upon as extremely dangerous obliged he when the campaign be over to continue in he winter quarter -- on which he send to monsieur the count to take possession in he name this be do but a intricate affair relate to certain sum lodge in a person 's hand and to be bring before the parliament of pari could not be decide without the presence either of he or myself who have be witness of the transaction -- i be extremely loth to take so long a journey be then in very ill health and hearing he be recover delay it as we then expect he in person : -- i send a special messenger however in order to hasten he return -- but instead of comply with my desire i receive a letter from he acquaint I that a business of more moment to he than any thing in my power to guess at require he presence in another place and insist by all the tenderness which have ever be between we that i would take on myself the management of this affair : -- to enable I the better to do it he send I a deed of trust to act as i should find it most expedient as he do not let I into the secret of what motive detain he at so critical a juncture i be at first very much surprize but on ask some question of the messenger i have send to he i soon discover what it be he tell I that on he arrival he find my brother have leave he quarter and be go to bolognia on which he follow and overtake he there -- that he appear in the utmost discontent and be just prepare to proceed to leghorn but do not mention to he any more than he do in he letter to I what inducement he have to this journey : -- he servant however tell he privately that the mystery be this : -- that be passionately in love with a young english lady whom he have place in a monastery at bolognium and expect to find there at he return she have in he absence depart without have acquaint he with she design and that suppose she be go for england and unable to live without she he intention be to take shipping for that country and make use of he utmost effort to find she out i must confess pursue the beautiful countess this piece of quixotism very much veve I : -- i think he friend in france deserve more from he than to be neglect for one who flee from he and who as the man say he know not whether he should be able ever to see again i resolve however to comply with he desire and come immediately to pari but heaven have shew he how little it approve he give I this unnecessary trouble for this morning i receive a letter from he that meeting with robber in he way they have take from he all he money and bill of exchange besides wound he in several place so that he can not proceed on he journey till he hurt which it seem be not dangerous be cure and he have fresh remittance from hence with what emotion the heart of louisa be agitate during the latter part of this little narrative a sensible reader may easily conceive : from the first mention of bolognium where there be no other english pensioner than herself she know it must be no other than she dear du plessis who be in search for she abroad while she be vainly hope to find he at home : -- every circumstance render this belief more certain and surprize and joy work so strongly in she that fear the effect would be visible she rise up and withdraw to a window mademoiselle charlotta who know she could not be capable of such a act of unpoliteness without be compel to it ask if she be not well : -- on which louisa entreated pardon but own a sudden faintness have come over she spirit so that she be oblige to be rude in order to prevent be troublesome as mademoiselle charlotta know nothing of she story she have no farther think about it than of some little qualm which frequently happen when young lady be too closely lace and she seem perfectly recover from the conversation be renew on the same subject it have turn upon before this interruption and the name of monsieur du plessis be often mention confirm louisa if before she could have have the least remains of doubt that it be she lover who neglectful of he own affair and the remonstrance of he expect friend be about to range in search of one who he imagine be ungrateful both to he love and friendship after have listen with the utmost attention to all the countess say of he and other matter become the topic of discourse she take she leave in order to reflect alone what she ought to do in this affair she debate not long within herself before she resolve to write to he and prevent the unprofitable journey he be about to take and have hear by madam d' espargne the name of the village where he be oblige to wait both for the recovery of he wound and for remittance for he expence she write to he in the follow term : _ to monsieur _ du plessis i should ill return the proof i have receive of you generous disinterested friendship to delay one moment that i have it in my power in endeavor to convince you that it be a quite contrary motive than ingratitude to you that carry I from bolognium : -- but the story be too long for the compass of a letter when you know it you will perhaps own this action whatever you may now think of it merit more than any thing i could have do you approbation : -- this seeming riddle will be easily expound if on the recovery of you wound you repair immediately to paris where you will find _ you much obliged _ louisa have finish this little billet a scruple rise in she head that be now under the care of a father she ought not to do any thing of this nature without he permission : -- she have already tell he how greatly she have be indebted to du plessis for he honorable passion but have not mention the least tittle of the tender impression it have make on she and she so lately know he to be she father that she be ashamed to make he the confidant of a affair of this nature but then when she consider the quality of du plessis which she be now confirm of and the sense dorilaus testify he have of he behavior to she while he believe she so infinitely he inferior make she resolve to drain she modesty so far as to inform he all she begin by relate she accidental meeting with madam the countess d'espargne and the conversation that pass at mademoiselle de palfoy 's and then tho ' not without immoderate blush shew he what she have write and beseech he to let she know whether it would be consistent with a virgin 's modesty and also agreeable to he pleasure that she give this demonstration of she gratitude for the favor she have receive from this young gentleman dorilaus be charm with this proof of she duty and respect and tell she that he be so far from disapprove what she have write that have she omit it or say less than she do he should have look upon she as unworthy of so perfect a passion as that which monsieur du plessis on all occasion testify for she : -- that in he opinion she owe he more than she could ever pay and that it should be he endeavor to shew he have not place he affection on the daughter of one who know not how to set a just value on merit such as he : -- he make she also add a postscript to the letter to give a direction in what part of pari he might find she on he arrival but louisa would by no means give the least hint of the alteration in she circumstance not that she want any farther proof of he sincerity but that she reserve the pleasure of so agreeable a surprize to they meeting this letter be dispatch immediately to the end he might receive it at least as soon as that from he sister with the expect remittance chap xxv _ monsieur du plessis arrive at paris : he reception from dorilaus and louisa : the marriage of these lover agree upon _ the innocent pleasure louisa feel in picture to herself the extacy which du plessis would be in at the receipt of she letter be not a flattering idea : -- to know she be in paris where in all probability she have come to seek he and to have the intelligence of it from herself have all the effect on he that the most raptured fancy can invent he order to madam d' espargne be punctually comply with he bill of exchange also come soon after to hand and the little hurt he have receive from the robber as well as those of he mind be perfectly heal he set out with a lover 's expedition and arrive in pari to the pleasing surprize of a sister who tenderly love he and expect not this satisfaction of a long time he take but one night 's repose before he enquire concern dorilaus and be tell that he be a person of quality in england but on some disgust he have receive in he native country be come to settle in france as louisa be extremely admire they tell he also that he have a very beautiful daughter of whom he be extremely fond this last information give not a little ease to the mind of he who hear it and dissipate those apprehension which the high character they give of dorilaus have in spite of himself excite in he : he now imagine that as they be english he louisa might possibly have be acquaint with the daughter of this gentleman in they own country and meet she at pari might have put herself under she protection full of those impatiency which be inseparable from a sincere passion he borrow he sister 's chariot and go to the fauxbourg st germain and be tell one of the best house in the place be that of dorilaus he ask for mademoiselle louisa on which he be desire to alight and shew into a handsome parlor while a servant go in to inform she : after this he be usher up stair into a room the furniture of which shew the elegance of the owner 's taste but accustom to every thing that be great and magnificent the gilded scene the rich tapestry the picture have no effect on he till cast he eye on one that hang over the chimney he find the exact resemblance of the dear object never absent from he heart -- it be indeed the picture of louisa which she father soon after she arrival have cause to be draw by one of the best painter at that time in pari this sight give he a double pleasure because it in some measure anticipate that of the original and also convinced he that she be not indifferent to the person she be with he be fix in contemplation on this delightful copy when the original appear in all the advantage that jewel and rich dress could give she -- tho ' he love she only for herself and nothing could add to the sincere respect he heart have always pay she yet to see she so different from what he expect fill he with a surprize and a kind of enforced awe which hinder he from give that loose to he transport which after so long a absence might have be very excusable -- and he could only say -- my dear adorable louisa be i so bless to see you once more -- she meet he embrace half way and reply monsieur du plessis heaven have give I all i have to wish in restore to I so faithful a friend -- but come continue she permit I to lead you to a father who long to

utmost testimony of respect on both side dorilaus tell he daughter she ought to make she excuse to monsieur for have elope from the monastry where he have be so good to place she which say he i think you can do in no better a manner than by tell the truth and as i be already sufficiently acquaint with the whole will leave you to relate it while i dispatch a little business that at present call I hence he go out of the room in speak this and louisa have a more full opportunity of inform she lover of all she have suffer since they parting till this happy change in she fortune than she could have have in the presence of she father tho ' no stranger to she most inmost thought on this occasion the please story of she pilgrimage rehearse how do the charm du plessis pity and applaud by turn she suffering and fortitude -- how exclaim against the treachery of the abbess and those of the nun who be in confederacy with she but he curiosity satisfy in this point another rise instantly in he mind that be the daughter of such a person as dorilaus wherefore she have make so great a secret of it and what reason have occasion she being on the term she be with melanthe he no sooner express he wonder on these head than have before she father 's permission to do so she resolve to leave he in no suspence on any score relate to she affair tho ' say she blush i can not reveal the history of my birth without lay open the error of those to whom i owe my be yet i shall not think the sacrifice too great to recompence the obligation you have lay upon I and then proceed to acquaint he with every thing relate to she parent as well as to herself from the first moment she be find in the garden of dorilaus it be not to be doubt but that he listen to the story with the utmost attention in which he find such matter of admiration that he could not forbear frequently interrupt she by cry oh heaven oh providence how mysterious be thy way -- how in thy disposal of thing dost thou force we to acknowledge thy divine power and wisdom he be also extremely pleased to find she be the sister of horatio whom he have often be in company with both at the baron de la valeire 's and at st germain and have admire for the many extraordinary quality he discover in he : this lead they into a conversation concern that young gentleman and the misfortune which some late news-paper give a account be begin to fall upon the king of sweden after that renew the subject of they mutual affection and du plessis run over the particulars of they acquaintance in italy louisa ask whether the count de bellfleur have ever testify any remorse for the injury he would have offer she and in what manner they have live together in the army to which monsieur du plessis reply that the authority of the prince have prevent he from attempt any open act of violence but that by he manner of behavior it be easy to see he have not forgive the disappointment and he verily believe want only a convenient opportunity to revenge it : but continue he whatever he design be heaven put a stop to the execution of they for in the first skirmish that happen between we and the force of prince eugene this once gay gallant courtier have he head take off by a cannon ball the gentle louisa could not forbear express some concern for the sudden fate of this bad man greatly as she have be affront by he but when she reflect that the same accident might have befall she dear du plessis she be all dissolve in tear they be in this tender communication when dorilaus return lead the countess d'espargne in one hand and mademoiselle de palfoy in the other monsieur du plessis be surprize to meet he sister in a place where he know not she be acquaint and she no less to find he there the occasion of it be this : dorilaus when he leave the lover together go directly to the baron de palfoy 's and related to he and to mademoiselle the whole history of monsieur du plessis and louisa on which they contriv would to make a pleasant scene by engage the countess d'espargne to go with they to dorilaus 's without let she know on what account -- the event answer they wish madam d' espargne rally she brother on find he alone with so beautiful a young lady and mademoiselle charlotta for he inconstancy to he mistress at bolognium : but when the riddle be solve and the countess come to know that the lady leave in the monastery and louisa be the same she no longer condemn a attachment which before have give she so much pain mademoiselle charlotta chide she for the reserve she have maintain to she in this affair especially say she as you be oblige to the conversation you have with madam d'espargne in my apartment that you receive any intelligence of monsieur du plessis or know how to direct you command to he to return that madam be a obligation lie wholly on I say monsieur du plessis and i believe i shall find it very difficult to requite it any more than i shall to deserve my sister 's pardon for so industriously endeavor to conceal from she the secret of my passion and its object louisa tell the lady that she now hope they would excuse the disorder she have be in at the countess 's discourse since they know the motive : -- a good deal of pleasantry pass between this agreeable company and as they be in the midst of it the baron de palfoy who have be hinder from accompany dorilaus when he conduct the lady now join they and tho ' he be considerably older than any there be no less entertaining and good-humoured than the youngest dorilaus have privately order a very magnificent collation which be serve up louisa do the honor of the table with so good a grace that madam d' espargne be charm with she and take a opportunity of ask dorilaus when she might hope the happiness of call so amiable a lady by the name of sister du plessis thank she for the interest she take in he affair and the baron de palfoy add that as the lover want no farther proof how worthy they be of each other he would join in sollicit for a completion of they happiness to which dorilaus reply that he be too well satisfy with he daughter 's conduct not to leave she entirely at she own disposal and as to what relate to fortune and settlement he should be ready to enter into such article as he believe monsieur du plessis would have no reason to complain of the passionate lover at these word cry out that it be louisa 's self alone he be ambitious of possess nor have either that lady or she father any room to look on what he say as a mere compliment because he love have long since wave all the seeming disproportion between they in fine not only at this time but every day almost every hour be louisa as it now depend wholly on herself importune by she lover and the countess d'espargne to render he

she say that as they be bear on the same day they nuptials should be also celebrate at the same time monsieur du plessis be oblige to content himself with this since he could obtain no more and for a time every thing pass smoothly and agreeably on but news after news continually arrive of the king of sweden 's ill success in ukranium render all the noble friend of horatio extremely dissatisfied : -- the public account be too deficient for they information of any particular officer and as there be very few french in the swedish army they could hope for no intelligence of he but from himself which as he omit give they at last conclude he be either kill or take prisoner which last misfortune they look upon as equal with the former : -- the russian barbarity and they manner of treat those whom the chance of war throw into they hand be no secret thro ' all europe and whichever of these accident have happen must be very grievous to a gentleman of dorilaus 's disposition who when unknow he be he son love he with more tenderness than many father do they offspring but now convince not only that he be so but also that he be possess of such amiable quality as might do honor to the most illustrious race have fix a idea in he mind of such a lasting happiness in have he near he that the thought of be deprive of he for ever throw he into a melancholy which not all the friend he have acquire in paris not all the gaiety of that place nor the sweet society of the engaging and dutiful louisa have the power to console so deep be he affliction that monsieur du plessis amorous and impatient as he be have not courage to urge a grant of he own happiness while those who be to bestow it be incapable of share any part of it soon after there arrive a thunder-clap indeed : -- certain intelligence that the once victorious charle be totally overthrow he whole army either cut to piece or take prisoner and himself a fugitive in the grand seignior 's dominion -- dorilaus now not doubt but the worst he fear have come to pass shut himself from all company and refuse the unavailing comfort of those who come to offer it -- the fair eye of louisa be continually drown in tear and the generous du plessis sympathize in all she grief but what become of mademoiselle charlotta de palfoy she tender soul so long accustom to love horatio have not courage to support the shock of lose he -- lose he at a time when she think herself secure of be unite to he for ever -- when he discover birth have render she father 's wish conformable to she own and there want nothing but he presence to render both they family completely bless : -- all that excess of love which modesty have hitherto restrain she from give any public mark of now shew itself in the violence of she grief and she despair -- she make no secret of she softest inclination and give a loose to all the impatience of a ruin love even the haughty baron be melt into tear of compassion and so far from condemn that he attempt all in he power to alleviate she sorrow chap xxvi _ the catastrophe of the whole _ poor horatio release as i have already say from he worse than turkish bondage have now with the companion of he misfortune leave a country where they have suffer so much and have so little to hope that they enlargement seem even to themselves a miracle -- as they part miserable and forlorn thro ' those province where about a year before they have march with so much pomp and force as together with the king of sweden 's name inspire admiration and terror over all those part of the world it fill they with the most poignant anguish and draw tear from those among they least sensible of any tender emotion all this disconsolate company except horatio be swede ' they make the best of they way some to stockholm and other to straelsund -- now leave alone a long journey before he and altogether uncertain what reception he should find at paris either from dorilaus or mademoiselle charlotta he condition be extremely pityable and he stand in need of more fortitude than could be expect from he year to enable he to go thro ' it the nearer he approach pari the greater be he shock at the necessity of appear there in the despicable figure he now make but he courage still get the better and surmount all difficulty if dorilaus think my disobedience to he command a crime too great to merit he forgiveness would he say to himself or charlotta disdain in he misfortune the faithful horatio i have no more to do than to return to poland and seek a honorable death in the service of stanislaus he make he entrance into that opulent city through the most bye-ways he could and conceal himself till towards night in a little cabaret where have soon be inform where dorilaus live he go when it be quite dark to he house though how divide between hope and fear it be easy to imagine he knock at the gate which be open by the porter and he desire to speak with he master be answer with many impertinent question as -- who he come from what he business be and such like interrogatory which the sawciness of servant generally put to person such as this fellow take horatio to be by he appearance but he have no sooner desire he would tell dorilaus that he come from russium and bring intelligence of horatio than he tone of voice and behavior be quite change -- we traveller be now carry into a parlor and entreat to sit down and the late surly porter call hastily for one of the servant bid he with the utmost joy run in and inform he master that here be a person come from russium that could give he news of colonel horatio this a little raise the lately depressed spirit of horatio as it assure he he name be not unknown in that family nor have be mention with indifference he attend but a very little time before he be shew up into dorilaus 's apartment who be just open he mouth to enquire if horatio be yet live and in what condition when he see it be himself surprize and joy render he incapable either of speak to he or hear the apology he be begin to make for have disobey he command : -- but he fall upon he neck and give he a embrace which dissipate all horatio 's fear and leave he no room to doubt if he peace be make no word be exchange between they for a considerable time but -- oh my dear son my ever love horatio on the one side my more than father patron on the other : -- at length the tumultuous rapture of so unexpected a meeting and reception give way to a more peaceful calm -- dorilaus make horatio relate all the particulars have happen to he and when he have end now say he i will reward the sincerity i easily perceive you have make use of in this narrative by acquaint you in my turn with secret you be far from have any notion of and which i believe will compensate for all you suffering and make you own that while you seem to groan under the utmost severity of fortune she be prepare for you all the blessing in she power to give and even more than you ambition aim at but i have first a message to dispatch continue he at my return you shall know all with these word he go out of the room but come back in a moment and after renew he embrace to horatio reveal to he the whole secret of he birth with all have happen to louisa till the time of they happy meeting in pari with what please wonder the soul of horatio be fill at this discovery be much more easy to conceive than describe so i shall leave it to the reader 's imagination to guess what it be he feel and speak on so extraordinary a occasion while he be pour out the transport it occasion in the most grateful thanks to heaven and he new find father louisa enter dorilaus have send to the baron de palfoy 's where he know she be to let she know a messenger from russium be arrive with news of she brother : -- they instantly know each other though it be upward of four year since they be separate and in that time the stature of both considerably increase : -- nothing could exceed the joy of these amiable twin : -- never be felicity more perfect which yet receive addition on horatio 's part when louisa tell he that it be as much as charlotta could do to restrain herself from come with she to hear what account the suppose messenger have bring dorilaus on this immediately send to let she know he son be well and expect in paris the next day for he would not suffer he to appear before she or the baron till a habit be make for he more agreeable to he condition than that he arrive in it be certain that the impatience of a lover would have make horatio gladly wave this ceremony but he would not a second time dispute the command of such a father but wherefore should i delay the attention of my reader who i doubt not but easily perceive by this time how thing will end : so i shall only say that the meeting of horatio and charlotta be such as might be expect from so arduous and constant a affection : that every thing have be settle between the two father at the time they send they joint mandate to call he home there now remain nothing but to celebrate the long desire nuptials which be defer no longer than be requisite for preparation to render the ceremony magnificent the generous du plessis and he beloved louisa be also unite the same day and it would be hard to say which of these wedding afford most satisfaction to the friend on both side or be attend with the most happy consequence to the person concern in they by these example we may learn that to sustain with fortitude and patience whatever ill we be preordain to suffer entitle we to relief while by impatient struggle we should but augment the score and provoke fate to shew we the vanity of all attempt to frustrate its decree _ finis _ end of project gutenberg 's the fortunate foundling by eliza fowler
