respect of which quintius fabius receive the surname of maximus niccolò machiavellus to zanobi buondelmontus and cosimo rucellaus health i send you a gift which if it answer ill the obligation i owe you be at any rate the greatest which niccolò machiavellus have it in he power to offer for in it i have express whatever i have learn or have observe for myself during a long experience and constant study of human affair and since neither you nor any other can expect more at my hand you can not complain if i have not give you more you may indeed lament the poverty of my wit since what i have to say be but poorly say and tax the weakness of my judgment which on many point may have err in its conclusion but grant all this i know not which of we be less beholden to the other : i to you who have force I to write what of myself i never should have write or you to I who have write what can give you no content take this however in the spirit in which all that come from a friend should be take in respect whereof we always look more to the intention of the giver than to the quality of the gift and believe I that in one thing only i find satisfaction namely in know that while in many matter i may have make mistake at least i have not be mistake in choose you before all other as the person to whom i dedicate these discourse both because i seem to myself in do so to have show a little gratitude for kindness receive and at the same time to have depart from the hackneyed custom which lead many author to inscribe they work to some prince and blind by hope of favor or reward to praise he as possess of every virtue whereas with more reason they might reproach he as contaminate with every shameful vice to avoid which error i have choose not those who be but those who from they infinite merit deserve to be prince not such person as have it in they power to load I with honor wealth and preferment but such as though they lack the power have all the will to do so for man if they would judge justly should esteem those who be and not those whose mean enable they to be generous and in like manner those who know how to govern kingdom rather than those who possess the government without such knowledge for historian award higher praise to hiero of syracuse when in a private station than to perseus the macedonian when a king affirm that while the former lack nothing that a prince should have save the name the latter have nothing of the king but the kingdom make the most therefore of this good or this evil as you may esteem it which you have bring upon yourselve and should you persist in the mistake of think my opinion worthy you attention i shall not fail to proceed with the rest of the history in the manner promise in my preface _ farewell _ discourse on the first decade of titus livius book i \* \* \* \* \* preface albeit the jealous temper of mankind ever more disposed to censure than to praise the work of other have constantly make the pursuit of new method and system no less perilous than the search after unknown land and sea nevertheless prompt by that desire which nature have implant in I fearlessly to undertake whatsoever i think offer a common benefit to all i enter on a path which be hitherto untrodden by any though it involve I in trouble and fatigue may yet win I thanks from those who judge my effort in a friendly spirit and although my feeble discernment my slender experience of current affair and imperfect knowledge of ancient event render these effort of mine defective and of no great utility they may at least open the way to some other who with better part and sounder reasoning and judgment shall carry out my design whereby if i gain no credit at all event i ought to incur no blame when i see antiquity hold in such reverence that to omit other instance the mere fragment of some ancient statue be often buy at a great price in order that the purchaser may keep it by he to adorn he house or to have it copy by those who take delight in this art and how these again strive with all they skill to imitate it in they various work and when on the other hand i find those noble labor which history show to have be work on behalf of the monarchy and republic of old time by king captain citizen lawgiver and other who have toil for the good of they country rather admire than follow nay so absolutely renounce by every one that not a trace of that antique worth be now leave among we i can not but at once marvel and grieve at this inconsistency and all the more because i perceive that in civil dispute between citizen and in the bodily disorder into which man fall recourse be always have to the decision and remedy pronounce or prescribe by the ancient for the civil law be no more than the opinion deliver by the ancient jurisconsult which be reduce to a system teach the jurisconsult of we own time how to determine while the healing art be simply the record experience of the old physician on which we modern physician find they practice and yet in give law to a commonwealth in maintain state and govern kingdom in organize army and conduct war in deal with subject nation and in extend a state 's dominion we find no prince no republic no captain and no citizen who resort to the example of the ancient this i persuade myself be due not so much to the feebleness to which the present method of education have bring the world or to the injury which a pervade apathy have work in many province and city of christendom as to the want of a right intelligence of history which render man incapable in read it to extract its true meaning or to relish its flavor whence it happen that by far the greater number of those who read history take pleasure in follow the variety of incident which it present without a think to imitate they judge such imitation to be not only difficult but impossible as though the heaven the sun the element and man himself be no longer the same as they formerly be as regard motion order and power desire to rescue man from this error i have think fit to note down with respect to all those book of titus livius which have escape the malignity of time whatever seem to I essential to a right understanding of ancient and modern affair so that any who shall read these remark of mine may reap from they that profit for the sake of which a knowledge of history be to be seek and although the task be arduous still with the help of those at whose instance i assume the burthen i hope to carry it forward so far that another shall have no long way to go to bring it to its destination chapter i -- _ of the beginning of city in general and in particular of that of rome _ no one who read how the city of rome have its beginning who be its founder and what its ordinance and law will marvel that so much excellence be maintain in it through many age or that it grow afterwards to be so great a empire and first as touch its origin i say that all city have be found either by the people of the country in which they stand or by stranger city have they origin in the former of these two way when the inhabitant of a country find that they can not live securely if they live disperse in many and small society each of they unable whether from its situation or its slender number to stand alone against the attack of its enemy on whose approach there be no time leave to unite for defense without abandon many stronghold and thus become a easy prey to the invader to escape which danger whether of they own motion or at the instance of some of greater authority among they they restrict themselves to dwell together in certain place which they think will be more convenient to live in and easier to defend among many city take they origin in this way be athen and venice the former of which for reason like those just now mention be build by a scatter population under the direction of theseus to escape the war which on the decay of the roman empire daily renew in italy by the arrival of fresh horde of barbarian numerous refugee shelter in certain little island in a corner of the adriatic sea give begin to venice where without any recognize leader to direct they they agree to live together under such law as they think best suit to maintain they and by reason of the prolonged tranquility which they position secure they be protect by the narrow sea and by the circumstance that the tribe who then harass italy have no ship wherewith to molest they they be able from very small beginning to attain to that greatness they now enjoy in the second case namely of a city be found by stranger the settler be either wholly independent or they be control by other as where colony be send forth either by a prince or by a republic to relieve they country of a excessive population or to defend newly acquire territory which it be seek to secure at small cost of this sort many city be settle by the roman and in all part of they dominion it may also happen that such city be found by a prince merely to add to he renown without any intention on he part to dwell there as alexandrium be build by alexander the great city like these not have have they beginning in freedom seldom make such progress as to rank among the chief town of kingdom the city of florence belong to that class of town which have not be independent from the first for whether we ascribe its origin to the soldier of syllum or as some have conjecture to the mountaineer of fiesole -lrb- who embolden by the long peace which prevail throughout the world during the reign of octavianus come down to occupy the plain on the bank of the arno -rrb- in either case it be found under the auspices of rome nor could at first make other progress than be permit by the grace of the sovereign state the origin of city may be say to be independent when a people either by themselves or under some prince be constrain by famine pestilence or war to leave they native land and seek a new habitation settler of this sort either establish themselves in city which they find ready to they hand in the country of which they take possession as do mose or they build new one as do æneas it be in this last case that the merit of a founder and the good fortune of the city found be best see and this good fortune will be more or less remarkable accord to the greater or less capacity of he who give the city its begin the capacity of a founder be know in two way : by he choice of a site or by the law which he frame and since man act either of necessity or from choice and merit may seem greater where choice be more restricted we have to consider whether it may not be well to choose a sterile district as the site of a new city in order that the inhabitant be constrain to industry and less corrupt by ease may live in closer union finding less cause for division in the poverty of they land as be the case in ragusa and in many other city build in similar situation such a choice be certainly the wisest and the most advantageous could man be content to enjoy what be they own without seek to lord it over other but since to be safe they must be strong they be compel avoid these barren district and to plant themselves in more fertile region where the fruitfulness of the soil enable they to increase and multiply they may defend themselves against any who attack they and overthrow any who would withstand they power and as for that languor which the situation might breed care must be have that hardship which the site do not enforce shall be enforce by the law and that the example of those wise nation be imitate who inhabit most fruitful and delightful country and such as be likely to rear a listless and effeminate race unfit for all manly exercise in order to obviate the mischief work by the amenity and relaxing influence of the soil and climate subject all who be to serve as soldier to the severest training whence it come that better soldier be raise in these country than in other by nature rugged and barren such of old be the kingdom of the egyptian which though of all land the most bountiful yet by the severe training which its law enforce produce most valiant soldier who have they name not be lose in antiquity might be think to deserve more praise than alexander the great and many besides whose memory be still fresh in man 's mind and even in recent time any one contemplate the kingdom of the soldan and the military order of the mameluke before they be destroy by selim the grand turk must have see how carefully they train they soldier in every kind of warlike exercise show thereby how much they dread that indolence to which they genial soil and climate might have dispose they unless neutralize by strenuous law i say then that it be a prudent choice to find you city in a fertile region when the effect of that fertility be duly balance by the restraint of the law when alexander the great thought to add to he renown by found a city dinocrate the architect come and show he how he might build it on mount atho which not only offer a strong position but could be handle that the city build there might present a semblance of the human form which would be a thing strange and striking and worthy of so great a monarch but on alexander ask how the inhabitant be to live dinocrate answer that he have not think of that whereupon alexander laugh and leave mount atho as it stand build alexandrium where the fruitfulness of the soil and the vicinity of the nile and the sea might attract many to take up they abode to he therefore who inquire into the origin of rome if he assign its begin to æneas it will seem to be of those city which be found by stranger if to romulus then of those found by the native of the country but in whichever class we place it it will be see to have have its beginning in freedom and not in subjection to another state it will be see too as hereafter shall be note how strict be the discipline which the law institute by romulus numa and its other founder make compulsory upon it so that neither its fertility the proximity of the sea the number of its victory nor the extent of its dominion could for many century corrupt it but on the contrary maintain it replete with such virtue as be never match in any other commonwealth and because the thing do by rome and which titus livius have celebrate be effect at home or abroad by public or by private wisdom i shall begin by treat and note the consequence of those thing do at home in accordance with the public voice which seem most to merit attention and to this object the whole of this first book or first part of my discourse shall be direct chapter ii -- of the various kind of government and to which of they the roman commonwealth belong i forego all discussion concern those city which at the outset have be dependent upon other and shall speak only of those which from they earliest beginning have stand entirely clear of all foreign control be govern from the first as pleased themselves whether as republic or as princedom these as they have have different origin so likewise have have different law and institution for to some at they very first commencement or not long after law have be give by a single legislator and all at one time like those give by lycurgus to the spartan while to other they have be give at different time as need rise or accident determine as in the case of rome that republic indeed may be call happy whose lot have be to have a founder so prudent as to provide for it law under which it can continue to live securely without need to amend they as we find sparta preserve hers for eight hundred year without deterioration and without any dangerous disturbance on the other hand some measure of unhappiness attach to the state which not have yield itself once for all into the hand of a single wise legislator be oblige to recast its institution for itself and of such state by far the most unhappy be that which be furthest remove from a sound system of government by which i mean that its institution lie wholly outside the path which might lead it to a true and perfect end for it be scarcely possible that a state in this position can ever by any chance set itself to rights whereas another whose institution be imperfect if it have make a good beginning and such as admit of its amendment may in the course of event arrive at perfection it be certain however that such state can never be reform without great risk for as a rule man will accept no new law alter the institution of they state unless the necessity for such a change be demonstrate and since this necessity can not arise without danger the state may easily be overthrow before the new order of thing be establish in proof whereof we may instance the republic of florence which be reform in the year 1502 in consequence of the affair of arezzo but be ruin in 1512 in consequence of the affair of prato desire therefore to discuss the nature of the government of rome and to ascertain the accidental circumstance which bring it to its perfection i say as have be say before by many who have write of government that of these there be three form know by the name monarchy aristocracy and democracy and that those who give its institution to a state have recourse to one or other of these three accord as it suit they purpose other and as many have think wiser teacher will have it that there be altogether six form of government three of they utterly bad the other three good in themselves but so readily corrupt that they too be apt to become hurtful the good be the three above name the bad three other dependent upon these and each so like that to which it be related that it be easy to pass imperceptibly from the one to the other for a monarchy readily become a tyranny a aristocracy a oligarchy while a democracy tend to degenerate into anarchy so that if the founder of a state should establish any one of these three form of government he establish it for a short time only since no precaution he may take can prevent it from slide into its contrary by reason of the close resemblance which in this case the virtue bear to the vice these diversity in the form of government spring up among man by chance for in the beginning of the world its inhabitant be few in number for a time live scatter after the fashion of beast but afterwards as they increase and multiply gather themselves into society and the better to protect themselves begin to seek who among they be the strongest and of the highest courage to whom make he they head they tender obedience next arise the knowledge of such thing as be honorable and good as oppose to those which be bad and shameful for observe that when a man wrong he benefactor hatred be universally feel for the one and sympathy for the other and that the ungrateful be blame while those who show gratitude be honor and reflect that the wrong they see do to other might be do to themselves to escape these they resort to make law and fix punishment against any who should transgress they and in this way grow the recognition of justice whence it come that afterwards in choose they ruler man no longer look about for the strongest but for he who be the most prudent and the most just but presently when sovereignty grow to be hereditary and no longer elective hereditary sovereign begin to degenerate from they ancestor and quit worthy course take up the notion that prince have nothing to do but to surpass the rest of the world in sumptuous display and wantonness and whatever else minister to pleasure so that the prince come to be hate and therefore to feel fear and pass from fear to infliction of injury a tyranny soon spring up forthwith there begin movement to overthrow the prince and plot and conspiracy against he undertake not by those who be weak or afraid for themselves but by such as be conspicuous for they birth courage wealth and station could not tolerate the shameful life of the tyrant the multitude follow the lead of these powerful man take up arm against the prince and he be get rid of obey these other as they liberator who on they part hold in hatred the name of sole ruler form themselves into a government and at first while the recollection of past tyranny be still fresh observe the law they themselves make and postpone personal advantage to the common welfare administer affair both publicly and privately with the utmost diligence and zeal but this government pass afterwards to they descendant who never have be teach in the school of adversity know nothing of the vicissitude of fortune these not choose to rest content with mere civil equality but abandon themselves to avarice ambition and lust convert without respect to civil rights what have be a government of the best into a government of the few and so very soon meet with the same fate as the tyrant for the multitude loathe its ruler lend itself to any who venture in whatever way to attack they when some one man speedily arise who with the aid of the people overthrow they but the recollection of the tyrant and of the wrong suffer at he hand be still fresh in the mind of the people who therefore feel no desire to restore the monarchy they have recourse to a popular government which they establish on such a footing that neither king nor noble have any place in it and because all government inspire respect at the first this government also last for a while but not for long and seldom after the generation which bring it into existence have die out for suddenly liberty pass into license wherein neither private worth nor public authority be respect but every one living as he like a thousand wrong be do daily whereupon whether drive by necessity or on the suggestion of some wiser man among they and to escape anarchy the people revert to a monarchy from which step by step in the manner and for the cause already assign they come round once more to license for this be the circle revolve within which all state be and have be govern although in the same state the same form of government rarely repeat themselves because hardly any state can have such vitality as to pass through such a cycle more than once and still together for it may be expect that in some sea of disaster when a state must always be want prudent counsel and in strength it will become subject to some neighbouring and better-governed state though assume this not to happen it might well pass for a indefinite period from one of these form of government to another i say then that all these six form of government be pernicious -- the three good kind from they brief duration the three bad from they inherent badness wise legislator therefore know these defect and avoid each of these form in its simplicity have make choice of a form which share in the quality of all the first three and which they judge to be more stable and lasting than any of these separately for where we have a monarchy a aristocracy and a democracy exist together in the same city each of the three serve as a check upon the other among those who have earn special praise by devise a constitution of this nature be lycurgus who so frame the law of sparta as to assign they proper function to king noble and common and in this way establish a government which to he great glory and to the peace and tranquility of he country last for more than eight hundred year the contrary however happen in the case of solon who by the turn he give to the institution of athen create there a purely democratic government of such brief duration that i himself live to witness the beginning of the despotism of pisistratus and although forty year later the heir of pisistratus be drive out and athen recover she freedom nevertheless because she revert to the same form government as have be establish by solon she could maintain it for only a hundred year more for though to preserve it many ordinance be pass for repress the ambition of the great and the turbulence of the people against which solon have not provide still since neither the monarchic nor the aristocratic element be give a place in she constitution athen as compare with sparta have but a short life but let we now turn to rome which city although she have no lycurgus to give she from the first such a constitution as would preserve she long in freedom through a series of accident cause by the contest between the common and the senate obtain by chance what the foresight of she founder fail to provide so that fortune if she bestow not she first favor on rome bestow she second because although the original institution of this city be defective still they lay not outside the true path which could bring they to perfection for romulus and the other king make many and good law and such as be not incompatible with freedom but because they seek to find a kingdom and not a commonwealth when the city become free many thing be find want which in the interest of liberty it be necessary to supply since these king have not supply they and although the king of rome lose they sovereignty in the manner and for the cause mention above nevertheless those who drive they out by at once create two consul to take they place preserve in rome the regal authority while banish from it the regal throne so that as both senate and consul be include in that republic it in fact possess two of the element above enumerate to wit the monarchic and the aristocratic it then only remain to assign its place to the popular element and the roman noble grow insolent from cause which shall be notice hereafter the common against they when not to lose the whole of they power they be force to concede a share to the people while with the share which remain the senate and consul retain so much authority that they still hold they own place in the republic in this way the tribune of the people come to be create after whose creation the stability of the state be much augmented since each the three form of government have now its due influence allow it and such be the good fortune of rome that although she government pass from the king to the noble and from these to the people by the step and for the reason notice above still the entire authority of the kingly element be not sacrifice to strengthen the authority of the noble nor be the noble divest of they authority to bestow it on the common but three blend together make up a perfect state which perfection as shall be fully show in the next two chapter be reach through the dissension of the common and the senate chapter iii -- of the accident which lead in rome to the creation of tribune of the people whereby the republic be make more perfect they who lay the foundation of a state and furnish it with law must as be show by all who have treat of civil government and by example of which history be full assume that ` all man be bad and will always when they have free field give loose to they evil inclination and that if these for a while remain hidden it be owe to some secret cause which from we have no contrary experience we do not recognize at once but which be afterwards reveal by time of whom we speak as the father of all truth in rome after the expulsion of the tarquin it seem as though the closest union prevail between the senate and the common and that the noble lay aside they natural arrogance have learn so to sympathize with the people as to have become supportable by all even of the humblest rank this dissimulation remain undetected and its cause conceal while the tarquin live for the noble dread the tarquin and fear that the people if they use they ill might take part against they treat they with kindness but no sooner be the tarquin get rid of and the noble thus relieve of they fear when they begin to spit forth against the common all the venom which before they have keep in they breast offend and insulting they in every way they could confirm what i have observe already that man never behave well unless compel and that whenever they be free to act as they please and be under no restraint everything fall at once into confusion and disorder wherefore it have be say that as poverty and hunger be need to make man industrious so law be need to make they good when we do well without law law be not need but when good custom be absent law be at once require on the extinction of the tarquin therefore the dread of whom have keep the noble in check some new safeguard have to be contrived which should effect the same result as have be effect by the tarquin while they live accordingly after much uproar and confusion and much danger of violence ensue between the common and the noble to insure the safety of the former tribune be create and be invest with such station and authority as always afterwards enable they to stand between the people and the senate and to resist the insolence of the nobles chapter iv -- that the dissension between the senate and common of rome make rome free and powerful touch those tumult which prevail in rome from the extinction of the tarquin to the creation of the tribune the discussion of which i have no wish to avoid and as to certain other matter of a like nature i desire to say something in opposition to the opinion of many who assert that rome be a turbulent city and have fall into utter disorder that have not she good fortune and military prowess make amends for other defect she would have be inferior to every other republic i can not indeed deny that the good fortune and the army of rome be the cause of she empire yet it certainly seem to I that those hold this opinion fail to perceive that in a state where there be good soldier there must be good order and generally speak good fortune and look to the other circumstance of this city i affirm that those who condemn these dissension between the noble and the common condemn what be the prime cause of rome become free and give more heed to the tumult and uproar wherewith these dissension be attend than to the good result which follow from they not reflect that while in every republic there be two conflict faction that of the people and that of the noble it be in this conflict that all law favourable to freedom have they origin as may readily be see to have be the case in rome for from the time of the tarquin to that of the gracchus a period of over three hundred year the tumult in rome seldom give occasion to punishment by exile and very seldom to bloodsh so that we can not truly declare those tumult to have be disastrous or that republic to have be disorderly which during all that time on account of she internal broil banish no more than eight or ten of she citizen put very few to death and rarely inflict money penalty nor can we reasonably pronounce that city ill-governed wherein we find so many instance of virtue for virtuous action have they origin in right training right training in wise law and wise law in these very tumult which many would thoughtlessly condemn for he who look well to the result of these tumult will find that they do not lead to banishment nor to violence hurtful to the common good but to law and ordinance beneficial to the public liberty and should any object that the behavior of the roman be extravagant and outrageous that for the assemble people to be hear shout against the senate the senate against the people for the whole common to be see rush wildly through the street close they shop and quit the town be thing which might well affright he even who only read of they it may be answer that the inhabitant of all city more especially of city which seek to make use of the people in matter of importance have they own way of give expression to they wish among which the city of rome have the custom that when its people seek to have a law pass they follow one or another of those course mention above or else refuse to be enrol as soldier when to pacify they something of they demand have to be concede but the demand of a free people be hurtful to freedom since they originate either in be oppress or in the fear that they be about to be so when this fear be groundless it find its remedy in public meeting wherein some worthy person may come forward and show the people by argument that they be deceive themselves for though they be ignorant the people be not therefore as cicero say incapable of be teach the truth but be readily convince when it be tell they by one in whose honesty they can trust we should therefore be careful how we censure the government of rome and should reflect that all the great result effect by that republic could not have come about without good cause and if the popular tumult lead the creation of the tribune they merit all praise since these magistrate not only give its due influence to the popular voice in the government but also act as the guardian of roman freedom as shall be clearly show in the follow chapter chapter v -- _ whether the guardianship of public freedom be safer in the hand of the common or of the noble and whether those who seek to acquire power or they who seek to maintain it be the greater cause of commotion _ of the provision make by wise founder of republic one of the most necessary be for the creation of a guardianship of liberty for accord as this be place in good or bad hand the freedom of the state will be more or less lasting and because in every republic we find the two party of noble and common the question arise to which of these two this guardianship can most safely be entrust among the lacedæmonians of old as now with the venetian it be place in the hand of the noble but with the roman it be vest in the common we have therefore to determine which of these state make the wiser choice if we look to reason something be to be say on both side of the question though be we to look to result we should have to pronounce in favor of the noble inasmuch as the liberty of sparta and venice have have a longer life than that of rome as touching reason it may be plead for the roman method that they be most fit to have charge of a thing who least desire to pervert it to they own end and doubtless if we examine the aim which the noble and the common respectively set before they we shall find in the former a great desire to dominate in the latter merely a desire not to be dominate over and hence a greater attachment to freedom since they have less to gain than the other by destroy it wherefore when the common be put forward as the defender of liberty they may be expect to take better care of it and as they have no desire to tamper with it themselves to be less apt to suffer other to do so on the other hand he who defend the method follow by the spartan and venetian may urge that by confide this guardianship to the noble two desirable end be serve : first that from be allow to retain in they own hand a weapon which make they the stronger party in the state the ambition of this class be more fully satisfied and second that a authority be withdraw from the unstable multitude which as use by they be likely to lead to endless dispute and tumult and to drive the noble into dangerous and desperate course in instance whereof might be cite the case of rome itself wherein the tribune of the people be vest with this authority not content to have one consul a plebeian insist on have both and afterwards lay claim to the censorship the prætorship and all the other magistracy in the city nor be this enough for they but carry away by the same factious spirit they begin after a time to pay court to such man as they think able to attack the nobility and so give occasion to the rise of marius and the overthrow of rome wherefore one who weigh both side of the question well might hesitate which party he should choose as the guardian of public liberty be uncertain which class be more mischievous in a commonwealth that which would acquire what it have not or that which would keep the authority which it have already but on the whole on a careful balance of argument we may sum up thus : -- either we have to deal with a republic eager like rome to extend its power or with one content merely to maintain itself in the former case it be necessary to do in all thing as rome do in the latter for the reason and in the manner to be show in the follow chapter we may imitate venice and sparta but revert to the question which class of citizen be more mischievous in a republic those who seek to acquire or those who fear to lose what they have acquire already i note that when marcus menenius and marcus fulvius both of they man of plebeian birth be make the one dictator the other master of the knight that they might inquire into certain plot against rome contrived in capua they have at the same time authority give they by the people to investigate whether in rome itself irregular and corrupt practice have be use to obtain the consulship and other honor of the city the noble suspect that the power thus confer be to be turn against they everywhere give out that if honor have be seek by any by irregular and unworthy mean it be not by they but by the plebeian who with neither birth nor merit to recommend they have need to resort to corruption and more particularly they accuse the dictator himself and so tell be the effect of these charge that menenius after harangue the people and complain to they of the calumny circulate against he lay down he dictatorship and submit himself to whatever judgment might be pass upon he when he cause come to be try he be acquit but at the hearing it be much debate whether he who would retain power or he who would acquire it be the more dangerous citizen the desire of both be likely to lead to the greatest disorder nevertheless i believe that as a rule disorder be more commonly occasion by those seek to preserve power because in they the fear of loss breed the same passion as be feel by those seek to acquire since man never think they hold what they have securely unless when they be gain something new from other it be also to be say that they position enable they to operate change with less effort and greater efficacy further it may be add that they corrupt and insolent behavior inflame the mind of those who have nothing with the desire to have either for the sake of punish they adversary by despoil they or to obtain for themselves a share of those riches and honor which they see the other abuse chapter vi -- _ whether it be possible in rome to contrive such a government as would have compose the difference between the common and the senate _ i have speak above of the effect produce in rome by the controversy between the common and the senate now as these last down to the time of the gracchus when they bring about the overthrow of freedom some may think it matter for regret that rome should not have achieve the great thing she do without be tear by such dispute wherefore it seem to I worth while to consider whether the government of rome could ever have be constitute in such a way as to prevent like controversy in make this inquiry we must first look to those republic which have enjoy freedom for a great while undisturbed by any violent contention or tumult and see what they government be and whether it would have be possible to introduce it into rome of such republic we have a example in ancient time in sparta in modern time in venice of both which state i have already make mention sparta create for herself a government consist of a king and a limited senate venice have make no distinction in the title of she ruler all qualify to take part in she government be class under the one designation of gentleman a arrangement due rather to chance than to the foresight of those who give this state its constitution for many person from cause already notice seek shelter on these rock on which venice now stand after they have so multiply that if they be to continue to live together it become necessary for they to frame law establish a form of government and assemble often in they council to consult for the interest of they city when it seem to they that they number be sufficient for political existence they close the entrance to civil rights against all who come afterwards to live there not allow they to take any part in the management of affair and when in course of time there come to be many citizen exclude from the government to add to the importance of the govern body they name these gentleman -lrb- _ gentiluominus _ -rrb- the other plebeian -lrb- _ popolanus _ -rrb- and this distinction could grow up and maintain itself without cause disturbance for as at the time of its origin whosoever then live in venice be make one of the govern body none have reason to complain while those who come to live there afterwards find the government in a complete form have neither ground nor opportunity to object no ground because nothing be take from they and no opportunity because those in authority keep they under control and never employ they in affair in which they could acquire importance besides which they who come later to dwell in venice be not so numerous as to destroy all proportion between the governor and the govern the number of the gentleman be as great as or greater than that of the plebeian for these reason therefore it be possible for venice to make she constitution what it be and to maintain it without division sparta again be govern as i have say by a king and a limited senate be able to maintain herself for the long period she do because from the country be thinly inhabit and further influx of population forbid and from the law of lycurgus -lrb- the observance whereof remove all ground of disturbance -rrb- be hold in high esteem the citizen be able to continue long in unity for lycurgus have by he law establish in sparta great equality as to property but less equality as to rank there prevail there a equal poverty and the common be less ambitious because the office of the state which be hold to they exclusion be confine to a few and because the noble never by harsh treatment arouse in they any desire to usurp these office and this be due to the spartan king who be appoint to that dignity for life and place in the midst of this nobility have no stronger support to they authority than in defend the people against injustice whence it result that as the people neither fear nor covet the power which they do not possess the conflict which might have arise between they and the noble be escape together with the cause which would have lead to they and in this way they be able to live long unite but of this unity in sparta there be two chief cause : one the fewness of its inhabitant which allow of they be govern by a few the other that by deny foreigner admission into they country the people have less occasion to become corrupted and never so increase in number as to prove troublesome to they few ruler weigh all which circumstance we see that to have keep rome in the same tranquility wherein these republic be keep one of two course must have be follow by she legislator for either like the venetian they must have refrain from employ the common in war or else like the spartan they must have close they country to foreigner whereas in both particulars they do the opposite arm the common and increase they number and thus afford endless occasion for disorder and have the roman commonwealth grow to be more tranquil this inconvenience would have result that it must at the same time have grow weaker since the road would have be close to that greatness to which it come for in remove the cause of she tumult rome must have interfere with the cause of she growth and he who look carefully into the matter will find that in all human affair we can not rid ourselves of one inconvenience without run into another so that if you would have you people numerous and warlike to the end that with they aid you may establish a great empire you will have they of such a sort as you can not afterwards control at you pleasure while should you keep they few and unwarlike to the end that you may govern they easily you will be unable should you extend you dominion to preserve they and will become so contemptible as to be the prey of any who attack you for which reason in all we deliberation we ought to consider where we be likely to encounter least inconvenience and accept that as the course to be prefer since we shall never find any line of action entirely free from disadvantage rome might therefore follow the example of sparta have create a king for life and a senate of limited number but desire to become a great empire she could not like sparta have restrict the number of she citizen so that to have create a king for life and a limited senate have be of little service to she be any one therefore about to find a wholly new republic he would have to consider whether he desire it to increase as rome do in territory and dominion or to continue within narrow limit in the former case he would have to shape its constitution as nearly as possible on the pattern of the roman leave room for dissension and popular tumult for without a great and warlike population no republic can ever increase or increase maintain itself in the second case he might give he republic a constitution like that of venice or sparta but since extension be the ruin of such republic the legislator would have to provide in every possible way against the state which he have found make any addition to its territory for these when superimpose upon a feeble republic be sure to be fatal to it : as we see to have be the case with sparta and venice the former of which after subjugate nearly all greece on sustain a trifling reverse betray the insufficiency of she foundation for when after the revolt of thebe under pelopida other city also rebel the spartan kingdom be utterly overthrow venice in like manner after gain possession of a great portion of italy -lrb- most of it not by she arm but by she wealth and subtlety -rrb- when she strength be put to the proof lose all in one pitched battle i can well believe then that to find a republic which shall long endure the best plan may be to give it internal institution like those of sparta or venice place it in a naturally strong situation and so fortify it that none can expect to get the better of it easily yet at the same time not make it so great as to be formidable to its neighbor since by take these precaution it might long enjoy its independence for there be two cause which lead to war be make against a republic one you desire to be its master the other the fear lest it should master you both of which danger the precaution indicate will go far to remove for if as we be to assume this republic be well prepare for defense and consequently difficult of attack it will seldom or never happen that any one will form the design to attack it and while it keep within its own boundary and be see from experience not to be influence by ambition no one will be lead out of fear for himself to make war upon it more particularly when its law and constitution forbid its extension and be it possible to maintain thing in this equilibrium i veritably believe that herein would be find the true form of political life and the true tranquility of a republic but all human affair be in movement and incapable of remain as they be they must either rise or fall and to many conclusion to which we be not lead by reason we be bring by necessity so that when we have give institution to a state on the footing that it be to maintain itself without enlargement should necessity require its enlargement its foundation will be cut from below it and its downfall quickly ensue on the other hand be a republic so favor by heaven as to lie under no necessity of make war the result of this ease would be to make it effeminate and divide which two evil together and each by itself would insure its ruin and since it be impossible as i believe to bring about a equilibrium or to adhere strictly to the mean path we must in arrange we republic consider what be the more honorable course for it to take and so contrive that even if necessity compel its enlargement it may be able to keep what it gain but return to the point first raise i believe it necessary for we to follow the method of the roman and not that of the other republic for i know of no middle way we must consequently put up with those dissension which arise between common and senate look on they as evil which can not be escape if we would arrive at the greatness of rome in connection with the argument here use to prove that the authority of the tribune be essential in rome to the guardianship of freedom we may naturally go on to show what advantage result to a republic from the power of impeachment which together with other be confer upon the tribune a subject to be notice in the follow chapter chapter vii -- _ that to preserve liberty in a state there must exist the right to accuse _ to those set forward in a commonwealth as guardian of public freedom no more useful or necessary authority can be give than the power to accuse either before the people or before some council or tribunal those citizen who in any way have offend against the liberty of they country a law of this kind have two effect most beneficial to a state : _ first _ that the citizen from fear of be accuse do not engage in attempt hurtful to the state or do so be put down at once and without respect of person : and _ next _ that a vent be give for the escape of all those evil humor which from whatever cause gather in city against particular citizen for unless a outlet be duly provide for these by the law they flow into irregular channel and overwhelm the state there be nothing therefore which contribute so much to the stability and permanence of a state as to take care that the fermentation of these disturbing humor be supply by operation of law with a recognize outlet this might be show by many example but by none so clearly as by that of coriolanus relate by livius where he tell we that at a time when the roman noble be angry with the plebeian -lrb- think that the appointment of tribune for they protection have make they too powerful -rrb- it happen that rome be visit by a grievous famine to meet which the senate send to sicily for corn but coriolanus hate the common seek to persuade the senate that now be the time to punish they and to deprive they of the authority which they have usurp to the prejudice of the noble by withhold the distribution of corn and so suffer they to perish of hunger which advice of he come to the ear of the people kindle they to such fury against he that they would have slay he as he leave the senate house have not the tribune cite he to appear and answer before they to a formal charge in respect of this incident i repeat what i have just now say how useful and necessary it be for republic to provide by they law a channel by which the displeasure of the multitude against a single citizen may find a vent for when none such be regularly provide recourse will be have to irregular channel and these will assuredly lead to much worse result for when a citizen be bear down by the operation or the ordinary law even though he be wrong little or no disturbance be occasion to the state : the injury he suffer not be work by private violence nor by foreign force which be the cause of the overthrow of free institution but by public authority and in accordance with public ordinance which have definite limit set they be not likely to pass beyond these so as to endanger the commonwealth for proof of which i be content to rest on this old example of coriolanus since all may see what a disaster it would have be for rome have he be violently put to death by the people for as between citizen and citizen a wrong would have be do afford ground for fear fear would have seek defense defense have lead to faction faction to division in the state and these to its ruin but the matter be take up by those whose office it be to deal with it all the evil which must have follow have it be leave in private hand be escape in florence on the other hand and in we own day we have see what violent commotion follow when the people can not show they displeasure against particular citizen in a form recognize by the law in the instance of francesco valorus at one time look upon as the foremost citizen of we republic but many think he ambitious and likely from he high spirit and daring to overstep the limit of civil freedom and there be no way to oppose he save by set up a adverse faction the result be that apprehend irregular attack he seek to gain partisan for he support while he opponent on they side have no course open to they of which the law approve resorted to course of which the law do not approve and at last to open violence and as he influence have to be attack by unlawful method these be attend by injury not to he only but to many other noble citizen whereas could he have be meet by constitutional restraint he power might have be break without injury to any save himself i might also cite from we florentine history the fall of piero soderinus which have no other cause than there not be in we republic any law under which powerful and ambitious citizen can be impeach for to form a tribunal by which a powerful citizen be to be try eight judge only be not enough the judge must be numerous because a few will always do the will of a few but have there be proper method for obtain redress either the people would have impeach piero if he be guilty and thus have give vent to they displeasure without call in the spanish army or if he be innocent would not have venture through fear of be accuse themselves to have take proceedings against he so that in either case the bitter spirit which be the cause of all the disorder would have have a end wherefore when we find one of the party in a state call in a foreign power we may safely conclude that it be because the defective law of that state provide no escape for those malignant humor which be natural to man which can best be do by arrange for a impeachment before a sufficient number of judge and by give countenance to this procedure this be so well contrived in rome that in spite of the perpetual struggle maintain between the common and the senate neither the senate nor the common nor any single citizen ever seek redress at the hand of a foreign power for have a remedy at home there be no need to seek one abroad although the example above cite be proof sufficient of what i affirm i desire to adduce one other record by titus livius in he history where he relate that a sister of arun have be violate by a lucumo of clusium the chief of the etruscan town arun be unable from the interest of she ravisher to avenge she betook himself to the gaul who rule in the province we now name lombardy and besought they to come with a armed force to clusium show they how with advantage to themselves they might avenge he wrong now have arun see that he could have have redress through the law of he country he never would have resort to these barbarian for help but as the right to accuse be beneficial in a republic so calumny on the other hand be useless and hurtful as in the follow chapter i shall proceed to show chapter viii -- _ that calumny be as hurtful in a commonwealth as the power to accuse be useful _ such be the service render to rome by furius camillus in rescue she from the oppression of the gaul that no roman however high he degree or station hold it derogatory to yield place to he save only manlius capitolinus who could not brook such glory and distinction be give to another for he think that in save the capitol he have himself do as much as camillus to preserve rome and that in respect of he other warlike achievement he be no whit behind he so that burst with jealousy and unable to remain at rest by reason of the other 's renown and see no way to sow discord among the father he set himself to spread abroad sinister report among the common throw out among other charge that the treasure collect to be give to the gaul but which afterwards be withhold have be embezzle by certain citizen and if recover might be turn to public use in relieve the people from tax or from private debt these assertion so prevail with the common that they begin to hold meeting and to raise what tumult they like throughout the city but this displease the senate and the matter appear to they grave and dangerous they appoint a dictator to inquire into it and to restrain the attack of manlius the dictator forthwith cause manlius to be cite before he and these two be thus bring face to face in the presence of the whole city the dictator surround by the noble and manlius by the common the latter be desire to say with whom the treasure of which he have speak be to be find since the senate be as anxious to know this as the common make no direct reply but answer evasively that it be needless to tell they what they already know whereupon the dictator order he to prison in this passage we be teach how hateful a thing be calumny in all free state as indeed in every society and how we must neglect no means which may serve to check it and there can be no more effectual means for check calumny than by afford ample facility for impeachment which be as useful in a commonwealth as the other be pernicious and between they there be this difference that calumny need neither witness nor circumstantial proof to establish it so that any man may be calumniate by any other but not impeach since impeachment demand that there be substantive charge make and trustworthy evidence to support they again it be before the magistrate the people or the court of justice that man be impeach but in the street and market place that they be calumniate calumny therefore be most rife in that state wherein impeachment be least practice and the law least favor it for which reason the legislator should so shape the law of he state that it shall be possible therein to impeach any of its citizen without fear or favor and after duly provide for this should visit calumniator with the sharpest punishment those punish will have no cause to complain since it be in they power to have impeach openly where they have secretly calumniate where this be not see to grave disorder will always ensue for calumny sting without disable and those who be sting be more move by hatred of they detractor than by fear of the thing they say against they seek revenge this matter as we have say be well arrange for in rome but have always be badly regulate in we city of florence and as the roman ordinance with regard to it be productive of much good so the want of they in florence have breed much mischief for any one read the history of we city may perceive how many calumny have at all time be aim against those of its citizen who have take a lead part in its affair thus of one it would be say that he have plunder the public treasury of another that he have fail in some enterprise because he have be bribe of a third that this or the other disaster have originate in he ambition hence hatred spring up on every side and hatred grow to division these lead to faction and these again to ruin but have there exist in florence some procedure whereby citizen might have be impeach and calumniator punish numberless disorder which have take there would have be prevent for citizen who be impeach whether condemn or acquit would have have no power to injure the state and they would have be impeach far seldomer than they have be calumniate for calumny as i have say already be a easier matter than impeachment some indeed have make use of calumny as a means for raise themselves to power and have find they advantage in traduce eminent citizen who withstand they design for by take the part of the people and confirm they in they ill-opinion of these great man they make they they friend of this though i could give many instance i shall content myself with one at the siege of lucca the florentine army be command by messer giovannus guicciardinus as its commissary through whose bad generalship or ill-fortune the town be not take but whatever the cause of this failure messer giovannus have the blame and the rumor run that he have be bribe by the people of lucca which calumny be foster by he enemy bring messer giovannus to very verge of despair and though to clear himself he would willingly have give himself up to the captain of justice he find he could not there be no provision in the law of the republic which allow of he do so hence arise the bitterest hostility between the friend of messer giovannus who be mostly of the old nobility -lrb- _ grandus _ -rrb- and those who seek to reform the government of florence and from this and the like cause the affair grow to such dimension as to bring about the downfall of we republic manlius capitolinus then be a calumniator not a accuser and in they treatment of he the roman show how calumniator should be deal with by which i mean that they should be force to become accuser and if they accusation be prove true should be reward or at least not punish but if prove false should be punish as manlius be chapter ix -- _ that to give new institution to a commonwealth or to reconstruct old institution on a entirely new basis must be the work of one man _ it may perhaps be think that i should not have get so far into the history of rome without some mention of those who give that city its institution and say something of these institution themselves so far as they relate to religion and war as i have no wish to keep those who would know my view on these matter in suspense i say at once that to many it might seem of evil omen that the founder of a civil government like romulus should first have slay he brother and afterwards have consent to the death of titus tatius the sabine whom he have choose to be he colleague in the kingship since he countryman if move by ambition and lust of power to inflict like injury on any who oppose they design might plead the example of they prince this view would be a reasonable one be we to disregard the object which lead romulus to put those man to death but we must take it as a rule to which there be very few if any exception that no commonwealth or kingdom ever have salutary institution give it from the first or have its institution recast in a entirely new mould unless by a single person on the contrary it must be from one man that it receive its institution at first and upon one man that all similar reconstruction must depend for this reason the wise founder of a commonwealth who seek to benefit not himself only or the line of he descendant but he state and country must endeavor to acquire a absolute and undivided authority and none who be wise will ever blame any action however extraordinary and irregular which serve to lay the foundation of a kingdom or to establish a republic for although the act condemn the doer the end may justify he and when as in the case of romulus the end be good it will always excuse the means since it be he who do violence with intent to injure not he who do it with the design to secure tranquility who merit blame such a person ought however to be so prudent and moderate as to avoid transmit the absolute authority he acquire as a inheritance to another for as man be by nature more prone to evil than to good a successor may turn to ambitious end the power which he predecessor have use to promote worthy end moreover though it be one man that must give a state its institution once give they be not so likely to last long rest for support on the shoulder of one man only as when entrust to the care of many and when it be the business of many to maintain they for though the multitude be unfit to set a state in order since they can not by reason of the division which prevail among they agree wherein the true well-being of the state lie yet when they have once be teach the truth they never will consent to abandon it and that romulus though he put he brother to death be yet of those who be to be pardon since what he do be do for the common good and not from personal ambition be show by he at once create a senate with whom he take counsel and in accordance with whose voice he determine and whosoever shall well examine the authority which romulus reserve to himself will find that he reserve nothing beyond the command of the army when war be resolve on and the right to assemble the senate this be see later on rome become free by the expulsion of the tarquin when the roman alter none of they ancient institution save in appoint two consul for a year instead of a king for life for this prove that all the original institution of that city be more in conformity with a free and constitutional government than with a absolute and despotic one in support of what have be say above i might cite innumerable instance as of mose lycurgus solon and other founder of kingdom and commonwealth who from the full power give they be enable to shape they law to the public advantage but pass over these example as of common notoriety i take one not indeed so famous but which merit the attention of all who desire to frame wise law agis king of sparta desire to bring back he countryman to those limit within which the law of lycurgus have hold they because he think that from have somewhat deviate from they he city have lose much of its ancient virtue and consequently much of its strength and power be at the very outset of he attempt slay by the spartan ephorus as one who seek to make himself a tyrant but cleomene come after he in the kingdom and on read the note and writings which he find of agi wherein he design and intention be explain be stir by the same desire perceive that he could not confer this benefit on he country unless he obtain sole power for he see that the ambition of other make it impossible for he to do what be useful for many against the will of a few wherefore finding fit occasion he cause the ephorus and all other likely to throw obstacle in he way to be put to death after which he completely renew the law of lycurgus and the result of he measure would have be to give fresh life to sparta and to gain for himself a renown not inferior to that of lycurgus have it not be for the power of the macedonian and the weakness of the other greek state for while engage with these reform he be attack by the macedonian and be by himself no match for they and have none to whom he could turn for help he be overpower and he plan though wise and praiseworthy be never bring to perfection all which circumstance consider i conclude that he who give new institution to a state must stand alone and that for the death of remus and tatius romulus be to be excuse rather than blame chapter x -- _ that in proportion as the founder of a kingdom or commonwealth merit praise he who found a tyranny deserve blame _ of all who be praise they be praise the most who be the author and founder of religion after whom come the founder of kingdom and commonwealth next to these they have the greatest name who as commander of army have add to they own dominion or those of they country after these again be rank man of letter who be of various shades of merit be celebrated each in he degree to all other whose number be infinite be ascribe that measure of praise to which he profession or occupation entitle he and conversely all who contribute to the overthrow of religion or to the ruin of kingdom and commonwealth all who be foe to letter and to the art which confer honor and benefit on the human race -lrb- among whom i reckon the impious the cruel the ignorant the indolent the base and the worthless -rrb- be hold in infamy and detestation no one whether he be wise or foolish bad or good if ask to choose between these two kind of man will ever be find to withhold praise from what deserve praise or blame from what be to be blame and yet almost all deceive by a false good and a false glory allow themselves either ignorantly or wilfully to follow in the footstep such as deserve blame rather than praise and have it in they power to establish to they lasting renown a commonwealth or kingdom turn aside to create a tyranny without a thought how much they thereby lose in name fame security tranquility and peace of mind and in name how much infamy scorn danger and disquiet they be but be they to read history and turn to profit the lesson of the past it seem impossible that those live in a republic as private citizen should not prefer they native city to play the part of scipio rather of cæsar or that those who by good fortune or merit have rise to be ruler should not seek rather to resemble agesilaus timoleon and dion than to nabis phalari and dionysius since they would see how the latter be load with infamy while the former have be extol beyond bound they would see too how timoleon and other like he have as great authority in they country as dionysius or phalari in theirs while enjoy far greater security nor let any one finding cæsar celebrate by a crowd of writer be mislead by he glory for those who praise he have be corrupt by good fortune and overawe by the greatness of that empire which be govern in he name would not suffer any to speak they mind openly concern he but let he who desire to know how historian would have write of cæsar have they be free to declare they thought mark what they say of catiline than whom cæsar be more hateful in proportion as he who do be more to be condemn than he who only desire to do evil let he see also what praise they lavish upon brutus because be unable out of respect for he power to reproach cæsar they magnify he enemy and if he who have become prince in any state will but reflect how after rome be make a empire far greater praise be earn those emperor who live within the law and worthily than by those who live in the contrary way he will see that titus nerva trajan hadrian antoninus and marcus have no need of prætorian cohort or of countless legion to guard they but be defend by they own good life the good-will of they subject and the attachment of the senate in like manner he will perceive in the case of caligulum nero vitellius and ever so many more of those evil emperor that all the army of the east and of the west be of no avail to protect they from the enemy whom they bad and depraved life raise up against they and be the history of these emperor rightly study it would be a sufficient lesson to any prince how to distinguish the path which lead to honor and safety from those which end in shame and insecurity for of the twenty-six emperor from cæsar to maximinus sixteen come to a violent ten only to a natural death and though one or two of those who die by violence may have be good prince as galba or pertinax they meet they fate in consequence of that corruption which they predecessor have leave behind in the army and if among those who die a natural death there be find some bad emperor like severus it be to be ascribe to they signal good fortune and to they great ability advantage seldom find unite in the same man from the study this history we may also learn how a good government be to be establish for while all the emperor who succeed to the throne by birth except titus be bad all be good who succeed by adoption as in the case of the five from nerva to marcus but so soon as the empire fall once more to the heir by birth its ruin recommence let a prince therefore look to that period which extend from nerva to marcus and contrast it with that which go before and that which come after and then let he say in which of they he would wish to have be bear or to have reign for during these time in which good man govern he will see the prince secure in the midst of happy subject and the whole world fill with peace and justice he will find the senate maintain its authority the magistrate enjoy they honor rich citizen they wealth rank and merit hold in respect ease and content everywhere prevail rancor licence corruption and ambition everywhere quench and that golden age restore in which every one might hold and support what opinion he please he will see in short the world triumph the sovereign honor and revere the people animated with love and rejoice in they security but should he turn to examine the time of the other emperor he will find they waste by battle tear by sedition cruel alike in war and peace many prince perish by the sword many war foreign and domestic italy overwhelm with unheard-of disaster she town destroy and plunder rome burn the capitol raze to the ground by roman citizen the ancient temple desolate the ceremony of religion corrupt the city rank with adultery the sea cover with exile and the island polluted with blood he will see outrage follow outrage rank riches honor and above all virtue imputed as mortal crime informer reward slave bribe to betray they master freedmen they patron and those who be without enemy bring to destruction by they friend and then he will know the true nature of the debt which rome italy and the world owe to cæsar and if he possess a spark of human feeling will turn from the example of those evil time and kindle with a consuming passion to imitate those which be good and in truth the prince who seek for worldly glory should desire to be the ruler of a corrupt city not that like cæsar he may destroy it but that like romulus he may restore it since man can not hope for nor heaven offer any better opportunity of fame be it indeed necessary in give a constitution to a state to forfeit its sovereignty the prince who to retain he station should withhold a constitution might plead excuse but for he who in give a constitution can still retain he sovereignty no excuse be to be make let those therefore to whom heaven have afford this opportunity remember that two course lie open to they one which will render they secure while they live and glorious when they die another which expose they to continual difficulty in life and condemn they to eternal infamy after death chapter xi -- _ of the religion of the roman _ though rome have romulus for she first founder and as a daughter owe he she being and nurture nevertheless when the institution of romulus be see by heaven to be insufficient for so great a state the roman senate be move to choose numa pompilius as he successor that he might look to all matter which romulus have neglect he find the people fierce and turbulent and desire with the help of the peaceful art to bring they to order and obedience call in the aid of religion as essential to the maintenance of civil society and give it such a form that for many age god be nowhere so much fear as in that republic the effect of this be to render easy any enterprise in which the senate or great man of rome think fit to engage and whosoever pay heed to a infinity of action perform sometimes by the roman people collectively often by single citizen will see that esteem the power of god beyond that of man they dread far more to violate they oath than to transgress the law as be clearly show by the example of scipio and of manlius torquatus for after the defeat of the roman by hannibal at cannæ many citizen meet together resolve in they terror and dismay to abandon italy and seek refuge in sicily but scipio get word of this go among they and menace they with he naked sword make they swear never to abandon they country again when lucius manlius be accuse by the tribune marcus pomponius before the day fix for trial titus manlius afterwards name torquatus son to lucius go to seek this marcus and threaten he with death if he do not withdraw the charge against he father compel he to swear compliance and he through fear have swear keep he oath in the first of these two instance therefore citizen whom love of they country and its law could not have retain in italy be keep there by the oath force upon they and in the second the tribune marcus to keep he oath lay aside the hatred he bear the father and overlook the injury do he by the son and he own dishonor and this from no other cause than the religion which numa have impress upon this city and it will be plain to any one who carefully study roman history how much religion help in discipline the army in unite the people in keep good man good and put bad man to shame so that have it to be decide to which prince romulus or numa rome owe the greater debt i think the balance must turn in favor of numa for when religion be once establish you may readily bring in arm but where you have arm without religion it be not easy afterwards to bring in religion we see too that while romulus in order to create a senate and to establish he other ordinance civil and military need no support from divine authority this be very necessary to numa who feign to have intercourse with a nymph by whose advice he be guide in counsel the people and this because desire to introduce in rome new and untried institution he fear that he own authority might not effect he end nor indeed have any attempt ever be make to introduce unusual law among a people without resort to divine authority since without such sanction they never would have be accept for the wise recognize many thing to be good which do not bear such reason on the face of they as command they acceptance by other wherefore wise man who would obviate these difficulty have recourse to divine aid thus do lycurgus thus solon and thus have do many besides who have have the same end in view the roman accordingly admire the prudence and virtue of numa assent to all the measure which he recommend this however be to be say that the circumstance of these time be deeply tinctured with religious feeling and of the man with whom he have to deal be rude and ignorant give numa better facility to carry out he plan as enable he to mould he subject readily to any new impression and doubtless he who should seek at the present day to form a new commonwealth would find the task easier among a race of simple mountaineer than among the dweller in city where society be corrupt as the sculptor can more easily carve a fair statue from a rough block than from the block which have be badly shape out by another but take all this into account i maintain that the religion introduce by numa be one of the chief cause of the prosperity of rome since it give rise to good ordinance which in turn bring with they good fortune and with good fortune happy issue to whatsoever be undertake and as the observance of the ordinance of religion be the cause of the greatness of a state so they neglect be the occasion of its decline since a kingdom without the fear of god must either fall to piece or must be maintain by the fear of some prince who supply that influence not supply by religion but since the life of prince be short the life of this prince also and with it he influence must soon come to a end whence it happen that a kingdom which rest wholly on the quality of its prince last for a brief time only because these quality terminate with he life be rarely renew in he successor for as dante wisely say : -- seldom through the bough doth human worth renew itself for such the will of he who give it that to he we may ascribe it -lrb- 1 -rrb- it follow therefore that the safety of a commonwealth or kingdom lie not in its have a ruler who govern it prudently while he live but in have one who so order thing that when he die the state may still maintain itself and though it be easier to impose new institution or a new faith on rude and simple man it be not therefore impossible to persuade they adoption by man who be civilized and who do not think themselves rude the people of florence do not esteem themselves rude or ignorant and yet be persuade by the friar girolamo savonarolum that he speak with god whether in this he say truth or no i take not on I to pronounce since of so great a man we must speak with reverence but this i do say that very many believe he without have witness anything extraordinary to warrant they belief he life he doctrine the matter whereof he treat be sufficient to enlist they faith let no man therefore lose heart from think that he can not do what other have do before he for as i say in my preface man be bear and live and die always in accordance with the same rule -lrb- footnote 1 : l'umana probitate : e questo vuole quei che la dà perchè da lui si chiami _ purg _ vii 121-123 -rrb- chapter xii -- that it be of much moment to make account of religion and that italy through the roman church be want therein have be ruin prince and commonwealth that would save themselves from grow corrupt should before all thing keep uncorrupted the rite and ceremony of religion and always hold they in reverence since we can have no surer sign of the decay of a province than to see divine worship hold therein in contempt this be easily understand when it be see on what foundation that religion rest in which a man be bear for every religion have its root in certain fundamental ordinance peculiar to itself the religion of the gentile have its beginning in the response of the oracle and in the prognostic of the augur and soothsayer all they other ceremony and observance depend upon these because man naturally believe that the god who could forecast they future weal or woe could also bring they to pass wherefore the temple the prayer the sacrifice and all the other rite of they worship have they origin in this that the oracle of delo of dodona and other celebrate in antiquity hold the world admiring and devout but afterwards when these oracle begin to shape they answer to suit the interest of powerful man and they imposture to be see through by the multitude man grow incredulous and ready to overturn every sacred institution for which reason the ruler of kingdom and commonwealth should maintain the foundation of the faith which they hold since thus it will be easy for they to keep they country religious and consequently virtuous and unite to which end they should countenance and further whatsoever tell in favor of religion even should they think it untrue and the wiser they be and the better they be acquaint with natural cause the more ought they to do so it be from this course have be follow by the wise that the miracle celebrate even in false religion have come to be hold in repute for from whatever source they spring discreet man will extol they whose authority afterwards give they currency everywhere these miracle be common enough in rome and among other this be believe that when the roman soldier be sack the city of veii certain of they enter the temple of juno and speak to the statue of the goddess say _ wilt thou come with we to rome _ when to some it seem that she incline she head in assent and to other that they hear she answer _ yea _ for these man be fill with religious awe -lrb- which titus livius show we by the circumstance that in enter the temple they enter devoutly reverently and without tumult -rrb- persuade themselves they hear that answer to they question which perhaps they have form beforehand in they mind but they faith and belief be wholly approve of and confirm by camillus and by the other chief man of the city have religion be maintain among the prince of christendom on the footing on which it be establish by its founder the christian state and republic have be far more united and far more prosperous than they now be nor can we have surer proof of its decay than in witness how those country which be the nearest neighbor of the roman church the head of we faith have less devoutness than any other so that any one who consider its earliest beginning and observe how widely different be its present practice might well believe its ruin or its chastisement to be close at hand but since some be of opinion that the welfare of italy depend upon the church of rome i desire to put forward certain argument which occur to I against that view and shall adduce two very strong one which to my mind admit of no answer the first be that through the ill example of the roman court the country have lose all religious feeling and devoutness a loss which draw after it infinite mischief and disorder for as the presence of religion imply every excellence so the contrary be involve in its absence to the church therefore and to the priest we italian owe this first debt that through they we have become wicked and irreligious and a still greater debt we owe they for what be the immediate cause of we ruin namely that by the church we country be keep divide for no country be ever unite or prosperous which do not yield obedience to some one prince or commonwealth as have be the case with france and spain and the church be the sole cause why italy stand on a different footing and be subject to no one king or commonwealth for though she hold here she seat and exert she temporal authority she have never yet gain strength and courage to seize upon the entire country or make herself supreme yet never have be so weak that when in fear of lose she temporal dominion she could not call in some foreign potentate to aid she against any italian state by which she be overmatch of which we find many instance both in early time as when by the intervention of charle the great she drive the lombard who have make themselves master of nearly the whole country out of italy and also in recent time as when with the help of france she first strip the venetian of they territory and then with the help of the swiss expel the french the church therefore never be powerful enough herself to take possession of the entire country while at the same time prevent any one else from do so have make it impossible to bring italy under one head and have be the cause of she always live subject to many prince or ruler by whom she have be bring to such division and weakness as to have become a prey not to barbarian king only but to any who have think fit to attack she for this i say we italian have none to thank but the church and be any man powerful enough to transplant the court of rome with all the authority it now wield over the rest of italy into the territory of the swiss -lrb- the only people who at this day both as regard religion and military discipline live like the ancient -rrb- he would have clear proof of the truth of what i affirm and would find that the corrupt manners of that court have in a little while work greater mischief in these territory than any other disaster which could ever befall they chapter xiii -- _ of the use the roman make of religion in give institution to they city in carry out they enterprise and in quell tumult _ here it seem to I not out of place to cite instance of the roman seek assistance from religion in reform they institution and in carry out they warlike design and although many such be relate by titus livius i content myself with mention the follow only : the roman have appoint tribune with consular power all of they save one plebeian it so chance that in that very year they be visit by plague and famine accompany by many strange portent take occasion from this the noble at the next creation of tribune give out that the god be angry with rome for lower the majesty of she government nor could be appease but by the choice of tribune be restore to a fair footing whereupon the people smite with religious awe choose all the tribune from the noble again at the siege of veius we find the roman commander make use of religion to keep the mind of they man well disposed towards that enterprise for when in the last year of the siege the soldier disgust with they protracted service begin to clamor to be lead back to rome on the alban lake suddenly rise to a uncommon height it be find that the oracle at delphus and elsewhere have foretell that veius should fall that year in which the alban lake overflow the hope of near victory thus excite in the mind of the soldier lead they to put up with the weariness of the war and to continue in arm until on camillus be name dictator veius be take after a ten year ' siege in these case therefore we see religion wisely use assist in the reduction of this city and in restore the tribuneship to the noble neither of which end could well have be effect without it one other example bearing on the same subject i must not omit constant disturbance be occasion in rome by the tribune terentillus who for reason to be notice in they place seek to pass a certain law the noble in they effort to baffle he have recourse to religion which they seek to turn to account in two way for first they cause the sibylline book to be search and a feigned answer return that in that year the city run great risk of lose its freedom through civil discord which fraud although expose by the tribune nevertheless arouse such alarm in the mind of the common that they slacken in they support of they leader they other contrivance be as follow : a certain appius herdonius at the head of a band of slave and outlaw to the lumber of four thousand have seize the capitol by night a alarm be spread that be the equian and volscian those perpetual enemy of the roman name then to attack the city they might succeed in take it and when in spite of this the tribune stubbornly persist in they effort to pass the law declare the act of herdonius to be a device of the noble and no real danger publius rubetius a citizen of weight and authority come forth from the senate house and in word partly friendly and partly menacing show they the peril in which the city stand and that they demand be unseasonable and speak to such effect that the common bind themselves by oath to stand by the consul in fulfilment of which engagement they aid the consul publius valerius to carry the capitol by assault but valerius be slay in the attack titus quintius be at once appoint in he place who to leave the people no breathing time nor suffer they thought to revert to the terentillian law order they to quit rome and march against the volscian declare they bind to follow he by virtue of the oath they have swear not to desert the consul and though the tribune withstand he contend that the oath have be swear to the dead consul and not to quintius yet the people under the influence of religious awe choose rather to obey the consul than believe the tribune and titus livius commend they behavior when he say : _ that neglect of the god which now prevail have not then make its way nor be it then the practice for every man to interpret he oath or the law to suit he private end _ the tribune accordingly fear to lose they entire ascendency consent to obey the consul and to refrain for a year from move in the matter of the terentillian law while the consul on they part undertake that for a year the common should not be call forth to war and thus with the help of religion the senate be able to overcome a difficulty which they never could have overcome without it chapter xiv -- _ that the roman interpret the auspices to meet the occasion and make a prudent show of observe the rite of religion even when force to disregard they and any who rashly slight religion they punish _ augury be not only as we have show above a main foundation of the old religion of the gentile but be also the cause of the prosperity of the roman commonwealth accordingly the roman give more heed to these than to any other of they observance resort to they in they consular comitium in undertake new enterprise in call out they army in go into battle and in short in every business of importance whether civil or military nor would they ever set forth on any warlike expedition until they have satisfy they soldier that the god have promise they victory among other means of declare the augury they have in they army a class of soothsayer name by they _ pullarii _ whom when they desire to give battle they would ask to take the auspices which they do by observe the behavior of fowl if the fowl peck the engagement be begin with a favourable omen if they refuse battle be decline nevertheless when it be plain on the face of it that a certain course have to be take they take it at all hazard even though the auspices be adverse contrive however to manage matter so adroitly as not to appear to throw any slight on religion as be do by the consul papirius in the great battle he fight with the samnite wherein that nation be finally break and overthrow for papirius be encamp over against the samnite and perceive that he fight victory be certain and consequently be eager to engage desire the omen to be take the fowl refuse to peck but the chief soothsayer observe the eagerness of the soldier to fight and the confidence feel both by they and by they captain not to deprive the army of such a opportunity of glory report to the consul that the auspices be favourable whereupon papirius begin to array he army for battle but some among the soothsayer have divulge to certain of the soldier that the fowl have not peck this be tell to spurius papirius the nephew of the consul who report it to he uncle the latter straightway bid he mind he own business for that so far as he himself and the army be concern the auspices be fair and if the soothsayer have lie the consequence be on he head and that the event might accord with the prognostic he command he officer to place the soothsayer in front of the battle it so chance that as they advance against the enemy the chief soothsayer be kill by a spear throw by a roman soldier which the consul hearing of say _ all go well and as the god would have it for by the death of this liar the army be purge of blame and absolved from whatever displeasure these may have conceive against it _ and contrive in this way to make he design tally with the auspices he join battle without the army know that the ordinance of religion have in any degree be disregard but a opposite course be take by appius pulcher in sicily in the first carthaginian war for desire to join battle he bid the soothsayer take the auspices and on they announce that the fowl refuse to feed he answer _ let we see then whether they will drink _ and so say cause they to be throw into the sea after which he fight and be defeat for this he be condemn at rome while papirius be honor not so much because the one have gain while the other have lose a battle as because in they treatment of the auspices the one have behave discreetly the other with rashness and in truth the sole object of this system of take the auspices be to insure the army join battle with that confidence of success which constantly lead to victory a device follow not by the roman only but by foreign nation as well of which i shall give a example in the follow chapter chapter xv -- _ how the samnite as a last resource in they broken fortune have recourse to religion _ the samnite who before have meet with many defeat at the hand of the roman be at last decisively route by they in etrurium where they army be cut to piece and they commander slay and because they ally also such as the etruscan the umbrian and the gaul be likewise vanquish they _ could now no longer _ as livius tell we _ either trust to they own strength or to foreign aid yet for all that would not cease from hostility nor resign themselves to forfeit the liberty which they have _ unsuccessfully defend prefer new defeat to a inglorious submission _ they resolve therefore to make a final effort and as they know that victory be only to be secure by inspiring they soldier with a stubborn courage to which end nothing could help so much as religion at the instance of they high priest ovius paccius they revive a ancient sacrificial rite perform by they in the manner follow after offer solemn sacrifice they cause all the captain of they army stand between the slay victim and the smoking altar to swear never to abandon the war they then summon the common soldier one by one and before the same altar and surround by a ring of many centurion with draw sword first bind they by oath never to reveal what they might see or hear and then after imprecate the divine wrath and recite the most terrible incantation make they vow and swear to the god as they would not have a curse light on they race and offspring to follow wherever they captain lead never to turn back from battle and to put any they see turn back to death some who in they terror decline to swear be forthwith slay by the centurion the rest warn by they cruel fate comply assemble thereafter to the number of forty thousand one-half of whom to render they appearance of unusual splendor be clothe in white with plume and crest over they helmet they take up they ground in the neighborhood of aquilonium but papirius being send against they bid he soldier be of good cheer tell they _ that feather make no wound and that a roman spear would pierce a paint shield _ and to lessen the effect which the oath take by the samnite have upon the mind of the roman he say that such a oath must rather distract than strengthen those bind by it since they have to fear at once they enemy they comrade and they god in the battle which ensue the samnite be route any firmness lend they by religion or by the oath they have swear be balance by the roman valor and the terror inspire by past defeat still we see that in they own judgment they have no other refuge to which to turn nor other remedy for restore they broken hope and this be strong testimony to the spirit which religion rightly use can arouse some of the incident which i have now be consider may be think to relate rather to the foreign than to the domestic affair of rome which last alone form the proper subject of this book nevertheless since the matter connect itself with one of the most important institution of the roman republic i have think it convenient to notice it here so as not to divide the subject and be oblige to return to it hereafter chapter xvi -- _ that a people accustom to live under a prince if by any accident it become free can hardly preserve that freedom _ should a people accustom to live under a prince by any accident become free as do the roman on the expulsion of the tarquin we know from numberless instance record in ancient history how hard it will be for it to maintain that freedom and this be no more than we might expect for a people in such circumstance may be liken to the wild animal which though destine by nature to roam at large in the wood have be rear in the cage and in constant confinement and which should it chance to be set free in the open country be unused to find its own food and unfamiliar with the covert where it might lie conceal fall a prey to the first who seek to recapture it even thus it fare with the people which have be accustom to be govern by other since ignorant how to act by itself either for attack or defense and neither know foreign prince nor be know of they it be speedily bring back under the yoke and often under a heavier yoke than that from which it have just free its neck these difficulty will be meet with even where the great body of the citizen have not become wholly corrupted but where the corruption be complete freedom as shall presently be show be not merely fleeting but impossible wherefore my remark be to be take as apply to those state only wherein corruption have as yet make no great progress and in which there be more that be sound than unsound to the difficulty above notice another have to be add which be that a state in become free make for itself bitter enemy but not warm friend all become its bitter enemy who draw they support from the wealth of the tyrant flourish under he government for these man when the cause which make they powerful be withdraw can no longer live contented but be one and all impel to attempt the restoration of the tyranny in hope of regain they former importance on the other hand as i have say the state which become free do not gain for itself warm friend for a free government bestow its honor and reward in accordance with certain fixed rule and on consideration of merit without which none be honor or reward but when a man obtain only those honor or reward which he seem to himself to deserve he will never admit that he be under any obligation to those who bestow they moreover the common benefit that all derive from a free government which consist in the power to enjoy what be we own openly and undisturbed in have to feel no anxiety for the honor of wife or child nor any fear for personal safety be hardly recognize by man while they still possess they since none will ever confess obligation to he who merely refrain from injury for these reason i repeat a state which have recently become free be likely to have bitter enemy and no warm friend now to meet these difficulty and they attendant disorder there be no more potent effectual wholesome and necessary remedy than _ to slay the son of brutus _ they as the historian tell we be along with other young roman lead to conspire against they country simply because the unusual privilege which they have enjoy under the king be withhold under the consul so that to they it seem as though the freedom of the people imply they servitude any one therefore who undertake to control a people either as they prince or as the head of a commonwealth and do not make sure work with all who be hostile to he new institution found a government which can not last long undoubtedly those prince be to be reckon unhappy who to secure they position be force to advance by unusual and irregular path and with the people for they enemy for while he who have to deal with a few adversary only can easily and without much or serious difficulty secure himself he who have a entire people against he can never feel safe and the greater the severity he use the weaker he authority become so that he best course be to strive to make the people he friend but since these view may seem to conflict with what i have say above treat there of a republic and here of a prince that i may not have to return to the subject again i will in this place discuss it briefly speak then of those prince who have become the tyrant of they country i say that the prince who seek to gain over a unfriendly people should first of all examine what it be the people really desire and he will always find that they desire two thing : first to be revenge upon those who be the cause of they servitude and second to regain they freedom the first of these desire the prince can gratify wholly the second in part as regard the former we have a instance exactly in point clearchus tyrant of heraclea be in exile it so happen that on a feud arise between the common and the noble of that city the latter perceive they be weaker than they adversary begin to look with favor on clearchus and conspire with he in opposition to the popular voice recall he to heraclea and deprive the people of they freedom clearchus find himself thus place between the arrogance of the noble whom he could in no way either satisfy or correct and the fury of the people who could not put up with the loss of they freedom resolve to rid himself at a stroke from the harassment of the noble and recommend himself to the people wherefore watch he opportunity he cause all the noble to be put to death and thus to the extreme delight of the people satisfied one of those desire by which they be possess namely the desire for vengeance as for the other desire of the people namely to recover they freedom the prince since he never can content they in this should examine what the cause be which make they long to be free and he will find a very few of they desire freedom that they may obtain power but all the rest whose number be countless only desire it that they may live securely for in all republic whatever the form of they government barely forty or fifty citizen have any place in the direction of affair who from they number be so small can easily be reckon with either by make away with they or by allow they such a share of honor as look to they position may reasonably content they all those other whose sole aim it be to live safely be well contented where the prince enact such law and ordinance as provide for the general security while they establish he own authority and when he do this and the people see that nothing induce he to violate these law they soon begin to live happily and without anxiety of this we have a example in the kingdom of france which enjoy perfect security from this cause alone that its king be bind to compliance with a infinity of law upon which the well-being of the whole people depend and he who give this state its constitution allow its king to do as they please as regard arm and money but provide that as regard everything else they should not interfere save as the law might direct those ruler therefore who omit to provide sufficiently for the safety of they government at the outset must like the roman do so on the first occasion which offer and whoever let the occasion slip will repent too late of not have act as he should the roman however be still uncorrupted at the time when they recover they freedom be able after slaying the son of brutus and get rid of the tarquin to maintain it with all those safeguard and remedy which we have elsewhere consider but have they already become corrupted no remedy could have be find either in rome or out of it by which they freedom could have be secure as i shall show in the follow chapter chapter xvii -- _ that a corrupt people obtain freedom can hardly preserve it _ i believe that if she king have not be expel rome must very soon have become a weak and inconsiderable state for see to what a pitch of corruption these king have come we may conjecture that if two or three more like reign have follow and the taint spread from the head to the member so soon as the latter become infected cure would have be hopeless but from the head be remove while the trunk be still sound it be not difficult for the roman to return to a free and constitutional government it may be assume however as most certain that a corrupted city living under a prince can never recover its freedom even be the prince and all he line to be exterminate for in such a city it must necessarily happen that one prince will be replace by another and that thing will never settle down until a new lord be establish unless indeed the combined goodness and valor of some one citizen should maintain freedom which even then will endure only for he lifetime as happen twice in syracuse first under the rule of dion and again under that of timoleon whose virtue while they live keep they city free but on whose death it fall once more under a tyranny but the strongest example that can be give be that of rome which on the expulsion of the tarquin be able at once to seize on liberty and to maintain it yet on the death of cæsar caligulum and nero and on the extinction of the julian line be not only unable to establish she freedom but do not even venture a step in that direction result so opposite arise in one and the same city can only be account for by this that in the time of the tarquin the roman people be not yet corrupt but in these later time have become utterly corrupt for on the first occasion nothing more be need to prepare and determine they to shake off they king than that they should be bind by oath to suffer no king ever again to reign in rome whereas afterwards the authority and austere virtue of brutus back by all the legion of the east could not rouse they to maintain they hold of that freedom which he follow in the footstep of the first brutus have win for they and this because of the corruption wherewith the people have be infect by the marian faction whereof cæsar become head be able so to blind the multitude that it see not the yoke under which it be about to lay its neck though this example of rome be more complete than any other i desire to instance likewise to the same effect certain people well know in we own day and i maintain that no change however grave or violent could ever restore freedom to naple or milan because in these state the entire body of the people have grow corrupted and so we find that milan although desirous to return to a free form of government on the death of filippo viscontus have neither the force nor the skill need to preserve it most fortunate therefore be it for rome that she king grow corrupt soon so as to be drive out before the taint of they corruption have reach the vitals of the city for it be because these be sound that the endless commotion which take place in rome so far from be hurtful be from they object be good beneficial to the commonwealth from which we may draw this inference that where the body of the people be still sound tumult and other like disorder do little hurt but that where it have become corrupted law however well devise be of no advantage unless impose by some one whose paramount authority cause they to be observe until the community be once more restore to a sound and healthy condition whether this have ever happen i know not nor whether it ever can happen for we see as i have say a little way back that a city which owe to its pervade corruption have once begin to decline if it be to recover at all must be save not by the excellence of the people collectively but of some one man then live among they on whose death it at once relapse into its former plight as happen with thebe in which the virtue of epaminonda make it possible while he live to preserve the form of a free government but which fall again on he death into its old disorder the reason be that hardly any ruler live so long as to have time to accustom to right method a city which have long be accustom to wrong wherefore unless thing be put on a sound footing by some one ruler who live to a very advanced age or by two virtuous ruler succeed one another the city upon they death at once fall back into ruin or if it be preserve must be so by incur great risk and at the cost of much blood for the corruption i speak of be wholly incompatible with a free government because it result from a inequality which pervade the state and can only be remove by employ unusual and very violent remedy such as few be willing or know how to employ as in another place i shall more fully explain chapter xviii -- _ how a free government exist in a corrupt city may be preserve or not exist may be create _ i think it neither out of place nor inconsistent with what have be say above to consider whether a free government exist in a corrupt city can be maintain or not exist can be introduce and on this head i say that it be very difficult to bring about either of these result and next to impossible to lay down rule as to how it may be do because the measure to be take must vary with the degree of corruption which prevail nevertheless since it be well to reason thing out i will not pass this matter by but will assume in the first place the case of a very corrupt city and then take the case of one in which corruption have reach a still greater height but where corruption be universal no law or institution will ever have force to restrain it because as good custom stand in need of good law for they support so law that they may be respect stand in need of good custom moreover the law and institution establish in a republic at its beginning when man be good be no longer suitable when they have become bad but while the law of a city be alter to suit its circumstance its institution rarely or never change whence it result that the introduction of new law be of no avail because the institution remain unchanged corrupt they and to make this plainer i say that in rome it be first of all the institution of the state and next the law as enforce by the magistrate which keep the citizen under control the institution of the state consist in the authority of the people the senate the tribune and the consul in the method of choose and appoint magistrate and in the arrangement for pass law these institution change little if at all with circumstance but the law by which the people be control as for instance the law relate to adultery the sumptuary law the law as to canvass at election and many other be alter as the citizen grow more and more corrupted hence the institution of the state remain the same although from the corruption of the people no longer suitable amendment in the law could not keep man good though they might have prove very useful if at the time when they be make the institution have likewise be reform that its original institution be no longer adapt to a city that have become corrupted be plainly see in two matter of great moment i mean in the appointment of magistrate and in the passing of law for the roman people confer the consulship and other great office of they state on none save those who seek they which be a good institution at first because then none seek these office save those who think themselves worthy of they and to be reject be hold disgraceful so that to be deem worthy all be on they best behavior but in a corrupted city this institution grow to be most mischievous for it be no longer those of greatest worth but those who have most influence who seek the magistracy while all who be without influence however deserving refrain through fear this untoward result be not reach all at once but like other similar result by gradual step for after subdue africa and asia and reduce nearly the whole of greece to submission the roman become perfectly assure of they freedom and seem to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they have cause to fear but this security and the weakness of they adversary lead they in confer the consulship no longer to look to merit but only to favor select for the office those who know best how to pay court to they not those who know best how to vanquish they enemy and afterwards instead of select those who be best like they come to select those who have most influence and in this way from the imperfection of they institution good man come to be wholly exclude again as to make law any of the tribune and certain other of the magistrate be entitle to submit law to the people but before these be pass it be open to every citizen to speak either for or against they this be a good system so long as the citizen be good since it be always well that every man should be able to propose what he think may be of use to he country and that all should be allow to express they view with regard to he proposal so that the people have hear all may resolve on what be best but when the people grow depraved this become a very mischievous institution for then it be only the powerful who propose law and these not in the interest of public freedom but of they own authority and because through fear none durst speak against the law they propose the people be either deceive or force into vote they own destruction in order therefore that rome after she have become corrupted might still preserve she freedom it be necessary that as in the course of event she have make new law so likewise she should frame new institution since different institution and ordinance be need in a corrupt state from those which suit a state which be not corrupt for where the matter be wholly dissimilar the form can not be similar but since old institution must either be reform all at once as soon as they be see to be no longer expedient or else gradually as the imperfection of each be recognize i say that each of these two course be all but impossible for to effect a gradual reform require a sagacious man who can discern mischief while it be still remote and in the germ but it may well happen that no such person be find in a city or that if find he be unable to persuade other of what he be himself persuade for man use to live in one way be loath to leave it for another especially when they be not bring face to face with the evil against which they should guard and only have it indicate to they by conjecture and as for a sudden reform of institution which be see by all to be no longer good i say that defect which be easily discern be not easily correct because for they correction it be not enough to use ordinary means these be in themselves insufficient but recourse must be have to extraordinary means such as violence and arm and as a preliminary you must become prince of the city and be able to deal with it at you pleasure but since the restoration of a state to new political life presuppose a good man and to become prince of a city by violence presuppose a bad man it can consequently very seldom happen that although the end be good a good man will be find ready to become a prince by evil way or that a bad man have become a prince will be dispose to act virtuously or think of turn to good account he ill-acquired authority from all these cause come the difficulty or rather the impossibility which a corrupted city find in maintain a exist free government or in establish a new one so that have we to establish or maintain a government in that city it would be necessary to give it a monarchical rather than a popular form in order that man too arrogant to be restrain by the law might in some measure be keep in check by a power almost absolute since to attempt to make they good otherwise would be a very cruel or a wholly futile endeavor this as i have say be the method follow by cleomene and if he that he might stand alone put to death the ephorus and if romulus with a like object put to death he brother and titus tatius the sabine and if both afterwards make good use of the authority they thus acquire it be nevertheless to be remember that it be because neither cleomene nor romulus have to deal with so corrupt a people as that of which i be now speak that they be able to effect they end and to give a fair color to they act chapter xix -- _ after a strong prince a weak prince may maintain himself : but after one weak prince no kingdom can stand a second _ when we contemplate the excellent quality of romulus numa and tullus the first three king of rome and note the method which they follow we recognize the extreme good fortune of that city in have she first king fierce and warlike she second peaceful and religious and she third like the first of a high spirit and more disposed to war than to peace for it be essential for rome that almost at the outset of she career a ruler should be find to lay the foundation of she civil life but after that have be do it be necessary that she ruler should return to the virtue of romulus since otherwise the city must have grow feeble and become a prey to she neighbor and here we may note that a prince who succeed to another of superior valor may reign on by virtue of he predecessor 's merit and reap the fruit of he labor but if he live to a great age or if he be follow by another who be want in the quality of the first that then the kingdom must necessarily dwindle conversely when two consecutive prince be of rare excellence we commonly find they achieve result which win for they endure renown david for example not only surpass in learning and judgment but be so valiant in arm that after conquer and subdue all he neighbor he leave to he young son solomon a tranquil state which the latter though unskilled in the art of war could maintain by the art of peace and thus happily enjoy the inheritance of he father 's valor but solomon could not transmit this inheritance to he son rehoboam who neither resemble he grandfather in valor nor he father in good fortune with difficulty make good he right to a sixth part of the kingdom in like manner bajazet sultan of the turk though a man of peace rather than of war be able to enjoy the labor of mahomet he father who like david have subdue he neighbor leave he son a kingdom so safely establish that it could easily be retain by he by peaceful art but have selim son to bajazet be like he father and not like he grandfather the turkish monarchy must have be overthrow as it be he seem likely to outdo the fame of he grandsire i affirm it to be prove by these example that after a valiant prince a feeble prince may maintain himself but that no kingdom can stand when two feeble prince follow in succession unless as in the case of france it be support by its ancient ordinance by feeble prince i mean such as be not valiant in war and to put the matter shortly it may be say that the great valor of romulus leave numa a period of many year within which to govern rome by peaceful art that after numa come tullus who renew by he courage the fame of romulus and that he in turn be succeed by ancus a prince so gifted by nature that he could equally avail himself of the method of peace or war who set himself at first to pursue the former when he find that he neighbor judge he to be effeminate and therefore hold he in slight esteem understand that to preserve rome he must resort to arm and resemble romulus rather than numa from whose example every ruler of a state may learn that a prince like numa will hold or lose he power accord as fortune and circumstance befriend he but that the prince who resemble romulus and like he be fortify with foresight and arm will hold he state whatever befall unless deprive of it by some stubborn and irresistible force for we may reckon with certainty that if rome have not have for she third king one who know how to restore she credit by deed of valor she could not or at any rate not without great difficulty have afterwards hold she ground nor could ever have achieve the great exploit she do and for these reason rome while she live under she king be in constant danger of destruction through a king who might be weak or bad chapter xx -- _ that the consecutive reign of two valiant prince produce great result : and that well-ordered commonwealth be assure of a succession of valiant ruler by whom they power and growth be rapidly extend _ when rome have drive out she king she be free from those danger to which as i have say she be expose by the possible succession of a weak or wicked prince for the chief share in the government then devolve upon the consul who take they authority not by inheritance nor yet by craft or by ambitious violence but by the free suffrage of they fellow-citizen and be always man of signal worth by whose valor and good fortune rome be constantly aid be able to reach the height of she greatness in the same number of year as she have live under she king and since we find that two successive reign of valiant prince as of philip of macedon and he son alexander suffice to conquer the world this ought to be still easier for a commonwealth which have it in its power to choose not two excellent ruler only but a endless number in succession and in every well order commonwealth provision will be make for a succession of this sort chapter xxi -- _ that it be a great reproach to a prince or to a commonwealth to be without a national army _ those prince and republic of the present day who lack force of they own whether for attack or defense should take shame to themselves and should be convince by the example of tullus that they deficiency do not arise from want of man fit for warlike enterprise but from they own fault in not know how to make they subject good soldier for after rome have be at peace for forty year tullus succeed to the kingdom find not a single roman who have ever be in battle nevertheless when he make up he mind to enter on a war it never occur to he to have recourse to the samnite or the etruscan or to any other of the neighbouring nation accustom to arm but he resolve like the prudent prince he be to rely on he own countryman and such be he ability that under he rule the people very soon become admirable soldier for nothing be more true than that where a country have man lack soldier it result from some fault in its ruler and not from any defect in the situation or climate of this we have a very recent instance every one know how only the other day the king of england invade the realm of france with a army raise wholly from among he own people although from he country have be at peace for thirty year he have neither man nor officer who have ever look a enemy in the face nevertheless he do not hesitate with such troops as he have to attack a kingdom well provide with officer and excellent soldier who have be constantly under arm in the italian war and this be possible through the prudence of the english king and the wise ordinance of he kingdom which never in time of peace relax its warlike discipline so too in old time pelopida and epaminonda the theban after they have free thebe from she tyrant and rescue she from thraldom to sparta finding themselves in a city use to servitude and surround by a effeminate people scruple not so great be they courage to furnish these with arm and go forth with they to meet and to conquer the spartan force on the field and he who relate this observe that these two captain very soon show that warrior be not breed in lacedæmon alone but in every country where man be find if only some one arise among they who know how to direct they to arm as we see tullus know how to direct the roman nor could virgil better express this opinion or show by fitter word that he be convince of its truth than when he say : -- to arm shall tullus rouse he sluggish warrior -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : residesque movebit tullus in arma viros _ virg aen _ vi 814 -rrb- chapter xxii -- _ what be to be note in the combat of the three roman horatius and the three alban curiatius _ it be agree between tullus king of rome and metius king of alba that the nation whose champion be victorious in combat should rule over the other the three alban curiatius be slay one of the roman horatius survive whereupon the alban king with all he people become subject to the roman the survive horatius return victorious to rome and meet he sister wife to one of the dead curiatius bewail the death of she husband slew she and be try for this crime be after much contention liberate rather on the entreaty of he father than for he own desert herein three point be to be note _ first _ that we should never peril we whole fortune on the success of only a part of we force _ second _ that in a well-governed state merit should never be allow to balance crime and _ third _ that those be never wise covenant which we can not or should not expect to be observe now for a state to be enslave be so terrible a calamity that it ought never to have be suppose possible that either of these king or nation would rest content under a slavery result from the defeat of three only of they number and so it appear to metius for although on the victory of the roman champion he at once confess himself vanquish and promise obedience nevertheless in the very first expedition which he and tullus undertake jointly against the people of veius we find he seek to circumvent the roman as though perceive too late the rash part he have play this be enough to say of the third point which i note as deserving attention of the other two i shall speak in the next two chapter chapter xxiii -- _ that we should never hazard we whole fortune where we put not forth we entire strength for which reason to guard a defile be often hurtful _ it be never judge a prudent course to peril you whole fortune where you put not forth you whole strength as may happen in more way than one one of these way be that take by tullus and metius when each stake the existence of he country and the credit of he army on the valor and good fortune of three only of he soldier that be a utterly insignificant fraction of the force at he disposal for neither of these king reflect that all the labor of they predecessor in frame such institution for they state as might with the aid of the citizen themselves maintain they long in freedom be render futile when the power to ruin all be leave in the hand of so small a number no rasher step therefore could have be take than be take by these king a like risk be almost always incur by those who on the approach of a enemy resolve to defend some place of strength or to guard the defile by which they country be enter for unless room be find in this place of strength for almost all you army the attempt to hold it will almost always prove hurtful if you can find room it will be right to defend you strong place but if these be difficult of access and you can not there keep you entire force together the effort to defend be mischievous i come to this conclusion from observe the example of those who although they territory be enclose by mountain and precipice have not on be attack by powerful enemy attempt to fight on the mountain or in the defile but have advance beyond they to meet they foe or if unwilling to advance have await attack behind they mountain on level and not on broken ground the reason of which be as i have above explain that many man can not be assemble in these strong place for they defense partly because a large number of man can not long subsist there and partly because such place be narrow and confine afford room for a few only so that no enemy can there be withstand who come in force to the attack which he can easily do he design be to pass on and not to make a stay whereas he who stand on the defensive can not do so in force because from not know when the enemy may enter the confine and sterile tract of which i speak he may have to lodge himself there for a long time but should you lose some pass which you have reckon on holding and on the defense of which you country and army have rely there commonly follow such panic among you people and among the troops which remain to you that you be vanquish without opportunity give for any display of valor and lose everything without bring all you resource into play every one have hear with what difficulty hannibal cross the alp which divide france from lombardy and afterwards those which separate lombardy from tuscany nevertheless the roman await he in the first instance on the bank of the ticino in the second on the plain of arezzo prefer to be defeat on ground which at least give they a chance of victory to lead they army into mountain fastness where it be likely to be destroy by the mere difficulty of the ground and any who read history with attention will find that very few capable commander have attempt to hold pass of this nature as well for the reason already give as because to close they all be impossible for mountain like plain be traverse not only by well-known and frequented road but also by many by-way which though unknown to stranger be familiar to the people of the country under whose guidance you may always and in spite of any opposition be easily conduct to whatever point you please of this we have a recent instance in the event of the year 1515 for when franci i of france resolve on invade italy in order to recover the province of lombardy those hostile to he attempt look mainly to the swiss who it be hope would stop he in pass through they mountain but this hope be disappoint by the event for leave on one side two or three defile which be guard by the swiss the king advance by another unknown pass and be in italy and upon he enemy before they know whereupon they flee terror-stricken into milan while the whole population of lombardy finding themselves deceive in they expectation that the french would be detain in the mountain go over to they side chapter xxiv -- _ that well-ordered state always provide reward and punishment for they citizen and never set off desert against misdeed _ the valor of horatius in vanquish the curiatius deserve the highest reward but in slaying he sister he have be guilty of a heinous crime and so displease to the roman be a outrage of this nature that although he service be so great and so recent they bring he to trial for he life to one look at it carelessly this might seem a instance of popular ingratitude but he who consider the matter more closely and examine with sounder judgment what the ordinance of a state should be will rather blame the roman people for acquit horatius than for put he on he trial and this because no well-ordered state ever strike a balance between the service of its citizen and they misdeed but appoint reward for good action and punishment for bad when it have reward a man for act well will afterwards should he act ill chastise he without regard to he former desert when these ordinance be duly observe a city will live long in freedom but when they be neglect it must soon come to ruin for when a citizen have render some splendid service to he country if to the distinction which he action in itself confer be add a over-weening confidence that any crime he might thenceforth commit would pass unpunished he would soon become so arrogant that no civil bond could restrain he still while we would have punishment terrible to wrongdoer it be essential that good action should be reward as we see to have be the case in rome for even where a republic be poor and have but little to give it ought not to withhold that little since a gift however small bestow as a reward for service however great will always be esteem most honorable and precious by he who receive it the story of horatius cocle and that of mutius scævola be well know : how the one withstand the enemy on the bridge while it be be cut down and the other thrust he hand into the fire in punishment of the mistake make when he seek the life of porsenna the etruscan king to each of these two in requital of they splendid deed two ploughgate only of the public land be give another famous story be that of manlius capitolinus to whom for have save the capitol from the besiege gaul a small measure of meal be give by each of those who be shut up with he during the siege which recompense in proportion to the wealth of the citizen of rome at that time be think ample so that afterwards when manlius move by jealousy and malice seek to arouse sedition in rome and to gain over the people to he cause they without regard to he past service throw he headlong from that capitol in save which he have formerly gain so great a renown chapter xxv -- _ that he who would reform the institution of a free state must retain at least the semblance of old way _ whoever take upon he to reform the government of a city must if he measure be to be well receive and carry out with general approval preserve at least the semblance of exist method so as not to appear to the people to have make any change in the old order of thing although in truth the new ordinance differ altogether from those which they replace for when this be attend to the mass of mankind accept what seem as what be nay be often touch more nearly by appearance than by reality this tendency be recognize by the roman at the very outset of they civil freedom when they appoint two consul in place of a single king they would not permit the consul to have more than twelve lictor in order that the old number of the king 's attendant might not be exceed again there be solemnize every year in rome a sacrificial rite which could only be perform by the king in person that the people might not be lead by the absence of the king to remark the want of any ancient observance a priest be appoint for the due celebration of this rite to whom be give the name of _ rex sacrificulus _ and who be place under the order of the chief priest in this way the people be contented and have no occasion from any defect in the solemnity to desire the return of they king like precaution should be use by all who would put a end to the old government of a city and substitute new and free institution for since novelty disturb man 's mind we should seek in the change we make to preserve as far as possible what be ancient so that if the new magistrate differ from the old in number in authority or in the duration of they office they shall at least retain the old name this i say should be see to by he who would establish a constitutional government whether in the form of a commonwealth or of a kingdom but he who would create a absolute government of the kind which political writer term a tyranny must renew everything as shall be explain in the follow chapter chapter xxvi -- _ a new prince in a city or province of which he have take possession ought to make everything new _ whosoever become prince of a city or state more especially if he position be so insecure that he can not resort to constitutional government either in the form of a republic or a monarchy will find that the best way to preserve he princedom be to renew the whole institution of that state that be to say to create new magistracy with new name confer new power and employ new man and like david when he become king exalt the humble and depress the great _ fill the hungry with good thing and send the rich empty away _ moreover he must pull down exist town and rebuild they remove they inhabitant from one place to another and in short leave nothing in the country as he find it so that there shall be neither rank nor condition nor honor nor wealth which its possessor can refer to any but to he and he must take example from philip of macedon the father of alexander who by mean such as these from be a petty prince become monarch of all greece and of whom it be write that he shift man from province to province as a shepherd move he flock from one pasture to another these indeed be most cruel expedient contrary not merely to every christian but to every civilized rule of conduct and such as every man should shun choose rather to lead a private life than to be a king on term so hurtful to mankind but he who will not keep to the fair path of virtue must to maintain himself enter this path of evil man however not know how to be wholly good or wholly bad choose for themselves certain middle way which of all other be the most pernicious as shall be show by a instance in the follow chapter chapter xxvii -- _ that man seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly bad _ when in the year 1505 pope julius ii go to bologna to expel from that city the family of the bentivoglus who have be prince there for over a hundred year it be also in he mind as a part of the general design he have plan against all those lord who have usurp church land to remove giovanpagolo baglionus tyrant of perugium and come to perugia with this intention and resolve of which all man know he would not wait to enter the town with a force sufficient for he protection but enter it unattended by troops although giovanpagolo be there with a great company of soldier whom he have assemble for he defense and thus urge on by that impetuosity which stamp all he action accompany only by he body-guard he commit himself into the hand of he enemy whom he forthwith carry away with he leave a governor behind to hold the town for the church all prudent man who be with the pope remark on he temerity and on the pusillanimity of giovanpagolo nor could they conjecture why the latter have not to he eternal glory avail himself of this opportunity for crush he enemy and at the same time enrich himself with plunder the pope be attend by the whole college of cardinal with all they luxurious equipage for it could not be suppose that he be withhold by any prompting of goodness or scruple of conscience because in the breast of a profligate living in incest with he sister and who to obtain the princedom have put he nephew and kinsman to death no virtuous impulse could prevail so that the only inference to be draw be that man know not how to be splendidly wicked or wholly good and shrink in consequence from such crime as be stamp with a inherent greatness or disclose a nobility of nature for which reason giovanpagolo who think nothing of incur the guilt of incest or of murder he kinsman could not or more truly dare not avail himself of a fair occasion to do a deed which all would have admire which would have win for he a deathless fame as the first to teach the prelate how little those who live and reign as they do be to be esteem and which would have display a greatness far transcend any infamy or danger that could attach to it chapter xxviii -- _ whence it come that the roman be less ungrateful to they citizen than be the athenian _ in the history of all republic we meet with instance of some sort of ingratitude to they great citizen but fewer in the history of rome than of athen or indeed of any other republic search for the cause of this i be persuade that so far as regard rome and athen it be due to the roman have have less occasion than the athenian to look upon they fellow-citizen with suspicion for from the expulsion of she king down to the time of syllum and marius the liberty of rome be never subvert by any one of she citizen so that there never be in that city grave cause for distrust any man and in consequence make he the victim of inconsiderate injustice the reverse be notoriously the case with athen for that city have at a time when she be most flourishing be deprive of she freedom by pisistratus under a false show of good-will remember after she regain she liberty she former bondage and all the wrong she have endure become the relentless chastiser not of offence only on the part of she citizen but even of the shadow of a offence hence the banishment and death of so many excellent man and hence the law of ostracism and all those other violent measure which from time to time during the history of that city be direct against she foremost citizen for this be most true which be assert by the writer on civil government that a people which have recover its freedom bite more fiercely than one which have always preserve it and any who shall weigh well what have be say will not condemn athen in this matter nor commend rome but refer all to the necessity arise out of the different condition prevail in the two state for careful reflection will show that have rome be deprive of she freedom as athen be she would not have be a whit more tender to she citizen this we may reasonably infer from remark what after the expulsion of the king befall collatinus and publius valerius the former of whom though he have take part in the liberation of rome be send into exile for no other reason than that he bear the name of tarquin while the sole ground of suspicion against the latter and what almost lead to he banishment be he have build a house upon the cælian hill see how harsh and suspicious rome be in these two instance we may surmise that she would have show the same ingratitude as athen have she like athen be wrong by she citizen at a early stage of she growth and before she have attain to the fulness of she strength that i may not have to return to this question of ingratitude i shall say all that remain to be say about it in my next chapter chapter xxix -- _ whether a people or a prince be the more ungrateful _ in connection with what have be say above it seem proper to consider whether more notable instance of ingratitude be supply by prince or people and to go to the root of the matter i affirm that this vice of ingratitude have its source either in avarice or in suspicion for a prince or people when they have send forth a captain on some important enterprise by succeed in which he earn a great name be bind in return to reward he and if move by avarice and covetousness they fail to do so or if instead of reward they wrong and disgrace he they commit a error which be not only without excuse but bring with it undying infamy and in fact we find many prince who have sin in this way for the cause give by cornelius tacitus when he say that _ man be readier to pay back injury than benefit since to requite a benefit be feel to be a burthen to return a injury a gain _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- when however reward be withhold or to speak more correctly where offence be give not from avarice but from suspicion the prince or people may deserve some excuse and we read of many instance of ingratitude proceeding from this cause for the captain who by he valor have win new dominion for he prince since while overcome he enemy he at the same time cover himself with glory and enrich he soldier must need acquire such credit with he own follower and with the enemy and also with the subject of he prince as can not be wholly agreeable to the master who send he forth and since man be by nature ambitious as well as jealous and none love to set a limit to he fortune the suspicion which at once lay hold of the prince when he see he captain victorious be sure to be inflamed by some arrogant act or word of the captain himself so that the prince will be unable to think of anything but how to secure himself and to this end will contrive how he may put he captain to death or at any rate deprive he of the credit he have gain with the army and among the people do all he can to show that the victory be not win by he valor but by good fortune or by the cowardice of the enemy or by the skill and prudence of those commander who be with he at this or the other battle after vespasian who be then in judæa have be proclaim emperor by he army antonius primus who command another army in illyrium adopt he cause and march into italy against vitellius who have be proclaim emperor in rome courageously defeat two army under that prince and occupied rome so that mutianus who be send thither by vespasian find everything do to he hand and all difficulty surmount by the valor of antonius but all the reward which antonius have for he pain be that mutianus forthwith deprive he of he command of the army and by degree diminish he authority in rome till none be leave he thereupon antonius go to join vespasian who be still in asia by whom he be so coldly receive and so little consider that in despair he put himself to death and of case like this history be full every man living at the present hour know with what zeal and courage gonsalvo of cordova while conduct the war in naple against the french conquer and subdue that kingdom for he master ferdinand of aragon and how he service be requite by ferdinand come from aragon to naple and first of all deprive he of the command of the army afterwards of the fortress and finally carry he back with he to spain where soon after he die in disgrace this jealousy then be so natural to prince that they can not guard themselves against it nor show gratitude to those who serve under they standard have gain great victory and make great conquest on they behalf and if it be impossible for prince to free they mind from such suspicion there be nothing strange or surprising that a people should be unable to do so for as a city living under free institution have two end always before it namely to acquire liberty and to preserve it it must of necessity be lead by its excessive passion for liberty to make mistake in the pursuit of both these object of the mistake it commit in the effort to acquire liberty i shall speak hereafter in the proper place of mistake commit in the endeavor to preserve liberty be to be note the injure those citizen who ought to be reward and the suspect those who should be trust now although in a state which have grow corrupt these error occasion great evil and commonly lead to a tyranny as happen in rome when cæsar take by force what ingratitude have deny he they be nevertheless the cause of much good in the republic which have not be corrupt since they prolong the duration of its free institution and make man through fear of punishment better and less ambitious of all people possess of great power the roman for the reason i have give have undoubtedly be the least ungrateful since we have no other instance of they ingratitude to cite save that of scipio for both coriolanus and camillus be banish on account of the wrong which they inflict on the common and though the former be not forgive because he constantly retain ill will against the people the latter be not only recall but for the rest of he life honor as a prince but the ingratitude show towards scipio arise from the suspicion wherewith the citizen come to regard he which they have not feel in the case of the other and which be occasion by the greatness of the enemy whom he have overthrow the fame he have win by prevail in so dangerous and protracted a war the suddenness of he victory and finally the favor which he youth together with he prudence and he other memorable quality have gain for he these quality be in truth so remarkable that the very magistrate not to speak of other stand in awe of he authority a circumstance displease to prudent citizen as before unheard of in rome in short he whole bearing and character be so much out of the common that even the elder cato so celebrated for he austere virtue be the first to declare against he say that no city could be deem free which contain a citizen who be fear by the magistrate and since in this instance the roman follow the opinion of cato they merit that excuse which as i have say already should be extend to the prince or people who be ungrateful through suspicion in conclusion it be to be say that while this vice of ingratitude have its origin either in avarice or in suspicion commonwealth be rarely lead into it by avarice and far seldomer than prince by suspicion have as shall presently be show far less reason than prince for suspect -lrb- footnote 1 : proclivius est injuriæ quam beneficio vicem exsolvere quia gratia oneri ultio in quastu habetur _ tacit hist _ iv 2 -rrb- chapter xxx -- _ how prince and commonwealth may avoid the vice of ingratitude and how a captain or citizen may escape be undo by it _ that he may not be torment by suspicion nor show ungrateful a prince should go himself on he war as the roman emperor do at first as the turk do now and in short as all valiant prince have do and do for when it be the prince himself who conquer the glory and the gain be all he own but when he be absent since the glory be another be it will seem to the prince that he profit nothing by the gain unless that glory be quench which he know not how to win for himself and when he thus become ungrateful and unjust doubtless he loss be greater than he gain to the prince therefore who either through indolence or from want of foresight send forth a captain to conduct he war while he himself remain inactive at home i have no advice to offer which he do not already know but i would counsel the captain whom he send since i be sure that he can never escape the attack of ingratitude to follow one or other of two course and either quit he command at once after a victory and place himself in the hand of he prince while carefully abstain from every vainglorious or ambitious act so that the prince be relieve from all suspicion may be dispose to reward or at any rate not to injure he or else should he think it inexpedient for he to act in this way to take boldly the contrary course and fearlessly to follow out all such measure as he think will secure for himself and not for he prince whatever he have gain conciliate the good-will of he soldier and fellow-citizen form new friendship with neighbouring potentate place he own adherent in fortify town corrupt the chief officer of he army and get rid of those whom he fail to corrupt and by all similar means endeavor to punish he master for the ingratitude which he look for at he hand these be the only two course open but since as i say before man know not how to be wholly good or wholly bad it will never happen that after a victory a captain will quit he army and conduct himself modestly nor yet that he will venture to use those hardy method which have in they some strain of greatness and so remain undecided he will be crush while he still waver and doubt a commonwealth desire to avoid the vice of ingratitude be as compare with a prince at this disadvantage that while a prince can go himself on he expedition the commonwealth must send some one of its citizen as a remedy i would recommend that course be adopt which be follow by the roman republic in order to be less ungrateful than other have its origin in the nature of the roman government for the whole city noble and common alike take part in she war there be always find in rome at every stage of she history so many valiant and successful soldier that by reason of they number and from one act as a check upon another the nation have never ground to be jealous of any one man among they while they on they part live uprightly and be careful to betray no sign of ambition nor give the people the least cause to distrust they as ambitious so that he obtain most glory from he dictatorship who be first to lay it down which conduct as it excite no suspicion could occasion no ingratitude we see then that the commonwealth which would have no cause to be ungrateful must act as rome do and that the citizen who would escape ingratitude must observe those precaution which be observe by roman citizen chapter xxxi -- _ that the roman captain be never punish with extreme severity for misconduct and where loss result to the republic merely through they ignorance or want of judgment be not punish at all _ the roman be not only as have be say above less ungrateful than other republic but be also more lenient and more considerate than other in punish the captain of they army for if these err of set purpose they chastise they with gentleness while if they err through ignorance so far from punish they even honor and reward they and this conduct be well consider for as they judge it of the utmost moment that those in command of they army should in all they have to do have they mind undisturbed and free from external anxiety they would not add further difficulty and danger to a task in itself both dangerous and difficult lest none should ever be find to act with valor for suppose they to be send forth a army against philip of macedon in greece or against hannibal in italy or against any other enemy at whose hand they have already sustained reverse the captain in command of that expedition would be weight with all the grave and important care which attend such enterprise but if to all these care have be add the example of roman general crucify or otherwise put to death for have lose battle it would have be impossible for a commander surround by so many cause for anxiety to have act with vigor and decision for which reason and because they think that to such person the mere ignominy of defeat be in itself punishment enough they would not dishearten they general by inflict on they any heavier penalty of error commit not through ignorance the follow be a instance sergius and virginius be engage in the siege of veii each be in command of a division of the army and while sergius be set to guard against the approach of the etruscan it fall to virginius to watch the town but sergius be attack by the faliscan and other tribe choose rather to be defeat and route than ask aid from virginius who on he part await the humiliation of he rival be willing to see he country dishonour and a army destroy sooner than go unasked to he relief this be notable misconduct and likely unless both offender be punish to bring discredit on the roman name but whereas another republic would have punish these man with death the roman be content to inflict only a money fine : not because the offence do not in itself deserve severe handling but because they be unwilling for the reason already give to depart in this instance from they ancient practice of error commit through ignorance we have no better example than in the case of varro through whose rashness the roman be defeat by hannibal at cannæ where the republic well-nigh lose its liberty but because he have act through ignorance and with no evil design they not only refrain from punish he but even treat he with distinction the whole senate go forth to meet he on he return to rome and as they could not thank he for have fight thank he for have come back and for not have despair of the fortune he country again when papirius cursor would have have fabius put to death because contrary to he order he have fight with the samnite among the reason plead by the father of fabius against the persistency of the dictator he urge that never on the occasion of the defeat of any of they captain have the roman do what papirius desire they to do on the occasion of a victory chapter xxxii -- _ that a prince or commonwealth should not delay confer benefit until they be themselves in difficulty _ the roman find it for they advantage to be generous to the common at a season of danger when porsenna come to attack rome and restore the tarquin for the senate apprehend that the people might choose rather to take back they king than to support a war secure they adherence by relieve they of the duty on salt and of all they other burthen say that _ the poor do enough for the common welfare in rear they offspring _ in return for which indulgence the common be content to undergo war siege and famine let no one however rely on this example delay conciliate the people till danger have actually come or if he do let he not hope to have the same good fortune as the roman for the mass of the people will consider that they have to thank not he but he enemy and that there be ground to fear that when the danger have pass away he will take back what he give under compulsion and therefore that to he they lie under no obligation and the reason why the course follow by the roman succeed be that the state be still new and unsettled besides which the people know that law have already be pass in they favor as for instance the law allow a appeal to the tribune and could therefore persuade themselves that the benefit grant they proceed from the good-will entertain towards they by the senate and be not due merely to the approach of a enemy moreover the memory of they king by whom they have in many way be wrong and ill-treat be still fresh in they mind but since like condition seldom recur it can only rarely happen that like remedy be useful wherefore all whether prince or republic who hold the rein of government ought to think beforehand of the adverse time which may await they and of what help they may then stand in need and ought so to live with they people as they would think right be they suffer under any calamity and whosoever whether prince or republic but prince more especially behave otherwise and believe that after the event and when danger be upon he he will be able to win man over by benefit deceive himself and will not merely fail to maintain he place but will even precipitate he downfall chapter xxxiii -- _ when a mischief have grow up in or against a state it be safer to temporize with than to meet it with violence _ as rome grow in fame power and dominion she neighbor who at first have take no heed to the injury which this new republic might do they begin too late to see they mistake and desire to remedy what should have be remedy before combine against she to the number of forty nation whereupon the roman resort to a method usual with they in season of peril appoint a dictator that be give power to one man to decide without advice and carry out he resolve without appeal which expedient as it then enable they to overcome the danger by which they be threaten so always afterwards prove most serviceable when at any time during the growth of they power difficulty arise to embarrass they republic in connection with this league against rome we have first to note that when a mischief which spring up either in or against a republic and whether occasion by internal or external cause have grow to such proportion that it begin to fill the whole community with alarm it be a far safer course to temporize with it than to attempt to quell it by violence for commonly those who make this attempt only add fuel to the flame and hasten the impending ruin such disorder arise in a republic more often from internal cause than external either through some citizen be suffer to acquire undue influence or from the corruption of some institution of that republic which have once be the life and sinew of its freedom and from this corruption be allow to gain such head that the attempt to check it be more dangerous than to let it be and it be all the harder to recognize these disorder in they beginning because it seem natural to man to look with favor on the beginning of thing favor of this sort more than by anything else be attract by those action which seem to have in they a quality of greatness or which be perform by the young for when in a republic some young man be see to come forward endowed with rare excellence the eye of all the citizen be at once turn upon he and all without distinction concur to do he honor so that if he have one spark of ambition the advantage which he have from nature together with those he take from this favourable disposition of man 's mind raise he to such a pitch of power that when the citizen at last see they mistake it be almost impossible for they to correct it and when they do what they can to oppose he influence the only result be to extend it of this i might cite numerous example but shall content myself with one relate to we own city cosimo de ' medicus to whom the house of the medicus in florence owe the origin of its fortune acquire so great a name from the favor wherewith he own prudence and the blindness of other invest he that come to be hold in awe by the government he fellow-citizen deem it dangerous to offend he but still more dangerous to let he alone nicolò da uzzano he cotemporary who be account well verse in all civil affair but who have make a first mistake in not discerning the danger which might grow from the rise influence of cosimo would never while he live permit a second mistake to be make in attempt to crush he judge that such a attempt would be the ruin of the state as in truth it prove after he death for some who survive he disregard he counsel combine against cosimo and banish he from florence and so it come about that the partisan of cosimo angry at the wrong do he soon afterwards recall he and make he prince of the republic a dignity he never would have reach but for this open opposition the very same thing happen in rome in the case of cæsar for he service have gain he the good-will of pompey and other citizen they favor be presently turn to fear as cicero testify where he say that it be late that pompey begin to fear cæsar this fear lead man to think of remedy and the remedy to which they resort accelerate the destruction of the republic i say then that since it be difficult to recognize these disorder in they beginning because of the false impression which thing produce at the first it be a wiser course when they become know to temporize with they than to oppose they for when you temporize either they die out of themselves or at any rate the injury they do be defer and the prince who would suppress such disorder or oppose himself to they force and onset must always be on he guard lest he help where he would hinder retard when he would advance and drown the plant he think to water he must therefore study well the symptom of the disease and if he believe himself equal to the cure grapple with it fearlessly if not he must let it be and not attempt to treat it in any way for otherwise it will fare with he as it fare with those neighbor of rome for whom it would have be safer after that city have grow to be so great to have seek to soothe and restrain she by peaceful art than to provoke she by open war to contrive new means of attack and new method of defense for this league have no other effect than to make the roman more united and resolute than before and to bethink themselves of new expedient whereby they power be still more rapidly advance among which be the creation of a dictator for this innovation not only enable they to surmount the danger which then threaten they but be afterwards the means of escape infinite calamity into which without it the republic must have fall chapter xxxiv -- _ that the authority of the dictator do good and not harm to the roman republic : and that it be not those power which be give by the free suffrage of the people but those which ambitious citizen usurp for themselves that be pernicious to a state _ those citizen who first devise a dictatorship for rome have be blame by certain writer as though this have be the cause of the tyranny afterwards establish there for these author allege that the first tyrant of rome govern it with the title of dictator and that but for the existence of the office cæsar could never have cloak he usurpation under a constitutional name he who first take up this opinion have not well consider the matter and he conclusion have be accept without good ground for it be not the name nor office of dictator which bring rome to servitude but the influence which certain of she citizen be able to assume from the prolongation of they term of power so that even have the name of dictator be want in rome some other have be find to serve they end since power may readily give title but not title power we find accordingly that while the dictatorship be confer in conformity with public ordinance and not through personal influence it be constantly beneficial to the city for it be the magistracy create and the power usurp in unconstitutional way that hurt a republic not those which conform to ordinary rule so that in rome through the whole period of she history we never find a dictator who act otherwise than well for the republic for which there be the plainest reason in the first place to enable a citizen to work harm and to acquire undue authority many circumstance must be present which never can be present in a state which be not corrupt for such a citizen must be exceedingly rich and must have many retainer and partisan whom he can not have where the law be strictly observe and who if he have they would occasion so much alarm that the free suffrage of the people would seldom be in he favor in the second place the dictator be not create for life but for a fixed term and only to meet the emergency for which he be appoint power be indeed give he to determine by himself what measure the exigency demand to do what he have to do without consultation and to punish without appeal but he have no authority to do anything to the prejudice of the state as it would have be to deprive the senate or the people of they privilege to subvert the ancient institution of the city or introduce new so that take into account the brief time for which he office last its limited authority and the circumstance that the roman people be still uncorrupted it be impossible for he to overstep the just limit of he power so as to injure the city and in fact we find that he be always useful to it and in truth among the institution of rome this of the dictatorship deserve we special admiration and to be link with the chief cause of she greatness for without some such safeguard a city can hardly pass unharmed through extraordinary danger because as the ordinary institution of a commonwealth work but slowly no council and no magistrate have authority to act in everything alone but in most matter one standing in need of the other and time be require to reconcile they difference the remedy which they provide be most dangerous when they have to be apply in case which do not brook delay for which reason every republic ought to have some resource of this nature provide by its constitution as we find that the republic of venice one of the best of those now exist have in case of urgent danger reserve authority to a few of she citizen if agree among themselves to determine without further consultation what course be to be follow when a republic be not provide with some safeguard such as this either it must be ruin by observe constitutional form or else to save it these must be break through but in a republic nothing should be leave to be effect by irregular method because although for the time the irregularity may be useful the example will nevertheless be pernicious as give rise to a practice of violate the law for good end under color of which they may afterwards be violate for end which be not good for which reason that can never become a perfect republic wherein every contingency have not be foresee and provide for by the law and the method of deal with it define to sum up therefore i say that those republic which can not in sudden emergency resort either to a dictator or to some similar authority will when the danger be serious always be undo we may note moreover how prudently the roman in introduce this new office contrived the condition under which it be to be exercise for perceive that the appointment of a dictator involve something of humiliation for the consul who from be the head of the state be reduce to render obedience like every one else and anticipate that this might give offence they determine that the power to appoint should rest with the consul think that when the occasion come when rome should have need of this regal authority they would have the consul act willingly and feel the less aggrieved from the appointment be in they own hand for those wound or other injury which a man inflict upon himself by choice and of he own free will pain he far less than those inflict by another nevertheless in the later day of the republic the roman be wont to entrust this power to a consul instead of to a dictator use the formulum _ videat _ consul _ ne quid respublica detrimentus capiat _ but to return to the matter in hand i say briefly that when the neighbor of rome seek to crush she they lead she to take measure not merely for she readier defense but such as enable she to attack they with a stronger force with better skill and with a undivided command chapter xxxv -- _ why the creation of the decemvirate in rome although bring about by the free and open suffrage of the citizen be hurtful to the liberty of that republic _ the fact of those ten citizen who be choose by the roman people to make law for rome in time become she tyrant and deprive she of she freedom may seem contrary to what i have say above namely that it be the authority which be violently usurp and not that confer by the free suffrage of the people which be injurious to a republic here however we have to take into account both the mode in which and the term for which authority be give where authority be unrestricted and be confer for a long term meaning by that for a year or more it be always attend with danger and its result will be good or bad accord as the man be good or bad to whom it be commit now when we compare the authority of the ten with that possess by the dictator we see that the power place in the hand of the former be out of all proportion greater than that entrust to the latter for when a dictator be appoint there still remain the tribune the consul and the senate all of they invest with authority of which the dictator could not deprive they for even if he could have take he consulship from one man or he status as a senator from another he could not abolish the senatorial rank nor pass new law so that the senate the consul and the tribune continue to exist with undiminished authority be a check upon he and keep he in the right road but on the creation of the ten the opposite of all this take place for on they appointment consul and tribune be sweep away and express power be give to the new magistrate to make law and do whatever else they think fit with the entire authority of the whole roman people so that find themselves alone without consul or tribune to control they and with no appeal against they to the people and thus there be none to keep a watch upon they and further be stimulate by the ambition of appius in the second year of they office they begin to wax insolent let it be note therefore that when it be say that authority give by the public vote be never hurtful to any commonwealth it be assume that the people will never be lead to confer that authority without due limitation or for other than a reasonable term should they however either from be deceive or otherwise blind be induce to bestow authority imprudently as the roman bestow it on the ten it will always fare with they as with the roman and this may readily be understand on reflect what cause operate to keep the dictator good what to make the ten bad and by observe how those republic which have be account well govern have act when confer authority for a extended period as the spartan on they king and the venetian on they doge for it will be see that in both these instance the authority be control by check which make it impossible for it to be abused but where a uncontrolled authority be give no security be afford by the circumstance that the body of the people be not corrupt for in the briefest possible time absolute authority will make a people corrupt and obtain for itself friend and partisan nor will it be any hindrance to he in whom such authority be vest that he be poor and without connection for wealth and every other advantage will quickly follow as shall be show more fully when we discuss the appointment of the ten chapter xxxvi -- _ that citizen who have hold the higher office of a commonwealth should not disdain the lower _ under the consul m fabius and cn manlius the roman have a memorable victory in a battle fight with the veientine and the etruscan in which q fabius brother of the consul who have himself be consul the year before be slay this event may lead we to remark how well the method follow by the city of rome be suit to increase she power and how great a mistake be make by other republic in depart from they for eager as the roman be in the pursuit of glory they never esteem it a dishonor to obey one whom before they have command or to find themselves serve in the rank of a army which once they have lead this usage however be oppose to the idea the rule and the practice which prevail at the present day as for instance in venice where the notion still obtain that a citizen who have fill a great office should be ashamed to accept a less and where the state itself permit he to decline it this course assume it to lend lustre to individual citizen be plainly to the disadvantage of the community which have reason to hope more from and to trust more to the citizen who descend from a high office to fill a lower than he who rise from a low office to fill a high one for in the latter no confidence can reasonably be place unless he be see to have other about he of such credit and worth that it may be hope they wise counsel and influence will correct he inexperience but have the usage which prevail in venice and in other modern commonwealth and kingdom prevail in rome whereby he who have once be consul be never afterwards to go with the army except as consul numberless result must have follow detrimental to the free institution of that city as well from the mistake which the inexperience of new man would have occasion as because from they ambition have a freer course and from they have none near they in whose presence they might fear to do amiss they would have grow less scrupulous and in this way the public service must have suffer grave harm chapter xxxvii -- _ of the mischief breed in rome by the agrarian law : and how it be a great source of disorder in a commonwealth to pass a law oppose to ancient usage and with stringent retrospective effect _ it have be say by ancient writer that to be pinch by adversity or pampered by prosperity be the common lot of man and that in whichever way they be act upon the result be the same for when no longer urge to war on one another by necessity they be urge by ambition which have such dominion in they heart that it never leave they to whatsoever height they climb for nature have so order it that while they desire everything it be impossible for they to have everything and thus they desire be always in excess of they capacity to gratify they they remain constantly dissatisfied and discontented and hence the vicissitude in human affair for some seek to enlarge they possession and some to keep what they have get war and enmity ensue from which result the ruin of one country and the growth of another i be lead to these reflection from observe that the common of rome be not content to secure themselves against the noble by the creation of tribune a measure to which they be drive by necessity but after effect this forthwith enter upon a ambitious contest with the noble seek to share with they what all man most esteem namely they honor and they wealth hence be breed that disorder from which spring the feud relate to the agrarian law and which lead in the end to the downfall of the roman republic and although it should be the object of every well-governed commonwealth to make the state rich and keep individual citizen poor it must be allow that in the matter of this law the city of rome be to blame whether for have pass it at first in such a shape as to require it to be continually recast or for have postpone it so long that its retrospective effect be the occasion of tumult or else because although rightly frame at first it have come in its operation to be pervert but in whatever way it happen so it be that this law be never speak of in rome without the whole city be convulse the law itself embrace two principal provision by one it be enact that no citizen should possess more than a fixed number of acre of land by the other that all land take from the enemy should be distribute among the whole people a twofold blow be thus aim at the noble since all who possess more land than the law allow as most of the noble do fall to be deprive of it while by divide the land of the enemy among the whole people the road to wealth be close these two grounds of offence be give to a powerful class to whom it appear that by resist the law they do a service to the state the whole city as i have say be throw into a uproar on the mere mention of its name the noble indeed seek to temporize and to prevail by patience and address sometimes call out the army sometimes oppose another tribune to the one who be promote the law and sometimes come to a compromise by send a colony into the land which be to be divide as be do in the case of the territory of antium whither on a dispute concern the law have arise settler be send from rome and the land make over to they in speaking of which colony titus livius make the notable remark that hardly any one in rome could be get to take part in it so much readier be the common to indulge in covetous scheme at home than to realize they by leave it the ill humor engender by this contest continue to prevail until the roman begin to carry they arm into the remoter part of italy and to country beyond its shore after which it seem for a time to slumber -- and this because the land hold by the enemy of rome out of sight of she citizen and too remote to be conveniently cultivate come to be less desire whereupon the roman grow less eager to punish they enemy by divide they land and be content when they deprive any city of its territory to send colonist to occupy it for cause such as these the measure remain in abeyance down to the time of the gracchus but be by they revive finally overthrow the liberty of rome for as it find the power of its adversary double such a flame of hatred be kindle between common and senate that regardless of all civil restraint they resort to arm and bloodshed and as the public magistrate be powerless to provide a remedy each of the two faction have no longer any hope from they resolve to do what it could for itself and to set up a chief for its own protection on reach this stage of tumult and disorder the common lend they influence to marius make he four time consul whose authority lasting thus long and with very brief interval become so firmly root that he be able to make himself consul other three time against this scourge the noble lack other defense set themselves to favor syllum and place he at the head of they faction enter on the civil war wherein after much blood have be spill and after many change of fortune they get the better of they adversary but afterwards in the time of cæsar and pompey the distemper break out afresh for cæsar head the marian party and pompey that of syllum and war ensue the victory remain with cæsar who be the first tyrant in rome after whose time that city be never again free such therefore be the beginning and such the end of the agrarian law but since it have elsewhere be say that the struggle between the common and senate of rome preserve she liberty as give rise to law favourable to freedom it might seem that the consequence of the agrarian law be oppose to that view i be not however lead to alter my opinion on this account for i maintain that the ambition of the great be so pernicious that unless control and counteract in a variety of way it will always reduce a city to speedy ruin so that if the controversy over the agrarian law take three hundred year to bring rome to slavery she would in all likelihood have be bring to slavery in a far shorter time have not the common by means of this law and by other demand constantly restrain the ambition of the noble we may also learn from this contest how much more man value wealth than honor for in the matter of honor the roman noble always give way to the common without any extraordinary resistance but when it come to be a question of property so stubborn be they in its defense that the common to effect they end have to resort to those irregular method which have be describe above of which irregularity the prime mover be the gracchus whose motive be more to be commend than they measure since to pass a law with stringent retrospective effect in order to remove a abuse of long standing in a republic be a unwise step and one which as i have already show at length can have no other result than to accelerate the mischief to which the abuse lead whereas if you temporize either the abuse develop more slowly or else in course of time and before it come to a head die out of itself chapter xxxviii -- _ that weak republic be irresolute and undecided and that the course they may take depend more on necessity than choice _ a terrible pestilence break out in rome seem to the equian and volscian to offer a fit opportunity for crush she the two nation therefore assemble a great army attack the latin and hernician and lay waste they country whereupon the latin and hernician be force to make they case know to the roman and to ask to be defend by they the roman who be sorely afflict by the pestilence answer that they must look to they own defense and with they own force since rome be in no position to succor they here we recognize the prudence and magnanimity of the roman senate and how at all time and in all change of fortune they assume the responsibility of determine the course they country should take and be not ashamed when necessary to decide on a course contrary to that which be usual with they or which they have decide to follow on some other occasion i say this because on other occasion this same senate have forbid these nation to defend themselves and a less prudent assembly might have think it lower they credit to withdraw that prohibition but the roman senate always take a sound view of thing and always accept the least hurtful course as the best so that although it be distasteful to they not to be able to defend they subject and equally distasteful -- both for the reason give and for other which may be understand -- that they subject should take up arm in they absence nevertheless know that these must have recourse to arm in any case since the enemy be upon they they take a honorable course in decide that what have to be do should be do with they leave lest man drive to disobey by necessity should come afterwards to disobey from choice and although this may seem the course which every republic ought reasonably to follow nevertheless weak and badly-advised republic can not make up they mind to follow it not know how to do themselves honor in like extremity after duke valentino have take faenza and force bologna to yield to he term desire to return to rome through tuscany he send one of he people to florence to ask leave for himself and he army to pass a council be hold in florence to consider how this request should be deal with but no one be favourable to the leave ask for be grant wherein the roman method be not follow for as the duke have a very strong force with he while the florentine be so bare of troops that they could not have prevent he passage it would have be far more for they credit that he should seem to pass with they consent than that he should pass in spite of they because while discredit have to be incur either way they would have incur less by accede to he demand but of all course the worst for a weak state be to be irresolute for then whatever it do will seem to be do under compulsion so that if by chance it should do anything well this will be set down to necessity and not to prudence of this i shall cite two other instance happen in we own time and in we own country in the year 1500 king loui of france after recover milan be desirous to restore pisa to the florentine so as to obtain payment from they of the fifty thousand ducat which they have promise he on the restitution be complete send troops to pisa under m beaumont in whom though a frenchman the florentine put much trust beaumont accordingly take up he position with he force between cascina and pisa to be in readiness to attack the town after he have be there for some day make arrangement for the assault envoy come to he from pisa offering to surrender they city to the french if a promise be give in the king 's name not to hand it over to the florentine until four month have run this condition be absolutely reject by the florentine and the siege be proceed with they be force to retire with disgrace now the proposal of the pisan be reject by the florentine for no other reason than that they distrust the good faith of the king into whose hand they weakness oblige they to commit themselves and do not reflect how much more it be for they interest that by obtain entrance into pisa he should have it in he power to restore the town to they or fail to restore it should at once disclose he design than that remain outside he should put they off with promise for which they have to pay it would therefore have be a far better course for the florentine to have agree to beaumont take possession on whatever term this be see afterwards by experience in the year 1502 when on the revolt of arezzo m imbalt be send by the king of france with french troops to assist the florentine for when he get near arezzo and begin to negotiate with the aretine who like the pisan be willing to surrender they town on term the acceptance of these term be strongly disapprove in florence which imbalt learning and think that the florentine be act with little sense he take the entire settlement of condition into he own hand and without consult the florentine commissioner conclude a arrangement to he own satisfaction in execution of which he enter arezzo with he army and he let the florentine know that he think they fool and ignorant of the way of the world since if they desire to have arezzo they could signify they wish to the king who would be much better able to give it they when he have he soldier inside than when he have they outside the town nevertheless in florence they never cease to blame and abuse m imbalt until at last they come to see that if beaumont have act in the same way they would have get possession of pisa as well as of arezzo apply what have be say to the matter in hand we find that irresolute republic unless upon compulsion never follow wise course for wherever there be room for doubt they weakness will not suffer they to come to any resolve so that unless they doubt be overcome by some superior force which impel they forward they remain always in suspense chapter xxxix -- _ that often the same accident be see to befall different nation _ any one compare the present with the past will soon perceive that in all city and in all nation there prevail the same desire and passion as always have prevail for which reason it should be a easy matter for he who carefully examine past event to foresee those which be about to happen in any republic and to apply such remedy as the ancient have use in like case or find none which have be use by they to strike out new one such as they might have use in similar circumstance but these lesson be neglect or not understand by reader or if understand by they be unknown to ruler it follow that the same disorder be common to all time in the year 1494 the republic of florence have lose a portion of its territory include pisa and other town be force to make war against those who have take possession of they who be powerful it follow that great sum be spend on these war to little purpose this large expenditure have to be meet by heavy tax which give occasion to numberless complaint on the part of the people and inasmuch as the war be conduct by a council of ten citizen who be style the ten of the war the multitude begin to regard these with displeasure as though they be the cause of the war and of the consequent expenditure and at last persuade themselves that if they get rid of this magistracy there would be a end to the war wherefore when the magistracy of the ten should have be renew the people do not renew it but suffer it to lapse entrust they affair to the signory this course be most pernicious since not only do it fail to put a end to the war as the people expect it would but by set aside man who have conduct it with prudence lead to such mishap that not pisa only but arezzo also and many other town besides be lose to florence whereupon the people recognize they mistake and that the evil be in the disease and not in the physician reinstate the magistracy of the ten similar dissatisfaction grow up in rome against the consular authority for the people see one war follow another and that they be never allow to rest when they should have ascribe this to the ambition of neighbouring nation who desire they overthrow ascribe it to the ambition of the noble who as they believe be unable to wreak they hatred against they within the city where they be protect by the power of the tribune seek to lead they outside the city where they be under the authority of the consul that they might crush they where they be without help in which belief they think it necessary either to get rid of the consul altogether or so to restrict they power as to leave they no authority over the people either in the city or out of it the first who attempt to pass a law to this effect be the tribune terentillus who propose that a committee of five should be name to consider and regulate the power of the consul this rouse the anger of the noble to whom it seem that the greatness of they authority be about to set for ever and that no part would be leave they in the administration of the republic such however be the obstinacy of the tribune that they succeed in abolish the consular title nor be satisfy until after other change it be resolve that in room of consul tribune should be appoint with consular power so much greater be they hatred of the name than of the thing for a long time matter remain on this footing till eventually the common discover they mistake resume the appointment of consul in the same way as the florentine revert to the ten of the war chapter xl -- _ of the creation of the decemvirate in rome and what therein be to be note wherein among other matter be show how the same cause may lead to the safety or to the ruin of a commonwealth _ it be my desire to treat fully of those disorder which arise in rome on the creation of the decemvirate i think it not amiss first of all to relate what take place at the time of that creation and then to discuss those circumstance attend it which seem most to deserve notice these be numerous and should be well consider both by those who would maintain the liberty of a commonwealth and by those who would subvert they for in the course of we inquiry it will be see that many mistake prejudicial to freedom be make by the senate and people and that many be likewise make by appius the chief decemvir prejudicial to that tyranny which it be he aim to establish in rome after much controversy and wrangle between the common and the noble as to the framing of new law by which the freedom of rome might be better secure spurius posthumius and two other citizen be by general consent despatch to athen to procure copy of the law which solon have draw up for the athenian to the end that these might serve as a groundwork for the law of rome on they return the next step be to depute certain person to examine these law and to draft the new code for which purpose a commission consist of ten member among whom be appius claudius a crafty and ambitious citizen be appoint for a year and that the commissioner in frame they law might act without fear or favor all the other magistracy and in particular the consulate and tribuneship be suspend and the appeal to the people discontinue so that the decemvir come to be absolute in rome very soon the whole authority of the commissioner come to be centre in appius owing to the favor in which he be hold by the common for although before he have be regard as the cruel persecutor of the people he now show himself so conciliatory in he bearing that man wonder at the sudden change in he character and disposition this set of commissioner then behave discreetly be attend by no more than twelve lictor walk in front of that decemvir whom the rest put forward as they chief and though vest with absolute authority yet when a roman citizen have to be try for murder they cite he before the people and cause he to be judge by they they law they write upon ten table but before sign they they expose they publicly that every one might read and consider they and if any defect be discover in they it might be correct before they be finally pass at this juncture appius cause it to be notify throughout the city that be two other table add to these ten the law would be complete hope that under this belief the people would consent to continue the decemvirate for another year this consent the people willingly give partly to prevent the consul be reinstate and partly because they think they could hold they ground without the aid of the tribune who as have already be say be the judge in criminal case on it be resolve to reappoint the decemvirate all the noble set to canvass for the office appius among the foremost and such cordiality do he display towards the common while seek they vote that the other candidate _ unable to persuade themselves that so much affability on the part of so proud a man be wholly disinterested _ begin to suspect he but fear to oppose he openly seek to circumvent he by put he forward though the youngest of they all to declare to the people the name of the propose decemvir think that he would not venture to name himself that be a unusual course in rome and hold discreditable _ but what they mean as a hindrance he turn to account _ by propose to the surprise and displeasure of the whole nobility he own name first and then nominate nine other on whose support he think he could depend the new appointment which be to last for a year have be make appius soon let both common and noble know the mistake they have commit for throw off the mask he allow he innate arrogance to appear and speedily infected he colleague with the same spirit who to overawe the people and the senate instead of twelve lictor appoint one hundred and twenty for a time they measure be direct against high and low alike but presently they begin to intrigue with the senate and to attack the common and if any of the latter on be harshly use by one decemvir venture to appeal to another he be worse handle on the appeal than in the first instance the common on discover they error begin in they despair to turn they eye towards the noble _ and to look for a breeze of freedom from that very quarter whence fear slavery they have bring the republic to its present strait _ to the noble the suffering of the common be not displease from the hope _ that disgust with the exist state of affair they too might come to desire the restoration of the consul _ when the year for which the decemvir be appoint at last come to a end the two additional table of the law be ready but have not yet be publish this be make a pretext by they for prolong they magistracy which they take measure to retain by force gathering round they for this purpose a retinue of young nobleman whom they enrich with the goods of those citizen whom they have condemn _ corrupt by which gift these youth come to prefer selfish licence to public freedom _ it happen that at this time the sabine and volscian begin to stir up a war against rome and it be during the alarm thereby occasion that the decemvir be first make aware how weak be they position for without the senate they could take no warlike measure while by assemble the senate they seem to put a end to they own authority nevertheless be drive to it by necessity they take this latter course when the senate meet many of the senator but particularly valerius and horatius inveigh against the insolence of the decemvir whose power would forthwith have be cut short have not the senate through jealousy of the common decline to exercise they authority for they think that be the decemvir to lay down office of they own free will tribune might not be reappoint wherefore they decide for war and send forth the army under command of certain of the decemvir but appius remain behind to govern the city it so fall out that he become enamoured of virginium and that when he seek to lay violent hand upon she virginius she father to save she from dishonor slew she thereupon follow tumult in rome and mutiny among the soldier who make common cause with the rest of the plebeian betake themselves to the sacred hill and there remain until the decemvir lay down they office when tribune and consul be once more appoint rome be restore to she ancient freedom in these event we note first of all that the pernicious step of create this tyranny in rome be due to the same cause which commonly give rise to tyranny in city namely the excessive love of the people for liberty and the passionate eagerness of the noble to govern for when they can not agree to pass some measure favourable to freedom one faction or the other set itself to support some one man and a tyranny at once spring up both party in rome consent to the creation of the decemvir and to they exercise unrestricted power from the desire which the one have to put a end to the consular name and the other to abolish the authority of the tribune when on the appointment of the decemvirate it seem to the common that appius have become favourable to they cause and be ready to attack the noble they incline to support he but when a people be lead to commit this error of lend its support to some one man in order that he may attack those whom it hold in hatred if he only be prudent he will inevitably become the tyrant of that city for he will wait until with the support of the people he can deal a fatal blow to the noble and will never set himself to oppress the people until the noble have be root out but when that time come the people although they recognize they servitude will have none to whom they can turn for help have this method which have be follow by all who have successfully establish tyranny in republic be follow by appius he power would have be more stable and lasting whereas take the directly opposite course he could not have act more unwisely than he do for in he eagerness to grasp the tyranny he make himself obnoxious to those who be in fact confer it and who could have maintain he in it and he destroy those who be he friend while he seek friendship from those from whom he could not have it for although it be the desire of the noble to tyrannize that section of they which find itself outside the tyranny be always hostile to the tyrant who can never succeed in gain over the entire body of the noble by reason of they greed and ambition for no tyrant can ever have honor or wealth enough to satisfy they all in abandon the people therefore and siding with the noble appius commit a manifest mistake as well for the reason above give as because to hold a thing by force he who use force must need be stronger than he against whom it be use whence it happen that those tyrant who have the mass of the people for they friend and the noble for they enemy be more secure than those who have the people for they enemy and the noble for they friend because in the former case they authority have the stronger support for with such support a ruler can maintain himself by the internal strength of he state as do nabi tyrant of sparta when attack by the roman and by the whole of greece for make sure work with the noble who be few in number and have the people on he side he be able with they assistance to defend himself which he could not have do have they be against he but in the case of a city wherein the tyrant have few friend its internal strength will not avail he for its defense and he will have to seek aid from without in one of three shape for either he must hire foreign guard to defend he person or he must arm the peasantry so that they may play the part which ought to be play by the citizen or he must league with powerful neighbor for he defense he who follow these method and observe they well may contrive to save himself though he have the people for he enemy but appius could not follow the plan of gain over the peasantry since in rome they and the people be one and what he might have do he know not how to do and so be ruin at the very outset in create the decemvirate therefore both the senate and the people make grave mistake for although as already explain when speaking of the dictatorship it be those magistrate who make themselves and not those make by the vote of the people that be hurtful to freedom nevertheless the people in create magistrate ought to take such precaution as will make it difficult for these to become bad but the roman when they ought to have set a check on the decemvir in order to keep they good dispense with it make they the sole magistrate of rome and set aside all other and this from the excessive desire of the senate to get rid of the tribune and of the common to get rid of the consul by which object both be so blind as to fall into all the disorder which ensue for as king ferrando be wont to say man often behave like certain of the smaller bird which be so intent on the prey to which nature incite they that they discern not the eagle hover overhead for they destruction in this discourse then the mistake make by the roman people in they effort to preserve they freedom and the mistake make by appius in he endeavor to obtain the tyranny have as i propose at the outset be plainly show chapter xli -- _ that it be unwise to pass at a bind from leniency to severity or to a haughty bearing from a humble _ among the crafty device use by appius to aid he in maintain he authority this of suddenly pass from one character to the other extreme be of no small prejudice to he for he fraud in pretend to the common to be well disposed towards they be happily contrived as be also the means he take to bring about the reappointment of the decemvirate most skilful too be he audacity in nominating himself contrary to the expectation of the noble and in propose colleague on whom he could depend to carry out he end but as i have say already it be not happily contrived that after do all this he should suddenly turn round and from be the friend reveal himself the enemy of the people haughty instead of humane cruel instead of kindly and make this change so rapidly as to leave himself no shadow of excuse but compel all to recognize the doubleness of he nature for he who have once seem good should he afterwards choose for he own end to become bad ought to change by slow degree and as opportunity serve so that before he altered nature strip he of old favor he may have gain for himself a equal share of new and thus he influence suffer no diminution for otherwise be at once unmask and friendless he be undo : chapter xlii -- _ how easily man become corrupted _ in this matter of the decemvirate we may likewise note the ease wherewith man become corrupted and how completely although bear good and well bring up they change they nature for we see how favourably dispose the youth whom appius gather round he become towards he tyranny in return for the trifling benefit which they draw from it and how quintus fabius one of the second decemvirate and a most worthy man blind by a little ambition and mislead by the evil counsel of appius abandon he fair fame betook himself to most unworthy course and grow like he master careful consideration of this should make those who frame law for commonwealth and kingdom more alive to the necessity of place restraint on man 's evil appetite and deprive they of all hope of do wrong with impunity chapter xliii -- _ that man fight in they own cause make good and resolute soldier _ from what have be touch upon above we be also lead to remark how wide be the difference between a army which have no ground for discontent fight in its own cause and one which be discontented fight to satisfy the ambition of other for whereas the roman be always victorious under the consul under the decemvir they be always defeat this help we to understand why it be that mercenary troops be worthless namely that they have no incitement to keep they true to you beyond the pittance which you pay they which neither be nor can be a sufficient motive for such fidelity and devotion as would make they willing to die in you behalf but in those army in which there exist not such a attachment towards he for whom they fight as make they devoted to he cause there never will be valor enough to withstand a enemy if only he be a little brave and since such attachment and devotion can not be look for from any save you own subject you must if you would preserve you dominion or maintain you commonwealth or kingdom arm the native of you country as we see to have be do by all those who have achieve great thing in war under the decemvir the ancient valor of the roman soldier have in no degree abate yet because they be no longer animated by the same good will they do not exert themselves as they be wont but so soon as the decemvirate come to a end and the soldier begin once more to fight as free man the old spirit be reawaken and as a consequence they enterprise accord to former usage be bring to a successful close chapter xliv -- _ that the multitude be helpless without a head : and that we should not with the same breath threaten and ask leave _ when virginium die by she father 's hand the common of rome withdraw under arm to the sacred hill whereupon the senate send messenger to demand by what sanction they have desert they commander and assemble there in arm and in such reverence be the authority of the senate hold that the common lack leader durst make no reply not say titus livius that they be at a loss what to answer but because they have none to answer for they word which clearly show how helpless a thing be the multitude when without a head this defect be perceive by virginius at whose instance twenty military tribune be appoint by the common to be they spokesman with the senate and to negotiate term who have ask that valerius and horatius might be send to they to whom they wish would be make know these decline to go until the decemvir have lay down they office when this be do and valerius and horatius come to the hill where the common be assemble the latter demand that tribune of the people should be appoint that in future there should be a appeal to the people from the magistrate of whatever degree and that all the decemvir should be give up to they to be burn alive valerius and horatius approve the first two demand but reject the last as inhuman tell the common that they be rush into that very cruelty which they themselves have condemn in other and counsel they to say nothing about the decemvir but to be satisfy to regain they own power and authority since thus the way would be open to they for obtain every redress here we see plainly how foolish and unwise it be to ask a thing and with the same breath to say i desire this that i may inflict a injury for we should never declare we intention beforehand but watch for every opportunity to carry it out so that it be enough to ask another for he weapon without add with these i purpose to destroy you for when once you have secure he weapon you can use they afterwards as you please chapter xlv -- _ that it be of evil example especially in the maker of a law not to observe the law when make : and that daily to renew act of injustice in a city be most hurtful to the governor _ term have be adjust and the old order of thing restore in rome virginius cite appius to defend himself before the people and on he appear attend by many of the noble order he to be lead to prison whereupon appius begin to cry out and appeal to the people but virginius tell he that he be unworthy to be allow that appeal which he have himself do away with or to have that people whom he have wrong for he protector appius rejoin that the people should not set at nought that right of appeal which they themselves have insist on with so much zeal nevertheless he be drag to prison and before the day of trial slew himself now though the wicked life of appius merit every punishment still it be impolitic to violate the law more particularly a law which have only just be pass for nothing i think be of worse example in a republic than to make a law and not to keep it and most of all when he who break be he that make it after the year 1494 the city of florence reform its government with the help of the friar girolamo savonarolum whose writings declare he learn he wisdom and the excellence of he heart among other ordinance for the safety of the citizen he cause a law to be pass allow a appeal to the people from the sentence pronounce by the eight and by the signory in trial for state offence a law he have long contend for and carry at last with great difficulty it so happen that a very short time after it be pass five citizen be condemn to death by the signory for state offence and that when they seek to appeal to the people they be not permit to do so and the law be violate this more than any other mischance help to lessen the credit of the friar since if he law of appeal be salutary he should have cause it to be observe if useless he ought not to have promote it and he inconsistency be the more remark because in all the sermon which he preach after the law be break he never either blame or excuse the person who have break it as though unwilling to condemn while unable to justify what suit he purpose this as betray the ambitious and partial turn of he mind take from he reputation and expose he to much obloquy another thing which greatly hurt a government be to keep alive bitter feeling in man 's mind by often renew attack on individual as be do in rome after the decemvirate be put a end to for each of the decemvir and other citizen besides be at different time accuse and condemn so that the greatest alarm be spread through the whole body of the noble who come to believe that these prosecution would never cease until they entire order be exterminate and this must have lead to grave mischief have not marcus duilius the tribune provide against it by a edict which forbid every one for the period of a year cite or accuse any roman citizen a ordinance which have the effect of reassure the whole nobility here we see how hurtful it be for a prince or commonwealth to keep the mind of they subject in constant alarm and suspense by continually renew punishment and violence and in truth no course can be more pernicious for man who be in fear for they safety will seize on every opportunity for secure themselves against the danger which surround they and will grow at once more daring and less scrupulous in resort to new course for these reason we should either altogether avoid inflict injury or should inflict every injury at a stroke and then seek to reassure man 's mind and suffer they to settle down and rest chapter xlvi -- _ that man climb from one step of ambition to another seek at first to escape injury and then to injure other _ as the common of rome on recover they freedom be restore to they former position -- nay to one still stronger since many new law have be pass which confirm and extend they authority -- it might reasonably have be hope that rome would for a time remain at rest the event however show the contrary for from day to day there arise in that city new tumult and fresh dissension and since the cause which bring this about have be most judiciously set forth by titus livius it seem to I much to the purpose to cite he own word when he say that whenever either the common or the noble be humble the other grow haughty so that if the common keep within due bound the young noble begin to inflict injury upon they against which the tribune who be themselves make the object of outrage be little able to give redress while the noble on they part although they could not close they eye to the ill behavior of they young man be yet well pleased that if excess be to be commit they should be commit by they own faction and not by the common thus the desire to secure its own liberty prompt each faction to make itself strong enough to oppress the other for this be the common course of thing that in seek to escape cause for fear man come to give other cause to be afraid by inflict on they those wrong from which they strive to relieve themselves as though the choice lay between injure and be injure herein among other thing we perceive in what way commonwealth be overthrow and how man climb from one ambition to another and recognize the truth of those word which sallust put in the mouth of cæsar that _ all ill action have they origin in fair beginning _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- for as i have say already the ambitious citizen in a commonwealth seek at the outset to secure himself against injury not only at the hand of private person but also of the magistrate to effect which he endeavor to gain himself friend these he obtain by means honorable in appearance either by supply they with money or protect they against the powerful and because such conduct seem praiseworthy every one be readily deceive by it and consequently no remedy be apply pursue these method without hindrance this man presently come to be so powerful that private citizen begin to fear he and the magistrate to treat he with respect but when he have advance thus far on the road to power without encounter opposition he have reach a point at which it be most dangerous to cope with he it be dangerous as i have before explain to contend with a disorder which have already make progress in a city nevertheless when he have bring thing to this pass you must either endeavor to crush he at the risk of immediate ruin or else unless death or some like accident interpose you incur inevitable slavery by let he alone for when as i have say it have come to this that the citizen and even the magistrate fear to offend he and he friend little further effort will afterwards be need to enable he to proscribe and ruin whom he please a republic ought therefore to provide by its ordinance that none of its citizen shall under color of do good have it in they power to do evil but shall be suffer to acquire such influence only as may aid and not injure freedom how this may be do shall presently be explain -lrb- footnote 1 : quod omnium mala exempla ex bonis initiis orta sunt -lrb- sall cat 51 -rrb- -rrb- chapter xlvii -- _ that though man deceive themselves in generality in particulars they judge truly _ the common of rome have as i have say grown disgusted with the consular name and desire either that man of plebeian birth should be admit to the office or its authority be restrict the noble to prevent its degradation in either of these two way propose a middle course whereby four tribune who might either be plebeian or noble be to be create with consular authority this compromise satisfy the common who think they would thus get rid of the consulship and secure the highest office of the state for they own order but here a circumstance happen worth note when the four tribune come to be choose the people who have it in they power to choose all from the common choose all from the noble with respect to which election titus livius observe that _ the result show that the people when declare they honest judgment after controversy be over be govern by a different spirit from that which have inspire they while contend for they liberty and for a share in public honor _ the reason for this i believe to be that man deceive themselves more readily in general than in particulars to the common of rome it seem in the abstract that they have every right to be admit to the consulship since they party in the city be the more numerous since they bear the greater share of danger in they war and since it be they who by they valor keep rome free and make she powerful and because it appear to they as i have say that they desire be a reasonable one they be resolve to satisfy it at all hazard but when they have to form a particular judgment on the man of they own party they recognize they defect and decide that individually no one of they be deserving of what collectively they seem entitle to and be ashamed of they turn to bestow they honor on those who deserve they of which decision titus livius speaking with due admiration say _ where shall we now find in any one man that modesty moderation and magnanimity which be then common to the entire people _ as confirm what i have say i shall cite another noteworthy incident which occur in capua after the rout of the roman by hannibal at cannæ for all italy be convulse by that defeat capua too be threaten with civil tumult through the hatred which prevail between she people and senate but pacuvius calavius who at this time fill the office of chief magistrate perceive the danger take upon himself to reconcile the contend faction with this object he assemble the senate and point out to they the hatred in which they be hold by the people and the risk they run of be put to death by they and of the city now that the roman be in distress be give up to hannibal but he add that be they to consent to leave the matter with he he think he could contrive to reconcile they in the meanwhile however he must shut they up in the palace that by put it in the power of the people to punish they he might secure they safety the senate consent to this proposal he shut they up in the palace and summon the people to a public meeting tell they the time have at last come for they to trample on the insolence of the noble and requite the wrong suffer at they hand for he have they all safe under bolt and bar but as he suppose they do not wish the city to remain without ruler it be fit before put the old senator to death they should appoint other in they room wherefore he have throw the name of all the old senator into a bag and would now proceed to draw they out one by one and as they be draw would cause they to be put to death so soon as a successor be find for each when the first name he draw be declare there arise a great uproar among the people all cry out against the cruelty pride and arrogance of that senator whose name it be but on pacuvius desire they to propose a substitute the meeting be quiet and after a brief pause one of the common be nominate no sooner however be he name mention than one begin to whistle another to laugh some jeer at he in one way and some in another and the same thing happen in every case each and all of those nominate be judge unworthy of senatorial rank whereupon pacuvius profit by the opportunity say since you be agree that the city would be badly off without a senate but be not agree whom to appoint in the room of the old senator it will perhaps be well for you to be reconcile to they for the fear into which they have be throw must have so subdue they that you be sure to find in they that affability which hitherto you have look for in vain this proposal be agree to a reconciliation follow between the two order the common have see they error so soon as they be oblige to come to particulars a people therefore be apt to err in judge of thing and they accident in the abstract but on become acquaint with particulars speedily discover its mistake in the year 1494 when she greatest citizen be banish from florence and no regular government any longer exist there but a spirit of licence prevail and matter go continually from bad to worse many florentine perceive the decay of they city and discerning no other cause for it blame the ambition of this or the other powerful citizen who they think be foment these disorder with a view to establish a government to he own liking and to rob they of they liberty those who think thus would hang about the arcade and public square malign many citizen and give it to be understand that if ever they find themselves in the signory they would expose the design of these citizen and have they punish from time to time it happen that one or another of those who use this language rise to be of the chief magistracy and so soon as he obtain this advancement and see thing nearer become aware whence the disorder i have speak of really come the danger attend they and the difficulty in deal with they and recognize that they be the growth of the time and not occasion by particular man suddenly alter he view and conduct a nearer knowledge of fact free he from the false impression he have be lead into on a general view of affair but those who have hear he speak as a private citizen when they see he remain inactive after he be make a magistrate believe that this arise not from he have obtain any better knowledge of thing but from he have be cajole or corrupt by the great and this happen with many man and often it come to be a proverb among the people that _ man have one mind in the market-place another in the palace _ reflect on what have be say we see how quickly man 's eye may be open if know that they deceive themselves in generality we can find a way to make they pass to particulars as pacuvius do in the case of the capuan and the senate in the case of rome nor do i believe that any prudent man need shrink from the judgment of the people in question relate to particulars as for instance in the distribution of honor and dignity for in such matter only the people be either never mistaken or at any rate far seldomer than a small number of person would be be the distribution entrust to they it seem to I however not out of place to notice in the follow chapter a method employ by the roman senate to enlighten the people in make this distribution chapter xlviii -- _ he who would not have a office bestow on some worthless or wicked person should contrive that it be solicit by one who be utterly worthless and wicked or else by one who be in the highest degree noble and good _ whenever the senate see a likelihood of the tribune with consular power be choose exclusively from the common it take one or other of two way -- either by cause the office to be solicit by the most distinguish among the citizen or else to confess the truth by bribe some base and ignoble fellow to fasten himself on to those other plebeian of better quality who be seek the office and become a candidate conjointly with they the latter device make the people ashamed to give the former ashamed to refuse this confirm what i say in my last chapter as to the people deceive themselves in generality but not in particulars chapter xlix -- _ that if city which like rome have they beginning in freedom have have difficulty in frame such law as would preserve they freedom city which at the first have be in subjection will find this almost impossible _ how hard it be in found a commonwealth to provide it with all the law need to maintain its freedom be well see from the history of the roman republic for although ordinance be give it first by romulus then by numa afterwards by tullus hostilius and servius and lastly by the ten create for the express purpose nevertheless in the actual government of rome new need be continually develop to meet which new ordinance have constantly to be devise as in the creation of the censor who be one of the chief mean by which rome be keep free during the whole period of she constitutional government for as the censor become the arbiter of moral in rome it be very much owe to they that the progress of the roman towards corruption be retard and though at the first creation of the office a mistake be doubtless make in fix its term at five year this be correct not long after by the wisdom of the dictator mamercus who pass a law reduce it to eighteen month a change which the censor then in office take in such ill part that they deprive mamercus of he rank as a senator this step be much blame both by the common and the father still as we history do not record that mamercus obtain any redress we must infer either that the historian have omit something or that on this head the law of rome be defective since it be never well that the law of a commonwealth should suffer a citizen to incur irremediable wrong because he promote a measure favourable to freedom but return to the matter under consideration we have in connection with the creation of this new office to note that if those city which as be the case with rome have have they beginning in freedom and have by themselves maintain that freedom have experience great difficulty in frame good law for the preservation of they liberty it be little to be wonder at that city which at the first be dependent should find it not difficult merely but impossible so to shape they ordinance as to enable they to live free and undisturbed this difficulty we see to have arise in the case of florence which be subject at first to the power of rome and subsequently to that of other ruler remain long in servitude take no thought for herself and even afterwards when she could breathe more freely and begin to frame she own law these since they be blended with ancient ordinance which be bad could not themselves be good and thus for the two hundred year of which we have trustworthy record we city have go on patch she institution without ever possess a government in respect of which she could truly be term a commonwealth the difficulty which have be feel in florence be the same as have be feel in all city which have have a like origin and although repeatedly by the free and public vote of she citizen ample authority have be give to a few of they number to reform she constitution no alteration of general utility have ever be introduce but only such as forward the interest of the party to which those commission to make change belong this instead of order have occasion the greatest disorder in we city but to come to particulars i say that among other matter which have to be consider by the founder of a commonwealth be the question into whose hand should be commit the power of life and death over its citizen ' this be well see to in rome where as a rule there be a right of appeal to the people but where on any urgent case arise in which it might have be dangerous to delay the execution of a judicial sentence recourse could be have to a dictator with power to execute justice at once a remedy however never resort to save in case of extremity but florence and other city have a like origin commit this power into the hand of a foreigner whom they style captain and as he be open to be corrupt by powerful citizen this be a pernicious course alter this arrangement afterwards in consequence of change in they government they appoint eight citizen to discharge the office of captain but this for a reason already mention namely that a few will always be govern by the will of a few and these the most powerful be a change from bad to worse the city of venice have guard herself against a like danger for in venice ten citizen be appoint with power to punish any man without appeal and because although possess the requisite authority this number might not be sufficient to insure the punishment of the powerful in addition to they council of ten they have also constitute a council of forty and have further provide that the council of the _ pregaus _ which be they supreme council shall have authority to chastise powerful offender so that unless a accuser be want a tribunal be never want in venice to keep powerful citizen in check but when we see how in rome with ordinance of she own impose and with so many and so wise legislator fresh occasion arise from day to day for frame new law favourable to freedom it be not to be wonder at that in other city less happy in they beginning difficulty should have spring up which no ordinance could remedy chapter l -- _ that neither any council nor any magistrate should have power to bring the government of a city to a stay _ tq cincinnatus and cn julius mento be consul of rome and be at variance with one another bring the whole business of the city to a stay which the senate perceiving be move to create a dictator to do what by reason of they difference the consul would not but though oppose to one another in everything else the consul be of one mind in resist the appointment of a dictator so that the senate have no remedy leave they but to seek the help of the tribune who support by they authority force the consul to yield here we have to note first the usefulness of the tribune ' authority in check the ambitious design not only of the noble against the common but also of one section of the noble against another and next that in no city ought thing ever to be so order that it rest with a few to decide on matter which if the ordinary business of the state be to proceed at all must be carry out wherefore if you grant authority to a council to distribute honor and office or to a magistrate to administer any branch of public business you must either impose a obligation that the duty confide shall be perform or ordain that on failure to perform another may and shall do what have to be do otherwise such a arrangement will be find defective and dangerous as would have be the case in rome have it not be possible to oppose the authority of the tribune to the obstinacy of the consul in the venetian republic the great council distribute honor and office but more than once it have happen that the council whether from ill-humour or from be badly advise have decline to appoint successor either to the magistrate of the city or to those administer the government abroad this give rise to the greatest confusion and disorder for on a sudden both the city itself and the subject province find themselves deprive of they lawful governor nor could any redress be have until the majority of the council be pacify or undeceived and this disorder must have bring the city to a bad end have not provision be make against its recurrence by certain of the wiser citizen who find a fit opportunity pass a law that no magistracy whether within or without the city should ever be deem to have be vacate until it be fill up by the appointment of a successor in this way the council be deprive of its facility for stop public business to the danger of the state chapter li -- _ what a prince or republic do of necessity should seem to be do by choice _ in all they action even in those which be matter of necessity rather than choice prudent man will endeavor so to conduct themselves as to conciliate good-will this species of prudence be well exercise by the roman senate when they resolve to grant pay from the public purse to soldier on active service who before have serve at they own charge for perceive that under the old system they could maintain no war of any duration and consequently could not undertake a siege or lead a army to any distance from home and find it necessary to be able to do both they decide on grant the pay i have speak of but this which they could not help do they do in such a way as to earn the thanks of the people by whom the concession be so well receive that all rome be intoxicate with delight for it seem to they a boon beyond any they could have venture to hope for or have dream of demand and although the tribune seek to make light of the benefit by show the people that they burthen would be increase rather than diminish by it since tax would have to be impose out of which the soldier 's stipend might be pay they could not persuade they to regard the measure otherwise than with gratitude which be further increase by the manner in which the senate distribute the tax impose on the noble all the heavier and greater and those which have to be pay first chapter lii -- _ that to check the arrogance of a citizen who be grow too powerful in a state there be no safer method or less open to objection than to forestall he in those way whereby he seek to advance himself _ it have be see in the precede chapter how much credit the noble gain with the common by a show of good-will towards they not only in provide for they military pay but also in adjust taxation have the senate constantly adhere to method like these they would have put a end to all disturbance in rome and have deprive the tribune of the credit they have with the people and of the influence thence arise for in truth in a commonwealth and especially in one which have become corrupt there be no better or easier or less objectionable way of oppose the ambition of any citizen than to anticipate he in those path by which he be see to be advance to the end he have in view this plan have it be follow by the enemy of cosimo de ' medicus would have prove a far more useful course for they than to banish he from florence since if those citizen who oppose he have adopt he method for gain over the people they would have succeed without violence or tumult in take he most effective weapon from he hand the influence acquire in florence by piero soderinus be entirely due to he skill in secure the affection of the people since in this way he obtain among they a name for love the liberty of the commonwealth and truly for those citizen who envy he greatness it would have be both easier and more honorable and at the same time far less dangerous and hurtful to the state to forestall he in those measure by which he be grow powerful than to oppose he in such a manner that he overthrow must bring with it the ruin of the entire republic for have they as they might easily have do deprive he of the weapon which make he formidable they could then have withstand he in all the council and in all public deliberation without either be suspect or fear and should any rejoin that if the citizen who hate piero soderinus commit a error in not be beforehand with he in those way whereby he come to have influence with the people piero himself err in like manner in not anticipate he enemy in those method whereby they grow formidable to he i answer that piero be to be excuse both because it would have be difficult for he to have so act and because for he such a course would not have be honorable for the path wherein he danger lay be those which favor the medicus and it be by these that he enemy attack he and in the end overthrow he but these path piero could not pursue without dishonor since he could not if he be to preserve he fair fame have join in destroy that liberty which he have be put forward to defend moreover since favor to the medicean party could not have be render secretly and once for all they would have be most dangerous for piero who have he show himself friendly to the medicus must have become suspect and hate by the people in which case he enemy would have have still better opportunity than before for he destruction man ought therefore to look to the risk and danger of any course which lie before they nor engage in it when it be plain that the danger outweigh the advantage even though they be advise by other that it be the most expedient way to take should they act otherwise it will fare with they as with tullius who in seek to diminish the power of marcus antonius add to it for antonius who have be declare a enemy by the senate have get together a strong force mostly make up of veteran who have share the fortune of cæsar tullius counsel the senate to invest octavianus with full authority and to send he against antonius with the consul and the army affirm that so soon as those veteran who have serve with cæsar see the face of he who be cæsar 's nephew and have assume he name they would rally to he side and desert antonius who might easily be crush when thus leave bare of support but the reverse of all this happen for antonius persuade octavianus to take part with he and to throw over tullius and the senate and this bring about the ruin of the senate a result which might easily have be foresee for remember the influence of that great captain who after overthrow all opponent have seize on sovereign power in rome the senate should have turn a deaf ear to the persuasion of tullius nor ever have believe it possible that from cæsar 's heir or from soldier who have follow cæsar they could look for anything that consist with the name of freedom chapter liii -- _ that the people deceive by a false show of advantage often desire what would be they ruin and that large hope and brave promise easily move they _ when veius fall the common of rome take up the notion that it would be to the advantage of they city be half they number to go and dwell there for they argue that as veii lay in a fertile country and be a well-built city a moiety of the roman people might in this way be enrich while by reason of its vicinity to rome the management of civil affair would in no degree be affect to the senate however and the wiser among the citizen the scheme appear so rash and mischievous that they publicly declare they would die sooner than consent to it the controversy continue the common grow so inflamed against the senate that violence and bloodshed must have ensue have not the senate for they protection put forward certain old and esteemed citizen respect for whom restrain the populace and put a stop to they violence two point be here to be note first that a people deceive by a false show of advantage will often labor for its own destruction and unless convince by some one whom it trust that the course on which it be bent be pernicious and that some other be to be prefer will bring infinite danger and injury upon the state and should it so happen as sometimes be the case that from have be deceive before either by man or by event there be none in whom the people trust they ruin be inevitable as to which dante in he treatise de monarchium observe that the people will often raise the cry _ flourish we death and perish we life _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- from which distrust it arise that often in republic the right course be not follow as when venice as have be relate on be attack by many enemy could not until she ruin be complete resolve to make friend with any one of they by restore those territory she have take from they on account of which war have be declare and a league of prince form against she in consider what course it be easy and what it be difficult to persuade a people to follow this distinction may be draw : either what you would persuade they to present on the face of it a semblance of gain or loss or it seem a spirited course or a base one when any proposal submit to the people hold out promise of advantage or seem to they a spirited course to take though loss lie hide behind nay though the ruin of they country be involve in it they will always be easily lead to adopt it whereas it will always be difficult to persuade the adoption of such course as wear the appearance of disgrace or loss even though safety and advantage be bind up with they the truth of what i say be confirm by numberless example both roman and foreign modern and ancient hence grow the ill opinion entertain in rome of fabius maximus who could never persuade the people that it behove they to proceed warily in they conflict with hannibal and withstand he onset without fight for this the people think a base course not discerning the advantage result from it which fabius could by no argument make plain to they and so blind be man in favor of what seem a spirited course that although the roman have already commit the blunder of permit varro master of the knight to fabius to join battle contrary to the latter 's desire whereby the army must have be destroy have not fabius by he prudence save it this lesson be not enough for afterwards they appoint this varro to be consul for no other reason than that he give out in the street and market-place that he would make a end of hannibal as soon as leave be give he to do so whence come the battle and defeat of cannæ and well-nigh the destruction of rome another example take from roman history may be cite to the same effect after hannibal have maintain himself for eight or ten year in italy during which time the whole country have be deluge with roman blood a certain marcus centenius penulum a man of mean origin but who have hold some post in the army come forward and propose to the senate that be leave give he to raise a force of volunteer in any part of italy he please he would speedily deliver hannibal into they hand alive or dead to the senate this man 's offer seem a rash one but reflect that be they to refuse it and be the people afterwards to hear that it have be make tumult ill will and resentment against they would result they grant the permission ask choose rather to risk the life of all who might follow penulum than to excite fresh discontent on the part of the people to whom they know that such a proposal would be welcome and that it would be very hard to dissuade they from it and so this adventurer march forth with a undisciplined and disorderly rabble to meet hannibal be with all he follower defeat and slay in the very first encounter in greece likewise and in the city of athen that most grave and prudent statesman nicia could not convince the people that the proposal to go and attack sicily be disadvantageous and the expedition be resolve on contrary to he advice and to the wish of the wiser among the citizen result in the overthrow of the athenian power scipio on be appoint consul ask that the province of africa might be award to he promise that he would utterly efface carthage and when the senate on the advice of fabius refuse he request he threaten to submit the matter to the people as very well know that to the people such proposal be always acceptable i might cite other instance to the same effect from the history of we own city as when messer ercole bentivoglio and antonio giacominus be in joint command of the florentine army after defeat bartolommeo d'alviano at san vincenzo proceed to invest pisa for this enterprise be resolve on by the people in consequence of the brave promise of messer ercole and though many wise citizen disapprove of it they could do nothing to prevent it be carry away by the popular will which take its rise in the assurance of they captain i say then that there be no readier way to bring about the ruin of a republic when the power be in the hand of the people than to suggest daring course for they adoption for wherever the people have a voice such proposal will always be well receive nor will those person who be oppose to they be able to apply any remedy and as this occasion the ruin of state it likewise and even more frequently occasion the private ruin of those to whom the execution of these proposal be commit because the people anticipate victory do not when there come defeat ascribe it to the short means or ill fortune of the commander but to he cowardice and incapacity and commonly either put he to death or imprison or banish he as be do in the case of numberless carthaginian general and of many athenian no success they might previously have obtain avail they anything for all past service be cancel by a present loss and so it happen with we antonio giacominus who not succeed as the people have expect and as he have promise in take pisa fall into such discredit with the people that notwithstanding he countless past service he life be spare rather by the compassion of those in authority than through any movement of the citizen in he behalf -lrb- footnote 1 : viva la sua morte e

_ frateschus _ among whom be pagolo antonio soderinus a citizen of great reputation in these day be worst in the course of these disturbance the people come with arm in they hand to plunder the house

no surer or more necessary restraint on the violence of a unruly multitude than the presence of some one whose character and bearing command respect but to return once more to the passage we be consider we see how stubbornly the people cling to this scheme of transplant themselves to veii think it for they advantage and not discerning the mischief really involve in it so that in addition to the many dissension which it occasion actual violence must have follow have not the senate with the aid of certain grave and reverend citizen repress the popular fury -lrb- footnote 1 : tum pietate

be not corrupt : and that a princedom be impossible where equality prevail and a republic where it do not _ though what we have to fear or hope from city that have grow corrupted have already be discuss still i think it not out of place to notice a resolution pass by the senate touch the vow which camillus make to apollo of a tenth of the spoil take from the veientine for this spoil have fall into the hand of the people the senate be unable by other means to get any account of it pass a edict that every man should publicly offer one tenth part of what he have take and although this edict be not carry out from the senate have afterwards follow a different course whereby to the content of the people the claim of apollo be otherwise satisfy we nevertheless see from they have entertain such a proposal how completely the senate trust to the honesty of the people when they assume that no one would withhold any part of what the edict command he to give on the other hand we see that it never occur to the people that they might evade the law by give less than be due they only thought be to free themselves from the law by openly manifest they displeasure this example together with many other already notice show how much virtue and how profound a feeling of religion prevail among the roman people and how much good be to be expect from they and in truth in the country where virtue like this do not exist no good can be look for as we should look for it in vain in province which at the present day be see to be corrupt as italy be beyond all other though in some degree france and spain be similarly taint in which last two country if we see not so many disorder spring up as we see daily spring up in italy this be not so much due to the superior virtue of they inhabitant -lrb- who to say truth fall far short of we countryman -rrb- as to they be govern by a king who keep they unite not merely by he personal quality but also by the law and ordinance of the realm which be still maintain with vigor in germany however we do see signal excellence and a devout religious spirit prevail among the people give rise to the many free state which there maintain themselves with such strict observance of they law that none either within or without they wall dare encroach on they that among this last-named people a great share of the ancient excellence do in truth still flourish i shall show by a example similar to that which i have above related of the senate and people of rome it be customary with the german free state when they have to expend any large sum of money on the public account for they magistrate or council have authority give they in that behalf to impose a rate of one or two in the hundred on every man 's estate which rate be fix every man in conformity with the law of the city present himself before the collector of the impost and have first make oath to pay the amount justly due throw into a chest provide for the purpose what he conscientiously believe it fair for he to pay of which payment none be witness save himself from this fact it may be gather what honesty and religion still prevail among this people for we must assume that each pay he just share since otherwise the impost would not yield the sum which with reference to former impost it be estimate to yield whereby the fraud would be detect and thereupon some other method for raise money have to be resort to at the present time this virtue be the more to be admire because it seem to have survive in this province only that it have survive there may be ascribe to two circumstance : _ first _ that the native have little communication with they neighbor neither visit they in they country nor be visit by they be content to use such commodity and subsist on such food and to wear garment of such material as they own land supplies so that all occasion for intercourse and every cause of corruption be remove for live after this fashion they have not learn the manners of the french the italian or the spaniard which three nation together be the corruption of the world the _ second _ cause be that these republic in which a free and pure government be maintain will not suffer any of they citizen either to be or to live as gentleman but on the contrary while preserve a strict equality among themselves be bitterly hostile to all those gentleman and lord who dwell in they neighborhood so that if by chance any of these fall into they hand they put they to death as the chief promoter of corruption and the origin of all disorder but to make plain what i mean when i speak of _ gentleman _ i say that those be so to be style who live in opulence and idleness on the revenue of they estate without concern themselves with the cultivation of these estate or incur any other fatigue for they support such person be very mischievous in every republic or country but even more mischievous be they who besides the estate i have speak of be lord of stronghold and castle and have vassal and retainer who render they obedience of these two class of man the kingdom of naple the country round rome romagna and lombardy be full and hence it happen that in these province no commonwealth or free form of government have ever exist because man of this sort be the swear foe to all free institution and since to plant a commonwealth in province which be in this condition be impossible if these be to be reform at all it can only be by some one man who be able there to establish a kingdom the reason be that when the body of the people be grow so corrupt that the law be powerless to control it there must in addition to the law be introduce a stronger force to wit the regal which by its absolute and unrestricted authority may curb the excessive ambition and corruption of the great this opinion may be support by the example of tuscany in which within a narrow compass of territory there have long exist the three republic of florence lucca and siena while the other city of that province although to a certain extent dependent still show by they spirit and by they institution that they preserve or at any rate desire to preserve they freedom : and this because there be in tuscany no lord possess of stronghold and few or no gentleman but so complete a equality prevail that a prudent statesman well acquaint with the history of the free state of antiquity might easily introduce free institution such however have be the unhappiness of this we country that up to the present hour it have never produce any man with the power and knowledge which would have enable he to act in this way from what have be say it follow that he who would find a commonwealth in a country wherein there be many gentleman can not do so unless he first get rid of they and that he who would find a monarchy or princedom in a country wherein great equality prevail will never succeed unless he raise above the level of that equality many person of a restless and ambitious temperament whom he must make gentleman not in name merely but in reality by confer on they castle and land supply they with riches and provide they with retainer that with these gentleman around he and with they help he may maintain he power while they through he may gratify they ambition all other be constrain to endure a yoke which force and force alone impose on they for when in this way there come to be a proportion between he who use force and he against whom it be use each stand fix in he own station but to find a commonwealth in a country suit for a kingdom or a kingdom in a country suit to be a commonwealth require so rare a combination of intelligence and power that though many engage in the attempt few be find to succeed for the greatness of the undertaking quickly daunt they and so obstruct they advance they break down at the very outset the case of the venetian republic wherein none save gentleman be permit to hold any public office do doubtless seem oppose to this opinion of mine that where there be gentleman it be impossible to find a commonwealth but it may be answer that the case of venice be not in truth a instance to the contrary since the gentleman of venice be gentleman rather in name than in reality inasmuch as they draw no great revenue from land they wealth consist chiefly in merchandise and chattel and not one of they possess a castle or enjoy any feudal authority for in venice this name of gentleman be a title of honor and dignity and do not depend on any of those circumstance in respect of which the name be give in other state but as in other state the different rank and class be divide under different name so in venice we have the division into gentleman -lrb- _ gentiluominus _ -rrb- and plebeian -lrb- _ popolanus _ -rrb- it be understand that the former hold or have the right to hold all situation of honor from which the latter be entirely exclude and in venice this occasion no disturbance for reason which i have already explain let a commonwealth then be constitute in the country where a great equality be find or have be make and conversely let a princedom be constitute where great inequality prevail otherwise what be constitute will be discordant in itself and without stability chapter lvi -- _ that when great calamity be about to befall a city or country sign be see to presage and seer arise who

along the via nova he hear a voice louder than mortal bidding he warn the magistrate that the gaul be on they way to rome the cause of such manifestation ought i think to be inquire into and explain by some one who have a knowledge which i have not of cause natural and supernatural it may however be as certain wise man say that the air be fill with intelligent being to whom it be give to forecast future event who take pity upon man warn they beforehand by these sign to prepare for what await they be this as it may certain it be that such warning be give and that always after they new and strange disaster befall nation chapter lvii -- _ that the people be strong collectively but individually weak _ after the ruin bring on they country by the invasion of the gaul many of the roman go to dwell in veius in opposition to the edict and command of the senate who to correct this mischief publicly ordain that within a time fix and under penalty state all should return to live in rome the person against whom these proclamation be direct at first deride they but when the time come for they to be obey all obey they and titus livius observe that _ although bold enough collectively each separately fear to be punish make he submission _ and indeed the temper of the multitude in such case can not be better describe than in this passage for often a people will be open-mouthed in condemn the decree of they prince but afterwards when they have to look punishment in the face put no trust in one another they hasten to comply wherefore if you be in a position to keep the people well-disposed towards you when they already be so or to prevent they injure you in case they be ill-disposed it be clearly of little moment whether the feeling with which they profess to regard you be favourable or no this apply to all unfriendliness on the part of a people whencesoever it proceed except only the resentment feel by they on be deprive either of liberty or of a prince whom they love and who still survive for the hostile temper produce by these two cause be more to be fear than any beside and demand measure of extreme severity to correct it the other untoward humor of the multitude should there be no powerful chief to foster they be easily deal with because while on the one hand there be nothing more terrible than a uncontrolled and headless mob on the other there be nothing feebler for though it be furnish with arm it be easily subdue if you have some place of strength wherein to shelter from its first onset for when its first fury have somewhat abate and each man see that he have to return to he own house all begin to lose heart and to take thought how to insure they personal safety whether by flight or by submission for which reason a multitude stir in this way if it would avoid danger such as i speak of must at once appoint a head from among its own number who may control it keep it unite and provide for its defense as do the common of rome when after the death of virginium they quit the city and for they protection create twenty tribune from among themselves unless this be do what titus livius have observe in the passage cite will always prove true namely that a multitude be strong while it hold together but so soon as each of those who compose it begin to think of he own private danger it become weak and contemptible chapter lviii -- _ that a people be wiser and more constant than a prince _ that _ nothing be more fickle and inconstant than the multitude _ be affirm not by titus livius only but by all other historian in whose chronicle of human action we often find the multitude condemn some citizen to death and afterwards lament he and grieve greatly for he loss as the roman grieve and lament for manlius capitolinus whom they have themselves condemn to die in relate which circumstance we author observe _ in a short time the people have no longer cause to fear he begin to deplore he death _ and elsewhere when speaking of what take place in syracuse after the murder of hieronymus grandson of hiero he say _ it be the nature of the multitude to be a abject slave or a domineering master _ it may be that in attempt to defend a cause which as i have say all writer be agree to condemn i take upon I a task so hard and difficult that i shall either have to relinquish it with shame or pursue it with opprobrium be that as it may i neither do nor ever shall judge it a fault to support opinion by argument where it be not seek to impose they by violence or authority i maintain then that this infirmity with which historian tax the multitude may with equal reason be charge against every individual man but most of all against prince since all who be not control by the law will commit the very same fault as be commit by a uncontrolled multitude proof whereof be easy since of all the many prince exist or who have exist few indeed be or have be either wise or good i speak of such prince as have have it in they power to break the rein by which they be control among whom i do not reckon those king who reign in egypt in the most remote antiquity when that country be govern in conformity with its law nor do i include those king who reign in sparta nor those who in we own time reign in france which kingdom more than any other whereof we have knowledge at the present day be under the government of its law for king who live as these do subject to constitutional restraint be not to be count when we have to consider each man 's proper nature and to see whether he resemble the multitude for to draw a comparison with such prince as these we must take the case of a multitude control as they be and regulate by the law when we shall find it to possess the same virtue which we see in they and neither conduct itself as a abject slave nor as a domineering master such be the people of rome who while the commonwealth continue uncorrupted never either serve abjectly nor domineered haughtily but on the contrary by means of they magistrate and they ordinance maintain they place and when force to put forth they strength against some powerful citizen as in the case of manlius the decemvir and other who seek to oppress they do so but when it be necessary for the public welfare to yield obedience to the dictator or consul obey and if the roman people mourn the loss of the dead manlius it be no wonder for they mourn he virtue which have be of such a sort that they memory stir the regret of all and would have have power to produce the same feeling even in a prince all writer be agree that excellence be praise and admire even by its enemy but if manlius when he be so greatly mourn could have rise once more from the dead the roman people would have pronounce the same sentence against he which they pronounce when they lead he forth from the prison-house and straightway condemn he to die and in like manner we see that prince account wise have put man to death and afterwards greatly lament they as alexander mourn for clitus and other of he friend and herod for mariamne but what we historian say of the multitude he say not of a multitude which like the people of rome be control by the law but of a uncontrolled multitude like the syracusan who be guilty of all these crime which infuriate and ungoverned man commit and which be equally commit by alexander and herod in the case mention wherefore the nature of a multitude be no more to be blame than the nature of prince since both equally err when they can do so without regard to consequence of which many instance besides those already give might be cite from the history of the roman emperor and of other prince and tyrant in whose life we find such inconstancy and fickleness as we might look in vain for in a people i maintain therefore contrary to the common opinion which aver that a people when they have the management of affair be changeable fickle and ungrateful that these fault exist not in they otherwise than as they exist in individual prince so that be any to accuse both prince and people the charge might be true but that to make exception in favor of prince be a mistake for a people in command if it be duly restrain will have the same prudence and the same gratitude as a prince have or even more however wise he may be reckon and a prince on the other hand if free from the control of the law will be more ungrateful fickle and short-sighted than a people and further i say that any difference in they method of act result not from any difference in they nature that be the same in both or if there be advantage on either side the advantage rest with the people but from they have more or less respect for the law under which each life and whosoever attentively consider the history of the roman people may see that for four hundred year they never relax in they hatred of the regal name and be constantly devote to the glory and welfare of they country and will find numberless proof give by they of they consistency in both particulars and should any allege against I the ingratitude they show to scipio i reply by what have already be say at length on that head where i prove that people be less ungrateful than prince but as for prudence and stability of purpose i affirm that a people be more prudent more stable and of better judgment than a prince nor be it without reason that the voice of the people have be liken to the voice of god for we see that wide-spread belief fulfil themselves and bring about marvellous result so as to have the appearance of presage by some occult quality either weal or woe again as to the justice of they opinion on public affair seldom find that after hear two speaker of equal ability urge they in opposite direction they do not adopt the sounder view or be unable to decide on the truth of what they hear and if as i have say a people err in adopt course which appear to it bold and advantageous prince will likewise err when they passion be touch as be far oftener the case with they than with a people we see too that in the choice of magistrate a people will choose far more honestly than a prince so that while you shall never persuade a people that it be advantageous to confer dignity on the infamous and profligate a prince may readily and in a thousand way be draw to do so again it may be see that a people when once they have come to hold a thing in abhorrence remain for many age of the same mind which we do not find happen with prince for the truth of both of which assertion the roman people be my sufficient witness who in the course of so many hundred year and in so many election of consul and tribune never make four appointment of which they have reason to repent and as i have say so detest the name of king that no obligation they might be under to any citizen who affect that name could shield he from the appoint penalty further we find that those city wherein the government be in the hand of the people in a very short space of time make marvellous progress far exceed that make by city which have be always rule by prince as rome grow after the expulsion of she king and athen after she free herself from pisistratus and this we can ascribe to no other cause than that the rule of a people be better than the rule of a prince nor would i have it think that anything we historian may have affirm in the passage cite or elsewhere controvert these my opinion for if all the glory and all the defect both of people and of prince be carefully weigh it will appear that both for goodness and for glory a people be to be prefer and if prince surpass people in the work of legislation in shape civil institution in moulding statute and frame new ordinance so far do the latter surpass the former in maintain what have once be establish as to merit no less praise than they and to state the sum of the whole matter shortly i say that popular government have endure for long period in the same way as the government of prince and that both have need to be regulate by the law because the prince who can do what he please be a madman and the people which can do as it please be never wise if then we assume the case of a prince bind and of a people chained down by the law greater virtue will appear in the people than in the prince while if we assume the case of each of they free from all control it will be see that the people commit fewer error than the prince and less serious error and such as admit of readier cure for a turbulent and unruly people may be speak to by a good man and readily bring back to good way but none can speak to a wicked prince nor any remedy be find against he but by the sword and from this we may infer which of the two suffer from the worse disease for if the disease of the people may be heal by word while that of the prince must be deal with by the sword there be none but will judge that evil to be the greater which demand the more violent remedy when a people be absolutely uncontrolled it be not so much the folly which it commit or the evil which it actually do that excite alarm as the mischief which may thence result since in such disorder it become possible for a tyrant to spring up but with a wicked prince the contrary be the case for we dread present ill and place we hope in the future persuade ourselves that the evil life of the prince may bring about we freedom so that there be this distinction between the two that with the one we fear what be with the other what be likely to be again the cruelty of a people be turn against he who it fear will encroach upon the common rights but the cruelty of the prince against those who he fear may assert those rights the prejudice which be entertain against the people arise from this that any man may speak ill of they openly and fearlessly even when the government be in they hand whereas prince be always speak of with a thousand reserve and a constant eye to consequence but since the subject suggest it it seem to I not out of place to consider what alliance we can most trust whether those make with commonwealth or those make with prince chapter lix -- _ to what league or alliance we may most trust whether those we make with commonwealth or those we make with prince _ since league and alliance be every day enter into by one prince with another or by one commonwealth with another and as convention and treaty be conclude in like manner between prince and commonwealth it seem to I proper to inquire whether the faith of a commonwealth or that of a prince be the more stable and the safer to count on all thing consider i be dispose to believe that in most case they be alike though in some they differ of one thing however i be convinced namely that engagement make under duress will never be observe either by prince or by commonwealth and that if menace with the loss of they territory both the one and the other will break faith with you and treat you with ingratitude demetrius who be name the city-taker have confer numberless benefit upon the athenian but when afterwards on be defeat by he enemy he seek shelter in athen as be a friendly city and under obligation to he it be refuse he a circumstance which grieve he far more than the loss of he soldier and army have do pompey in like manner when route by cæsar in thessaly flee for refuge to ptolemy in egypt who formerly have be restore by he to he kingdom by whom he be put to death in both these instance the same cause be at work although the inhumanity and the wrong inflict be less in the case of the commonwealth than of the prince still wherever there be fear the want of faith will be the same and even if there be find a commonwealth or prince who in order to keep faith will submit to be ruin this be see to result from a like cause for as to the prince it may easily happen that he be friend to a powerful sovereign whom though he be at the time without means to defend he he may presently hope to see restore to he dominion or it may be that have link he fortune with another 's he despair of find either faith or friendship from the enemy of he ally as be the case with those neapolitan prince who espouse the interest of france as to commonwealth a instance similar to that of the prince last name be that of saguntum in spain which await ruin in adhering to the fortune of rome a like course be also follow by florence when in the year 1512 she stand steadfastly by the cause of the french and take everything into account i believe that in case of urgency we shall find a certain degree of stability sooner in commonwealth than in prince for though commonwealth be like-minded with prince and influence by the same passion the circumstance that they movement must be slower make it harder for they to resolve than it be for a prince for which reason they will be less ready to break faith and since league and alliance be break for the sake of certain advantage in this respect also commonwealth observe they engagement far more faithfully than prince for abundant example might be cite of a very slight advantage have cause a prince to break faith and of a very great advantage have fail to induce a commonwealth to do so of this we have a instance in the proposal make to the athenian by themistocle when he tell they at a public meeting that he have certain advice to offer which would prove of great advantage to they city but the nature of which he could not disclose to they lest it should become generally know when the opportunity for act upon it would be lose whereupon the athenian name aristide to receive he communication and to act upon it as he think fit to he accordingly themistocle show how the navy of unite greece for the safety of which the athenian stand pledge be so situate that they might either gain it over or destroy it and thus make themselves absolute master of the whole country aristide report to the athenian that the course propose by themistocle be extremely advantageous but extremely dishonourable the people utterly refuse to entertain it but philip of macedon would not have so act nor any of those other prince who have seek and find more profit in break faith than in any other way as to engagement break off on the pretext that they have not be observe by the other side i say nothing since that be a matter of everyday occurrence and i be speak here only of those engagement which be break off on extraordinary grounds but in this respect likewise i believe that commonwealth offend less than prince and be therefore more to be trust chapter lx -- _ that the consulship and all the other magistracy in rome be give without respect to age _ it be see in the course of the roman history that after the consulship be throw open to the common the republic concede this dignity to all its citizen without distinction either of age or blood nay that in this matter respect for age be never make a ground for preference among the roman whose constant aim it be to discover excellence whether exist in old or young to this we have the testimony of valerius corvinus himself make consul in he twenty-fourth year who in address he soldier say of the consulship that it be _ the reward not of birth but of desert _ whether the course thus follow by the roman be well judge or not be a question on which much might be say the concession as to blood however be make under necessity and as i have observe on another occasion the same necessity which obtain in rome will be find to obtain in every other city which desire to achieve the result which rome achieve for you can not subject man to hardship unless you hold out reward nor can you without danger deprive they of those reward whereof you have hold out hope it be consequently necessary to extend betime to the common the hope of obtain the consulship on which hope they feed themselves for a while without actually realize it but afterwards the hope alone be not enough and it have to be satisfy for while city which do not employ man of plebeian birth in any of those undertaking wherein glory be to be gain as we have see be the case with venice may treat these man as they please those other city which desire to do as rome do can not make this distinction and if there be to be no distinction in respect of blood nothing can be plead for a distinction in respect of age on the contrary that distinction must of necessity cease to be observe for where a young man be appoint to a post which require the prudence which be be suppose to bring it must be since the choice rest with the people that he be thus advance in consideration of some noble action which he have perform but when a young man be of such excellence as to have make a name for himself by some signal achievement it be much to the detriment of he city be it unable at once to make use of he but have to wait until he have grow old and have lose with youth that alacrity and vigor by which he country might have profit as rome profit by the service of valerius corvinus of scipio of pompey and of many other who triumph while yet very young book ii \* \* \* \* \* preface man do always but not always with reason commend the past and condemn the present and be so much the partisan of what have be as not merely to cry up those time which be know to they only from the record leave by historian but also when they grow old to extol the day in which they remember they youth to have be spend and although this preference of theirs be in most instance a mistaken one i can see that there be many cause to account for it chief of which i take to be that in respect of thing long go by we perceive not the whole truth those circumstance that would detract from the credit of the past be for the most part hide from we while all that give it lustre be magnify and embellish for the generality of writer render this tribute to the good fortune of conqueror that to make they achievement seem more splendid they not merely exaggerate the great thing they have do but also lend such a color to the action of they enemy that any one bear afterwards whether in the conquering or in the conquer country have cause to marvel at these man and these time and be constrain to praise and love they beyond all other again man be move to hatred either by fear or envy these two most powerful cause of dislike be cancel in respect of thing which be past because what be past can neither do we hurt nor afford occasion for envy the contrary however be the case with the thing we see and in which we take part for in these from we complete acquaintance with they no part of they be hide from we we recognize along with much that be good much that displease we and so be force to pronounce they far inferior to the old although in truth they deserve far greater praise and admiration i speak not here of what relate to the art which have such distinction inherent in they that time can give or take from they but little of the glory which they merit of themselves i speak of the life and manners of man touch which the grounds for judge be not so clear i repeat then that it be true that this habit of blame and praise obtain but not always true that it be wrong apply for sometimes it will happen that this judgment be just because as human affair be in constant movement it must be that they either rise or fall wherefore we may see a city or province furnish with free institution by some great and wise founder flourish for a while through he merit and advance steadily on the path of improvement any one bear therein at that time would be in the wrong to praise the past more than the present and he error would be occasion by the cause already notice but any one bear afterwards in that city or province when the time have come for it to fall away from its former felicity would not be mistake in praise the past when i consider how this happen i be persuade that the world remain continually the same have in it a constant quantity of good and evil but that this good and this evil shift about from one country to another as we know that in ancient time empire shift from one nation to another accord as the manners of these nation change the world as a whole continue as before and the only difference be that whereas at first assyrium be make the seat of its excellence this be afterwards place in media then in persium until at last it be transfer to italy and rome and although after the roman empire none have follow which have endure or in which the world have centre its whole excellence we nevertheless find that excellence diffuse among many valiant nation the kingdom of the frank for example that of the turk that of the soldan and the state of germany at the present day and share at a earlier time by that sect of the saracen who perform so many great achievement and gain so wide a dominion after destroy the roman empire in the east in all these country therefore after the decline of the roman power and among all these race there exist and in some part of they there yet exist that excellence which alone be to be desire and justly to be praise wherefore if any man be bear in one of these country should exalt past time over present he might be mistaken but any who live at the present day in italy or greece have not in italy become a ultramontane or in greece a turk have reason to complain of he own time and to commend those other in which there be many thing which make they admirable whereas now no regard be have to religion to law or to arm but all be tarnish with every sort of shame there be nothing to redeem the age from the last extremity of wretchedness ignominy and disgrace and the vice of we age be the more odious in that they be practice by those who sit on the judgment seat govern the state and demand public reverence but return to the matter in hand it may be say that if the judgment of man be at fault in pronounce whether the present age or the past be the better in respect of thing whereof by reason of they antiquity they can not have the same perfect knowledge which they have of they own time it ought not to be at fault in old man when they compare the day of they youth with those of they maturity both of which have be alike see and know by they this be indeed true if man at all period of they life judge of thing in the same way and be constantly influence by the same desire but since they alter the time although they alter not can not but seem different to those who have other desire other pleasure and other way of view thing in they old age from those they have in they youth for since when they grow old man lose in bodily strength but gain in wisdom and discernment it must need be that those thing which in they youth seem to they tolerable and good should in they old age appear intolerable and evil and whereas they should ascribe this to they judgment they lay the blame upon the time but further since the desire of man be insatiable nature prompt they to desire all thing and fortune permit they to enjoy but few there result a constant discontent in they mind and a loathing of what they possess prompt they to find fault with the present praise the past and long for the future even though they be not move thereto by any reasonable cause i know not therefore whether i may not deserve to be reckon in the number of those who thus deceive themselves if in these discourse of mine i render excessive praise to the ancient time of the roman while i censure we own and indeed be not the excellence which then prevail and the corruption which prevail now clearer than the sun i should proceed more guardedly in what i have to say from fear lest in accuse other i should myself fall into this self-deception but since the thing be so plain that every one see it i shall be bold to speak freely all i think both of old time and of new in order that the mind of the young who happen to read these my writings may be lead to shun modern example and be prepare to follow those set by antiquity whenever chance afford the opportunity for it be the duty of every good man to teach other those wholesome lesson which the malice of time or of fortune have not permit he to put in practice to the end that out of many who have the knowledge some one better loved by heaven may be find able to carry they out have speak then in the foregoing book of the various method follow by the roman in regulate the domestic affair of they city in this i shall speak of what be do by they to spread they empire chapter i -- _ whether the empire acquire by the roman be more due to valor or to fortune _ many author and among other that most grave historian plutarch have think that in acquire they empire the roman be more beholden to they good fortune than to they valor and besides other reason which they give for this opinion they affirm it to be prove by the admission of the roman themselves since they have erect more temple to fortune than to any other deity show that it be to she that they ascribe they success it would seem too that titus livius be of the same mind since he very seldom put a speech into the mouth of any roman in which he discourse of valor wherein he do not also make mention of fortune this however be a opinion with which i can in no way concur and which i take it can not be make good for if no commonwealth have ever be find to grow like the roman it be because none be ever find so well fit by its institution to make that growth for by the valor of she army she spread she empire while by she conduct of affair and by other method peculiar to herself and devise by she first founder she be able to keep what she acquire as shall be fully show in many of the follow discourse the writer to whom i have refer assert that it be owe to they good fortune and not to they prudence that the roman never have two great war on they hand at once as for instance that they wage no war with the latin until they have not merely overcome the samnite but undertake in they defense the war on which they then enter nor ever fight with the etruscan until they have subjugate the latin and have almost worn out the samnite by frequent defeat whereas have any two of these power while yet fresh and unexhausted unite together it may easily be believe that the ruin of the roman republic must have follow but to whatsoever cause we ascribe it it never so chance that the roman engage in two great war at the same time on the contrary it always seem as though on the break out of one war another be extinguish or that on the termination of one another break out and this we may plainly see from the order in which they war succeed one another for omit those wage by they before they city be take by the gaul we find that during they struggle with the equian and the volscian and while these two nation continue strong no other rise against they on these be subdue there break out the war with the samnite and although before the close of that contest the latin nation have begin to rebel against rome nevertheless when they rebellion come to a head the samnite be in league with rome and help she with they army to quell the presumption of the rebel on whose defeat the war with samnium be renew when the strength of samnium have be drain by repeat reverse there follow the war with the etruscan which end the samnite be once more stir to activity by the come of pyrrhus into italy when he too have be defeat and send back to greece rome enter on she first war with the carthaginian which be no sooner over than all the gallic nation on both side of the alp combine against the roman by whom in the battle fight between populonium and pisa where now stand the fortress of san vincenzo they be at last route with tremendous slaughter this war end for twenty year together the roman be engage in no contest of importance they only adversary be the ligurian and the remnant of the gallic tribe who occupy lombardy and on this footing thing continue down to the second carthaginian war which for sixteen year keep the whole of italy in a blaze this too be bring to a most glorious termination there follow the macedonian war at the close of which succeed the war with antiochus and asia these subdue there remain not in the whole world king or people who either singly or together could withstand the power of rome but even before this last victory any one observe the order of these war and the method in which they be conduct must have recognize not only the good fortune of the roman but also they extraordinary valor and prudence and be any one to search for the cause of this good fortune he would have little difficulty in find they since nothing be more certain than that when a potentate have attain so great a reputation that every neighbouring prince or people be afraid to engage he single-handed and stand in awe of he none will ever venture to attack he unless drive to do so by necessity so that it will almost rest on he will to make war as he like on any of he neighbor while he studiously maintain peace with the rest who on they part whether through fear of he power or deceive by the method he take to dull they vigilance be easily keep quiet distant power in the mean time who have no intercourse with either treat the matter as too remote to concern they in any way and abide in this error until the conflagration approach they own door on its arrival have no resource for its extinction save in they own strength which as they enemy have by that time become exceedingly powerful no longer suffice i forbear to relate how the samnite stand look on while the roman be subjugate the equian and the volscian and to avoid be prolix shall content myself with the single instance of the carthaginian who at the time when the roman be contend with the samnite and etruscan be possess of great power and hold in high repute be already master of the whole of africa together with sicily and sardinium besides occupy territory in various part of spain and because they empire be so great and at such a distance from the roman frontier they be never lead to think of attack the roman or of lend assistance to the etruscan or samnite on the contrary they behave towards the roman as man behave towards those whom they see prosper rather take they part and court they friendship nor do they discover they mistake until the roman after subdue all the intervene nation begin to assail they power both in spain and sicily what happen in the case of the carthaginian happen also in the case of the gaul of philip of macedon and of antiochus each of whom while rome be engage with another of they believe that other would have the advantage and that there would be time enough to provide for they own safety whether by make peace or war it seem to I therefore that the same good fortune which in this respect attend the roman might be share by all prince act as they do and of a valor equal to theirs as bear on this point it might have be proper for I to show what method be follow by the roman in enter the territory of other nation have i not already speak of this at length in my _ treatise on princedom _ wherein the whole subject be discuss here it be enough to say briefly that in a new province they always seek for some friend who should be to they as a ladder whereby to climb a door through which to pass or a instrument wherewith to keep they hold thus we see they effect they entrance into samnium through the capuan into etrurium through the camertine into sicily through the mamertine into spain through the saguntan into africa through massinissa into greece through the etolian into asia through eumene and other prince into gaul through the massilian and eduan and in like manner never without similar assistance in they effort whether to acquire province or to keep they the nation who carefully attend to this precaution will be see to stand in less need of fortune 's help than other who neglect it but that all may clearly understand how much more the roman be aid by valor than by fortune in acquire they empire i shall in the follow chapter consider the character of those nation with whom they have to contend and show how stubborn these be in defend they freedom chapter ii -- _ with what nation the roman have to contend and how stubborn these be in defend they freedom _ in subdue the country round about they and certain of the more distant province nothing give the roman so much trouble as the love which in those day many nation bear to freedom defend it with such obstinacy as could not have be overcome save by a surpass valor for we know by numberless instance what peril these nation be ready to face in they effort to maintain or recover they freedom and what vengeance they take against those who deprive they of it we know too from history what hurt a people or city suffer from servitude and though at the present day there be but one province which can be say to contain within it free city we find that formerly these abound everywhere for we learn that in the ancient time of which i speak from the mountain which divide tuscany from lombardy down to the extreme point of italy there dwell numerous free nation such as the etruscan the roman and the samnite besides many other in other part of the peninsula nor do we ever read of there be any king over they except those who reign in rome and porsenna king of etrurium how the line of this last-named prince come to be extinguish history do not inform we but it be clear that at the time when the roman go to besiege veii etrurium be free and so greatly rejoice in she freedom and so detest the regal name that when the veientine who for they defense have create a king in veius seek aid from the etruscan against rome these after much deliberation resolve to lend they no help while they continue to live under a king judge it useless to defend a country give over to servitude by its inhabitant it be easy to understand whence this love of liberty arise among nation for we know by experience that state have never signally increase either as to dominion or wealth except where they have live under a free government and truly it be strange to think to what a pitch of greatness athen come during the hundred year after she have free herself from the despotism of pisistratus and far stranger to contemplate the marvellous growth which rome make after free herself from she king the cause however be not far to seek since it be the well-being not of individual but of the community which make a state great and without question this universal well-being be nowhere secure save in a republic for a republic will do whatsoever make for its interest and though its measure prove hurtful to this man or to that there be so many whom they benefit that these be able to carry they out in spite of the resistance of the few whom they injure but the contrary happen in the case of a prince for as a rule what help he hurt the state and what help the state hurt he so that whenever a tyranny spring up in a city which have live free the least evil which can befall that city be to make no further progress nor ever increase in power or wealth but in most case if not in all it will be its fate to go back or should there chance to arise in it some able tyrant who extend he dominion by he valor and skill in arm the advantage which result be to himself only and not to the state since he can bestow no honor on those of the citizen over whom he tyrannize who have show themselves good and valiant lest afterwards he should have cause to fear they nor can he make those city which he acquire subject or tributary to the city over which he rule because to make this city powerful be not for he interest which lie in keep it so divide that each town and province may separately recognize he alone as its master in this way he only and not he country be the gainer by he conquest and if any one desire to have this view confirm by numberless other proof let he look into xenophon 's treatise _ de tirannide _ no wonder then that the nation of antiquity pursue tyrant with such relentless hatred and so passionately love freedom that its very name be dear to they as be see when hieronymus grandson of hiero the syracusan be put to death in syracuse for when word of he death reach the army which lay encamp not far off at first it be greatly move and eager to take up arm against the murderer but on hear the cry of liberty shout in the street of syracuse quiet at once by the name it lay aside its resentment against those who have slay the tyrant and fall to consider how a free government might be provide for the city nor be it to be wonder at that the ancient nation take terrible vengeance on those who deprive they of they freedom of which though there be many instance i mean only to cite one which happen in the city of corcyra at the time of the peloponnesian war for greece be divide into two faction one of which side with the athenian the other with the spartan it result that many of its city be divide against themselves some of the citizen seek the friendship of sparta and some of athen in the aforesaid city of corcyra the noble get the upper hand deprive the common of they freedom these however recover themselves with the help of the athenian lay hold of the entire body of the noble and cast they into a prison large enough to contain they all whence they bring they forth by eight or ten at a time pretend that they be to be send to different place into banishment whereas in fact they put they to death with many circumstance of cruelty those who be leave learn what be go on resolve to do they utmost to escape this ignominious death and arm themselves with what weapon they could find defend the door of they prison against all who seek to enter till the people hear the tumult and rush in haste to the prison drag down the roof and smother the prisoner in the ruin many other horrible and atrocious cruelty likewise perpetrate in greece show it to be true that a lose freedom be avenge with more ferocity than a threaten freedom be defend when i consider whence it happen that the nation of antiquity be so much more zealous in they love of liberty than those of the present day i be lead to believe that it arise from the same cause which make the present generation of man less vigorous and daring than those of ancient time namely the difference of the training of the present day from that of earlier age and this again arise from the different character of the religion then and now prevail for we religion have reveal to we the truth and the true path teach we to make little account of worldly glory whereas the gentile greatly esteem it and place therein they highest good display a greater fierceness in they action this we may gather from many of they custom begin with they sacrificial rite which be of much magnificence as compare with the simplicity of we worship though that be not without a certain dignity of its own refined rather than splendid and far remove from any tincture of ferocity or violence in the religious ceremony of the ancient neither pomp nor splendor be want but to these be join the ordinance of sacrifice give occasion to much bloodshed and cruelty for in its celebration many beast be slaughter and this be a cruel spectacle impart a cruel temper to the worshipper moreover under the old religion none obtain divine honor save those who be load with worldly glory such as captain of army and ruler of city whereas we religion glorify man of a humble and contemplative rather than of a active life accordingly while the highest good of the old religion consist in magnanimity bodily strength and all those other quality which make man brave we religion place it in humility lowliness and contempt for the thing of this world or if it ever call upon we to be brave it be that we should be brave to suffer rather than to do this manner of life therefore seem to have make the world feebler and to have give it over as a prey to wicked man to deal with as they please since the mass of mankind in the hope of be receive into paradise think more how to bear injury than how to avenge they but should it seem that the world have grow effeminate and heaven lay aside she arm this assuredly result from the baseness of those who have interpret we religion to accord with indolence and ease rather than with valor for be we to remember that religion permit the exaltation and defense of we country we would see it to be we duty to love and honor it and would strive to be able and ready to defend it this training therefore and these most false interpretation be the cause why in the world of the present day we find no longer the numerous commonwealth which be find of old and in consequence that we see not now among the nation that love of freedom which prevail then though at the same time i be persuade that one cause of this change have be that the roman empire by its arm and power put a end to all the free state and free institution of antiquity for although the power of rome fall afterwards into decay these state could never recover they strength or resume they former mode of government save in a very few district of the empire but be this as it may certain it be that in every country of the world even the least considerable the roman find a league of well-armed republic most resolute in the defense of they freedom whom it be clear they never could have subdue have they not be endow with the rarest and most astonishing valor to cite a single instance i shall take the case of the samnite who strange as it may now seem be on the admission of titus livius himself so powerful and so steadfast in arm as to be able to withstand the roman down to the consulship of papirius cursor son to the first papirius a period of six and forty year in spite of numerous defeat the loss of many of they town and the great slaughter which overtake they everywhere throughout they country and this be the more remarkable when we see that country which once contain so many noble city and support so great a population now almost uninhabited and reflect that it formerly enjoy a government and possess resource make its conquest impossible to less than roman valor there be no difficulty therefore in determine whence that ancient greatness and this modern decay have arise since they can be trace to the free life formerly prevail and to the servitude which prevail now for all country and province which enjoy complete freedom make as i have say most rapid progress because from marriage be less restricted in these country and more seek after we find there a greater population every man be dispose to beget as many child as he think he can rear when he have no anxiety lest they should be deprive of they patrimony and know not only that they be bear to freedom and not to slavery but that they may rise by they merit to be the first man of they country in such state accordingly we see wealth multiply both that which come from agriculture and that which come from manufacture for all love to gather riches and to add to they possession when they enjoyment of they be not likely to be disturbed and hence it happen that the citizen of such state vie with one another in whatever tend to promote public or private well-being in both of which consequently there be a wonderful growth but the contrary of all this take place in those country which live in servitude and the more oppressive they servitude the more they fall short of the good which all desire and the hardest of all hard servitude be that wherein one commonwealth be subject to another first because it be more lasting and there be less hope to escape from it and second because every commonwealth seek to add to its own strength by weaken and enfeeble all beside a prince who get the better of you will not treat you after this fashion unless he be a barbarian like those eastern despot who lay country waste and destroy the labor of civilization but if influence by the ordinary prompting of humanity will as a rule regard all he subject state with equal favor and suffer they to pursue they usual employment and retain almost all they ancient institution so that if they flourish not as free state might they do not dwindle as state that be enslave by which i mean enslave by a stranger for of that other slavery to which they may be reduce by one of they own citizen i have already speak whoever therefore shall well consider what have be say above will not be astonish at the power possess by the samnite while they be still free nor at the weakness into which they fall when they be subjugate of which change in they fortune livius often remind we and particularly in connection with the war with hannibal where he relate that the samnite be ill-treat by a roman legion quarter at nolum send legate to hannibal to ask he aid who in lay they case before he tell he that with they own soldier and captain they have fight single hand against the roman for a hundred year and have more than once withstand two consul and two consular army but have now fall so low that they be scarce able to defend themselves against one poor legion chapter iii -- _ that rome become great by destroy the city which lay round about she and by readily admit stranger to the rights of citizenship _ crescit interea roma albæ ruini -- _ meanwhile rome grow on the ruin of alba _ they who would have they city become a great empire must endeavor by every means to fill it with inhabitant for without a numerous population no city can ever succeed in grow powerful this may be effect in two way by gentleness or by force by gentleness when you offer a safe and open path to all stranger who may wish to come and dwell in you city so as to encourage they to come there of they own accord by force when after destroy neighbouring town you transplant they inhabitant to live in yours both of these method be practice by rome and with such success that in the time of she sixth king there dwell within she wall eighty thousand citizen fit to bear arm for the roman love to follow the method of the skilful husbandman who to insure a plant grow big and yielding and mature its fruit cut off the first shoot it send out that the strength remain in the stem it may in due season put forth new and more vigorous and more fruitful branch and that this be a right and a necessary course for rome to take for establish and extend she empire be prove by the example of sparta and athen which although exceedingly well-armed state and regulate by excellent law never reach the same greatness as the roman republic though the latter to all appearance be more turbulent and disorderly than they and so far as law go not so perfectly govern for this we can offer no other explanation than that already give for by augment the number of she citizen in both the way name rome be soon able to place two hundred and eighty thousand man under arm while neither sparta nor athen could ever muster more than twenty thousand and this not because the situation of these country be less advantageous than that of rome but simply from the difference in the method they follow for lycurgus the founder of the spartan republic think nothing so likely to relax he law as a admixture of new citizen do all he could to prevent intercourse with stranger with which object besides refuse these the right to marry the right of citizenship and all such other social rights as induce man to become member of a community he ordain that in this republic of he the only money current should be of leather so that none might be tempt to repair thither to trade or to carry on any art under such circumstance the number of the inhabitant of that state could never much increase for as all we action imitate nature and it be neither natural nor possible that a puny stem should carry a great branch so a small republic can not assume control over city or country stronger than herself or do so will resemble the tree whose bough be greater than its trunk be support with difficulty and snap by every gust of wind as it prove with sparta for after she have spread she dominion over all the city of greece no sooner do thebe rebel than all the other rebel likewise and the trunk be leave strip of its bough but this could not have happen with rome whose stem be mighty enough to bear any branch with ease it be therefore by add to she population and by adopt certain other method presently to be notice that rome become so great and powerful and this be well express by titus livius in the word _ crescit interea roma albae ruinis _ chapter iv -- _ that commonwealth have follow three method for extend they power _ any one who have read ancient history with attention must have observe that three method have be use by republic for extend they power one of these follow by the old etruscan be to form a confederation of many state wherein none have precedence over the rest in authority or rank and each allow the other to share its acquisition as do the state of the swiss league in we day and as the achaian and etolian do in greece in earlier time and because the etruscan be oppose to the roman in many war that i may give a clearer notion of this method of theirs i shall enlarge a little in my account of the etruscan people in italy before the roman become supreme the etruscan be very powerful both by sea and land and although we have no separate history of they affair we have some slight record leave we of they and some indication of they greatness we know for instance that they plant a colony to which they give the name of hadrium on the coast of the upper sea which colony become so renowned that it lend its name to the sea itself which to this day by the latin be call the hadriatic we know too that they arm be obey from the tiber to the foot of the mountain which enclose the greater part of the italian peninsula although two hundred year before rome grow to any great strength they have lose they supremacy in the province now know as lombardy of which the french have possess themselves for that people whether drive by necessity or attract by the excellence of the fruit and still more of the wine of italy come there under they chief bellovesus and after defeat and expel the inhabitant of the country settle themselves therein and there build many city call the district gallium after the name they then bear : and this territory they retain until they be subdue by the roman these etruscan therefore live with one another on a footing of complete equality when they seek to extend they power follow that first method of which i have just now speak they state be make up of twelve city among which be chiusi veius friulus arezzo volterra and the like and they government be conduct in the form of a league they could not however extend they conquest beyond italy while even within the limit of italy much territory remain unoccupied by they for reason presently to be notice the second method be to provide yourself with ally or companion take heed however to retain in you own hand the chief command the seat of government and the titular supremacy this be the method follow by the roman the third method be to hold other state in direct subjection to you and not merely associate with you as companion and this be the plan pursue by the spartan and athenian of these three method the last be wholly useless as be see in the case of the two state name which come to ruin from no other cause than that they have acquire a dominion greater than they could maintain for to undertake to govern city by force especially such city as have be use to live in freedom be a difficult and arduous task in which you never can succeed without a army and that a great one but to have such a army you must need have associate who will help to swell the number of you own citizen and because athen and sparta neglect this precaution whatever they do be do in vain whereas rome which offer a instance of the second of the method we be consider by attend to this precaution reach a power that have no limit and as she alone have live in this way so she alone have attain to this pitch of power for join with herself many state throughout italy as she companion who in most respects live with she on a footing of equality while as have be note always reserve to herself the seat of empire and the titular command it come about that these state without be aware of it by they own effort and with they own blood work out they own enslavement for when rome begin to send army out of italy for the purpose of reduce foreign kingdom to province and of subjugate nation who be use to live under king be not impatient of she yoke and who receive roman governor and have be conquer by army bear the roman name recognize no master save the roman those companion of rome who dwell in italy suddenly find themselves surround by roman subject and weigh down by the greatness of the roman power and when at last they come to perceive the mistake in which they have be live it be too late to remedy it so vast be the authority which rome have then obtain over foreign country and so great the resource which she possess within herself have by this time grow to be the mightiest and best-armed of state so that although these she companion seek to avenge they wrong by conspire against she they be soon defeat in the attempt and remain in a worse plight than before since they too become subject and no longer associate this method then as i have say be follow by the roman alone but no other plan can be pursue by a republic which desire to extend its power experience have show none other so safe and certain the method which consist in form league of which i have speak above as have be adopt by the etruscan the achaian and the etolian of old and in we own day by the swiss be the next best after that follow by the roman for as in this way there can be no great extension of power two advantage result : first that you do not readily involve yourself in war and second that you can easily preserve any little acquisition which you may make the reason why you can not greatly extend you power be that as you league be make up of separate state with distinct seat of government it be difficult for these to consult and resolve in concert the same cause make these state careless to enlarge they territory because acquisition which have to be share among many community be less think of than those make by a single republic which look to enjoy they all to itself again since league govern through general council they must need be slower in resolve than a nation dwelling within one frontier moreover we find from experience that this method have certain fix limit beyond which there be no instance of its ever have pass by which i mean that some twelve or fourteen community may league themselves together but will never seek to pass beyond that limit : for after associate themselves in such number as seem to they to secure they safety against all besides they desire no further extension of they power partly because no necessity compel they to extend and partly because for the reason already give they would find no profit in extend for be they to seek extension they would have to follow one of two course : either continue to admit new member to they league whose number must lead to confusion or else make subject a course which they will avoid since they will see difficulty in make they and no great good in have they wherefore when they number have so increase that they safety seem secure they have recourse to two expedient : either receive other state under they protection and engage for they defense -lrb- in which way they obtain money from various quarter which they can easily distribute among themselves -rrb- or else hire themselves out as soldier to foreign state and draw pay from this or the other prince who employ they to carry out he enterprise as we see do by the swiss at the present day and as we read be do in ancient time by certain of those nation whom we have name above to which we have a witness in titus livius who relate that when philip of macedon come to treat with titus quintius flamininus and while term be be discuss in the presence of a certain etolian captain this man come to word with philip the latter taunt he with greed and bad faith tell he that the etolian be not ashamed to draw pay from one side and then send they man to serve on the other so that often the banner of etolia might be see display in two hostile camp we see therefore that the method of proceeding by league have always be of the same character and have lead always to the same result we see likewise that the method which proceed by reduce state to direct subjection have constantly prove a weak one and produce insignificant gain and that whenever these gain have pass a certain limit ruin have ensue and if the latter of these two method be of little utility among armed state among those that be unarmed as be now the case with the republic of italy it be worse than useless we may conclude therefore that the true method be that follow by the roman which be the more remarkable as we find none who adopt it before they do and none who have follow it since as for league i know of no nation who have have recourse to they in recent time except the swiss and the suevian but to bring my remark on this head to a end i affirm that all the various method follow by the roman in conduct they affair whether foreign or domestic so far from be imitate in we day have be hold of no account some pronounce they to be mere fable some think they impracticable other out of place and unprofitable and so abide in this ignorance we rest a prey to all who have choose to invade we country but should it seem difficult to tread in the footstep of the roman it ought not to appear so hard especially for we tuscan to imitate the tuscan of antiquity who if from the cause already assign they fail to establish a empire like that of rome succeed in acquire in italy that degree of power which they method of act allow and which they long preserve in security with the greatest renown in arm and government and the highest reputation for manners and religion this power and this glory of theirs be first impaired by the gaul and afterwards extinguish by the roman and so utterly extinguish that of the etruscan empire so splendid two thousand year ago we have at the present day barely a record this it be which have lead I to inquire whence this oblivion of thing arise a question of which i shall treat in the follow chapter chapter v -- _ that change in sect and tongue and the happen of flood and pestilence obliterate the memory of the past _ to those philosopher who will have it that the world have exist from all eternity it be i think a good answer that if what they say be true we ought to have record of a longer period than five thousand year do it not appear that the memory of past time be blot out by a variety of cause some referable to man and some to heaven among the cause which have a human origin be the change in sect and tongue because when a new sect that be to say a new religion come up its first endeavor in order to give itself reputation be to efface the old and should it so happen that the founder of the new religion speak another tongue this may readily be effect this we know from observe the method which christianity have follow in deal with the religion of the gentile for we find that it have abolish all the rite and ordinance of that worship and obliterate every trace of the ancient belief true it have not succeed in utterly blot out we knowledge of thing do by the famous man who hold that belief and this because the propagator of the new faith retain the latin tongue be constrain to use it in write the new law for could they have write this in a new tongue we may infer have regard to they other persecution that no record whatever would have survive to we of past event for any one who read of the method follow by saint gregory and the other head of the christian religion will perceive with what animosity they pursue all ancient memorial burn the work of poet and historian break image and destroy whatsoever else afford any trace of antiquity so that if to this persecution a new language have be join it must soon have be find that everything be forget we may believe therefore that what christianity have seek to effect against the sect of the gentile be actually effect by that sect against the religion which precede theirs and that from the repeat change of belief which have take place in the course of five or six thousand year the memory of what happen at a remote date have perish or if any trace of it remain have come to be regard as a fable to which no credit be due like the chronicle of diodorus siculus which profess to give a account of the event of forty or fifty thousand year be hold and i believe justly a lie tale as for the cause of oblivion which we may refer to heaven they be those which make havoc of the human race and reduce the population of certain part of the world to a very small number this happen by plague famine or flood of which three the last be the most hurtful as well because it be the most universal as because those save be generally rude and ignorant mountaineer who possess no knowledge of antiquity themselves can impart none to those who come after they or if among the survivor there chance to be one possess of such knowledge to give himself consequence and credit he will conceal and pervert it to suit he private end so that to he posterity there will remain only so much as he may have be please to communicate and no more that these flood plague and famine do in fact happen i see no reason to doubt both because we find all history full of they and recognize they effect in this oblivion of the past and also because it be reasonable that such thing should happen for as when much superfluous matter have gather in simple body nature make repeat effort to remove and purge it away thereby promote the health of these body so likewise as regard that composite body the human race when every province of the world so teem with inhabitant that they can neither subsist where they be nor remove elsewhere every region be equally crowd and over-peopled and when human craft and wickedness have reach they highest pitch it must need come about that the world will purge herself in one or another of these three way to the end that man become few and contrite may amend they life and live with more convenience etrurium then as have be say above be at one time powerful abound in piety and valor practise she own custom and speak she own tongue but all this be efface by the power of rome so that as i have observe already nothing be leave of she but the memory of a name chapter vi -- _ of the method follow by the roman in make war _ have treat of the method follow by the roman for increase they power we shall now go on to consider those which they use in make war and in all they do we shall find how wisely they turn aside from the common path in order to render they progress to supreme greatness easy whosoever make war whether from policy or ambition mean to acquire and to hold what he acquire and to carry on the war he have undertake in such a manner that it shall enrich and not impoverish he native country and state it be necessary therefore whether for acquire or hold to consider how cost may be avoid and everything do most advantageously for the public welfare but whoever would effect all this must take the course and follow the method of the roman which consist first of all in make they war as the french say _ great and short _ for enter the field with strong army they bring to a speedy conclusion whatever war they have with the latin the samnite or the etruscan and if we take note of all the war in which they be engage from the foundation of they city down to the siege of veii all will be see to have be quickly end some in twenty some in ten and some in no more than six day and this be they wont : so soon as war be declare they would go forth with they army to meet the enemy and at once deliver battle the enemy on be route to save they country from pillage very soon come to term when the roman would take from they certain portion of they territory these they either assign to particular person or make the seat of a colony which be settle on the confines of the conquer country serve as a defense to the roman frontier to the advantage both of the colonist who have these land give they and of the roman people whose border be thus guard at no expense to themselves and no other system of defense could have be at once so safe so strong and so effectual for while the enemy be not actually in the field this guard be sufficient and when they come out in force to overwhelm the colony the roman also go forth in strength and give they battle and get the better of they impose harder term than before and so return home and in this way they come gradually to establish they name abroad and to add to they power these method they continue to employ until they change they system of warfare which they do during the siege of veius when to enable they to carry on a prolonged war they pass a law for the payment of they soldier whom up to that time they have not pay nor need to pay because till then they war have be of brief duration nevertheless while allow pay to they soldier that they might thus wage longer war and keep they army longer in the field when employ on distant enterprise they never depart from they old plan of bring they campaign to as speedy a end as place and circumstance allow nor ever cease to plant colony they custom of terminate they war with despatch besides be natural to the roman be strengthen by the ambition of they consul who be appoint for twelve month only six of which they have to spend in the city be eager to bring they war to a end as rapidly as they could that they might enjoy the honor of a triumph the usage of plant colony be recommend by the great advantage and convenience which result from it in deal with the spoil of warfare they practice no doubt in a measure change so that in this respect they be not afterwards so liberal as they be at first partly because liberality do not seem so necessary when they soldier be in receipt of pay and partly because the spoil themselves be greater than before they think by they help so to enrich the public treasury as to be able to carry on they war without tax the city and in fact by pursue this course the public revenue be soon greatly augment the method thus follow by the roman in divide plunder and in plant colony have accordingly this result that whereas other less prudent prince and republic be impoverish by war rome be enrich by it nay so far be the system carry that no consul could hope for a triumph unless he bring back with he for the public treasury much gold and silver and spoil of every kind by method such as these at one time bring they war to a rapid conclusion by invasion and actual defeat at another wear out a enemy by protracted hostility and again by conclude peace on advantageous term the roman continually grow richer and more powerful chapter vii -- _ of the quantity of land assign by the roman to each colonist _ it would i think be difficult to fix with certainty how much land the roman allot to each colonist for my belief be that they give more or less accord to the character of the country to which they send they we may however be sure that in every instance and to whatever country they be send the quantity of land assign be not very large : first because these colonist be send to guard the newly acquire country by give little land it become possible to send more man and second because as the roman live frugally at home it be unreasonable to suppose that they should wish they countryman to be too well off abroad and titus livius tell we that on the capture of veii the roman send thither a colony allotting to each colonist three jugera and seven uncia of land which accord to we measurement would be something under two acre besides the above reason the roman may likely enough have think that it be not so much the quantity of the land allot as its careful cultivation that would make it suffice it be very necessary however that every colony should have common pasturage where all may send they cattle to graze as well as wood where they may cut fuel for without such convenience no colony can maintain itself chapter viii -- _ why certain nation leave they ancestral seat and overflow the country of other _ have speak above of the method follow by the roman in make war and related how the etruscan be attack by the gaul it seem to I not foreign to these topic to explain that of war there be two kind one kind of war have its origin in the ambition of prince or republic who seek to extend they dominion such be the war wage by alexander the great and by the roman and such be those which we see every day carry on by one potentate against another war of this sort have they danger but do not utterly extirpate the inhabitant of a country what the conqueror seek be merely the submission of the conquer people whom generally speak he suffer to retain they law and always they house and goods the other species of war be when a entire people with all the family of which it be make up be drive out by famine or defeat remove from its former seat and go in search of a new abode and a new country not simply with the view to establish dominion over it but to possess it as its own and to expel or exterminate the former inhabitant of this most terrible and cruel species of warfare sallust speak at the end of he history of the war with jugurtha where in mention that after the defeat of jugurtha the movement of the gaul into italy begin to be notice he observe that _ in the war of the roman with other nation the struggle be for mastery but that always in they war with the gaul the struggle on both side be for life _ for a prince or commonwealth when attack another state will be content to rid themselves of those only who be at the head of affair but a entire people set in motion in the manner describe must destroy all who oppose they since they object be to subsist on that whereon those whom they invade have hitherto subsist the roman have to pass through three of these desperate war the first be that in which they city be actually capture by those gaul who as already mention have previously take lombardy from the etruscan and make it they seat and for whose invasion titus livius have assign two cause first that they be attract as i have say before by the fruitful soil and by the wine of italy which they have not in gaul second that they population have multiply so greatly that they could no longer find wherewithal to live on at home the prince of they land decide that certain of they number should go forth to seek a new abode and so decide choose as leader of those who be to go two gaulish chief bellovesus and siccovesus the former of whom come into italy while the latter pass into spain from the immigration under bellovesus result the occupation of lombardy and subsequently the first war of the gaul with rome at a later date and after the close of the first war with carthage come the second gallic invasion when more than two hundred thousand gaul perish in battle between piombino and pisa the third of these war break out on the descent into italy of the todus and cimbrus who after defeat several roman army be themselves defeat by marius in these three most dangerous contest the arm of rome prevail but no ordinary valor be need for they success for we see afterwards when the spirit of the roman have decline and they army have lose they former excellence they supremacy be overthrow by man of the same race that be to say by the goth the vandal and other like they who spread themselves over the whole of the western empire nation such as these quit as i have say they native land when force by famine or by defeat in domestic war to seek a new habitation elsewhere when those thus drive forth be in large number they violently invade the territory of other nation slaughter the inhabitant seize on they possession found new kingdom and give new name to province as be do by mose and by those tribe who overrun the roman empire for the new name which we find in italy and elsewhere have no other origin than in they have be give by these new occupant as when the country formerly know as gallium cisalpina and gallium transalpina take the name of lombardy and france from the lombard and the frank who settle themselves there in the same way sclavonium be formerly know as illyrium hungary as pannonium and england as britain while many other province which it would be tedious to enumerate have similarly change they designation as when the name judæa be give by mose to that part of syrium of which he take possession and since i have say above that nation such as those i have be describe be often drive by war from they ancestral home and force to seek a new country elsewhere i shall cite the instance of the maurusian a people who anciently dwell in syrium but hearing of the inroad of the hebrew and think themselves unable to resist they choose rather to seek safety in flight than to perish with they country in a vain effort to defend it for which reason remove with they family they go to africa where after drive out the native inhabitant they take up they abode and although they could not defend they own country be able to possess themselves of a country belong to other and procopius who write the history of the war which belisarius conduct against those vandal who seize on africa relate that on certain pillar stand in place where the maurusian once dwell he have read inscription in these word : _ we maurusian who flee before joshua the robber the son of nun _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- give we to know the cause of they quit syrium be this as it may nation thus drive forth by a supreme necessity be if they be in great number in the highest degree dangerous and can not be successfully withstand except by a people who excel in arm when those constrain to abandon they home be not in large number they be not so dangerous as the nation of whom i have be speak since they can not use the same violence but must trust to they address to procure they a habitation and after procure it must live with they neighbor as friend and companion as we find æneas dido the massilian and other like they to have live all of whom contrived to maintain themselves in the district in which they settle by secure the good will of the neighbouring nation almost all the great emigration of nation have be and continue to be from the cold and barren region of scythium because from the population there be excessive and the soil ill able to support they they be force to quit they home many cause operate to drive they forth and none to keep they back and if for the last five hundred year it have not happen that any of these nation have actually overrun another country there be various reason to account for it first the great clearance which that region make of its inhabitant during the decline of the roman empire when more than thirty nation issue from it in succession and next the circumstance that the country of germany and hungary whence also these nation come be now so much improve that man can live there in comfort and consequently be not constrain to shift they habitation besides which since these country be occupy by a very warlike race they serve as a sort of bulwark to keep back the neighbouring scythian who for this reason do not venture to attack they nor attempt to force a passage nevertheless movement on a great scale have oftentimes be begin by the tartar and be at once withstand by the hungarian and pole whose frequent boast it be that but for they italy and the church would more than once have feel the weight of the tartar arm of the nation of whom i have be speak i shall now say no more -lrb- footnote 1 : no maurusii qui fugimus a facie jesu latroni filius nava _ procop hist bell vand ii _ -rrb- chapter ix -- _ of the cause which commonly give rise to war between state _ the occasion which lead to war between the roman and samnite who for long have be in league with one another be of common occurrence in all powerful state be either bring about by accident or else purposely contrived by some one who would set war a-foot as between the roman and the samnite the occasion of war be accidental for in make war upon the sidicinian and afterwards on the campanian the samnite have no thought of involve themselves with the roman but the campanian be overpower and contrary to the expectation of roman and samnite alike resort to rome for aid the roman on whose protection they throw themselves be force to succor they as dependant and to accept a war which it seem to they they could not with honor decline for though they might have think it unreasonable to be call on to defend the campanian as friend against they own friend the samnite it seem to they shameful not to defend they as subject or as a people who have place themselves under they protection for they reason that to decline they defense would close the gate against all other who at any future time might desire to submit themselves to they power and accordingly since glory and empire and not peace be the end which they always have in view it become impossible for they to refuse this protectorship a similar circumstance give rise to the first war with the carthaginian namely the protectorate assume by the roman of the citizen of messina in sicily and this likewise come about by chance but the second war with carthage be not the result of chance for hannibal the carthaginian general attack the saguntan who be the friend of rome in spain not from any desire to injure they but in order to set the arm of rome in motion and so gain a opportunity of engage the roman in a war and pass on into italy this method of pick a quarrel be constantly resort to by powerful state when they be bind by scruple of honor or like consideration for if i desire to make war on a prince with whom i be under a ancient and binding treaty i shall find some color or pretext for attack the friend of that prince very well know that when i attack he friend either the prince will resent it when my scheme for engage he in war will be realize or that should he not resent it he weakness or baseness in not defend one who be under he protection will be make apparent either of which alternative will discredit he and further my design we be to note therefore in connection with this submission of the campanian what have just now be say as to provoke another power to war and also the remedy open to a state which be unequal to its own defense be prepare to go all length to ruin its assailant -- that remedy be to give itself up unreservedly to some one whom it select for its defender as the campanian give themselves up to the roman and as the florentine give themselves up to king robert of naple who after refuse to defend they as he friend against castruccio of lucca by whom they be hard press defend they as he subject chapter x -- _ that contrary to the vulgar opinion money be not the sinew of war _ since any man may begin a war at he pleasure but can not at he pleasure bring it to a close a prince before he engage in any warlike enterprise ought to measure he strength and govern himself accordingly but he must be prudent enough not to deceive himself as to he strength which he will always do if he measure it by money by advantage of position or by the good-will of he subject while he be unprovided with a army of he own these be thing which may swell you strength but do not constitute it be in themselves null and of no avail without a army on which you can depend without such a army no amount of money will meet you want the natural strength of you country will not protect you and the fidelity and attachment of you subject will not endure since it be impossible that they should continue true to you when you can not defend they lake and mountain and the most inaccessible stronghold where valiant defender be want become no better than the level plain and money so far from be a safeguard be more likely to leave you a prey to you enemy since nothing can be falser than the vulgar opinion which affirm it to be the sinew of war this opinion be put forward by quintus curtius where in speaking of the war between antipater the macedonian and the king of sparta he relate that the latter from want of money be constrain to give battle and be defeat whereas could he have put off fight for a few day the news of alexander 's death would have reach greece and he might have have a victory without a battle but lack money and fear that on that account he soldier might desert he he be force to hazard a engagement it be for this reason that quintus curtius declare money to be the sinew of war a maxim every day cite and act upon by prince less wise than they should be for building upon this they think it enough for they defense to have lay up great treasure not reflect that be great treasure all that be need for victory darius of old have conquer alexander the greek the roman and in we own time charle of burgundy the swiss while the pope and the florentine together would have have little difficulty in defeat francesco marium nephew of pope julius ii in the recent war of urbino and yet in every one of these instance the victory remain with he who hold the sinew of war to consist not in money but in good soldier croesus king of lydium after show solon the athenian much besides at last display to he the boundless riches of he treasure-house and ask he what he think of he power whereupon solon answer that he think he no whit more powerful in respect of these treasure for as war be make with iron and not with gold another come with more iron might carry off he gold after the death of alexander the great a tribe of gaul pass through greece on they way into asia send envoy to the king of macedonium to treat for term of accord when the king to dismay they by a display of he resource show they great store of gold and silver but these barbarian when they see all this wealth in they greed to possess it though before they have look on peace as settle break off negotiation and thus the king be ruin by those very treasure he have amass for he defense in like manner not many year ago the venetian with a full treasury lose they whole dominion without derive the least advantage from they wealth i maintain therefore that it be not gold as be vulgarly suppose that be the sinew of war but good soldier or while gold by itself will not gain you good soldier good soldier may readily get you gold have the roman choose to make war with gold rather than with iron all the treasure of the earth would not have suffice they have regard to the greatness of they enterprise and the difficulty they have to overcome in carry they out but make they war with iron they never feel any want of gold for those who stand in fear of they bring gold into they camp and suppose it true that the spartan king be force by lack of money to risk the chance of a battle it only fare with he in respect of money as it have often fare with other from other cause since we see that where a army be in such strait for want of victual that it must either fight or perish by famine it will always fight as be the more honorable course and that on which fortune may in some way smile so too it have often happen that a captain see he enemy about to be reinforce have be oblige either to trust to fortune and at once deliver battle or else wait till the reinforcement be complete to fight then whether he will or no and at whatever disadvantage we find also as in the case of hasdrubal when beset in the march of ancona at once by claudius nero and by the other roman consul that a captain when he must either fight or fly will always fight since it will seem to he that by this course however hazardous he have at least a chance of victory while by the other he ruin be certain there be many circumstance therefore which may force a captain to give battle contrary to he intention among which the want of money may sometimes be one but this be no ground for pronounce money to be the sinew of war any more than those other thing from the want of which man be reduce to the same necessity once more therefore i repeat that not gold but good soldier constitute the sinew of war money indeed be most necessary in a secondary place but this necessity good soldier will always be able to supply since it be as impossible that good soldier should lack money as that money by itself should secure good soldier and that what i say be true be show by countless passage in history when pericle persuade the athenian to declare war against the whole peloponnesus assure they that they dexterity aid by they wealth be sure to bring they off victorious the athenian though for a while they prosper in this war in the end be overpower the prudent counsel and good soldier of sparta prove more than a match for the dexterity and wealth of athen but indeed there can be no better witness to the truth of my contention than titus livius himself for in that passage of he history wherein he discuss whether if alexander the great have invade italy he would have succeed in vanquish the roman three thing be note by he as essential to success in war to wit many and good soldier prudent captain and favourable fortune and after examine whether the roman or alexander would have have the advantage in each of these three particulars he arrive at he conclusion without any mention of money the campanian therefore when ask by the sidicinian to arm in they behalf must have measure they strength by wealth and not by soldier for after declare in they favor and suffer two defeat to save themselves they be oblige to become tributary to rome chapter xi -- _ that it be unwise to ally yourself a prince who have reputation rather than strength _ to mark the mistake make by the sidicinian in trust to the protection of the campanian and by the campanian in suppose themselves able to protect the sidicinian titus livius could not have express himself in apter word than by say that _ the campanian rather lend they name to the sidicinian than furnished any substantial aid towards they defense _ here we have to note that alliance with prince who from dwelling at a distance have no facility or who from they own embarrassment or from other cause have no ability to render aid afford rather reputation than protection to those who put they trust in they as be the case in we own time with the florentine when in the year 1479 they be attack by the pope and the king of naple for be friend of the french king they draw from that friendship more reputation than help the same would be the case with that prince who should engage in any enterprise in reliance on the emperor maximilian he be one of those friendship which in the word of we historian _ nomen magi quam praesidium adferunt _ on this occasion therefore the campanian be mislead by imagine themselves stronger than they really be for often from defect of judgment man take upon they to defend other when they have neither skill nor ability to defend themselves of which we have a further instance in the tarentine who when the roman and samnite army be already draw up against one another for battle send messenger to the roman consul to acquaint he that they desire peace between the two nation and would themselves declare war against whichsoever of the two first begin hostility the consul laughing at they threat in the presence of the messenger order the signal for battle to sound and bid he army advance to meet the enemy show the tarentine by act rather than word what answer he think they message deserve have speak in the present chapter of unwise course follow by prince for defend other i shall speak in the next of the method they follow in defend themselves chapter xii -- _ whether when invasion be imminent it be better to anticipate or to await it _ i have often hear it dispute by man well verse in military affair whether when there be two prince of nearly equal strength and the bolder of the two proclaim war upon the other it be better for that other to await attack within he own frontier or to march into the enemy 's country and fight he there and i have hear reason give in favor of each of these course they who maintain that a enemy should be attack in he own country cite the advice give by croesus to cyrus when the latter have come to the frontier of the massagetæ to make war on that people for word be send by tomyris they queen that cyrus might at he pleasure either enter she dominion where she would await he or else allow she to come and meet he and the matter be debate croesus contrary to the opinion of other adviser counsel cyrus to go forward and meet the queen urge that be he to defeat she at a distance from she kingdom he might not be able to take it from she since she would have time to repair she strength whereas be he to defeat she within she own dominion he could follow she up on she flight and without give she time to recover herself deprive she of she state they cite also the advice give by hannibal to antiochus when the latter be meditate a war on the roman for hannibal tell he that the roman could not be vanquish except in italy where a invader might turn to account the arm and resource of they friend whereas any one make war upon they out of italy and leave that country in they hand would leave they a unfailing source whence to draw whatever reinforcement they might need and finally he tell he that the roman might more easily be deprive of rome than of they empire and of italy more easily than of any of they other province they likewise instance agathocle who be unequal to support a war at home invade the carthaginian by whom he be be attack and reduce they to sue for peace they also cite scipio who to shift the war from italy carry it into africa those who hold a contrary opinion contend that to have you enemy at a disadvantage you must get he away from he home allege the case of the athenian who while they carry on the war at they convenience in they own territory retain they superiority but when they quit that territory and go with they army to sicily lose they freedom they cite also the fable of the poet wherein it be figure that antæus king of libya be assail by the egyptian hercule could not be overcome while he await he adversary within the bound of he own kingdom but so soon as he be withdraw from these by the craft of hercule lose he kingdom and he life whence the fable run that antæus be son to the goddess earth when throw to the ground draw fresh strength from the earth he mother and that hercule perceive this hold he up away from the earth recent opinion be likewise cite as favor this view every one know how ferrando king of naple be in he day account a most wise prince and how two year before he death there come a rumor that charle viii of france be meditate a attack upon he and how after make great preparation for he defense he sicken and be on the point of death among other counsel leave he son alfonso this advice that nothing in the world should tempt he to pass out of he own territory but to await the enemy within he frontier and with he force unimpair a warning disregard by alfonso who send into romagna a army which he lose and with it he whole dominion without a battle other argument on both side of the question in addition to those already notice be as follow : he who attack show higher courage than he who stand on he defense and this give he army greater confidence moreover by attack you enemy you deprive he of many opportunity for use he resource since he can receive no aid from subject who have be strip of they possession and when a enemy be at he gate a prince must be careful how he levy money and impose tax so that as hannibal say the spring which enable a country to support a war come to be dry up again the soldier of a invader finding themselves in a foreign land be under a stronger necessity to fight and necessity as have often be say be the parent of valor on the other hand it may be argue that there be many advantage to be gain by await the attack of you enemy for without put yourself much about you may harass he by intercept he supplies whether of victual or of whatsoever else a army stand in need : from you better knowledge of the country you can impede he movement and because man muster more willingly to defend they home than to go on distant expedition you can meet he with more numerous force if defeat you can more easily repair you strength because the bulk of you army find shelter at hand will be able to save itself and you reserve will have no distance to come in this way you can use you whole strength without risk you entire fortune whereas in leave you country you risk you entire fortune without put forth you whole strength nay we find that to weaken a adversary still further some have suffer he to make a march of several day into they country and then to capture certain of they town that by leave garrison in these he might reduce the number of he army and so be attack at greater disadvantage but now to speak my own mind on the matter i think we should make this distinction either you have you country strongly defend as the roman have and the swiss have theirs or like the carthaginian of old and the king of france and the italian at the present day you have it undefended in the latter case you must keep the enemy at a distance from you country for as you strength lie not in man but in money whenever the supply of money be cut off you be undo and nothing so soon cut off this supply as a war of invasion of which we have example in the carthaginian who while they country be free from invasion be able by means of they great revenue to carry on war in italy against the roman but when they be invade could not defend themselves even against agathocle the florentine in like manner could make no head against castruccio lord of lucca when he attack they in they own country and to obtain protection be compel to yield themselves up to king robert of naple and yet after castruccio 's death these same florentine be bold enough to attack the duke of milan in he own country and strong enough to strip he of he dominion such valor do they display in distant war such weakness in those that be near but when a country be arm as rome be and switzerland now be the closer you press it the harder it be to subdue because such state can assemble a stronger force to resist attack than for attack other nor do the great authority of hannibal move I in this instance since resentment and he own advantage might lead he to speak as he speak to antiochus for have the roman suffer in gaul and within the same space of time those three defeat at the hand of hannibal which they suffer in italy it must have make a end of they since they could not have turn the remnant of they army to account as they do in italy not have the same opportunity for repair they strength nor could they have meet they enemy with such numerous army for we never find they send forth a force of more than fifty thousand man for the invasion of any province whereas in defend they own country against the inroad of the gaul at the end of the first carthaginian war we hear of they bring some eighteen hundred thousand man into the field and they failure to vanquish the gaul in lombardy as they have vanquish those in tuscany arise from they inability to lead a great force so far against a numerous enemy or to encounter he with the same advantage in germany the cimbrian route a roman army who have there no means to repair they disaster but when they come into italy the roman could collect they whole strength and destroy they out of they native country whence they can bring no more than thirty or forty thousand man the swiss may readily be defeat but in they own country where they can assemble a hundred thousand they be well-nigh invincible in conclusion therefore i repeat that the prince who have he people arm and train for war should always await a great and dangerous war at home and never go forth to meet it but that he whose subject be unarmed and whose country be not habituate to war should always carry the war to as great a distance as he can from home for in this way each will defend himself in the best manner he means admit chapter xiii -- _ that man rise from humble to high fortune rather by fraud than by force _ i hold it as most certain that man seldom if ever rise to great place from small beginning without use fraud or force unless indeed they be give or take by inheritance the place to which some other have already come force however will never suffice by itself to effect this end while fraud often will as any one may plainly see who read the life of philip of macedon agathocle of sicily and many other like they who from the lowest or at any rate from very low beginning rise either to sovereignty or to the highest command this necessity for use deceit be teach by xenophon in he life of cyrus for the very first expedition on which cyrus be send against the king of armenia be see to teem with fraud and it be by fraud and not by force that he be represent as have acquire he kingdom so that the only inference to be draw from he conduct as xenophon describe it be that the prince who would accomplish great thing must have learn how to deceive xenophon moreover represent he hero as deceive he maternal grandsire cyaxare king of the median in a variety of way give it to be understand that without such deceit he could not have reach the greatness to which he come nor do i believe that any man bear to humble fortune can be show to have attain great station by sheer and open force whereas this have often be effect by mere fraud such as that use by giovannus galeazzo to deprive he uncle bernabo of the state and government of lombardy the same art which prince be constrain to use at the outset of they career must also be use by commonwealth until they have grow powerful enough to dispense with they and trust to strength alone and because rome at all time whether from chance or choice follow all such method as be necessary to attain greatness in this also she be not behindhand and to begin with she could have use no greater fraud than be involve in she method above notice of make for herself companion since under this name she make for herself subject for such the latin and the other surround nation in fact become for avail herself at first of they arm to subdue neighbouring country and gain herself reputation as a state she power be so much increase by these conquest that there be none whom she could not overcome but the latin never know that they be enslave until they see the samnite twice route and force to make term this success while it add greatly to the fame of the roman among prince at a distance who be thereby make familiar with the roman name though not with the roman arm breed at the same time jealousy and distrust among those who like the latin both saw and feel these arm and such be the effect of this jealousy and distrust that not the latin only but all the roman colony in latium along with the campanian whom a little while before the roman have defend league themselves together against the authority of rome this war be set on foot by the latin in the manner in which as i have already explain most war be begin not by directly attack the roman but by defend the sidicinian against the samnite who be make war upon they with the permission of the roman and that it be from they have find out the crafty policy of the roman that the latin be lead to take this step be plain from the word which titus livius put in the mouth of annius setinus the latin prætor who in address the latin council be make to say _ for if even now we can put up with slavery under the disguise of a equal alliance etc _ we see therefore that the roman from the time they first begin to extend they power be not unfamiliar with the art of deceive a art always necessary for those who would mount to great height from low beginning and which be the less to be condemn when as in the case of the roman it be skilfully conceal chapter xiv -- _ that man often err in think they can subdue pride by humility _ you shall often find that humility be not merely of no service to you but be even hurtful especially when use in deal with insolent man who through envy or other like cause have conceive hatred against you proof whereof be supply by we historian where he explain the cause of this war between the roman and the latin for on the samnite complain to the roman that the latin have attack they the roman desire not to give the latin ground of offence would not forbid they proceed with the war but the endeavor to avoid give offence to the latin only serve to increase they confidence and lead they the sooner to declare they hostility of which we have evidence in the language use by the same latin prætor annius setinus at the aforesaid council when he say : -- _ you have try they patience by refuse they soldier who doubt but that they be offend still they have put up with the affront they have hear that we be assemble a army against they ally the samnite and yet they have not stir from they city whence this astonishing forbearance but from they know we strength and they own weakness _ which word give we clearly to understand how much the patience of the roman increase the arrogance of the latin a prince therefore should never stoop from he dignity nor should he if he would have credit for any concession make it voluntarily unless he be able or believe himself able to withhold it for almost always when matter have come to such a pass that you can not give way with credit it be better that a thing be take from you by force than yield through fear of force for if you yield through fear and to escape war the chance be that you do not escape it since he to whom out of manifest cowardice you make this concession will not rest content but will endeavor to wring further concession from you and make less account of you will only be the more kindle against you at the same time you will find you friend less zealous on you behalf since to they you will appear either weak or cowardly but if so soon as the design of you enemy be disclose you at once prepare to resist though you strength be inferior to he he will begin to think more of you other neighbouring prince will think more and many will be willing to assist you on see you take up arm who have you relinquish hope and abandon yourself to despair would never have stir a finger to save you the above be to be understand as apply where you have a single adversary only but should you have several it will always be a prudent course even after war have be declare to restore to some one of they number something you have of he so as to regain he friendship and detach he from the other who have league themselves against you chapter xv -- that weak state be always dubious in they resolve and that tardy resolve be always hurtful touch this very matter and with regard to these earliest beginning of war between the latin and the roman it may be note that in all we deliberation it behove we to come quickly to a definite resolve and not to remain always in dubiety and suspense this be plainly see in connection with the council convene by the latin when they think to separate themselves from the roman for the roman suspect the hostile humor wherewith the latin be infect in order to learn how thing really stand and see whether they could not win back the malcontent without recourse to arm give they to know that they must send eight of they citizen to rome as they have occasion to consult with they on receive which message the latin know that they have do many thing contrary to the wish of the roman call a council to determine who of they number should be send and to instruct they what they be to say but annius they prætor be present in the council when these matter be be discuss tell they _ that he think it of far greater moment for they to consider what they be to do than what they be to say for when they resolve be form it would be easy to clothe they in fit word _ this in truth be sound advice and such as every prince and republic should lay to heart because where there be doubt and uncertainty as to what we may decide on do we know not how to suit we word to we conduct whereas with we mind make up and the course we be to follow fix it be a easy matter to find word to declare we resolve i have notice this point the more readily because i have often find such uncertainty hinder the public business of we own republic to its detriment and discredit and in all matter of difficulty wherein courage be need for resolve this uncertainty will always be meet with whenever those who have to deliberate and decide be weak not less mischievous than doubtful resolve be those which be late and tardy especially when they have to be make in behalf of a friend for from they lateness they help none and hurt ourselves tardy resolve be due to want of spirit or want of strength or to the perversity of those who have to determine who be move by a secret desire to overthrow the government or to carry out some selfish purpose of they own suffer no decision to be come to but only thwart and hinder whereas good citizen even when they see the popular mind to be bent on dangerous course will never oppose the adoption of a fix plan more particularly in matter which do not brook delay after hieronymus the syracusan tyrant be put to death there be at that time a great war between the roman and the carthaginian the citizen of syracuse fall to dispute among themselves with which nation they should take part and so fierce grow the controversy between the partisan of the two alliance that no course could be agree on and they take part with neither until apollonide one of the foremost of the syracusan citizen tell they in a speech replete with wisdom that neither those who incline to hold by the roman nor those who choose rather to side with the carthaginian be deserving of blame but that what be utterly to be condemn be doubt and delay in take one side or other for from such uncertainty he clearly foresee the ruin of they republic whereas by take a decide course whatever it might be some good might come now titus livius could not show more clearly than he do in this passage the mischief which result from rest in suspense he show it likewise in the case of the lavinian of whom he relate that be urge by the latin to aid they against rome they be so long in make up they mind that when the army which they at last send to succor the latin be issue from they gate word come that the latin be defeat whereupon millionius they prætor say _ with the roman this short march will cost we dear _ but have the lavinian resolve at once either to grant aid or to refuse it take a latter course they would not have give offence to the roman take the former and render timely help they and the latin together might have have a victory but by delay they stand to lose in every way as the event show this example have it be remember by the florentine might have save they from all that loss and vexation which they undergo at the hand of the french at the time king loui xii of france come into italy against lodovico duke of milan for when loui first propose to pass through tuscany he meet with no objection from the florentine whose envoy at he court arrange with he that they should stand neutral while the king on he arrival in italy be to maintain they government and take they under he protection a month 's time be allow the republic to ratify these term but certain person who in they folly favor the cause of lodovico delay this ratification until the king be already on the eve of victory when the florentine suddenly become eager to ratify the king would not accept they ratification perceive they consent to be give under constraint and not of they own good-will this cost the city of florence dear and go near to lose she freedom whereof she be afterwards deprive on another like occasion and the course take by the florentine be the more to be blame in that it be of no sort of service to duke lodovico who have he be victorious would have show the florentine many more sign of he displeasure than do the king although the hurt which result to republic from weakness of this sort have already be discuss in another chapter nevertheless since a opportunity offer for touch upon it again i have willingly avail myself of it because to I it seem a matter of which republic like ours should take special heed chapter xvi -- _ that the soldier of we day depart widely from the method of ancient warfare _ in all they war with other nation the most momentous battle ever fight by the roman be that which they fight with the latin when torquatus and decius be consul for it may well be believe that as by the loss of that battle the latin become subject to the roman so the roman have they not prevail must have become subject to the latin and titus livius be of this opinion since he represent the army as exactly equal in every respect in discipline and in valor in number and in obstinacy the only difference he draw be that of the two army the roman have the more capable commander we find however two circumstance occur in the conduct of this battle the like of which never happen before and seldom since namely that to give steadiness to the mind of they soldier and render they obedient to the word of command and resolute to fight one of the consul put himself and the other he son to death the equality which titus livius declare to have prevail in these two army arise from this that have long serve together they use the same language discipline and arm that in dispose they man for battle they follow the same system and that the division and officer of they army bear the same name it be necessary therefore that as they be of equal strength and valor something extraordinary should take place to render the courage of the one army more stubborn and unflinching than that of the other it be on this stubbornness as i have already say that victory depend for while this temper be maintain in the mind of the combatant they will never turn they back on they foe and that it might endure longer in the mind of the roman than of the latin partly chance and partly the valor of the consul cause it to fall out that torquatus slew he son and decius die by he own hand in point out this equality of strength titus livius take occasion to explain the whole system follow by the roman in the order of they army and in dispose they for battle and as he have treat the subject at length i need not go over the same ground and shall touch only on what i judge in it most to deserve attention but be overlook by all the captain of we time have lead to disorder in many army and in many battle from this passage of titus livius then we learn that the roman army have three principal division or battalion as we might now call they of which they name the first _ hastatus _ the second _ principe _ and the third _ triarius _ to each of which cavalry be attach in array a army for battle they set the _ hastatus _ in front directly behind they in the second rank they place the _ principe _ and in the third rank of the same column the _ triarius _ the cavalry of each of these three division they dispose to the right and left of the division to which it belong and to these company of horse from they form and position they give the name wing -lrb- _ alæ _ -rrb- from they appear like the two wing of the main body of the army the first division the _ hastatus _ which be in front they draw up in close order to enable it to withstand and repulse the enemy the second division the _ principe _ since it be not to be engage from the beginning but be mean to succor the first in case that be drive in be not form in close order but keep in open file so that it might receive the other into its rank whenever it be break and force to retire the third division that namely of the _ triarius _ have its rank still more open than those of the second so that if occasion require it might receive the first two division of the _ hastatus _ and _ principe _ these division therefore be draw up in this order the engagement begin and if the _ hastatus _ be overpower and drive back they retire within the loose rank of the _ principe _ when both these division be thus unite into one renew the conflict if these again be route and force back they retreat within the open rank of the _ triarius _ and all three division form into one once more renew the fight in which if they be overpower since they have no further means of recruit they strength they lose the battle and because whenever this last division of the _ triarius _ have to be employ the army be in jeopardy there arise the proverb _ re redacta est ad triario _ equivalent to we expression of _ play a last stake _ the captain of we day as they have abandon all the other custom of antiquity and pay no heed to any part of the ancient discipline so also have discard this method of dispose they man though it be one of no small utility for to insure the defeat of a commander who so arrange he force as to be able thrice during a engagement to renew he strength fortune must thrice declare against he and he must be match with a adversary able three time over to defeat he whereas he whose sole chance of success lie in he survive the first onset as be the case with all the army of christendom at the present day may easily be vanquish since any slight mishap and the least failure in the steadiness of he man may deprive he of victory and what take from we army the capacity to renew they strength be that provision be now no longer make for one division be receive into the rank of another which happen because at present a army be arrange for battle in one or other of two imperfect method for either its division be place side by side so as to form a line of great width but of no depth or solidity or if to strengthen it it be draw up in column after the fashion of the roman army should the front line be break no provision have be make for its be receive by the second it be throw into complete disorder and both division fall to piece for if the front line be drive back it jostle the second if the second line endeavor to advance the first stand in its way : and thus the first drive against the second and the second against the third such confusion follow that often the most trifling accident will cause the ruin of a entire army at the battle of ravenna where m de foix the french commander be slay although accord to modern notion this be a well-fought field both the french and the spanish army be draw up in the first of the faulty method above describe that be to say each army advance with the whole of its battalion side by side so that each present a single front much wider than deep this be always the plan follow by modern army when as at ravenna the ground be open for know the disorder they fall into on retreat form themselves in a single line they endeavor as i have say as much as possible to escape confusion by extend they front but where the ground confines they they fall at once into the disorder speak of without a effort to prevent it troops traverse a enemy 's country whether to pillage or carry out any other operation of war be liable to fall into the same disorder and at s regolo in the pisan territory and at other place where the florentine be beat by the pisan during the war which follow on the revolt of pisa after the come of charle of france into italy we defeat be due to no other cause than the behavior of we own cavalry who be post in front and be repulse by the enemy fall back on the infantry and throw they into confusion whereupon the whole army take to flight and messer ciriaco del borgo the veteran leader of the florentine foot have often declare in my presence that he have never be route by any cavalry save those who be fight on he side for which reason the swiss who be the greatest proficient in modern warfare when serve with the french make it they first care to place themselves on they flank so that the cavalry of they friend if repulse may not throw they into disorder but although these matter seem easy to understand and not difficult to put in practice none have yet be find among the commander of we time who attempt to imitate the ancient or to correct the modern for although these also have a tripartite division of they army into van-guard main-body and rear-guard the only use they make of it be in give order when they man be in quarter whereas on active service it rarely happen that all division be not equally expose to the same onset and because many to excuse they ignorance will have it that the destructive fire of artillery forbid we employ at the present day many of the tactic use by the ancient i will discuss this question in the follow chapter and examine whether artillery do in fact prevent we from use the valiant method of antiquity chapter xvii -- _ what importance the army of the present day should allow to artillery and whether the commonly receive opinion concern it be just _ look to the number of pitched battle or what be term by the french _ journées _ and by the italian _ fattus d'arme _ fight by the roman at diver time i be lead further to examine the generally receive opinion that have artillery be in use in they day the roman would not have be allow or at least not with the same ease to subjugate province and make other nation they tributary and could never have spread they power in the astonishing way they do for it be say that by reason of these fire-arm man can no longer use or display they personal valor as they could of old that there be greater difficulty now than there be in former time in join battle that the tactic follow then can not be follow now and that in time all warfare must resolve itself into a question of artillery judge it not out of place to inquire whether these opinion be sound and how far artillery have add to or take from the strength of army and whether its use lessen or increase the opportunity for a good captain to behave valiantly i shall at once address myself to the first of the averment notice above namely that the army of the ancient roman could not have make the conquest they do have artillery then be in use to this i answer by say that since war be make for purpose either of offence or defense we have first to see in which of these two kind of warfare artillery give the greater advantage or inflict the greater hurt now though something might be say both way i nevertheless believe that artillery be beyond comparison more hurtful to he who stand on the defensive than to he who attack for he who defend himself must either do so in a town or in a fortified camp if within a town either the town will be a small one as fortified town commonly be or it will be a great one in the former case he who be on the defensive be at once undo for such be the shock of artillery that there be no wall so strong that in a few day it will not batter down when unless those within have ample room to withdraw behind cover work and trench they must be beat it be impossible for they to resist the assault of a enemy who force a entrance through the breach in they wall nor will any artillery a defender may have be of any service to he since it be a established axiom that where man be able to advance in number and rapidly artillery be powerless to check they for this reason in storm town the furious assault of the northern nation prove irresistible whereas the attack of we italian troops who do not rush on in force but advance to the assault in small knot of skirmisher -lrb- _ scaramouch _ as they be fitly name -rrb- may easily be withstand those who advance in such loose order and with so little spirit against a breach cover by artillery advance to certain destruction and as against they artillery be useful but when the assailant swarm to the breach so mass together that one push on another unless they be bring to a stand by ditch and earthwork they penetrate everywhere and no artillery have any effect to keep they back and though some must fall yet not so many as to prevent a victory the frequent success of the northern nation in storm town and more particularly the recovery of brescium by the french be proof sufficient of the truth of what i say for the town of brescium rise against the french while the citadel still hold out the venetian to meet any attack which might be make from the citadel upon the town range gun along the whole line of road which lead from the one to the other plant they in front and in flank and wherever else they could be bring to bear of all which m de foix make no account dismount with he man-at-arms from horseback and advance with they on foot through the midst of the battery take the town nor do we learn that he sustain any considerable loss from the enemy 's fire so that as i have say he who have to defend himself in a small town when he wall be batter down and he have no room to retire behind other work and have only he artillery to trust to be at once undo but even where the town you defend be a great one so that you have room to fall back behind new work artillery be still by a long way more useful for the assailant than for the defender for to enable you artillery to do any hurt to those without you must raise yourself with it above the level of the ground since if you remain on the level the enemy by erect any low mound or earth-work can so secure himself that it will be impossible for you to touch he but in raise yourself above the level of the ground whether by extend yourself along the gallery of the wall or otherwise you be expose to two disadvantage for first you can not there bring into position gun of the same size or range as he who be without can bring to bear against you since it be impossible to work large gun in a confine space and secondly although you should succeed in get you gun into position you can not construct such strong and solid work for they protection as those can who be outside and on level ground and who have all the room and every other advantage which they could desire it be consequently impossible for he who defend a town to maintain he gun in position at any considerable height when those who be outside have much and powerful artillery while if he place it lower it become as have be explain to a great extent useless so that in the end the defense of the city have to be effect as in ancient time by hand to hand fighting or else by means of the smaller kind of fire-arm from which if the defender derive some slight advantage it be balance by the injury he sustain from the great artillery of he enemy whereby the wall of the city be batter down and almost bury in they ditch so that when it come once more to a encounter at close quarter by reason of he wall be demolish and he ditch fill up the defender be now at a far greater disadvantage than he be formerly wherefore i repeat that these arm be infinitely more useful for he who attack a town than for he who defend it as to the remain method which consist in you take up you position in a entrenched camp where you need not fight unless you please and unless you have the advantage i say that this method commonly afford you no greater facility for avoid a engagement than the ancient have nay that sometimes owe to the use of artillery you be worse off than they be for if the enemy fall suddenly upon you and have some slight advantage -lrb- as may readily be the case from he be on higher ground or from you work on he arrival be still incomplete so that you be not wholly sheltered by they -rrb- forthwith and without you be able to prevent he he dislodge you and you be force to quit you defence and deliver battle : as happen to the spaniard at the battle of ravenna for have post themselves between the river ronco and a earthwork from they not have carry this work high enough and from the french have a slight advantage of ground they be force by the fire of the latter to quit they entrenchment come to a engagement but assume the ground you have choose for you camp to be as it always should higher than that occupy by the enemy and you work to be complete and sufficient so that from you position and preparation the enemy dare not attack you recourse will then be have to the very same method as be resort to in ancient time when a army be so post that it could not be assail that be to say you country will be waste city friendly to you besiege or storm and you supplies intercept until you be force at last of necessity to quit you camp and to fight a pitched battle in which as will presently appear artillery will be of little service to you if we consider therefore for what end the roman make war and that attack and not defense be the object of almost all they campaign it will be clear if what i have say be true that they would have have still greater advantage and might have achieve they conquest with even greater ease have artillery be in use in they time and as to the second complaint that by reason of artillery man can no longer display they valor as they could in ancient day i admit it to be true that when they have to expose themselves a few at a time man run more risk now than formerly as when they have to scale a town or perform some similar exploit in which they be not mass together but must advance singly and one behind another it be true also that captain and commander of army be subject to a greater risk of be kill now than of old since they a be reach everywhere by the enemy 's fire and it be no protection to they to be with those of they man who be furthest from the enemy or to be surround by the bravest of they guard still we do not often find either of these two danger occasion extraordinary loss for town strongly fortify be not attack by escalade nor will the assail army advance against they in weak number but will endeavor as in ancient time to reduce they by regular siege and even in the case of town attack by storm the danger be not so very much greater now than they be formerly for in those old day also the defender of town be not without warlike engine which if less terrible in they operation have so far as kill go much the same effect and as for the death of captain and leader of company it may be say that during the last twenty-four year of war in italy we have have fewer instance of such death than might be find in a period of ten year of ancient warfare for except the count lodovico dellum mirandolum who fall at ferrara when the venetian a few year ago attack that city and the duke de nemor slay at cirignuolum we have no instance of any commander be kill by artillery for at ravenna m de foix die by steel and not by shot wherefore i say that if man no longer perform deed of individual prowess it result not so much from the use of artillery as from the faulty discipline and weakness of we army which be collectively without valor can not display it in particular instance as to the third assertion that army can no longer be bring to engage one another and that war will soon come to be carry on wholly with artillery i maintain that this allegation be utterly untrue and will always be so hold by those who be willing in handle they troops to follow the usage of ancient valor for whosoever would have a good army must train it either by real or by mimic warfare to approach the enemy to come within sword-thrust and to grapple with he and must rely more on foot soldier than on horse for reason presently to be explain but when you trust to you foot-soldier and to the method already indicate artillery become powerless to harm you for foot-soldier in approach a enemy can with more ease escape the fire of he artillery than in ancient time they could have avoid a charge of elephant or of scythed chariot or any other of those strange contrivance which have to be encounter by the roman and against which they always devise some remedy and certainly as against artillery they remedy would have be easier by as much as the time during which artillery can do hurt be shorter than the time during which elephant and chariot could for by these you be throw into disorder after battle join whereas artillery harass you only before you engage a danger which infantry can easily escape either by advance so as to be cover by the inequality of the ground or by lie down while the firing continue nay we find from experience that even these precaution may be dispense with especially as against great artillery which can hardly be level with such precision that its fire shall not either pass over you head from the range be too high or fall short from its be too low so soon however as the engagement be begin it be perfectly clear that neither small nor great artillery can harm you any longer since if the enemy have he artilleryman in front you take they if in rear they will injure he before they injure you and if in flank they can never fire so effectively as to prevent you closing with the result already explain nor do this admit of much dispute since we have proof of it in the case of the swiss at novara in the year 1513 when with neither gun nor cavalry they advance against the french army who have fortify themselves with artillery behind entrenchment and route they without suffer the slightest check from they fire in further explanation whereof it be to be note that to work artillery effectively it should be protect by wall by ditch or by earth-works and that whenever from be leave without such protection it have to be defend by man as happen in pitched battle and engagement in the open field it be either take or otherwise become useless nor can it be employ on the flank of a army save in the manner in which the ancient make use of they warlike engine which they move out from they column that they might be work without inconvenience but withdraw within they when drive back by cavalry or other troops he who look for any further advantage from artillery do not rightly understand its nature and trust to what be most likely to deceive he for although the turk use artillery have gain victory over the soldan and the sofus the only advantage he have have from it have be the terror into which the horse of the enemy unused to such sound be throw by the roar of the gun and now to bring these remark to a conclusion i say briefly that employ by a army wherein there be some strain of the ancient valor artillery be useful but employ otherwise against a brave adversary be utterly useless chapter xviii -- _ that the authority of the roman and the example of ancient warfare should make we hold foot soldier of more account than horse _ by many argument and instance it can be clearly establish that in they military enterprise the roman set far more store on they infantry than on they cavalry and trust to the former to carry out all the chief object which they army be mean to effect among many other example of this we may notice the great battle which they fight with the latin near the lake regillus where to steady they waver rank they make they horseman dismount and renew the combat on foot obtain a victory here we see plainly that the roman have more confidence in themselves when they fight on foot than when they fight on horseback the same expedient be resort to by they in many of they other battle and always in they sorest need they find it they surest stay nor be we to condemn the practice in deference to the opinion of hannibal who at the battle of cannæ on see the consul make the horseman dismount say scoffingly _ better still have they deliver they knight to I in chain _ for though this say come from the mouth of a most excellent soldier still if we be to regard authority we ought rather to follow the authority of a commonwealth like rome and of the many great captain who serve she than that of hannibal alone but apart from authority there be manifest reason to bear out what i say for a man may go on foot into many place where a horse can not go man can be teach to keep rank and if throw into disorder to recover form whereas it be difficult to keep horse in line and impossible if once they be throw into disorder to reform they moreover we find that with horse as with man some have little courage and some much and that often a spirited horse be ride by a faint-hearted rider or a dull horse by a courageous rider and that in whatever way such disparity be cause confusion and disorder result again infantry when draw up in column can easily break and be not easily break by cavalry this be vouch not only by many ancient and many modern instance but also by the authority of those who lay down rule for the government of state who show that at first war be carry on by mount soldier because the method for array infantry be not yet understand but that so soon as these be discover the superiority of foot over horse be at once recognize in say this i would not have it suppose that horseman be not of the greatest use in army whether for purpose of observation for harry and lay waste the enemy 's country for pursue a retreat foe or help to repulse he cavalry but the substance and sinew of a army and that part of it which ought constantly to be most consider should always be the infantry and among sin of the italian prince who have make they country the slave of foreigner there be none worse than that they have hold these arm in contempt and turn they whole attention to mount troops this error be due to the craft of we captain and to the ignorance of we ruler for the control of the army of italy for the last five and twenty year rest in the hand of man who as have no land of they own may be look on as mere soldier of fortune these fall forthwith on contrive how they might maintain they credit by be supply with the arm which the prince of the country be without and as they have no subject of they own of whom they could make use and could not obtain constant employment and pay for a large number of foot-soldier and as a small number would have give they no importance they have recourse to horseman for a _ condottiere _ draw pay for two or three hundred horseman be maintain by they in the highest credit and yet the cost be not too great to be meet by the prince who employ he and to effect they object with more ease and increase they credit still further these adventurer would allow no merit or favor to be due to foot-soldier but claim all for they horseman and to such a length be this bad system carry that in the very greatest army only the smallest sprinkling of infantry be to be find this together with many other ill practice which accompany it have so weaken the militia of italy that the country have easily be trample upon by all the nation of the north that it be a mistake to make more account of cavalry than of infantry may be still more clearly see from another example take from roman history the roman be engage on the siege of sora a troop of horse a sally from the town to attack they camp when the roman master of the knight advance with he own horseman to give they battle it so chance that at the very first onset the leader on both side be slay both party be thus leave without commander and the combat nevertheless continue the roman think thereby to have the advantage of they adversary alight from horseback oblige the enemy 's cavalry in order to defend themselves to do the like the result be that the roman have the victory now there could be no stronger instance than this to show the superiority of foot over horse for while in other battle the roman cavalry be make by they consul to dismount in order to succor they infantry who be in distress and in need of such aid on this occasion they dismount not to succor they infantry nor to encounter a enemy contend on foot but because they see that though they could not prevail against the enemy fighting as horseman against horseman on foot they readily might and from this i conclude that foot-soldier if rightly handle can hardly be beat except by other soldier fight on foot with very few cavalry but with a considerable force of infantry the roman commander crassus and marcus antonius each for many day together overrun the territory of the parthian although oppose by the countless horseman of that nation crassus indeed with the greater part of he army be leave there dead and antonius only save himself by he valor but even in the extremity to which the roman be then bring see how greatly superior foot-soldier be to horse for though fight in a open country far from the sea-coast and cut off from he supplies antonius prove himself a valiant soldier in the judgment even of the parthian themselves the whole strength of whose cavalry never venture to attack the column of he army and though crassus perish there any one who read attentively the account of he expedition must see that he be rather outwit than defeat and that even when he condition be desperate the parthian dare not close with he but effect he destruction by hang continually on the flank of he army and intercept he supplies while cajole he with promise which they never keep it might i grant be harder to demonstrate this great superiority of foot over horse have we not very many modern example afford the clearest proof of it for instance at the battle of novara of which we have already speak nine thousand swiss foot be see to attack ten thousand cavalry together with a equal number of infantry and to defeat they the cavalry be powerless to injure they while of the infantry who be mostly gascon and badly discipline they make no account on another occasion we have see twenty-six thousand swiss march on milan to attack franci i of france who have with he twenty thousand man-at-arms forty thousand foot and a hundred piece of artillery and although they be not victorious as at novara they nevertheless fight valiantly for two day together and in the end though beat be able to bring off half they number with foot-soldier only marcus attilius regulus venture to oppose himself not to cavalry merely but to elephant and if the attempt fail it do not follow that he be not justify by the valor of he man in believe they equal to surmount this danger i repeat therefore that to prevail against well-disciplined infantry you must meet they with infantry discipline still better and that otherwise you advance to certain destruction in the time of filippo viscontus duke of milan some sixteen thousand swiss make a descent on lombardy whereupon the duke who at that time have il carmagnolum as he captain send he with six thousand man-at-arms and a slender following of foot-soldier to meet they not know they manner of fight carmagnolum fall upon they with he horseman expect to put they at once to rout but find they immovable after lose many of he man he withdraw but be a most wise captain and skilful in devise new remedy to meet unwonted danger after reinforce he company he again advance to the attack and when about to engage make all he man-at-arms dismount and place they in front of he foot-soldier fall once more upon the swiss who could then no longer withstand he for he man be on foot and well armed easily penetrate the swiss rank without hurt to themselves and get among they have no difficulty in cut they down so that of the entire army of the swiss those only escape who be spare by he humanity of this difference in the efficiency of these two kind of troops many i believe be aware but such be the unhappiness and perversity of the time in which we live that neither ancient nor modern example nor even the consciousness of error can move we present prince to amend they way or convince they that to restore credit to the arm of a state or province it be necessary to revive this branch of they militia also to keep it near they to make much of it and to give it life that in return it may give back life and reputation to they but as they have depart from all those other method already speak of so have they depart from this and with this result that to they the acquisition of territory be rather a loss than a gain as presently shall be show chapter xix -- _ that acquisition make by ill-governed state and such as follow not the valiant method of the roman tend rather to they ruin than to they aggrandizement _ to these false opinion found on the pernicious example first set by the present corrupt age we owe it that no man think of depart from the method which be in use it have be impossible for instance some thirty year ago to persuade a italian that ten thousand foot-soldier could on plain ground attack ten thousand cavalry together with a equal number of infantry and not merely attack but defeat they as we see do by the swiss at that battle of novara to which i have already refer so often for although history abound in similar example none would have believe they or believe they would have say that nowadays man be so much better arm that a squadron of cavalry could shatter a rock to say nothing of a column of infantry with such false plea would they have belie they judgment take no account that with a very scanty force of foot-soldier lucullus route a hundred and fifty thousand of the cavalry of tigrane among whom be a body of horseman very nearly resemble we own man-at-arms now however this error be demonstrate by the example of the northern nation and since what history teach as to the superiority of foot-soldier be thus prove to be true man ought likewise to believe that the other method practice by the ancient be in like manner salutary and useful and be this once accept both prince and commonwealth would make fewer blunder than they do would be stronger to resist sudden attack and would no longer place they sole hope of safety in flight while those who take in hand to provide a state with new institution would know better what direction to give they whether in the way of extend or merely of preserve and would see that to augment the number of they citizen to assume other state as companion rather than reduce they to subjection to send out colony for the defense of acquire territory to hold they spoil at the credit of the common stock to overcome enemy by inroad and pitched battle rather than by siege to enrich the public purse keep down private wealth and zealously to maintain all military exercise be the true way to aggrandize a state and to extend its empire or if these method for add to they power be not to they mind let they remember that acquisition make in any other way be the ruin of republic and so set bound to they ambition wisely regulate the internal government of they country by suitable law and ordinance forbid extension and look only to defense and take heed that they defence be in good order as do those republic of germany which live and for long have live in freedom and yet as i have say on another occasion when speaking of the difference between the method suitable for acquire and those suitable for maintain it be impossible for a republic to remain long in the peaceful enjoyment of freedom within a restricted frontier for should it forbear from molest other other be not likely to refrain from molest it whence must grow at once the desire and the necessity to make acquisition or should no enemy be find abroad they will be find at home for this seem to be incidental to all great state and if the free state of germany be and have long be able to maintain themselves on they present footing this arise from certain condition peculiar to that country and to be find nowhere else without which these community could not go on living as they do the district of germany of which i speak be formerly subject to the roman empire in the same way as france and spain but on the decline of the empire and when its very name come to be limit to this one province its more powerful city take advantage of the weakness and necessity of the emperor begin to free themselves by buy from they they liberty subject to the payment of a trifling yearly tribute until gradually all the city which hold directly from the emperor and be not subject to any intermediate lord have in like manner purchase they freedom while this go on it so happen that certain community subject to the duke of austrium among which be friburg the people of schweitz and the like rose in rebellion against he and meeting at the outset with good success by degree acquire such accession of strength that so far from return under the austrian yoke they be become formidable to all they neighbor these be the state which we now name swiss germany be consequently divide between the swiss the community which take the name of free town the prince and the emperor and the reason why amid so many conflict interest war do not break out or break out be of short continuance be the reverence in which all hold this symbol of the imperial authority for although the emperor be without strength of he own he have nevertheless such credit with all these other that he alone can keep they unite and interpose as mediator can speedily repress by he influence any dissension among they the greatest and most protracted war which have take place in this country have be those between the swiss and the duke of austrium and although for many year past the empire and the dukedom of austrium have be unite in the same man he have always fail to subdue the stubbornness of the swiss who be never to be bring to term save by force nor have the rest of germany lend the emperor much assistance in he war with the swiss the free town be little disposed to attack other whose desire be to live as they themselves do in freedom while the prince of the empire either be so poor that they can not or from jealousy of the power of the emperor will not take part with he against they these community therefore abide contented within they narrow confines because have regard to the imperial authority they have no occasion to desire greater and be at the same time oblige to live in unity within they wall because a enemy be always at hand and ready to take advantage of they division to effect a entrance but be the circumstance of the country other than they be these community would be force to make attempt to extend they dominion and be constrain to relinquish they present peaceful mode of life and since the same condition be not find elsewhere other nation can not adopt this way of living but be compel to extend they power either by means of league or else by the method use by the roman and any one who should act otherwise would find not safety but rather death and destruction for since in a thousand way and from cause innumerable conquest be surround with danger it may well happen that in add to we dominion we add nothing to we strength but whosoever increase not he strength while he add to he dominion must need be ruin he who be impoverish by he war even should he come off victorious can add nothing to he strength since he spend more than he gain as the venetian and florentine have do for venice have be far feebler since she acquire lombardy and florence since she acquire tuscany than when the one be content to be mistress of the sea and the other of the land lie within six mile from she wall and this from they eagerness to acquire without know what way to take for which ignorance these state be the more to be blame in proportion as there be less to excuse they since they have see what method be use by the roman and could have follow in they footstep whereas the roman without any example set they be able by they own prudence to shape a course for themselves but even to well-governed state they conquest may chance to occasion much harm as when some city or province be acquire abound in luxury and delight by whose manners the conqueror become infected as happen first to the roman and afterwards to hannibal on take possession of capua and have capua be at such a distance from rome that a ready remedy could not have be apply to the disorder of the soldiery or have rome herself be in any degree taint with corruption this acquisition have certainly prove she ruin to which titus livius bear witness when he say _ most mischievous at this time to we military discipline be capua for minister to all delight she turn away the corrupted mind of we soldier from the remembrance of they country _ and truly city and province like this avenge themselves on they conqueror without blood or blow since by infect they with they own evil custom they prepare they for defeat at the hand of any assailant nor could the subject have be better handle than by juvenal where he say in he satire that into the heart of the roman through they conquest in foreign land foreign manners find they way and in place of frugality and other admirable virtue -- come luxury more mortal than the sword and settle down avenge a vanquished world -lrb- 1 -rrb- and if they conquest be like to be fatal to the roman at a time when they be still animated by great virtue and prudence how must it fare with those who follow method altogether different from theirs and who to crown they other error of which we have already say enough resort to auxiliary and mercenary arm bring upon themselves those danger whereof mention shall be make in the chapter follow -lrb- footnote 1 : sævior armi luxurium occubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem _ juv sit vi 292 -rrb- chapter xx -- _ of the danger incur by prince or republic who resort to auxiliary or mercenary arm _ have i not already in another treatise enlarged on the inutility of mercenary and auxiliary and on the usefulness of national arm i should dwell on these matter in the present discourse more at length than it be my design to do for have give the subject very full consideration elsewhere here i would be brief still when i find titus livius supply a complete example of what we have to look for from auxiliary by whom i mean troops send to we assistance by some other prince or ruler pay by he and under officer by he appoint it be not fit that i should pass it by in silence it be related then by we historian that the roman after defeat on two different occasion army of the samnite with force send by they to succor the capuan whom they thus relieve from the war which the samnite be wage against they be desirious to return to rome left behind two legion to defend the capuan that the latter might not from be altogether deprive of they protection once more become a prey to the samnite but these two legion rot in idleness begin to take such delight therein that forgetful of they country and the reverence due to the senate they resolve to seize by violence the city they have be leave to guard by they valor for to they it seem that the citizen of capua be unworthy to enjoy advantage which they know not how to defend the roman however get timely notice of this design at once meet and defeat it in the manner to be more fully notice when i come to treat of conspiracy once more then i repeat that of all the various kind of troops auxiliary be the most pernicious because the prince or republic resorting to they for aid have no authority over they the only person who possess such authority be he who send they for as i have say auxiliary troops be those send to you assistance by some other potentate under he own flag under he own officer and in he own pay as be the legion send by the roman to capua such troops if victorious will for the most part plunder he by whom as well as he against whom they be hire to fight and this they do sometimes at the instigation of the potentate who send they sometimes for ambitious end of they own it be not the purpose of the roman to violate the league and treaty which they have make with capua but to they soldier it seem so easy a matter to master the capuan that they be readily lead into this plot for deprive they of they town and territory many other example might be give to the same effect but it be enough to mention besides this instance that of the people of regium who be deprive of they city and of they life by another roman legion send for they protection prince and republic therefore should resort to any other expedient for the defense of they state sooner than call in hire auxiliary when they have to rest they entire hope of safety on they since any accord or term however hard which you may make with you enemy will be carefully study and current event well consider it will be see that for one who have succeed with such assistance hundred have be betray nor in truth can any better opportunity for usurp a city or province present itself to a ambitious prince or commonwealth than to be ask to send a army for its defense on the other hand he who be so greedy of conquest as to summon such help not for purpose of defense but in order to attack other seek to have what he can never hold and be most likely to be take from he by the very person who help he to gain it yet such be the perversity of man that to gratify the desire of the moment they shut they eye to those ill which must speedily ensue and be no more move by example in this matter than in all those other of which i have speak for be they move by these example they would see that the more disposed they be to deal generously with they neighbor and the more averse they be to usurp authority over they the readier will these be to throw themselves into they arm as will at once appear from the case of the capuan chapter xxi -- _ that capua be the first city to which the roman send a prætor nor there until four hundred year after they begin to make war _ the great difference between the method follow by the ancient roman in add to they dominion and those use for that purpose by the state of the present time have now be sufficiently discuss it have be see too how in deal with the city which they do not think fit to destroy and even with those which have make they submission not as companion but as subject it be customary with the roman to permit they to live on under they own law without impose any outward sign of dependence merely bind they to certain condition or comply with which they be maintain in they former dignity and importance we know further that the same method continue to be follow by the roman until they pass beyond the confines of italy and begin to reduce foreign kingdom and state to province : as plainly appear in the fact that capua be the first city to which they send a prætor and he from no motive of ambition but at the request of the capuan themselves who live at variance with one another thought it necessary to have a roman citizen in they town who might restore unity and good order among they influence by this example and urge by the same need the people of antium be the next to ask that they too might have a prætor give they touch which request and in connection with which new method of govern titus livius observe _ that not the arm only but also the law of rome now begin to exert a influence _ show how much the course thus follow by the roman promote the growth of they authority for those city more especially which have be use to freedom or to be govern by they own citizen rest far better satisfied with a government which they do not see even though it involve something of oppression than with one which stand constantly before they eye seem every day to reproach they with the disgrace of servitude and to the prince there be another advantage in this method of government namely that as the judge and magistrate who administer the law civil and criminal within these city be not under he control no decision of theirs can throw responsibility or discredit upon he so that he thus escape many occasion of calumny and hatred of the truth whereof besides the ancient instance which might be note we have a recent example here in italy for genoa as every one know have many time be occupy by the french king who always until lately send thither a french governor to rule in he name recently however not from choice but of necessity he have permit the town to be self-govern under a genoese ruler and any one who have to decide which of these two method of govern give the greater security to the king 's authority and the greater content to the people themselves would assuredly have to pronounce in favor of the latter man moreover in proportion as they see you averse to usurp authority over they grow the readier to surrender themselves into you hand and fear you less on the score of they freedom when they find you act towards they with consideration and kindness it be the display of these quality that move the capuan to ask the roman for a prætor for have the roman betray the least eagerness to send they one they would at once have conceive jealousy and grow estrange but why turn for example to capua and rome when we have they close at hand in tuscany and florence who be there but know what a time it be since the city of pistoja submit of she own accord to the florentine supremacy who again but know the animosity which down to the present day exist between florence and the city of pisa lucca and siena this difference of feeling do not arise from the citizen of pistoja value they freedom less than the citizen of these other town or think themselves inferior to they but from the florentine have always act towards the former as brother towards the latter as foe this it be that lead the pistojan to come voluntarily under we authority while the other have do and do all in they power to escape it for there seem no reason to doubt that if florence instead of exasperate these neighbor of hers have seek to win they over either by enter into league with they or by lend they assistance she would at this hour have be mistress of tuscany not that i would be understand to maintain that recourse be never to be have to force and to arm but that these be only to be use in the last resort and when all other remedy be unavailing chapter xxii -- _ that in matter of moment man often judge amiss _ how falsely man often judge of thing they who be present at they deliberation have constant occasion to know for in many matter unless these deliberation be guide by man of great part the conclusion come to be certain to be wrong and because in corrupt republic and especially in quiet time either through jealousy or from other like cause man of great ability be often oblige to stand aloof it follow that measure not good in themselves be by a common error judge to be good or be promote by those who seek public favor rather than the public advantage mistake of this sort be find out afterwards in season of adversity when recourse must be have to those person who in peaceful time have be as it be forget as shall hereafter in its proper place be more fully explain case moreover arise in which those who have little experience of affair be sure to be mislead from the matter with which they have to deal be attend by many deceptive appearance such as lead man to believe whatsoever they be mind to believe these remark i make with reference to the false hope which the latin after be defeat by the roman be lead to form on the persuasion of they prætor numitius and also with reference to what be believe by many a few year ago when franci king of france come to recover milan from the swiss for franci of angoulême succeed on the death of loui xii to the throne of france and desire to recover for that realm the duchy of milan on which some year before the swiss have seize at the instance of pope julius seek for ally in italy to second he in he attempt and besides the venetian who have already be gain over by king loui endeavor to secure the aid of the florentine and pope leo x think that be he to succeed in get these other to take part with he he enterprise would be easier for the force of the spanish king be then in lombardy and the army of the emperor at verona pope leo however do not fall in with the wish of franci be it be say persuade by he adviser that he best course be to stand neutral for they urge that it be not for the advantage of the church to have powerful stranger whether french or swiss in italy but that to restore the country to its ancient freedom it must be deliver from the yoke of both and since to conquer both whether singly or together be impossible it be to be desire that the one should overthrow the other after which the church with she friend might fall upon the victor and it be aver that no better opportunity for carry out this design could ever be find than then present itself for both the french and the swiss be in the field while the pope have he troops in readiness to appear on the lombard frontier and in the vicinity of the two army where under color of watch he own interest he could easily keep they until the opposed host come to a engagement when as both army be full of courage they encounter might be expect to be a bloody one and likely to leave the victor so weaken that it would be easy for the pope to attack and defeat he and so to he own great glory remain master of lombardy and supreme throughout italy how baseless this expectation be be see from the event for the swiss be route after a protracted combat the troops of the pope and spain so far from venture to attack the conqueror prepare for flight nor would flight have save they have not the humanity or indifference of the king withhold he from pursue he victory and dispose he to make term with the church the argument put forward by the pope 's adviser have a certain show of reason in they favor which look at from a distance seem plausible enough but be in reality wholly contrary to truth since it rarely happen that the captain who win a victory lose any great number of he man he loss be in battle only and not in flight for in the heat of battle while man stand face to face but few fall chiefly because such combat do not last long and even when they do last and many of the victorious army be slay so splendid be the reputation which attend a victory and so great the terror it inspire as far to outweigh any loss the victor suffer by the slaughter of he soldier so that a enemy who trust to find he weaken should then venture to attack he would soon be teach he mistake unless strong enough to give he battle at any time before he victory as well as after for in that case he might as fortune and valor should determine either win or lose though even then the army which have first fight and win would have a advantage and this we know for a truth from what befall the latin in consequence of the mistake make by numitius they prætor and they blindness in believe he for when they have already suffer defeat at the hand of the roman numitius cause it to be proclaim throughout the whole country of latium that now be the time to fall upon the enemy exhaust by a struggle in which they be victorious only in name while in reality suffer all those ill which attend defeat and who might easily be crush by any fresh force bring against they whereupon the latin believe he and get together a new army be forthwith route with such loss as always await those who listen to like counsel chapter xxiii -- _ that in chastise they subject when circumstance require it the roman always avoid half-measure _ such _ be now the state of affair in latium that peace and war seem alike intolerable _ no worse calamity can befall a prince or commonwealth than to be reduce to such strait that they can neither accept peace nor support war as be the case with those whom it would ruin to conclude peace on the term offer while war oblige they either to yield themselves a spoil to they ally or remain a prey to they foe to this grievous alternative be man lead by evil counsel and unwise course and as already say from not rightly measure they strength for the commonwealth or prince who have rightly measure he strength can hardly be bring so low as be the latin who make war with the roman when they should have make term and make term when they should have make war and so mismanaged everything that the friendship and the enmity of rome be alike fatal whence it come that in the first place they be defeat and break by manlius torquatus and afterwards utterly subdue by camillus who when he have force they to surrender at discretion to the roman arm and have place garrison in all they town and take hostage from all return to rome and report to the senate that the whole of latium now lay at they mercy and because the sentence then pass by the senate be memorable and worthy to be study by prince that it may be imitate by they on like occasion i shall cite the exact word which livius put into the mouth of camillus as confirm what i have already say touch the method use by the roman to extend they power and as show how in chastise they subject they always avoid half-measure and take a decide course for government consist in nothing else than in so control you subject that it shall neither be in they power nor for they interest to harm you and this be effect either by make such sure work with they as put it out of they power to do you injury or else by so load they with benefit that it would be folly in they to seek to alter they condition all which be imply first in the measure propose by camillus and next in the resolution pass on these proposal by the senate the word of camillus be as follow : _ the immortal god have make you so entirely master in the matter you be now consider that _ _ it lie with you to pronounce whether latium shall or shall not longer exist so far as the latin be concern you can secure a lasting peace either by clemency or by severity would you deal harshly with those whom you have conquer and who have give themselves into you hand you can blot out the whole latin nation would you after the fashion of we ancestor increase the strength of rome by admit the vanquish to the rights of citizenship here you have opportunity to do so and with the greatest glory to yourselve that assuredly be the strongest government which they rejoice in who obey it now then be you time while the mind of all be bent on what be about to happen to obtain a ascendency over they either by punishment or by benefit _ upon this motion the senate resolve in accordance with the advice give by the consul to take the case of each city separately and either destroy utterly or else treat with tenderness all the more important of the latin town to those city they deal with leniently they grant exemption and privilege confer upon they the rights of citizenship and secure they welfare in every particular the other they raze to the ground and plant colony in they room either remove the inhabitant to rome or so scattered and disperse they that neither by arm nor by counsel be it ever again in they power to inflict hurt for as i have say already the roman never in matter of moment resort to half-measure and the sentence which they then pronounce should be a pattern for all ruler and ought to have be follow by the florentine when in the year 1502 arezzo and all the val di chiana rise in revolt for have they follow it they would have establish they authority on a surer footing and add much to the greatness of they city by secure for it those land which be need to supply it with the necessaries of life but pursue that half-hearted policy which be most mischievous in execute justice some of the aretine they outlaw some they condemn to death and all they deprive of they dignity and ancient importance in they town while leave the town itself untouch and if in the council then hold any florentine recommend that arezzo should be dismantle they who think themselves wiser than they fellow object that to do so would be little to the honor of we republic since it would look as though she lack strength to hold it reason like this are of a sort which seem sound but be not really so for by the same rule no parricide should be put to death nor any other malefactor however atrocious he crime because forsooth it would be discreditable to the ruler to appear unequal to the control of a single criminal they who hold such opinion fail to see that when man individually or entire city collectively offend against the state the prince for he own safety and as a warn to other have no alternative but to make a end of they and that true honor lie in be able and in know how to chastise such offender and not in incur endless danger in the effort to retain they for the prince who do not chastise offender in a way that put it out of they power to offend again be account unwise or worthless how necessary it be for the roman to execute justice against the latin be further see from the course take with the man of privernum and here the text of livius suggest two point for we attention : first as already note that a subjugated people be either to be caress or crush and second how much it be for we advantage to maintain a manly bearing and to speak the truth fearlessly in the presence of the wise for the senate be meet to determine the fate of the citizen of privernum who after rebel have be reduce to submission by the roman arm certain of these citizen be send by they countryman to plead for pardon when these have come into the presence of the senate one of they be ask by a senator _ what punishment he think he fellow citizen deserve _ to which he of privernum answer _ such punishment as they deserve who deem themselves worthy of freedom _ _ but _ say the consul _ should we remit you punishment what sort of peace can we hope to have with you _ to which the other reply _ if grant on fair term a firm and lasting peace if on unfair a peace of brief duration _ upon this though many of the senator be displeased the wiser among they declare _ that they have hear the voice of freedom and manhood and would never believe that the man or people who so speak ought to remain longer than be needful in a position which give they cause for shame since that be a safe peace which be accept willingly whereas good faith could not be look for where it be seek to impose servitude _ so say they decide that the people of privernum should be admit to roman citizenship with all the rights and privilege thereto appertain declare that _ man whose only thought be for freedom be indeed worthy to be roman _ so please be this true and high answer to generous mind while any other must have seem at once false and shameful and they who judge otherwise of man and of those man especially who have be use to be free or so to think themselves be mistaken and be lead through they mistake to adopt course unprofitable for themselves and afford no content to other whence the frequent rebellion and the downfall of state but return to we subject i conclude as well from this instance of privernum as from the measure follow with the latin that when we have to pass sentence upon powerful state accustom to live in freedom we must either destroy they utterly or else treat they with much indulgence and that any other course we may take with they will be unprofitable but most carefully should we avoid as of all course the most pernicious such half-measure as be follow by the samnite when they have the roman shut up in the caudine fork and would not listen to the counsel of the old man who urge they either to send they captive away with every honorable attention or else put they all to death but adopt a middle course and after disarm they and make they pass under the yoke suffer they to depart at once disgraced and angered and no long time after they find to they sorrow that the old man 's warning be true and that the course they have themselves choose be calamitous as shall hereafter in its place be show chapter xxiv -- _ that commonly fortress do much more harm than good _ to the wise man of we day it may seem a oversight on the part of the roman that when they seek to protect themselves against the man of latium and privernum it never occur to they to build stronghold in they city to be a curb upon they and insure they fidelity especially when we remember the florentine say which these same wise man often quote to the effect that pisa and other like city must be hold by fortress doubtless have those old roman be like-minded with we modern sage they would not have neglect to build themselves fortress but because they far surpass they in courage sense and vigor they refrain and while rome retain she freedom and adhere to she own wise ordinance and wholesome usage she never build a single fortress with the view to hold any city or province though sometimes she may have suffer those to stand which she find already build look therefore to the course follow by the roman in this particular and to that adopt by we modern ruler it seem proper to consider whether or not it be advisable to build fortress and whether they be more likely to help or to hurt he who build they in the first place then we be to remember that fortress be build either as a defense against foreign foe or against subject in the former case i pronounce they unnecessary in the latter mischievous and to state the reason why in the latter case they be mischievous i say that when prince or republic be afraid of they subject and in fear lest they rebel this must proceed from know that they subject hate they which hatred in its turn result from they own ill conduct and that again from they think themselves able to rule they subject by mere force or from they govern with little prudence now one of the cause which lead they to suppose that they can rule by mere force be this very circumstance of they people have these fortress on they back so that the conduct which breed hatred be itself mainly occasion by these prince or republic be possess of fortress which if this be true be really far more hurtful than useful first because as have be say already they render a ruler bolder and more violent in he bear towards he subject and next because they do not in reality afford he that security which he believe they to give for all those method of violence and coercion which may be use to keep a people under resolve themselves into two since either like the roman you must always have it in you power to bring a strong army into the field or else you must dissipate destroy and disunite the subject people and so divide and scatter they that they can never again combine to injure you for should you merely strip they of they wealth _ spoliati arma supersunt _ arm still remain to they or if you deprive they of they weapon _ furor arma ministrat _ rage will supply they if you put they chief to death and continue to maltreat the rest head will renew themselves like those hydra while if you build fortress these may serve in time of peace to make you bolder in outrage you subject but in time of war they will prove wholly useless since they will be attack at once by foe both foreign and domestic whom together it will be impossible for you to resist and if ever fortress be useless they be so at the present day by reason of the invention of artillery against the fury of which as i have show already a petty fortress which afford no room for retreat behind fresh work can not be defend but to go deeper into the matter i say either you be a prince seek by means of these fortress to hold the people of you city in check or you be a prince or it may be a republic desirous to control some city which you have gain in war to the prince i would say that for the reason already give nothing can be more unserviceable than a fortress as a restraint upon you subject since it only make you the readier to oppress they and less scrupulous how you do so while it be this very oppression which move they to destroy you and so kindle they hatred that the fortress which be the cause of all the mischief be powerless to protect you a wise and good prince therefore that he may continue good and give no occasion or encouragement to he descendant to become evil will never build a fortress to the end that neither he nor they may ever be lead to trust to it rather than to the good-will of they subject and if francesco sforza who be account a wise ruler on become duke of milan erect a fortress in that city i say that herein he be unwise and that the event have show the building of this fortress to have be hurtful and not helpful to he heir for think that by its aid they could behave as badly as they like to they citizen and subject and yet be secure they refrain from no sort of violence or oppression until become beyond measure odious they lose they state as soon as a enemy attack it nor be this fortress which in peace have occasion they much hurt any defense or of any service they in war for have they be without it through thoughtlessness treat they subject inhumanely they must soon have discover and withdraw from they danger and might thereafter with no other help than that of attached subject have withstand the attack of the french far more successfully than they could with they fortress but with subject whom they have estrange and in truth fortress be unserviceable in every way since they may be lose either by the treachery of those to whom you commit they defense or by the overwhelming strength of a assailant or else by famine and where you seek to recover a state which you have lose and in which only the fortress remain to you if that fortress be to be of any service or assistance to you you must have a army wherewith to attack the enemy who have drive you out but with such a army you might succeed in recover you state as readily without a fortress as with one nay perhaps even more readily since you subject have you not use they ill from the overweening confidence you fortress give you might then have feel better disposed towards you and the event show that in time of adversity this very fortress of milan have be of no advantage whatever either to the sforza or to the french but on the contrary have bring ruin on both because trust to it they do not turn they thought to nobler method for preserve that state guido ubaldo duke of urbino and son to duke federigo who in he day be a warrior of much renown but who be drive from he dominion by cesare borgium son to pope alexander vi when afterwards by a sudden stroke of good fortune he be restore to the dukedom cause all the fortress of the country to be dismantle judge they to be hurtful for as he be beloved by he subject so far as they be concern he have no need for fortress while as against foreign enemy he see he could not defend they since this would have require a army keep constantly in the field for which reason he make they be raze to the ground when pope julius ii have drive the bentivoglus from bologna after erect a citadel in that town he cause the people to be cruelly oppress by he governor whereupon the people rebel and he forthwith lose the citadel so that he citadel and the oppression to which it lead be of less service to he than different behavior on he part have be when niccolo da castello the ancestor of the vitellus return to he country out of exile he straightway pull down the two fortress build there by pope sixtus iv perceive that it be not by fortress but by the good-will of the people that he could be maintain in he government but the most recent and in all respects most noteworthy instance and that which best demonstrate the futility of building and the advantage of destroy fortress be what happen only the other day in genoa every one know how in 1507 genoa rise in rebellion against loui xii of france who come in person and with all he force to recover it and after recover it build there a citadel stronger than any before know be both from its position and from every other circumstance most inaccessible to attack for stand on the extremity of a hill name by the genoese codefa which jut out into the sea it command the whole harbor and the greater part of the town but afterwards in the year 1512 when the french be drive out of italy the genoese in spite of this citadel again rebel and ottaviano fregoso assume the government after the greatest effort continue over a period of sixteen month at last succeed in reduce the citadel by famine by all it be believe that he would retain it as a rock of refuge in case of any reverse of fortune and by some he be advise to do so but he be a truly wise ruler and know well that it be by the attachment of they subject and not by the strength of they fortification that prince be maintain in they government dismantle this citadel and found he authority not upon material defence but on he own valor and prudence keep and still keep it and whereas formerly a force of a thousand foot-soldier could effect a change in the government of genoa the enemy of ottaviano have assail he with ten thousand without be able to harm he here then we see that while to dismantle this fortress occasion ottaviano no loss its construction give the french king no sort of advantage for when he could come into italy with a army he could recover genoa though he have no citadel there but when he could not come with a army it be not in he power to hold the city by means of the citadel moreover it be costly for the king to build and shameful for he to lose this fortress while for ottaviano it be glorious to take and advantageous to destroy it let we turn now to those republic which build fortress not within they own territory but in town whereof they have take possession and if the above example of france and genoa suffice not to show the futility of this course that of florence and pisa ought i think to be conclusive for in erect fortress to hold pisa the florentine fail to perceive that a city which have always be openly hostile to they which have live in freedom and which could cloak rebellion under the name of liberty must if it be to be retain at all be retain by those method which be use by the roman and either be make a companion or be destroy of how little service these pisan fortress be be see on the come of charle viii of france into italy to whom whether through the treachery of they defender or from fear of worse evil they be at once deliver up whereas have there be no fortress in pisa the florentine would not have look to they as the means whereby the town be to be hold the king could not by they assistance have take the town from the florentine and the method whereby it have previously be preserve might in all likelihood have continue sufficient to preserve it and at any rate have serve that end no worse than the fortress these then be the conclusion to which i come namely that fortress build to hold you own country under be hurtful and that those build to retain acquire territory be useless and i be content to rely on the example of the roman who in the town they seek to hold by the strong hand rather pull down fortress than build they and if any to controvert these view of mine be to cite the case of tarentum in ancient time or of brescium in recent as town which when they rebel be recover by means of they citadel i answer that for the recovery of tarentum fabius maximus be send at the end of a year with a army strong enough to retake it even have there be no fortress there and that although he avail himself of the fortress for the recovery of the town he might without it have resort to other means which would have bring about the same result nor do i see of what service a citadel can be say to be when to recover the city you must employ a consular army under a fabius maximus but that the roman would in any case have recover tarentum be plain from what happen at capua where there be no citadel and which they retake simply by the valor of they soldier again as regard brescium i say that the circumstance attend the revolt of that town be such as occur but seldom namely that the citadel remain in you hand after the defection of the city you should happen to have a great army nigh at hand as the french have theirs on this occasion for m de foix be in command of the king 's force at bologna on hearing of the loss of brescium march thither without a hour 's delay and reach brescium in three day retake the town with the help of the citadel but here again we see that to be of any service the citadel of brescium have to be succour by a de foix and by that french army which in three day ' time march to its relief so that this instance can not be consider conclusive as against other of a contrary tendency for in the course of recent war many fortress have be take and retake with the same variety of fortune with which open country have be acquire or lose and this not only in lombardy but also in romagna in the kingdom of naple and in all part of italy and further touch the erection of fortress as a defense against foreign enemy i say that such defence be not need by the prince or people who possess a good army while for those who do not possess a good army they be useless for good army without fortress be in themselves a sufficient defense : whereas fortress without good army avail nothing and this we see in the case of those nation which have be think to excel both in they government and otherwise as for instance the roman and the spartan for while the roman would build no fortress the spartan not merely abstain from build they but would not even suffer they city to be enclose with wall desire to be protect by they own valor only and by no other defense so that when a spartan be ask by a athenian what he think of the wall of athen he answer that they be fine wall if mean to hold woman only if a prince who have a good army have likewise on the sea-front of he dominion some fortress strong enough to keep a enemy in check for a few day until he get he force together this though not necessary may sometimes be for he advantage but for a prince who be without a strong army to have fortress erect throughout he territory or upon he frontier be either useless or hurtful since they may readily be lose and then turn against he or suppose they so strong that the enemy be unable to take they by assault he may leave they behind and so render they wholly unprofitable for a brave army unless stoutly meet enter a enemy 's country without regard to the town or fortify place it leave in its rear as we read of happen in ancient time and have see do by francesco marium dellum rovere who no long while ago when he march against urbino make little of leave ten hostile city behind he the prince therefore who can bring together a strong army can do without build fortress while he who have not a strong army ought not to build they but should carefully strengthen the city wherein he dwell and keep it well store with supplies and its inhabitant well affect so that he may resist attack till a accord be agree on or he be relieve by foreign aid all other expedient be costly in time of peace and in war useless whoever carefully weigh all that have now be say will perceive that the roman as they be most prudent in all they other method so also show they wisdom in the measure they take with the man of latium and privernum when without ever think of fortress they seek security in bolder and more sagacious course chapter xxv -- _ that he who attack a city divide against itself must not think to get possession of it through its division _ violent dissension break out in rome between the common and the noble it appear to the veientine and etruscan that now be they time to deal a fatal blow to the roman supremacy accordingly they assemble a army and invade the territory of rome the senate send caius manlius and marcus fabius to meet they whose force encamp close by the veientine the latter cease not to reproach and vilify the roman name with every sort of taunt and abuse and so incensed the roman by they unmeasured insolence that from be divide they become reconcile and give the enemy battle break and defeat they here again we see what have already be note how prone man be to adopt wrong course and how often they miss they object when they think to secure it the veientine imagine that they could conquer the roman by attack they while they be at feud among themselves but this very attack reunite the roman and bring ruin on they assailant for the cause of division in a commonwealth be for the most part ease and tranquillity while the cause of union be fear and war wherefore have the veientine be wise the more divide they see rome to be the more should they have seek to avoid war with she and endeavor to gain a advantage over she by peaceful art and the best way to effect this in a divided city lie in gain the confidence of both faction and in mediate between they as arbiter so long as they do not come to blow but when they resort to open violence then to render some tardy aid to the weaker side so as to plunge they deeper in hostility wherein both may exhaust they force without be lead by you put forth a excess of strength to suspect you of a desire to ruin they and remain they master where this be well manage it will almost always happen that you succeed in effect the object you propose to yourself the city of pistoja as i have say already in connection with another matter be win over to the florentine republic by no other artifice than this for the town be split by faction the florentine by now favor one side and now the other without incur the suspicion of either bring both to such extremity that weary out with they harass life they throw themselves at last of they own accord into the arm of florence the city of siena again have never make any change in she government which have have the support of the florentine save when that support have be slight and insignificant for whenever the interference of florence have be marked and decide it have have the effect of unite all party in support of thing as they stand one other instance i shall add to those already give oftener than once filippo viscontus duke of milan rely on they division set war on foot against the florentine and always without success so that in lament over these failure he be wont to complain that the mad humor of the florentine have cost he two million of gold without he have anything to show for it the veientine and etruscan therefore as i have say already be mislead by false hope and in the end be route by the roman in a single pitched battle and any who should look hereafter to prevail on like grounds and by similar means against a divide people will always find themselves deceive chapter xxvi -- _ that taunt and abuse breed hatred against he who use they without yield he any advantage _ to abstain from threat and injurious language be methinks one of the wisest precaution a man can use for abuse and menace take nothing from the strength of a adversary the latter only make he more cautious while the former inflame he hatred against you and lead he to consider more diligently how he may cause you hurt this be see from the example of the veientine of whom i speak in the last chapter who to the injury of war against the roman add those verbal injury from which all prudent commander should compel they soldier to refrain for these be injury which stir and kindle you enemy to vengeance and yet as have be say in no way disable he from do you hurt so that in truth they be weapon which wind those who use they of this we find a notable instance in asia in connection with the siege of amida for gabade the persian general after besiege this town for a great while wearied out at last by its protracted defense determine on withdraw he army and have actually begin to strike he camp when the whole inhabitant of the place elate by they success come out upon the wall to taunt and upbraid they enemy with they cowardice and meanness of spirit and to load they with every kind of abuse sting by these insult gabade change he resolution renew the siege with such fury that in a few day he storm and sack the town and the very same thing befall the veientine who not content as we have see to make war on the roman with arm must need assail they with foul reproach advance to the palisade of they camp to revile they and molest they more with they tongue than with they sword until the roman soldier who at first be most unwilling to fight force the consul to lead they to the attack whereupon the veientine like those other of whom mention have just now be make have to pay the penalty of they insolence wise captain of army therefore and prudent governor of city should take all fit precaution to prevent such insult and reproach from be use by they soldier and subject either amongst themselves or against a enemy for when direct against a enemy they lead to the mischief above notice while still worse consequence may follow from we not prevent they among ourselves by such measure as sensible ruler have always take for that purpose the legion who be leave behind for the protection of capua have as shall in its place be tell conspire against the capuan they conspiracy lead to a mutiny which be presently suppress by valerius corvinus when as one of the condition on which the mutineer make they submission it be declare that whosoever should thereafter upbraid any soldier of these legion with have take part in this mutiny should be visit with the severest punishment so likewise when tiberius gracchus be appoint during the war with hannibal to command a body of slave whom the roman in they strait for soldier have furnish with arm one of he first act be to pass a order make it death for any to reproach he man with they servile origin so mischievous a thing do the roman esteem it to use insulting word to other or to taunt they with they shame whether this be do in sport or earnest nothing vex man more or rouse they to fiercer indignation _ for the bite jest which flavor too much of truth leave always behind it a rankle memory _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : nam facetiæ asperæ quando nimium ex vero traxere acrem sui memoriam relinquunt _ tacit a _ xv 68 -rrb- chapter xxvii -- _ that prudent prince and republic should be content to have obtain a victory for commonly when they be not theft-victory turn to defeat _ the use of dishonour language towards a enemy be mostly cause by a insolent humor breed by victory or the false hope of it whereby man be oftentimes lead not only to speak but also to act amiss for such false hope when they gain a entry into man 's mind cause they to overrun they goal and to miss opportunity for secure a certain good on the chance of obtain some thing better but uncertain and this be a matter that deserve attention because in deceive themselves man often injure they country i desire to illustrate it by particular instance ancient and recent since mere argument might not place it in so clear a light after route the roman at cannæ hannibal send messenger to carthage to announce he victory and to ask support a debate arise in the carthaginian senate as to what be to be do hanno a aged and wise citizen advise that they should prudently take advantage of they victory to make peace with the roman while as conqueror they might have it on favourable term and not wait to make it after a defeat since it should be they object to show the roman that they be strong enough to fight they but not to peril the victory they have win in the hope of win a greater this advice be not follow by the carthaginian senate but its wisdom be well see later when the opportunity to act upon it be go when the whole east have be overrun by alexander of macedon the citizen of tyre -lrb- then at the height of its renown and very strong from be build like venice in the sea -rrb- recognize he greatness send ambassador to he to say that they desire to be he good servant and to yield he all obedience yet could not consent to receive either he or he soldier within they wall whereupon alexander displeased that a single city should venture to close its gate against he to whom all the rest of the world have throw theirs open repulse the tyrian and reject they overture set to work to besiege they town but as it stand on the water and be well store with victual and all other munitions need for its defense after four month have go alexander perceive that he be waste more time in a inglorious attempt to reduce this one city than have suffice for most of he other conquest resolve to offer term to the tyrian and to make they those concession which they themselves have ask but they puff up by they success not merely refuse the term offer but put to death the envoy send to propose they enraged by this alexander renew the siege and with such vigor that he take and destroy the city and either slew or make slave of its inhabitant in the year 1512 a spanish army enter the florentine territory with the object of restore the medicus to florence and of levy a subsidy from the town have be summon thither by certain of the citizen who have promise they that so soon as they appear within the florentine confines they would arm in they behalf but when the spaniard have come into the plain of the arno and none declare in they favor be in sore need of supplies they offer to make term this offer the people of florence in they pride reject and so give occasion for the sack of prato and the overthrow of the florentine republic a prince therefore who be attack by a enemy much more powerful than himself can make no greater mistake than to refuse to treat especially when overture be make to he for however poor the term offer may be they be sure to contain some condition advantageous for he who accept they and which he may construe as a partial success for which reason it ought to have be enough for the citizen of tyre that alexander be bring to accept term which he have at first reject and they should have esteem it a sufficient triumph that by they resistance in arm they have force so great a warrior to bow to they will and in like manner it should have be a sufficient victory for the florentine that the spaniard have in part yield to they wish and abate something of they own demand the purport of which be to change the government of florence to sever she from she allegiance to france and further to obtain money from she for if of these three object the spaniard have succeed in secure the last two while the florentine maintain the integrity of they government a fair share of honor and contentment would have fall to each and while preserve they political existence the florentine should have make small account of the other two condition nor ought they even with the possibility and almost certainty of greater advantage before they to have leave matter in any degree to the arbitration of fortune by push thing to extreme and incur risk which no prudent man should incur unless compel by necessity hannibal when recall by the carthaginian from italy where for sixteen year he have cover himself with glory to the defense of he native country find on he arrival that hasdrubal and syphax have be defeat the kingdom of numidium lose and carthage confine within the limit of she wall and leave without other resource save in he and he army perceive therefore that this be the last stake he country have to play and not choose to hazard it until he have try every other expedient he feel no shame to sue for peace judge that in peace rather than in war lay the best hope of safety for he country but when peace be refuse he no fear of defeat deter he from battle be resolve either to conquer if conquer he might or if he must fall to fall gloriously now if a commander so valiant as hannibal at the head of a unconquered army be willing to sue for peace rather than appeal to battle when he see that by defeat he country must be enslave what course ought to be follow by another commander less valiant and with less experience than he but man labor under this infirmity that they know not where to set bound to they hope and building on these without otherwise measure they strength rush headlong on destruction chapter xxviii -- _ that to neglect the redress of grievance whether public or private be dangerous for a prince or commonwealth _ certain gaul come to attack etrurium and more particularly clusium its chief city the citizen of clusium seek aid from rome whereupon the roman send the three fabius as envoy to these gaul to notify to they in the name of the roman people that they must refrain from make war on the etruscan from what befall the roman in connection with this embassy we see clearly how far man may be carry in resent a affront for these envoy arrive at the very moment when the gaul and etruscan be about to join battle be readier at deed than word take part with the etruscan and fight in they foremost rank whence it come that the gaul recognize the roman envoy turn against the roman all the hatred which before they have feel for the etruscan and grow still more incensed when on make complaint to the roman senate through they ambassador of the wrong do they and demand that the fabius should be give up to they in atonement for they offence not merely be the offender not give up or punish in any way but on the contrary when the comitium meet be create tribune with consular power but when the gaul find these man honor who deserve to be chastise they conclude that what have happen have be do by way of slight and insult to they and burn with fury and resentment hasten forward to attack rome which they take with the exception of the capitol now this disaster overtake the roman entirely from they disregard of justice for they envoy who have violate the law of nation and have therefore deserve punishment they have on the contrary treat with honor and this should make we reflect how carefully all prince and commonwealth ought to refrain from commit like wrong not only against community but also against particular man for if a man be deeply wrong either by a private hand or by a public officer and be not avenge to he satisfaction if he live in a republic he will seek to avenge himself though in do so he bring ruin on he country or if he live under a prince and be of a resolute and haughty spirit he will never rest until he have wreak he resentment against the prince though he know it may cost he dear whereof we have no finer or truer example than in the death of philip of macedon the father of alexander for pausania a handsome and high-born youth belong to philip 's court have be most foully and cruelly dishonour by attalus one of the foremost man of the royal household repeatedly complain to philip of the outrage who for a while put he off with promise of vengeance but in the end so far from avenge he promote attalus to be governor of the province of greece whereupon pausania see he enemy honor and not punish turn all he resentment from he who have outrage against he who have not avenge he and on the morning of the day fix for the marriage of philip 's daughter to alexander of epirus while philip walk between the two alexander he son and he son-in-law towards the temple to celebrate the nuptials he slew he this instance nearly resemble that of the roman envoy and offer a warn to all ruler never to think so lightly of any man as to suppose that when wrong upon wrong have be do he he will not bethink himself of revenge however great the danger he run or the punishment he thereby bring upon himself chapter xxix -- _ that fortune obscure the mind of man when she would not have they hinder she design _ if we note well the course of human affair we shall often find thing come about and accident befall against which it seem to be the will of heaven that man should not provide and if this be the case even in rome so renowned for she valor religion and wise ordinance we need not wonder if it be far more common in other city and province wherein these safeguard be want have here a notable opportunity to show how heaven influence man 's action titus livius turn it to account and treat the subject at large and in pregnant word where he say that since it be heaven 's will for end of its own that the roman should feel its power it first of all cause these fabius who be send as envoy to the gaul to act amiss and then by they misconduct stir up the gaul to make war on rome and lastly so order matter that nothing worthy of they name be do by the roman to withstand they attack for it be fore-ordain by heaven that camillus who alone could supply the remedy to so mighty a evil should be banish to ardea and again that the citizen who have often create a dictator to meet attack of the volscian and other neighbouring hostile nation should fail to do so when the gaul be march upon rome moreover the army which the roman get together be but a weak one since they use no signal effort to make it strong nay be so dilatory in arm that they be barely in time to meet the enemy at the river allium though no more than ten mile distant from rome here again the roman tribune pitch they camp without observe any of the usual precaution attend neither to the choice of ground nor to surround themselves with trench or palisade nor to avail themselves of any other aid human or divine in order they army for battle moreover dispose it in weak column and these far apart : so that neither man nor officer accomplish anything worthy of the roman discipline the battle be bloodless for the roman flee before they be attack most of they retreat to veii the rest to rome where without turn aside to visit they home they make straight for the capitol meanwhile the senate so far from bethink themselves how they might defend the city do not even attend to close the gate and while some of they make they escape from rome other enter the capitol along with those who seek shelter there it be only in the defense of the capitol that any method be observe measure be take to prevent it be crowd with useless number and all the victual which could be get be bring into it to enable it to stand a siege of the woman the child and the man whose year unfitted they for service the most part flee for refuge to the neighbouring town the rest remain in rome a prey to the invader so that no one who have hear of the achievement of the roman in past year on be tell of what take place on this occasion could have believe that it be of the same people that thing so contrary be related wherefore titus livius after set forth all these disorder conclude with the word _ so far do fortune darken man 's mind when she would not have she ascendency gainsaid _ nor could any juster observation be make and hence it be that those who experience the extreme whether of good or of evil fortune be commonly little deserving either of praise or blame since it be apparent that it be from heaven have afford they or deny they opportunity for act worthily that they have be bring to they greatness or to they undoing fortune doubtless when she seek to effect great end will often choose as she instrument a man of such sense and worth that he can recognize the opportunity which she hold out to he and in like manner when she desire to bring about great calamity will put forward such man as will of themselves contribute to that result and all who stand in she way she either remove by death or deprive of the means of effect good and it be well see in the passage we be consider how fortune to aggrandize rome and raise she to the height she reach judge it necessary as shall be more fully show in the follow book to humble she yet would not have she utterly undo for which reason we find she cause camillus to be banish but not put to death suffering rome to be take but not the capitol and bring it to pass that while the roman take no wise precaution for the defense of they city they neglect none in defend they citadel that rome might be take fortune cause the mass of the army after the rout at the allium to direct its flight to veii thus withdraw the means wherewith the city might have be defend but while thus dispose matter she at the same time prepare all the needful step for its recovery in bring a almost entire roman array to veius and camillus to ardea so that a great force might be assemble for the rescue of they country under a captain in no way compromise by previous reverse but on the contrary in the enjoyment of a untarnished renown i might cite many modern instance to confirm these opinion but since enough have be say to convince any fair mind i pass they over but once more i repeat what from all history may be see to be most true that man may aid fortune but not withstand she may interweave they thread with she web but can not break it but for all that they must never lose heart since not know what they end be to be and move towards it by cross-road and untravelled path they have always room for hope and ought never to abandon it whatsoever befall and into whatsoever strait they come chapter xxx -- _ that really powerful prince and commonwealth do not buy friendship with money but with they valor and the fame of they prowess _ when besiege in the capitol the roman although expect succor from veius and from camillus nevertheless be straiten by famine enter into a agreement to buy off the gaul with gold but at the very moment when in pursuance of this agreement the gold be be weigh out camillus come up with he army this say we historian be contrived by fortune _ that the roman might not live thereafter as man ransom for a price _ and the matter be noteworthy not only with reference to this particular occasion but also as it bear on the method generally follow by this republic for we never find rome seek to acquire town or to purchase peace with money but always confide in she own warlike valor which could not i believe be say of any other republic now one of the test whereby to gauge the strength of any state be to observe on what term it live with its neighbor : for when it so carry itself that to secure its friendship its neighbor pay it tribute this be a sure sign of its strength but when its neighbor though of less reputation receive payment from it this be a clear proof of its weakness in the course of the roman history we read how the massilian the eduan the rhodian hiero of syracuse the king eumene and massinissa all of they neighbor to the roman frontier in order to secure the friendship of rome submit to impost and tribute whenever rome have need of they ask no return save she protection but with a weak state we find the reverse of all this happen and to begin with we own republic of florence we know that in time past when she be at the height of she renown there be never a lordling of romagna who have not a subsidy from she to say nothing of what she pay to the perugian to the castellan and to all she other neighbor but have we city be arm and strong the direct contrary would have be the case for to obtain she protection all would have pour money into she lap not seek to sell they friendship but to purchase hers nor be the florentine the only people who have live on this dishonourable foot the venetian have do the same nay the king of france himself for all he great dominion live tributary to the swiss and to the king of england and this because the french king and the other name with a view to escape danger rather imaginary than real have disarm they subject seek to reap a present gain by wring money from they rather than follow a course which would secure they own safety and the lasting welfare of they country which ill-practice of theirs though they quiet thing for a time must in the end exhaust they resource and give rise in season of danger to incurable mischief and disorder it would be tedious to count up how often in the course of they war the florentine the venetian and the kingdom of france have have to ransom themselves from they enemy and to submit to a ignominy to which once only the roman be very near be subject it would be tedious too to recite how many town have be buy by the florentine and by the venetian which afterwards have only be a trouble to they from they not know how to defend with iron what they have win with gold while the roman continue free they adhere to this more generous and noble method but when they come under the emperor and these again begin to deteriorate and to love the shade rather than the sunshine they also take to purchase peace now from the parthian now from the german and at other time from other neighbouring nation and this be the beginning of the decline of they great empire such be the evil that befall when you withhold arm from you subject and this course be attend by the still greater disadvantage that the closer a enemy press you the weaker he find you for any one who follow the evil method of which i speak must in order to support troops whom he think can be trust to keep off he enemy be very exacting in he dealings with those of he subject who dwell in the heart of he dominion since to widen the interval between himself and he enemy he must subsidize those prince and people who adjoin he frontier state maintain on this footing may make a little resistance on they confines but when these be pass by the enemy no further defense remain those who pursue such method as these seem not to perceive that they be oppose to reason and common sense for the heart and vital part of the body not the extremity be those which we should keep guard since we may live on without the latter but must die if the former be hurt but the state of which i speak leave the heart undefended defend only the hand and foot the mischief which have thus be and be at this day work in florence be plain enough to see for so soon as a enemy penetrate within she frontier and approach she heart all be over with she and the same be witness a few year ago in the case of the venetian whose city have it not be girdle by the sea must then have find its end in france indeed a like result have not be see so often she be so great a kingdom as to have few enemy mightier than herself nevertheless when the english invade france in the year 1513 the whole kingdom totter and the king himself as well as every one else have to own that a single defeat might have cost he he dominion but with the roman the reverse of all this take place for the nearer a enemy approach rome the more completely he find she arm for resistance and accordingly we see that on the occasion of hannibal 's invasion of italy the roman after three defeat and after the slaughter of so many of they captain and soldier be still able not merely to withstand the invader but even in the end to come off victorious this we may ascribe to the heart be well guard while the extremity be but little heed for the strength of rome rest on the roman people themselves on the latin league on the confederate town of italy and on she colony from all of which source she draw so numerous a army as enable she to subdue the whole world and to keep it in subjection the truth of what i say may be further see from the question put by hanno the carthaginian to the messenger send to carthage by hannibal after he victory at cannæ for when these be vaunt the achievement of hannibal they be ask by hanno whether any one have come forward on behalf of the roman to propose term of peace and whether any town of the latin league or of the colonize district have revolt from the roman and when to both inquiry the envoy answer no hanno observe that the war be no nearer a end than on the day it be begin we can understand therefore as well from what have now be say as from what i have often say before how great a difference there be between the method follow by the republic of the present time and those follow by the republic of antiquity and why it be that we see every day astounding loss alternate with extraordinary gain for where man be weak fortune show herself strong and because she change state and government change with she and will continue to change until some one arise who follow reverently the example of the ancient shall so control she that she shall not have opportunity with every revolution of the sun to display anew the greatness of she power chapter xxxi -- _ of the danger of trust banish man _ the danger of trust those who be in exile from they own country be one to which the ruler of state be often expose may i think be fitly consider in these discourse and i notice it the more willingly because i be able to illustrate it by a memorable instance which titus livius though with another purpose relate in he history when alexander the great pass with he army into asia he brother-in-law and uncle alexander of epirus come with another army into italy be invite thither by the banish lucanian who give he to believe that with they aid he might get possession of the whole of that country but when confide in the promise of these exile and feed by the hope they hold out to he he come into italy they put he to death they fellow-citizen have offer to restore they to they country upon this condition it behove we therefore to remember how empty be the promise and how doubtful the faith of man in banishment from they native land for as to they faith it may be assume that whenever they can effect they return by other means than yours notwithstanding any covenant they may have make with you they will throw you over and take part with they countryman and as for the empty promise and delusive hope which they set before you so extreme be they desire to return home that they naturally believe many thing which be untrue and designedly misrepresent many other so that between they belief and what they say they believe they fill you with false impression on which if you build you labor be in vain and you be lead to engage in enterprise from which nothing but ruin can result to this instance of alexander i shall add only one other that namely of themistocle the athenian who be proclaim a traitor flee into asia to darius to whom he make such lavish promise if he would only attack greece that he induce he to undertake the enterprise but afterwards when he could not fulfil what he have promise either from shame or through fear of punishment he poison himself but if such a mistake as this be make by a man like themistocle we may reckon that mistake still greater will be make by those who be of a feebler nature suffer themselves to be more completely sway by they feeling and wish wherefore let a prince be careful how he embark in any enterprise on the representation of a exile for otherwise he be likely either to be put to shame or to incur the gravest calamity because town be sometimes though seldom take by craft through secret practice have with they inhabitant i think it not out of place to discuss the matter in the follow chapter wherein i shall likewise show in how many way the roman be wont to make such acquisition chapter xxxii -- _ in how many way the roman gain possession of town _ turn they thought wholly to arm the roman always conduct they military enterprise in the most advantageous way both as to cost and every other circumstance of war for which reason they avoid attempt town by siege judge the expense and inconvenience of this method of carry on war greatly to outweigh any advantage to be gain by it accordingly they think it better and more for they interest to reduce town in any other way than this and in all those year during which they be constantly engage in war we find very few instance of they proceeding by siege for the capture of town therefore they trust either to assault or to surrender assault be effect either by open force or by force and stratagem combine when a town be assail by open force the wall be storm without be breach and the assailant be say _ aggredi urbem corona _ because they encircle the city with they entire strength and keep up a attack on all side in this way they often succeed in carry town and even great town at a first onset as when scipio take new carthage in spain but when they fail to carry a town by storm they set themselves to breach the wall with batter ram and other warlike engine or they dig mine so as to obtain a entrance within the wall this be the method follow in take veius or else to be on a level with the defender they erect tower of timber or throw up mound of earth against the outside of the wall so as to reach the top of these method of attack the first wherein the city be entirely surround expose the defender to more sudden peril and leave they more doubtful remedy for while it be necessary for they to have a sufficient force at all point it might happen that the force at they disposal be not numerous enough to be everywhere at once or to relieve one another or if they number be sufficient they might not all be equally resolute in stand they ground and they failure at any one point involve a general defeat consequently as i have say this method of attack be often successful but when it do not succeed at the first it be rarely renew be a method dangerous to the attack army which have to secure itself along a extended line be leave everywhere too weak to resist a sally make from the town nay of itself be apt to fall into confusion and disorder this method of attack therefore could be attempt once only and by way of surprise against breach in the wall the defense be as at the present day to throw up new work while mine be meet by counter-mine in which the enemy be either withstand at the point of the sword or baffle by some other warlike contrivance as by fill cask with feather which be set on fire and place in the mine choke out the assailant by they smoke and stench where tower be employ for the attack the defender seek to destroy they with fire and where mound of earth be throw up against the wall they would dig hole at the base of the wall against which the mound rest and carry off the earth which the enemy be heap up which be remove from within as fast as it be throw up from without the mound make no progress none of these method of attack can long be persist in and the assailant if unsuccessful must either strike he camp and seek victory in some other direction as scipio do when he invade africa and after fail in the attempt to storm utica withdraw from he attack on that town and turn he strength against the carthaginian army in the field or else recourse must be have to regular siege as by the roman at veius capua carthage jerusalem and diver other city which they reduce in this way the capture of town by stratagem combine with force be effect as by the roman at palæopolis through a secret understanding with some within the wall many attempt of this sort have be make both by the roman and by other but few successfully because the least hindrance disarrange the plan of action and because such hindrance be very likely to occur for either the plot be discover before it can be carry out as it readily may whether from treachery on the part of those to whom it have be communicate or from the difficulty which attend its inception the preliminary arrangement have to be make with the enemy and with person with whom it be not permit save under some pretext or other to hold intercourse or if it be not discover while it be be contrived a thousand difficulty will still be meet with in its execution for if you arrive either before or after the appoint time all be ruin the faintest sound as of the cackling of the goose in the capitol the least departure from some ordinary routine the most trifling mistake or error mar the whole enterprise add to which the darkness of night lend further terror to the peril of such undertaking while the great majority of those engage in they have no knowledge of the district or place into which they be bring be bewildered and disconcerted by the least mishap and put to flight by every imaginary danger in secret nocturnal enterprise of this sort no man be ever more successful than aratus of sicyon although in any encounter by day there never be a more arrant coward this we must suppose due rather to some special and occult quality inherent in the man than to success be naturally to be look for in the like attempt such enterprise accordingly be often plan but few be put into execution and fewer still with success when city be acquire by surrender the surrender be either voluntary or under compulsion voluntary when the citizen appeal to you for protection against some threaten danger from without as capua submit to the roman or where they be move by a desire to be better govern and be attract by the good government which he to whom they surrender be see exercise over other who have place themselves in he hand as be the case with the rhodian the massilian and other who for like cause give themselves up to the roman people compulsory surrender take place either as the result of a protracted siege like those we have speak of above or from the country be continually waste by incursion foray and similar severity to escape which a city make its submission of the method which have be notice the roman in preference to all other use this last and for four hundred and fifty year make it they aim to wear out they neighbor by invasion and by defeat in the open field while endeavor as i have elsewhere say to establish they influence over they by treaty and convention it be to this method of warfare therefore that they always mainly trust because after try all other they find none so free from inconvenience and disadvantage -- the procedure by siege involve expense and delay that by assault difficulty and danger and that by secret practice uncertainty and doubt they find likewise that while in subdue one obstinate city by siege many year might be waste a kingdom might be gain in a single day by the defeat of a hostile army in the field chapter xxxiii -- _ that the roman intrust the captain of they army with the fullest power _ in read this history of titus livius with a view to profit by it i think that all the method of conduct follow by the roman people and senate merit attention and among other thing fit to be consider it should be note with how ample a authority they send forth they consul they dictator and the other captain of they army all of whom we find clothe with the fullest power : no other prerogative be reserve to itself by the senate save that of declare war and make peace while everything else be leave to the discretion and determination of the consul for so soon as the people and senate have resolve on war for instance on a war against the latin they throw all further responsibility upon the consul who might fight or decline battle as he please and attack this or the other city as he think fit that this be so be see in many instance and especially from what happen during a expedition make against the etruscan for the consul fabius have route that people near sutrium and think to pass onward through the ciminian forest into etrurium so far from seek the advice of the senate give they no hint whatever of he design although for its execution the war have to be carry into a new difficult and dangerous country we have further witness to the same effect in the action take in respect of this enterprise by the senate who be inform of the victory obtain by fabius and apprehend that he might decide to pass onward through the aforesaid forest and deem it inexpedient that he should incur risk by attempt this invasion send two messenger to warn he not to enter etrurium these messenger however do not come up with the consul until he have already make he way into that country and gain a second victory when instead of oppose he further advance they return to rome to announce he good fortune and the glory which he have win whoever therefore shall well consider the character of the authority whereof i speak will see that it be most wisely accord since have it be the wish of the senate that a consul in conduct a war should proceed step by step as they might direct he this must have make he at once less cautious and more dilatory because the credit of victory would not then have seem to be wholly he own but share by the senate on whose advice he act besides which the senate must have take upon itself the task of advise on matter which it could not possibly understand for although it might contain among its member all who be most verse in military affair still since these man be not on the spot and be ignorant of many particulars which if they be to give sound advice it be necessary for they to know they must in advise have make numberless mistake for these reason they desire that the consul should act on he own responsibility and that the honor of success should be wholly he judge that the love of fame would act on he at once as a spur and as a curb make he do whatever he have to do well this matter i have the rather dwell upon because i observe that we modern republic such as the venetian and the florentine view it in a different light so that when they captain commissary or _ provedditorus _ have a single gun to place in position the authority at home must be inform and consult a course deserving the same approval as be due to all those other method of theirs which one with another have bring italy to she present condition book iii \* \* \* \* \* chapter i -- _ for a sect or commonwealth to last long it must often be bring back to its beginning _ doubtless all the thing of this world have a limit set to they duration yet those of they the body whereof have not be suffer to grow disorder but have be so care for that either no change at all have be work in they or if any a change for the better and not for the worse will run that course which heaven have in a general way appoint they and since i be now speak of mixed body for state and sect be so to be regard i say that for they these be wholesome change which bring they back to they first beginning those state consequently stand surest and endure longest which either by the operation of they institution can renew themselves or come to be renew by accident apart from any design nothing however can be clearer than that unless thus renew these body do not last now the way to renew they be as i have say to bring they back to they beginning since all beginning of sect commonwealth or kingdom must need have in they a certain excellence by virtue of which they gain they first reputation and make they first growth but because in progress of time this excellence become corrupted unless something be do to restore it to what it be at first these body necessarily decay for as the physician tell we in speaking of the human body _ something or other be daily add which sooner or later will require treatment _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- as regard commonwealth this return to the point of departure be bring about either by extrinsic accident or by intrinsic foresight as to the first we have see how it be necessary that rome should be take by the gaul that be thus in a manner reborn she might recover life and vigor and resume the observance of religion and justice which she have suffer to grow rust by neglect this be well see from those passage of livius wherein he tell we that when the roman army be ` send forth against the gaul and again when tribune be create with consular authority no religious rite whatever be celebrated and wherein he further relate how the roman not only fail to punish the three fabius who contrary to the law of nation have fight against the gaul but even clothe they with honor for from these instance we may well infer that the rest of the wise ordinance institute by romulus and the other prudent king have begin to be hold of less account than they deserve and less than be essential for the maintenance of good government and therefore it be that rome be visit by this calamity from without to the end that all she ordinance might be reform and the people teach that it behove they not only to maintain religion and justice but also to esteem they worthy citizen and to prize they virtue beyond any advantage of which they themselves might seem to have be deprive at they instance and this we find be just the effect produce for no sooner be the city retaken than all the ordinance of the old religion be at once restore the fabius who have fight in violation of the law of nation be punish and the worth and excellence of camillus so fully recognize that the senate and the whole people lay all jealousy aside once more commit to he the entire charge of public affair it be necessary then as i have say already that where man dwell together in a regulated society they be often remind of those ordinance in conformity with which they ought to live either by something inherent in these or else by some external accident a reminder be give in the former of these two way either by the passing of some law whereby the member of the society be bring to a account or else by some man of rare worth arise among they whose virtuous life and example have the same effect as a law in a commonwealth accordingly this end be serve either by the virtue of some one of its citizen or by the operation of its institution the institution whereby the roman commonwealth be lead back to its start point be the tribuneship of the people and the censorship together with all those law which be pass to check the insolence and ambition of its citizen such institution however require fresh life to be infuse into they by the worth of some one man who fearlessly devote himself to give they effect in opposition to the power of those who set they at defiance of the law be thus reinforce in rome before its capture by the gaul we have notable example in the death of the son of brutus of the decemvir and of manlius frumentarius and after its capture in the death of manlius capitolinus and of the son of manlius torquatus in the prosecution of he master of the knight by papirius cursor and in the impeachment of the scipio such example as these be signal and extraordinary have the effect whenever they take place of bring man back to the true standard of right but when they come to be of rarer occurrence they leave man more leisure to grow corrupted and be attend by greater danger and disturbance wherefore between one and another of these vindication of the law no more than ten year at most ought to intervene because after that time man begin to change they manners and to disregard the law and if nothing occur to recall the idea of punishment and unless fear resume its hold on they mind so many offender suddenly spring up together that it be impossible to punish they without danger and to this purport it use to be say by those who rule florence from the year 1434 to 1494 that they government could hardly be maintain unless it be renew every five year by which they mean that it be necessary for they to arouse the same terror and alarm in man 's mind as they inspire when they first assume the government and when all who offend against they authority be signally chastise for when the recollection of such chastisement have die out man be embolden to engage in new design and to speak ill of they ruler for which the only remedy be to restore thing to what they be at first a republic may likewise be bring back to its original form without recourse to ordinance for enforce justice by the mere virtue of a single citizen by reason that these virtue be of such influence and authority that good man love to imitate they and bad man be ashamed to depart from they those to whom rome owe most for service of this sort be horatius cocle mutius scævola the two decius atilius regulus and diver other whose rare excellence and generous example work for they city almost the same result as might have be effect by ordinance and law and if to these instance of individual worth have be add every ten year some signal enforcement of justice it would have be impossible for rome ever to have grow corrupted but when both of these incitement to virtuous behavior begin to recur less frequently corruption spread and after the time of atilius regulus no like example be again witness for though the two cato come later so great a interval have elapse before the elder cato appear and again so long a period intervene between he and the younger and these two moreover stand so much alone that it be impossible for they by they influence to work any important change more especially for the younger who find rome so much corrupt that he could do nothing to improve he fellow-citizen this be enough to say concern commonwealth but as regard sect we see from the instance of we own religion that here too a like renewal be need for have not this religion of ours be bring back to its original condition by saint franci and saint dominick it must soon have be utterly extinguish they however by they voluntary poverty and by they imitation of the life of christ rekindle in the mind of man the die flame of faith and by the efficacious rule which they establish avert from we church that ruin which the ill life of its prelate and head must otherwise have bring upon it for live in poverty and gain great authority with the people by confess they and preach to they they get they to believe that it be evil to speak ill even of what be evil and that it be good to be obedient to ruler who if they do amiss may be leave to the judgment of god by which teaching these ruler be encourage to behave as badly as they can have no fear of punishment which they neither see nor credit nevertheless it be this renewal which have maintain and still maintain we religion kingdom also stand in need of a like renewal and to have they law restore to they former force and we see how by attend to this the kingdom of france have profit for that kingdom more than any other lie under the control of its law and ordinance which be maintain by its parliament and more especially by the parliament of pari from which last they derive fresh vigor whenever they have to be enforce against any prince of the realm for this assembly pronounce sentence even against the king himself heretofore this parliament have maintain its name as the fearless champion of the law against the noble of the land but should it ever at any future time suffer wrong to pass unpunished and should offence multiply either these will have to be correct with great disturbance to the state or the kingdom itself must fall to piece this then be we conclusion -- that nothing be so necessary in any society be it a religious sect a kingdom or a commonwealth as to restore to it that reputation which it have at first and to see that it be provide either with wholesome law or with good man whose action may effect the same end without need to resort to external force for although this last may sometimes as in the case of rome afford a efficacious remedy it be too hazardous a remedy to make we ever wish to employ it and that all may understand how much the action of particular citizen help to make rome great and how many admirable result they work in that city i shall now proceed to set they forth and examine they with which survey this third book of mine and last division of the first decade of titus livius shall be bring to a close but although great and notable action be do by the roman king nevertheless since history have treat of these at much length here i shall pass they over and say no more about these prince save as regard certain thing do by they with a eye to they private interest i shall begin therefore with brutus the father of roman freedom -lrb- footnote 1 : quod quotidie aggregatur aliquid quod quandoque indiget curatione -rrb- chapter ii -- _ that on occasion it be wise to feign folly _ never do any man by the most splendid achievement gain for himself so great a name for wisdom and prudence as be justly due to junius brutus for feign to be a fool and although titus livius mention one cause only as have lead he to assume this part namely that he might live more securely and look after he patrimony yet on consider he behavior we may believe that in counterfeit folly it be also he object to escape notice and so find better convenience to overthrow the king and to free he country whenever a occasion offer that this be in he mind be see first of all from the interpretation he give to the oracle of apollo when to render the god favourable to he design he pretend to stumble and secretly kiss he mother earth and again from this that on the death of lucretium though she father she husband and other of she kinsman be present he be the first to draw the dagger from she wound and bind the bystander by oath never more to suffer king to reign in rome from he example all who be discontent with they prince be teach first of all to measure and to weigh they strength and if they find themselves strong enough to disclose they hostility and proclaim open war then to take that course as at once the nobler and less dangerous but if too weak to make open war then sedulously to court the favor of the prince use to that end all such method as they may judge needful adapt themselves to he pleasure and show delight in whatever they see he delight in such a intimacy in the first place enable you to live securely and permit you without incur any risk to share the happy fortune of the prince while it afford you every facility for carry out you plan some no doubt will tell you that you should not stand so near the prince as to be involve in he downfall nor yet at such a distance that when he fall you shall be too far off to use the occasion for rise on he ruin but although this mean course could we only follow it be certainly the best yet since i believe it to be impracticable we must resort to the method above indicate and either keep altogether aloof or else cleave closely to the prince whosoever do otherwise if he be of great station live in constant peril nor will it avail he to say i concern myself with nothing i covet neither honor nor preferment my sole wish be to live a quiet and peaceful life for such excuse though they be listen to be not accept nor can any man of great position however much and sincerely he desire it elect to live this life of tranquillity since he profession will not be believe so that although he might be contented to be let alone other will not suffer he to be so wherefore like brutus man must feign folly and to play the part effectively and so as to please they prince must say do see and praise thing contrary to they inclination but now have speak of the prudence show by brutus when he seek to recover the freedom of rome let we next speak of the severity which he use to maintain it chapter iii -- _ that to preserve a newly acquire freedom we must slay the son of brutus _ the severity use by brutus in preserve for rome the freedom he have win for she be not less necessary than useful the spectacle of a father sit on the judgment and not merely sentence he own son to death but be himself present at they execution afford a example rare in history but those who study the record of ancient time will understand that after a change in the form of a government whether it be from a commonwealth to a tyranny or from a tyranny to a commonwealth those who be hostile to the new order of thing must always be visit with signal punishment so that he who set up as a tyrant and slay not brutus and he who create a free government and slay not the son of brutus can never maintain himself long but since i have elsewhere treat of this matter at large i shall merely refer to what have there be say concern it and shall cite here one instance only happen in we own day and memorable in the history of we country i speak of piero soderinus who think by he patience and goodness to overcome the very same temper which prompt the son of brutus to revert to the old government and who fail in the endeavor for although he sagacity should have teach he the necessity while chance and the ambition of those who attack he furnish he with the opportunity of make a end of they he never could resolve to strike the blow and not merely believe himself able to subdue disaffection by patience and kindness and to mitigate the enmity of particular man by the reward he hold out to they but also persuade himself and often declare in the presence of he friend that he could not confront opposition openly nor crush he adversary without assume extraordinary power and pass law destructive of civil equality which measure although not afterward use by he for tyrannical end would so alarm the community that after he death they would never again consent to appoint a gonfalonier for life a office which he judge it essential both to maintain and strengthen now although these scruple of he be wise and good we ought never out of regard for what be good to suffer a evil to run its course since it may well happen that the evil will prevail over the good and piero should have believe that as he act and intention be to be judge by result he might if he live and if fortune befriend he have make it clear to all that what he do be do to preserve he country and not from personal ambition and he might have so contrived matter that no successor of he could ever turn to bad end the means which he have use for good end but he be mislead by a preconceived opinion and fail to understand that ill-will be not to be vanquish by time nor propitiate by favor and so from not know how to resemble brutus he lose power and fame and be drive a exile from he country that it be as hard a matter to preserve a princedom as it be to preserve a commonwealth will be show in the chapter follow chapter iv -- _ that a usurper be never safe in he princedom while those live whom he have deprive of it _ from what befall the elder tarquin at the hand of the son of ancus and servius tullius at the hand of tarquin the proud we see what a arduous and perilous course it be to strip a king of he kingdom and yet suffer he to live on hope to conciliate he by benefit we see too how the elder tarquin be ruin by he belief that he hold the kingdom by a just title since it have be give he by the people and confirm to he by the senate never suspect that the son of ancus would be so stir by resentment that it would be impossible to content they with what contented all the rest of rome servius tullius again be ruin through believe that he could conciliate the son of ancus by load they with favor by the fate of the first of these king every prince may be warn that he can never live securely in he princedom so long as those from whom he have take it survive while the fate of the second should remind all ruler that old injury be not to be heal by subsequent benefit and least of all when the new benefit be less in degree than the injury suffer and truly servius be want in wisdom when he imagine that the son of tarquin would contentedly resign themselves to be the son-in-law of one whom they think should be they subject for the desire to reign be so prevail a passion that it penetrate the mind not only of those who be rightful heir but also of those who be not as happen with the wife of the younger tarquin who be daughter to servius but who possess by this madness and setting at naught all filial duty incite she husband to take she father 's kingdom and with it he life so much nobler do she esteem it to be a queen than the daughter of a king but while the elder tarquin and servius tullius lose the kingdom from not know how to secure themselves against those whom they have deprive of it the younger tarquin lose it from not observe the ordinance of the old king as shall be show in the follow chapter chapter v -- _ how a hereditary king may come to lose he kingdom _ tarquin the proud when he have put servius tullius to death inasmuch as the latter leave no heir take secure possession of the kingdom have nothing to fear from any of those danger which have stand in the way of he predecessor and although the means whereby he make himself king be hateful and monstrous nevertheless have he adhere to the ancient ordinance of the earlier king he might have be endure nor would he have arouse both senate and people to combine against he and deprive he of he government it be not therefore because he son sextus violate lucretium that tarquin be drive out but because he himself have violate the law of the kingdom and govern as a tyrant strip the senate of all authority and bring everything under he own control for all business which formerly have be transact in public and with the sanction of the senate he cause to be transact in he palace on he own responsibility and to the displeasure of every one else and so very soon deprive rome of whatever freedom she have enjoy under she other king nor be it enough for he to have the father he enemy but he must need also kindle the common against he wear they out with mere mechanic labor very different from the enterprise in which they have be employ by he predecessor so that when rome overflow with instance of he cruelty and pride he have already dispose the mind of all the citizen to rebel whenever they find the opportunity wherefore have not occasion offer in the violence do to lucretia some other have soon be find to bring about the same result but have tarquin live like the other king when sextus he son commit that outrage brutus and collatinus would have have recourse to he to punish the offender and not to the common of rome and hence let prince learn that from the hour they first violate those law custom and usage under which man have live for a great while they begin to weaken the foundation of they authority and should they after they have be strip of that authority ever grow wise enough to see how easily princedom be preserve by those who be content to follow prudent counsel the sense of they loss will grieve they far more and condemn they to a worse punishment than any they suffer at the hand of other for it be far easier to be love by good man than by bad and to obey the law than to seek to control they and to learn what mean they must use to retain they authority they have only to take example by the conduct of good prince such as timoleon of corinth aratus of sicyone and the like in whose life they will find such security and content both on the side of the ruler and the rule as ought to stir they with the desire to imitate they which for the reason already give it be easy for they to do for man when they be well govern ask no more nor look for further freedom as be the case with the people govern by the two whom i have name whom they constrain to continue they ruler while they live though both of they seek repeatedly to return to private life but because in this and the two precede chapter i have notice the ill-will which arise against the king the plot contrived by the son of brutus against they country and those direct against the elder tarquin and servius tullius it seem to I not out of place to discourse of these matter more at length in the follow chapter as deserving the attention both of prince and private citizen chapter vi -- _ of conspiracy _ it be a omission not to say something on the subject of conspiracy these be a source of much danger both to prince and to private man for we see that many more prince have lose they life and state through these than in open warfare power to wage open war upon a prince be concede to few whereas power to conspire against he be deny to none on the other hand since conspiracy be attend at every stage by difficulty and danger no more hazardous or desperate undertaking can be engage in by any private citizen whence it come that while many conspiracy be plan few effect they object wherefore to put prince on they guard against these danger and to make subject more cautious how they take part in they and rather learn to live content under whatever government fortune have assign they i shall treat of they at length without omit any noteworthy circumstance which may serve for the instruction of either though indeed this be a golden sentence of cornelius tacitus wherein he say that _ the past should have we reverence the present we obedience and that we should wish for good prince but put up with any _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- for assuredly whosoever do otherwise be likely to bring ruin both on himself and on he country but to go deeper into the matter we have first of all to examine against whom conspiracy be direct and we shall find that man conspire either against they country or they prince and it be of these two kind of conspiracy that at present i desire to speak for of conspiracy which have for they object the surrender of city to enemy who be besiege they and of all other contrived for like end i have already say enough first then i shall treat of those conspiracy which be direct against a prince and begin by inquire into they cause which be manifold but of which one be more momentous than all the rest i mean the be hate by the whole community for it may reasonably be assume that when a prince have draw upon himself this universal hatred he must also have give special offence to particular man which they will be eager to avenge and this eagerness will be augment by the feeling of general ill-will which the prince be see to have incur a prince ought therefore to avoid this load of public hatred how he be to do so i need not stop here to explain have discuss the matter already in another place but if he can guard against this offence give to particular man will expose he to but few attack one reason be that there be few man who think so much of a injury do they as to run great risk to revenge it another that assume they to have both the disposition and the courage to avenge themselves they be restrain by the universal favor which they see entertain towards the prince injury be either to a man 's life to he property or to he honor as regard the first they who threaten injury to life incur more danger than they who actually inflict they or rather while great danger be incur in threatening none at all be incur from inflict such injury for the dead be past thinking of revenge and those who survive for the most part leave such thought to the dead but he whose life be threaten find himself force by necessity either to do or suffer become a man most dangerous to the prince as shall be fully explain hereafter after menace to life injury to property and honor stir man more than any other and of these a prince have most to beware for he can never strip a man so bare of he possession as not to leave he some weapon wherewith to redress he wrong nor ever so far dishonor he as to quell the stubborn spirit which prompt revenge of all dishonor those do to the woman of a household be the worst after which come such personal indignity as nerve the arm of pausania against philip of macedon and of many another against other prince and in we own day it be no other reason that move giulio belantus to conspire against pandolfo lord of siena than that pandolfo who have give he he daughter to wife afterwards take she from he as presently shall be tell chief among the cause which lead the pazzus to conspire against the medicus be the law pass by the latter deprive they of the inheritance of giovannus bonromei another most powerful motive to conspire against a prince be the desire man feel to free they country from a usurper this it be which impel brutus and cassius to conspire against cæsar and countless other against such tyrant as phalari dionysius and the like against this humor no tyrant can guard except by lay down he tyranny which as none will do few escape a unhappy end whence the verse of juvenal : -- few tyrant die a peaceful death and few the king who visit proserpine 's dread lord unscathed by wound and blood -lrb- 2 -rrb- great as i have say already be the danger which man run in conspire for at all time they be in peril whether in contrive in execute or after execution and since in conspiracy either many be engage or one only -lrb- for although it can not properly be say of _ one _ man that he _ conspire _ there may exist in he the fix resolve to put the prince to death -rrb- it be only the solitary plotter who escape the first of these three stage of danger for he run no risk before execute he design since as he impart it to none there be none to bring it to the ear of the prince a deliberate resolve like this may be conceive by a person in any rank of life high or low base or noble and whether or no he be the familiar of he prince for every one must at some time or other have leave to speak to the prince and whoever have this leave have opportunity to accomplish he design pausania of whom we have make mention so often slew philip of macedon as he walk between he son and he son-in-law to the temple surround by a thousand armed guard pausania indeed be noble and know to the prince but ferdinand of spain be stab in the neck by a poor and miserable spaniard and though the wound be not mortal it suffice to show that neither courage nor opportunity be want to the would-be-assassin a dervish or turkish priest draw he scimitar on bajazet father of the sultan now reign and if he do not wind he it be from no lack either of daring or of opportunity and i believe that there be many who in they mind desire the deed no punishment or danger attend the mere wish though there be but few who dare do it for since few or none who venture escape death few be willing to go forward to certain destruction but to pass from these solitary attempt to those in which several be engage i affirm it to be show by history that all such plot have be contrived by man of great station or by those who have be on term of close intimacy with the prince since no other not be downright madman would ever think of conspire for man of humble rank and such as be not the intimate of they prince be neither feed by the hope nor possess of the opportunity essential for such attempt because in the first place man of low degree will never find any to keep faith with they none be move to join in they scheme by those expectation which encourage man to run great risk wherefore so soon as they design have be impart to two or three they be betray and ruin or assume they fortunate enough to have no traitor of they number they will be so hamper in the execution of they plot by the want of easy access to the prince that they be sure to perish in the mere attempt for if even man of great position who have ready access to the prince succumb to the difficulty which i shall presently notice those difficulty must be infinitely increase in the case of man who be without these advantage and because when life and property be at stake man be not utterly reckless on perceive themselves to be weak they grow cautious and though cursing the tyrant in they heart be content to endure he and to wait until some one of higher station than they come forward to redress they wrong so that should we ever find these weakling attempt anything we may commend they courage rather than they prudence we see however that the great majority of conspirator have be person of position and the familiar of they prince and that they plot have be as often the consequence of excessive indulgence as of excessive injury as when perennius conspire against commodus plautianus against severus and sejanus against tiberius all of whom have be raise by they master to such wealth honor and dignity that nothing seem want to they authority save the imperial name that they might not lack this also they fall to conspire against they prince but in every instance they conspiracy have the end which they ingratitude deserve the only instance in recent time of such attempt succeed be the conspiracy of jacopo iv d'appiano against messer piero gambacortus lord of pisa for jacopo who have be breed and bring up by piero and load by he with honor deprive he of he state similar to this in we own day be the conspiracy of coppolum against king ferdinand of aragon for coppolum have reach such a pitch of power that he seem to himself to have everything but sovereignty in seek to obtain which he lose he life though if any plot enter into by a man of great position could be expect to succeed this certainly might be contrived as we may say by another king and by one who have the amplest opportunity for its accomplishment but that lust of power which blind man to danger darken the mind of those to whom the execution of the scheme be commit who have they only known how to add prudence to they villainy could hardly have miss they aim the prince therefore who would guard himself against plot ought more to fear those man to whom he have be too indulgent than those to whom he have do great wrong for the latter lack opportunity which the former have in abundance and the move cause be equally strong in both lust of power be at least as strong a passion as lust of revenge wherefore a prince should entrust he friend with so much authority only as leave a certain interval between he position and theirs that between the two something be still leave they to desire otherwise it will be strange if he do not fare like those prince who have be name above but to return from this digression i say that have show it to be necessary that conspirator should be man of great station and such as have ready access to the prince we have next to consider what have be the result of they plot and to trace the cause which have make they succeed or fail now as i have say already we find that conspiracy be attend by danger at three stage : before during and after they execution for which reason very few of they have have a happy issue it be next to impossible to surmount all these different danger successfully and to begin with those which be incur beforehand and which be graver than all the rest i say that he must be both very prudent and very fortunate who when contrive a conspiracy do not suffer he secret to be discover conspiracy be discover either by disclosure make or by conjecture disclosure be make through the treachery or folly of those to whom you communicate you design treachery be to be look for because you can impart you plan only to such person as you believe ready to face death on you behalf or to those who be discontent with the prince of man whom you can trust thus implicitly one or two may be find but when you have to open you design to many they can not all be of this nature and they goodwill towards you must be extreme if they be not daunt by the danger and by fear of punishment moreover man commonly deceive themselves in respect of the love which they imagine other bear they nor can ever be sure of it until they have put it to the proof but to make proof of it in a matter like this be very perilous and even if you have prove it already and find it true in some other dangerous trial you can not assume that there will be the same fidelity here since this far transcend every other kind of danger again if you gauge a man 's fidelity by he discontent with the prince you may easily deceive yourself for so soon as you have take this discontented man into you confidence you have supply he with the means whereby he may become contented so that either he hatred of the prince must be great indeed or you influence over he extraordinary if it keep he faithful hence it come that so many conspiracy have be discover and crush in they earliest stage and that when the secret be preserve among many accomplice for any length of time it be look on as a miracle as in the case of the conspiracy of piso against nero and in we own day in that of the pazzus against lorenzo and giuliano de ' medicus which last though more than fifty person be privy to it be not discover until it come to be carry out conspiracy be disclose through the imprudence of a conspirator when he talk so indiscreetly that some servant or other person not in the plot overhear he as happen with the son of brutus who when treat with the envoy of tarquin be overhear by a slave who become they accuser or else through you own weakness in impart you secret to some woman or boy whom you love or to some other such light person as when dymnus who be one of those who conspire with philota against alexander the great reveal the plot to nicomachus a youth whom he love who at once tell cebalinus and cebalinus the king of discovery by conjecture we have a instance in the conspiracy of piso against nero for scaevinus one of the conspirator the day before he be to kill nero make he will liberate all he slave and give they money and bade milichus he freedman sharpen he old rusty dagger and have bandage ready for bind up wound from all which preparation milichus conjecture what work be in hand accuse scaevinus before nero whereupon scaevinus be arrest and with he natalis another of the conspirator who the day before have be see to speak with he for a long time in private and when the two differ in they account of what then pass between they they be put to the torture and force to confess the truth in this way the conspiracy be bring to light to the ruin of all concern against these cause of the discovery of conspiracy it be impossible so to guard as that either through treachery want of caution or levity the secret shall not be find out whenever more than three or four person be privy to it and whenever more than one conspirator be arrest the plot be certain to be detect because no two person can perfectly agree in a false account of what have pass between they if only one be take should he be a man of resolute courage he may refuse to implicate he comrade but they on they part must have no less courage to stay quiet where they be and not betray themselves by flight for if courage be absent anywhere whether in he who be take or in those still at large the conspiracy be reveal and what be relate by titus livius as have happen in the conspiracy against hieronymus tyrant of syracuse be most extraordinary namely that on the capture of one of the conspirator name theodorus he with great fortitude withhold the name of all he accomplice and accuse friend of the tyrant while he companion on they part trust so completely in he courage that not one of they quit syracuse or show any sign of fear all these danger therefore which attend the contrivance of a plot must be pass through before you come to its execution or if you would escape they you must observe the follow precaution : you first and surest nay to say truth you only safeguard be to leave you accomplice no time to accuse you for which reason you must impart the affair to they only at the moment when you mean it to be carry out and not before those who have follow this course have wholly escape the preliminary danger of conspiracy and generally speak the other also indeed i may say that they have all succeed and that it be open to every prudent man to act as they do it will be enough to give two instance of plot effect in this way nelematus unable to endure the tyranny of aristotimus despot of epirus assemble many of he friend and kinsman in he house exhort they to free they country and when some of they ask for time to consider and mature they plan he bid he slave close the door and tell those assemble that unless they swear to go at once and do as he direct he would make they over to aristotimus as prisoner alarm by he threat they bind themselves by a solemn oath and go forth at once and without delay successfully carry out he bid a certain magus have fraudulently usurp the throne of persium ortane a grandee of that realm discover the fraud disclose it to six other of the chief nobility tell they that it behove they to free the kingdom from the tyranny of this impostor and when some among they ask for time darius who be one of the six summon by ortane stand up and say either we go at once to do this deed or i go to the magus to accuse you all whereupon all rise together without time give to any to change he mind they go forth and succeed in effect they end not unlike these instance be the plan take by the etolian to rid themselves of nabi the spartan tyrant to whom under pretence of succour he they send alasamene they fellow-citizen with two hundred foot soldier and thirty horseman for they impart they real design to alasamene only charge the rest under pain of exile to obey he in whatever he command alasamene repair to sparta and never divulge he commission till the time come for execute it and so succeed in put nabi to death it be therefore by the precaution they observe that the person of whom i have just now speak escape all those peril that attend the contrivance of conspiracy and any follow they example may expect the like good fortune and that all may learn to do as they do i shall notice the case of piso of which mention have before be make by reason of he rank he reputation and the intimate term on which he live with nero who trust he without reserve and would often come to he garden to sup with he piso be able to gain the friendship of many person of spirit and courage and well fit in every way to take part in he plot against the emperor which under these circumstance might easily have be carry out for when nero come to he garden piso could readily have communicate he design to those friend of he and with suitable word have encourage they to do what in fact they would not have have time to withdraw from and be certain to succeed and be we to examine all similar attempt it would be see that there be few which might not have be effect in the manner show but since most man be very ignorant of practical affair they commit the gravest blunder especially in matter which lie as this do a little way out of the beaten track wherefore the contriver of a plot ought never if he can help it to communicate he design until the moment when it be to be execute or if he must communicate it then to some one man only with whom he have long be intimate and whom he know to be move by the same feeling as himself to find one such person be far easier than to find several and at the same time involve less risk for though this one man play you false you be not leave altogether without resource as you be when you accomplice be numerous for i have hear it shrewdly say that to one man you may impart anything since unless you have be lead to commit yourself by write you denial will go as far as he assertion shun write therefore as you would a rock for there be nothing so damning as a letter under you own hand plautianus desire to procure the death of the emperor severus and he son caracallum intrust the business to the tribune saturninus who be more disposed to betray than obey plautianus but at the same time afraid that if it come to lay a charge plautianus might be believe sooner than he ask he for a write authority that he commission might be credit blind by ambition plautianus comply and forthwith be accuse by saturninus and find guilty whereas but for that write warrant together with other corroborating proof he must have escape by he bold denial of the charge against the testimony of a single witness you have thus some defense unless convict by you own handwriting or by other circumstantial proof against which you must guard a woman name epichari who have formerly be a mistress of nero be privy to piso 's conspiracy and think it might be useful to have the help of a certain captain of trireme whom nero have among he body-guard she acquaint he with the plot but not with the name of the plotter this fellow turn traitor and accuse epichari to nero so stoutly do she deny the charge that nero confound by she effrontery let she go in impart a plot to a single person there be therefore two risk : one that he may come forward of he own accord to accuse you the other that if arrest on suspicion or on some proof of he guilt he may on be convict in the hope to escape punishment betray you but in neither of these danger be you leave without a defense since you may meet the one by ascribe the charge to the malice of you accuser and the other by allege that the witness he be force by torture to say what be untrue the wisest course however be to impart you design to none but to act like those who have be mention above or if you impart it then to one only : for although even in this course there be a certain degree of danger it be far less than when many be admit to you confidence a case nearly resemble that just now notice be where a emergency so urgent as to leave you no time to provide otherwise for you safety constrain you to do to a prince what you see he mind to do to you a necessity of this sort lead almost always to the end desire as two instance may suffice to show among the closest friend and intimate of the emperor commodus be two captain of the pretorian guard letus and electus while among the most favor of he distress be a certain martium but because these three often reprove he for he manner of living as disgraceful to himself and to he station he resolve to rid himself of they and so write they name along with those of certain other whom he mean should be put to death the next night in a list which he place under the pillow of he bed but on he go to bathe a boy who be a favorite of he while play about he room and on he bed find the list and come out of the chamber with it in he hand be meet by martium who take it from he and on read it and find what it contain send for letus and electus and all three recognize the danger in which they stand resolve to be beforehand with the tyrant and lose no time murder he that very night the emperor caracallum be with he army in mesopotamium have with he macrinus who be more of a statesman than a soldier as he prefect but because prince who be not themselves good be always afraid lest other treat they as they deserve caracallum write to he friend maternianus in rome to learn from the astrologer whether any man have ambitious design upon the empire and to send he word maternianus accordingly write back that such design be entertain by macrinus but this letter ere it reach the emperor fall into the hand of macrinus who see when he read it that he must either put caracallum to death before further letter arrive from rome or else die himself commit the business to a centurion name martiali whom he trust and whose brother have be slay by caracallum a few day before who succeed in kill the emperor we see therefore that a urgency which leave no room for delay have almost the same result as the method already notice as follow by nelematus of epirus we see too what i remark almost at the outset of this discourse that the threat of prince expose they to greater danger than the wrong they actually inflict and lead to more active conspiracy : and therefore that a prince should be careful not to threaten since man be either to be treat kindly or else get rid of but never bring to such a pass that they have to choose between slaying and be slay as to the danger attend the execution of plot these result either from some change make in the plan or from a failure in courage on the part of he who be to carry it out or else from some mistake he fall into through want of foresight or from he not give the affair its finish stroke as when some be left alive whom it be mean to put to death now nothing cause so much disturbance and hindrance in human affair as to be force at a moment 's notice and without time allow for reflection to vary you plan of action and adopt a different one from that fix on at the first and if such change cause confusion anywhere it be in matter appertain to war and in enterprise of the kind we be now speak of for in such affair as these there be nothing so essential as that man be prepare to do the exact thing intrust to they but when man have for many day together turn they whole thought to do a thing in a certain way and in a certain order and the way and order be suddenly alter it be impossible but that they should be disconcerted and the whole scheme ruin for which reason it be far better to do everything in accordance with the preconcerted plan though it be see to be attend with some disadvantage than in order to escape these to involve yourself in a infinity of danger and this will happen when you depart from you original design without time give to form a new one for when time be give you may manage as you please the conspiracy of the pazzus against lorenzo and giuliano de ' medicus be well know the scheme agree on be to give a banquet to the cardinal s giorgio at which the brother should be put to death to each of the conspirator a part be assign : to one the murder to another the seizure of the palace while a third be to ride through the street and call on the people to free themselves but it so chance that at a time when the pazzus the medicus and the cardinal be all assemble in the cathedral church of florence to hear high mass it become know that giuliano would not be present at the banquet whereupon the conspirator lay they head together resolve to do in church what they be to have do elsewhere this however derange the whole scheme for giovambattista of montesecco would have no hand in the murder if it be to be do in a church and the whole distribution of part have in consequence to be change when as those to whom the new part be assign have no time allow they to nerve they mind to they new task they manage matter so badly that they be overpower in they attempt courage fail a conspirator either from he own poorness of spirit or from he be overcome by some feeling of reverence for such majesty and awe attend the person of a prince that it may well happen that he soften or dismay he executioner when caius marius be take by the people of minturnum the slave send in to slay he overawe by the bearing of the man and by the memory which he name call up become unnerved and powerless to perform he office and if this influence be exercise by one who be a prisoner and in chain and overwhelm by adverse fortune how much more must reverence be inspire by a prince who be free and uncontrolled surround by he retinue and by all the pomp and splendor of he station whose dignity confound and whose graciousness conciliate certain person conspire against sitalce king of thrace fix a day for he murder and assemble at the place appoint whither the king have already come yet none of they raise a hand to harm he and all depart without attempt anything against he or know why they refrain each blame the other and more than once the same folly be repeat until the plot get wind they be take and punish for what they might have do yet dare not do two brother of alfonso duke of ferrara conspire against he employ as they tool a certain priest name gienne a singing-man in the service of the duke he at they request repeatedly bring the duke into they company so that they have full opportunity to make away with he yet neither of they ever venture to strike the blow till at last they scheme be discover they pay the penalty of they combined cowardice and temerity such irresolution can only have arise from they be overawe by the majesty of the prince or touch by he graciousness in the execution of conspiracy therefore error and mishap arise from a failure of prudence or courage to which all be subject when lose self-control they be lead in they bewilderment to do and say what they ought not that man be thus confound and throw off they balance could not be better show than in the word of titus livius where he describe the behavior of alasamene the etolian at the time when he resolve on the death of nabi the spartan of whom i have speak before for when the time to act come and he have disclose to he follower what they have to do livius represent he as _ collect he thought which have grow confuse by dwelling on so desperate a enterprise _ for it be impossible for any one though of the most steadfast temper and use to the sight of death and to handle deadly weapon not to be perturb at such a moment for which reason we should on such occasion choose for we tool those who have have experience in similar affair and trust no other though repute of the truest courage for in these grave undertaking no one who be without such experience however bold and resolute be to be trust the confusion of which i speak may either cause you to drop you weapon from you hand or to use word which will have the same result quintianus be command by lucillum sister of commodus to slay he lay in wait for he at the entrance of the amphitheatre and rush upon he with a draw dagger cry out _ the senate send you this _ which word cause he to be seize before he blow descend in like manner messer antonio of volterra who as we have elsewhere see be tell off to kill lorenzo de ' medici exclaim as he approach he _ ah traitor _ and this exclamation prove the salvation of lorenzo and the ruin of that conspiracy for the reason now give a conspiracy against a single ruler may readily break down in its execution but a conspiracy against two ruler be not only difficult but so hazardous that its success be almost hopeless for to effect like action at the same time in different place be well-nigh impossible nor can they be effect at different time if you would not have one counteract another so that if conspiracy against a single ruler be imprudent and dangerous to conspire against two be in the last degree fool-hardy and desperate and be it not for the respect in which i hold the historian i could not credit as possible what herodian relate of plautianus namely that he commit to the centurion saturninus the task of slaying single-handed both severus and caracallum they dwelling in different place for the thing be so oppose to reason that on no other authority could i be induce to accept it as true certain young athenian conspire against diocle and hippia tyrant of athen diocle they slew but hippia make he escape avenge he chion and leonida of heraclea disciple of plato conspire against the despot clearchus and satirus clearchus fall but satirus survive and avenge he the pazzus of whom we have speak so often succeed in murder giuliano only from such conspiracy therefore as be direct against more head than one all should abstain for no good be to be get from they whether for ourselves for we country or for any one else on the contrary when those conspire against escape they become harsher and more unsufferable than before as in the example give florence athen and heraclea have cause to know true it be that the conspiracy contrived by pelopida for the liberation of he country have to encounter every conceivable hindrance and yet have the happiest end for pelopida have to deal not with two tyrant only but with ten and so far from have they confidence could not be a outlaw even approach they and yet he succeed in come to thebe in put the tyrant to death and in free he country but whatever he do be do with the aid of one of the counsellor of the tyrant a certain charon through whom he have all facility for execute he design let none however take this case as a pattern for that it be in truth a desperate attempt and its success a marvel be and be the opinion of all historian who speak of it as a thing altogether extraordinary and unexampled the execution of a plot may be frustrate by some groundless alarm or unforeseen mischance occur at the very moment when the scheme be to be carry out on the morning on which brutus and he confederate be to slay cæsar it so happen that cæsar talk for a great while with cneus pompilius lena one of the conspirator which some of the other observe be in terror that pompilius be divulge the conspiracy to cæsar whose life they would therefore have attempt then and there without wait he arrival in the senate house have they not be reassure by see that when the conference end he show no sign of unusual emotion false alarm of this sort be to be take into account and allow for all the more that they be easily raise for he who have not a clear conscience be apt to assume that other be speak of he a word use with a wholly different purpose may throw he mind off its balance and lead he to fancy that reference be intend to the matter he be engage on and cause he either to betray the conspiracy by flight or to derange its execution by anticipate the time fix and the more there be privy to the conspiracy the likelier be this to happen as to the mischance which may befall since these be unforeseen they can only be instance by example which may make man more cautious giulio belantus of siena of whom i have speak before from the hate he bear pandolfo petruccus who have give he he daughter to wife and afterwards take she from he resolve to murder he and thus choose he time almost every day pandolfo go to visit a sick kinsman pass the house of giulio on the way who remark this take measure to have he accomplice ready in he house to kill pandolfo as he pass wherefore place the rest arm within the doorway one he station at a window to give the signal of pandolfo 's approach it so happen however that as he come nigh the house and after the look-out have give the signal pandolfo fall in with a friend who stop he to converse when some of those with he go on in advance saw and hear the gleam and clash of weapon and so discover the ambuscade whereby pandolfo be save while giulio with he companion have to fly from siena this plot accordingly be mar and giulio 's scheme baulk in consequence of a chance meeting against such accident since they be out of the common course of thing no provision can be make still it be very necessary to take into account all that may happen and devise what remedy you can it now only remain for we to consider those danger which follow after the execution of a plot these in fact resolve themselves into one namely that some should survive who will avenge the death of the murder prince the part of avenger be likely to be assume by a son a brother or other kinsman of the decease who in the ordinary course of event might have look to succeed to the princedom and such person be suffer to live either from inadvertence or from some of the cause note already as when giovann ' andrea of lampognano with the help of he companion put to death the duke of milan for the son and two brother of the duke who survive he be able to avenge he death in case like this indeed the conspirator may be hold excuse since there be nothing they can do to help themselves but when from carelessness and want of due caution some one be allow to live whose death ought to have be secure there be no excuse certain conspirator after murder the lord count girolamo of forlus make prisoner of he wife and of he child who be still very young by think they could not be safe unless they get possession of the citadel which the governor refuse to surrender they obtain a promise from madonna caterina for so the countess be name that on they permit she to enter the citadel she would cause it to be give up to they she child in the mean time remain with they as hostage on which undertaking they suffer she to enter the citadel but no sooner have she get inside than she fall to upbraid they from the wall with the murder of she husband and to threaten they with every kind of vengeance and to show they how little store she set upon she child tell they scoffingly that she know how other could be get in the end the rebel have no leader to advise they and perceive too late the error into which they have be betray have to pay the penalty of they rashness by perpetual banishment but of all the danger which may follow on the execution of a plot none be so much or so justly to be fear as that the people should be well affect to the prince whom you have put to death for against this danger conspirator have no resource which can ensure they safety of this we have example in the case of cæsar who as he have the love of the roman people be by they avenge for they it be who by drive out the conspirator from rome be the cause that all of they at different time and in different place come to violent end conspiracy against they country be less danger for those who take part in they than conspiracy against prince since there be less risk beforehand and though there be the same danger in they execution there be none afterwards beforehand the risk be few because a citizen may use means for obtain power without betray he wish or design to any and unless he course be arrest he design be likely enough to succeed nay though law be pass to restrain he he may strike out a new path this be to be understand of a commonwealth which have to some degree become corrupt for in one wherein there be no taint of corruption there be no soil in which evil seed can grow such design will never suggest themselves to any citizen in a commonwealth therefore a citizen may by many means and in many way aspire to the princedom without risk destruction both because republic be slower than prince be to take alarm be less suspicious and consequently less cautious and because they look with greater reverence upon they great citizen who be in this way render bolder and more reckless in attack they any one who have read sallust 's account of the conspiracy of catiline must remember how when that conspiracy be discover catiline not only remain in rome but even make he appearance in the senatehouse where he be suffer to address the senate in the most insulting term -- so scrupulous be that city in protect the liberty of all its citizen nay even after he have leave rome and place himself at the head of he army lentulus and he other accomplice would not have be imprison have not letter be find upon they clearly establish they guilt hanno the foremost citizen of carthage aspire to absolute power on the occasion of the marriage of a daughter contrived a plot for administer poison to the whole senate and so make himself prince the scheme be discover the senate take no step against he beyond pass a law to limit the expense of banquet and marriage ceremony so great be the respect they pay to he quality true the _ execution _ of a plot against you country be attend with greater difficulty and danger since it seldom happen that in conspire against so many you own resource be sufficient by themselves for it be not every one who like cæsar agathocle or cleomene be at the head of a army so as to be able at a stroke and by open force to make himself master of he country to such as these doubtless the path be safe and easy enough but other who have not such a assemble force ready at they command must effect they end either by stratagem and fraud or with the help of foreign troops of such stratagem and fraud we have a instance in the case of pisistratus the athenian who after defeat the megarian and thereby gain the favor of he fellow-citizen show himself to they one morning cover with wound and blood declare that he have be thus outrage through the jealousy of the noble and ask that he might have a armed guard assign for he protection with the authority which this lend he he easily rise to such a pitch of power as to become tyrant of athen in like manner pandolfo petruccus on he return with the other exile to siena be appoint the command of the public guard as a mere office of routine which other have decline very soon however this armed force give he so much importance that he become the supreme ruler of the state and many other have follow other plan and method and in the course of time and without incur danger have achieve they aim conspirator against they country whether trust to they own force or to foreign aid have have more or less success in proportion as they have be favor by fortune catiline of whom we speak just now be overthrow hanno who have also be mention fail to accomplish he object by poison arm he partisan to the number of many thousand but both he and they come to a ill end on the other hand certain citizen of thebe conspire to become its tyrant summon a spartan army to they assistance and usurp the absolute control of the city in short if we examine all the conspiracy which man have engage in against they country we shall find that few or none have be quell in they inception but that all have either succeed or have break down in they execution once execute they entail no further risk beyond those imply in the nature of a princedom for the man who become a tyrant incur all the natural and ordinary danger in which a tyranny involve he and have no remedy against they save those of which i have already speak this be all that occur to I to say on the subject of conspiracy if i have notice those which have be carry out with the sword rather than those wherein poison have be the instrument it be because generally speak the method of proceeding be the same in both it be true nevertheless that conspiracy which be to be carry out by poison be by reason of they uncertainty attend by greater danger for since fewer opportunity offer for they execution you must have a understanding with person who can command opportunity but it be dangerous to have to depend on other again many cause may hinder a poison draught from prove mortal as when the murderer of commodus on he vomit the poison give he have to strangle he prince then have no worse enemy than conspiracy for when a conspiracy be form against they it either carry they off or discredit they : since if it succeed they die while if it be discover and the conspirator be put to death themselves it will always be believe that the whole affair have be trump up by the prince that he might glut he greed and cruelty with the goods and blood of those whom he have make away with let I not however forget to warn the prince or commonwealth against whom a conspiracy be direct that on get word of it and before take any step to punish it they endeavor as far as they can to ascertain its character and after carefully weigh the strength of the conspirator with they own on find it preponderate never suffer they knowledge of the plot to appear until they be ready with a force sufficient to crush it for otherwise to disclose they knowledge will only give the signal for they destruction they must strive therefore to seem unconscious of what be go on for conspirator who see themselves detect be drive forward by necessity and will stick at nothing of this precaution we have a example in roman history when the officer of the two legion who as have already be mention be leave behind to defend the capuan from the samnite conspire together against the capuan for on rumor of this conspiracy reach rome rutilius the new consul be charge to see to it who not to excite the suspicion of the conspirator publicly give out that by order of the senate the capuan legion be continue in they station the conspirator believe this and think they would have ample time to execute they plan make no effort to hasten matter but remain at they ease until they find that the consul be move one of the two legion to a distance from the other this arouse they suspicion lead they to disclose they design and endeavor to carry they out now we could have no more instructive example than this in whatever way we look at it for it show how slow man be to move in those matter wherein time seem of little importance and how active they become when necessity urge they nor can a prince or commonwealth desire for they own end to retard the execution of a conspiracy use any more effectual means to do so than by artfully hold out to the conspirator some special opportunity as likely soon to present itself await which and believe they have time and to spare for what they have to do they will afford that prince or commonwealth all the leisure need to prepare for they punishment whosoever neglect these precaution hasten he own destruction as happen with the duke of athen and with guglielmo de ' pazzus for the duke who have make himself tyrant of florence on learn that he be be conspire against without further inquiry into the matter cause one of the conspirator to be seize whereupon the rest at once arm themselves and deprive he of he government guglielmo again be commissary in the val di chiana in the year 1501 and learn that a conspiracy be be hatch in arezzo to take the town from the florentine and give it over to the vitellus repair thither with all haste and without provide himself with the necessary force or give a think to the strength of the conspirator on the advice of the bishop he son have one of they arrest which become know to the other they forthwith rush to arm and take the town from the florentine make guglielmo they prisoner where however conspiracy be weak they may and should be put down without scruple or hesitation two method somewhat oppose to one another which have occasionally be follow in deal with conspiracy be in no way to be commend one of these be that adopt by the duke of athen of whom i have just now speak who to have it think that he confide in the goodwill of the florentine cause a certain man who give information of a plot against he to be put to death the other be that follow by dion the syracusan who to sound the intention of one whom he suspect arrange with calippus whom he trust to pretend to get up a conspiracy against he neither of these tyrant reap any advantage from the course he follow for the one discourage informer and give heart to those who be dispose to conspire the other prepare a easy road to he own death or rather be prime mover in a conspiracy against himself as the event show for calippus have free leave to plot against dion plot to such effect that he deprive he at once of he state and life -lrb- footnote 1 : _ tac hist _ iv 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ad generum cereri sine caede et vulnere pauci descendunt rege et sicca morte tiranni _ juv sit _ x 112 -rrb- chapter vii -- _ why it be that change from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom be sometimes make without bloodshed but at other time reek with blood _ since we find from history that in the countless change which have be make from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom sometimes a infinite multitude have perish while at other not a soul have suffer -lrb- as when rome make she change from king to consul on which occasion none be banish save tarquin and no harm be do to any other -rrb- it may perhaps be ask how it happen that of these revolution some have be attend by bloodshed and other not the answer i take to be this the government which suffer change either have or have not have its beginning in violence and since the government which have its beginning in violence must start by inflict injury on many it must need happen that on its downfall those who be injure will desire to avenge themselves from which desire for vengeance the slaughter and death of many will result but when a government originate with and derive its authority from the whole community there be no reason why the community if it withdraw that authority should seek to injure any except the prince from whom it withdraw it now the government of rome be of this nature and the expulsion of the tarquin take place in this way of a like character be the government of the medicus in florence and accordingly upon they overthrow in the year 1494 no injury be do to any save themselves in such case therefore the change i speak of do not occasion any very great danger but the change work by man who have wrong to revenge be always of a most dangerous kind and such to say the least as may well cause dismay in the mind of those who read of they but since history abound with instance of such change i need say no more about they chapter viii -- _ that he who would effect change in a commonwealth must give heed to its character and condition _ i have say before that a bad citizen can not work grave mischief in a commonwealth which have not become corrupted this opinion be not only support by the argument already advance but be further confirm by the example of spurius cassius and manlius capitolinus for spurius be ambitious and desire to obtain extraordinary authority in rome and to win over the people by load they with benefit -lrb- as for instance by sell they those land which the roman have take from the hernicus -rrb- he design be see through by the senate and lay he under such suspicion that when in harangue the people he offer they the money realize by the sale of the grain bring from sicily at the public expense they would have none of it believe that he offer it as the price of they freedom now have the people be corrupt they would not have refuse this bribe but would have open rather than close the way to the tyranny the example of manlius be still more striking for in he case we see what excellent gift both of mind and body and what splendid service to he country be afterwards cancel by that shameful eagerness to reign which we find breed in he by he jealousy of the honor pay camillus for so darkened do he mind become that without reflect what be the institution to which rome be accustomed or test the material he have to work on when he would have see that it be still unfit to be mould to evil end he set himself to stir up tumult against the senate and against the law of he country and herein we recognize the excellence of this city of rome and of the material whereof it be compose for although the noble be wont to stand up stoutly for one another not one of they stir to succor manlius and not one of he kinsfolk make any effort on he behalf so that although it be customary in the case of other accuse person for they friend to put on black and sordid raiment with all the other outward sign of grief in order to excite pity for the accuse none be see to do any of these thing for manlius even the tribune of the people though constantly ready to promote whatever course seem to favor the popular cause and the more vehemently the more they seem to make against the noble in this instance side with the noble to put down the common enemy nay the very people themselves keenly alive to they own interest and well disposed towards any attempt to damage the noble though they show manlius many proof of they regard nevertheless when he be cite by the tribune to appear before they and submit he cause for they decision assume the part of judge and not of defender and without scruple or hesitation sentence he to die wherefore i think that there be no example in the whole roman history which serve so well as this to demonstrate the virtue of all rank in that republic for not a man in the whole city bestir himself to shield a citizen endowed with every great quality and who both publicly and privately have do so much that deserve praise but in all the love of country outweigh every other thought and all look less to he past desert than to the danger which he present conduct threaten from which to relieve themselves they put he to death _ such _ say livius _ be the fate of a man worthy we admiration have he not be bear in a free state _ and here two point should be note the first that glory be to be seek by different method in a corrupt city and in one which still preserve its freedom the second which hardly differ from the first that in they action and especially in matter of moment man must have regard to time and circumstance and adapt themselves thereto for those person who from a unwise choice or from natural inclination run counter to the time will for the most part live unhappily and find all they undertake issue in failure whereas those who accommodate themselves to the time be fortunate and successful and from the passage cite we may plainly infer that have manlius live in the day of marius and syllum when the body of the state have become corrupt so that he could have impress it with the stamp of he ambition he might have have the same success as they have and as those other have who after they aspire to absolute power and conversely that if syllum and marius have live in the day of manlius they must have break down at the very beginning of they attempt for one man by mischievous art and measure may easily prepare the ground for the universal corruption of a city but no one man in he lifetime can carry that corruption so far as himself to reap the harvest or grant that one man 's life might be long enough for this purpose it would be impossible for he have regard to the ordinary habit of man who grow impatient and can not long forego the gratification of they desire to wait until the corruption be complete moreover man deceive themselves in respect of they own affair and most of all in respect of those on which they be most bent so that either from impatience or from self-deception they rush upon undertaking for which the time be not ripe and so come to a ill end wherefore to obtain absolute authority in a commonwealth and to destroy its liberty you must find the body of the state already corrupt and corrupt by a gradual waste continue from generation to generation which indeed take place necessarily unless as have be already explain the state be often reinforce by good example or bring back to its first beginning by wise law manlius therefore would have be a rare and renowned man have he be bear in a corrupt city and from he example we see that citizen seek to introduce change in the form of they government whether in favor of liberty or despotism ought to consider what material they have to deal with and then judge of the difficulty of they task for it be no less arduous and dangerous to attempt to free a people dispose to live in servitude than to enslave a people who desire to live free and because it have be say above that in they action man must take into account the character of the time in which they live and guide themselves accordingly i shall treat this point more fully in the follow chapter chapter ix -- _ that to enjoy constant good fortune we must change with the time _ i have repeatedly note that the good or bad fortune of man depend on whether they method of act accord with the character of the time for we see that in what they do some man act impulsively other warily and with caution and because from inability to preserve the just mean they in both of these way overstep the true limit they commit mistake in one direction or the other he however will make fewest mistake and may expect to prosper most who while follow the course to which nature incline he find as i have say he method of act in accordance with the time in which he live all know that in he command of the roman army fabius maximus display a prudence and caution very different from the audacity and hardihood natural to he countryman and it be he good fortune that he method suit with the time for hannibal come into italy in all the flush of youth and recent success have already by two defeat strip rome of she best soldier and fill she with dismay nothing could have be more fortunate for that republic than to find a general able by he deliberateness and caution to keep the enemy at bay nor on the other hand could fabius have fall upon time better suit to the method which he use and by which he crown himself with glory that he act in accordance with he natural bent and not from a reason choice we may gather from this that when scipio to bring the war to a end propose to pass with he army into africa fabius unable to depart from he characteristic method and habit strenuously oppose he so that have it rest with he hannibal might never have leave italy for he perceive not that the time have change and that with they it be necessary to change the method of prosecute the war have fabius therefore be king of rome he might well have cause the war to end unhappily not know how to accommodate he method to the change in the time as it be he live in a commonwealth in which there be many citizen and many different disposition and which as it produce a fabius excellent at a time when it be necessary to protract hostility so also afterwards give birth to a scipio at a time suit to bring they to a successful close and hence it come that a commonwealth endure longer and have a more sustained good fortune than a princedom because from the diversity in the character of its citizen it can adapt itself better than a prince can to the diversity of time for as i have say before a man accustom to follow one method will never alter it whence it must need happen that when time change so as no longer to accord with he method he will be ruin piero soderinus of whom i have already speak be guide in all he action by patience and gentleness and he and he country prosper while the time be in harmony with these method but afterwards when a time come when it behove he to have do with patience and gentleness he know not how to drop they and be ruin together with he country pope julius ii throughout the whole of he pontificate be govern by impulse and passion and because the time be in perfect accord all he undertaking prosper but have other time come require other quality he could not have escape destruction since he could not have change he method nor he habitual line of conduct as to why such change be impossible two reason may be give one be that we can not act in opposition to the bent of we nature the other that when a man have be very successful while follow a particular method he can never be convince that it be for he advantage to try some other and hence it result that a man 's fortune vary because time change and he do not change with they so too with commonwealth which as we have already show at length be ruin from not alter they institution to suit the time and commonwealth be slower to change than prince be change cost they more effort because occasion must be wait for which shall stir the whole community and it be not enough that a single citizen alter he method of act but since i have make mention of fabius maximus who wear out hannibal by keep he at bay i think it opportune to consider in the follow chapter whether a general who desire to engage he enemy at all risk can be prevent by that enemy from do so chapter x -- _ that a captain can not escape battle when he enemy force it on he at all risk _ _ cneius sulpitius when appoint dictator against the gaul be unwilling to tempt fortune by attack a enemy whom delay and a disadvantageous position would every day render weaker protracted the war _ when a mistake be make of a sort that all or most man be likely to fall into i think it not amiss to mark it again and again with disapproval wherefore although i have already show repeatedly how in affair of moment the action of the modern conform not to those of antiquity still it seem to I not superfluous in this place to say the same thing once more for if in any particular the modern have deviate from the method of the ancient it be especially in they method of warfare wherein not one of those rule formerly so much esteem be now attend to and this because both prince and commonwealth have devolve the charge of such matter upon other and to escape danger have keep aloof from all military service so that although one or another of the prince of we time may occasionally be see present in person with he army we be not therefore to expect from he any further praiseworthy behavior for even where such personage take part in any warlike enterprise they do so out of ostentation and from no nobler motive though doubtless from sometimes see they soldier face to face and from retain to themselves the title of command they be likely to make fewer blunder than we find make by republic and most of all by the republic of italy which though altogether dependent upon other and themselves utterly ignorant of everything relate to warfare do yet that they may figure as the commander of they army take upon they to direct they movement and in do so commit countless mistake some of which have be consider elsewhere but one be of such importance as to deserve notice here when these sluggard prince or effeminate republic send forth any of they captain it seem to they that the wisest instruction they can give he be to charge he on no account to give battle but on the contrary to do what he can to avoid fight wherein they imagine themselves to imitate the prudence of fabius maximus who by protract the war with hannibal save the roman commonwealth not perceive that in most instance such advice to a captain be either useless or hurtful for the truth of the matter be that a captain who would keep the field can not decline battle when he adversary force it on he at all hazard so that the instruction to avoid battle be but tantamount to say you shall engage when it please you enemy and not when it suit yourself for if you would keep the field and yet avoid battle the only safe course be to interpose a distance of at least fifty mile between you and you enemy and afterwards to maintain so vigilant a look-out that should he advance you will have time to make you retreat another method be to shut yourself up in some town but both of these method be extremely disadvantageous for by follow the former you leave you country a prey to the enemy and a valiant prince would far sooner risk the chance of battle than prolong a war in a manner so disastrous to he subject while by adopt the latter method and shut yourself up in a town with you army there be manifest danger of you be besiege and presently reduce by famine and force to surrender wherefore it be most mischievous to seek to avoid battle in either of these two way to intrench yourself in a strong position as fabius be wont to do be a good method when you army be so formidable that the enemy dare not advance to attack you in you intrenchment yet it can not truly be say that fabius avoid battle but rather that he seek to give battle where he could do so with advantage for have hannibal desire to fight fabius would have wait for he and fight he but hannibal never dare to engage he on he own ground so that a engagement be avoid as much by hannibal as by fabius since if either have be mind to fight at all hazard the other would have be constrain to take one of three course that be to say one or other of the two just now mention or else to retreat the truth of this be confirm by numberless example and more particularly by what happen in the war wage by the roman against philip of macedon the father of perseus for philip be invade by the roman resolve not to give they battle and to avoid battle seek at first to do as fabius have do in italy post himself on the summit of a hill where he intrench himself strongly think that the roman would not venture to attack he there but they advance and attack he in he intrenchment drive he from he position when unable to make further resistance he flee with the greater part of he army and be only save from utter destruction by the difficulty of the ground which make it impossible for the roman to pursue he philip therefore who have no mind to fight encamp too near the roman be force to fly and learn from this experience that to escape fight it be not enough for he to intrench himself on a hill yet not choose to shut himself up in a walled town he be constrain to take the other alternative of keep at a distance of many mile from the roman legion accordingly when the roman enter one province he betake himself to another and when they leave a province he enter it but perceive that by protract the war in this way he condition grow constantly worse while he subject suffer grievously now from he own troops at another time from those of the enemy he at last resolve to hazard battle and so come to a regular engagement with the roman it be for you interest therefore not to fight when you possess the same advantage as fabius or as cneius sulpitius have in other word when you army be so formidable in itself that the enemy dare not attack you in you intrenchment and although he have get within you territory have yet gain no footing there and suffer in consequence from the want of necessary supplies in such circumstance delay be useful for the reason assign by titus livius when speaking of sulpitius in no other circumstance however can a engagement be avoid without dishonor or danger for to retire as philip do be nothing else than defeat and the disgrace be greater in proportion as you valor have be less put to the proof and if philip be lucky enough to escape another not similarly favor by the nature of the ground might not have the same good fortune that hannibal be not a master in the art of warfare there be none will venture to maintain wherefore when he have to encounter scipio in africa it may be assume that have he see any advantage in prolong the war he would have do so and possibly be a skilful captain and in command of a valiant army he might have be able to do what fabius do in italy but since he take not that course we may infer that he be move by sufficient reason for the captain who have get a army together and perceive that from want of money or friend he can not maintain it long must be a mere madman if he do not at once and before he army melt away try the fortune of battle since he be certain to lose by delay while by fight he may chance to succeed and there be this also to be keep in view that we must strive even if we be defeat to gain glory and that more glory be to be win in be beat by force than in a defeat from any other cause and this we may suppose to have weigh with hannibal on the other hand suppose hannibal to have decline battle scipio even if he have lack courage to follow he up and attack he in he intrenched camp would not have suffer thereby for as he have defeat syphax and get possession of many of the african town he could have rest where he be in the same security and with the same convenience as if he have be in italy but this be not the case with hannibal when he have to encounter fabius nor with the gaul when they be oppose to sulpitius least of all can he decline battle who invade with he army the country of another for seek to enter he enemy 's country he must fight whenever the enemy come forward to meet he and be under still greater necessity to fight if he undertake the siege of any town as happen in we own day with duke charle of burgundy who when beleaguer morat a town of the swiss be by they attack and route or as happen with the french army encamp against novara which be in like manner defeat by the swiss chapter xi -- _ that one who have to contend with many though he be weaker than they will prevail if he can withstand they first onset _ the power exercise in rome by the tribune of the people be great and as i have repeatedly explain be necessary since otherwise there would have be no check on the ambition of the noble and the commonwealth must have grow corrupted far sooner than it do but because as i have say elsewhere there be in everything a latent evil peculiar to it give rise to new mischance it become necessary to provide against these by new ordinance the authority of the tribune therefore be insolently assert so as to become formidable to the nobility and to the entire city disorder dangerous to the liberty of the state must thence have result have not a method be devise by appius claudius for control the ambition of the tribune this be to secure that there should always be one of they number timid or venal or else a lover of the general good who could be influence to oppose the rest whenever these seek to pass any measure contrary to the wish of the senate this remedy be a great restraint on the excessive authority of the tribune and on many occasion prove serviceable to rome i be lead by this circumstance to remark that when many powerful person be unite against one who although no match for the other collectively be also powerful the chance be more in favor of this single and less i powerful person than of the many who together be much stronger for set aside a infinity of accident which can be turn to better account by one than by many it will always happen that by exercise a little dexterity the one will be able to divide the many and weaken the force which be strong while it be unite in proof whereof i shall not refer to ancient example though many such might be cite but content myself with certain modern instance take from the event of we own time in the year 1484 all italy combine against the venetian who find they position desperate and be unable to keep they army any longer in the field bribe signer lodovico who then govern milan and so succeed in effect a settlement whereby they not only recover the town they have lose but also obtain for themselves a part of the territory of ferrara so that those be by peace the gainer who in war have be the loser not many year ago the whole world be band together against france but before the war come to a close spain break with the confederate and enter into a separate treaty with france the other member of the league also be presently force to make term wherefore we may always assume when we see a war set on foot by many against one that this one if he have strength to withstand the first shock and can temporize and wait he opportunity be certain to prevail but unless he can do this he run a thousand danger : as do the venetian in the year 1508 who could they have temporize with the french and so get time to conciliate some of those who have combine against they might have escape the ruin which then overtake they but not possess such a strong army as would have enable they to temporize with they enemy and consequently not have the time need for gain any to they side they be undo yet we know that the pope as soon as he have obtain what he want make friend with they and that spain do the like and that both the one and the other of these power would gladly have save the lombard territory for themselves nor would if they could have help it have leave it to france so as to augment she influence in italy the venetian therefore should have give up a part to save the rest and have they do so at a time when the surrender would not have seem to be make under compulsion and before any step have be take in the direction of war it would have be a most prudent course although discreditable and probably of little avail after war have be begin but until the war break out few of the venetian citizen recognize the danger fewer still the remedy and none venture to prescribe it but to return to the point whence we start i say that the same safeguard for they country which the roman senate find against the ambition of the tribune in they number be within the reach of the prince who be attack by many adversary if he only know to use prudently those method which promote division chapter xii -- _ a prudent captain will do what he can to make it necessary for he own soldier to fight and to relieve he enemy from that necessity _ elsewhere i have note how greatly man be govern in what they do by necessity and how much of they renown be due to she guidance so that it have even be say by some philosopher that the hand and tongue of man the two noblest instrument of they fame would never have work to perfection nor have bring they labor to that pitch of excellence we see they to have reach have they not be impel by this cause the captain of antiquity therefore know the virtue of this necessity and see the steadfast courage which it give they soldier in battle spare no effort to bring they army under its influence while use all they address to loosen its hold upon they enemy for which reason they would often leave open to a adversary some way which they might have close and close against they own man some way they might have leave open whosoever therefore would have a city defend itself stubbornly or a army fight resolutely in the field must before all thing endeavor to impress the mind of those whom he command with the belief that no other course be open to they in like manner a prudent captain who undertake the attack of a city will measure the ease or difficulty of he enterprise by know and consider the nature of the necessity which compel the inhabitant to defend it and where he find that necessity to be strong he may infer that he task will be difficult but if otherwise that it will be easy and hence it happen that city be harder to be recover after a revolt than to be take for the first time because on a first attack have no occasion to fear punishment since they have give no ground of offence they readily surrender but when they have revolt they know that they have give ground of offence and fear punishment be not so easily bring under a like stubbornness grow from the natural hostility with which prince or republic who be neighbor regard one another which again be cause by the desire to dominate over those who live near or from jealousy of they power this be more particularly the case with republic as in tuscany for example for contention and rivalry have always make and always will make it extremely hard for one republic to bring another into subjection and for this reason any one who consider attentively who be the neighbor of florence and who of venice will not marvel so much as some have do that florence should have spend more than venice on she war and gain less since this result entirely from the venetian find they neighbouring town less obstinate in they resistance than the florentine theirs for all the town in the neighborhood of venice have be use to live under prince and not in freedom and those who be use to servitude commonly think little of change master nay be often eager for the change in this way venice though she have have more powerful neighbor than florence have be able from find they town less stubborn to subdue they more easily than the latter surround exclusively by free city have have it in she power to do but to return to the matter in hand the captain who attack a town should use what care he can not to drive the defender to extremity lest he render they stubborn but when they fear punishment should promise they pardon and when they fear for they freedom should assure they that he have no design against the common welfare but only against a few ambitious man in they city for such assurance have often smooth the way to the surrender of town and although pretext of this sort be easily see through especially by the wise the mass of the people be often beguile by they because desire present tranquillity they shut they eye to the snare hide behind these specious promise by means such as these therefore city innumerable have be bring into subjection as recently be the case with florence the ruin of crassus and he army be similarly cause : for although he himself see through the empty promise of the parthian as mean only to blind the roman soldier to the necessity of defend themselves yet he could not keep he man steadfast they as we clearly gather in read the life of this captain be deceive by the offer of peace hold out to they by they enemy on the other hand when the samnite who at the instance of a few ambitious man and in violation of the term of the truce make with they have overrun and pillage land belong to the ally of rome afterwards send envoy to rome to implore peace offering to restore whatever they have take and to surrender the author of these injury and outrage as prisoner and these offer be reject by the roman and the envoy return to samnium bring with they no hope of a adjustment claudius pontius who then command the army of the samnite show they in a remarkable speech that the roman desire war at all hazard and declare that although for the sake of he country he wish for peace necessity constrain he to prepare for war tell they _ that be a just war which could not be escape and those arm sacred in which lay they only hope _ and building on this necessity he raise in the mind of he soldier a confident expectation of success that i may not have to revert to this matter again it will be convenient to notice here those example from roman history which most merit attention when caius manilius be in command of the legion encamp against veius a division of the veientine army have get within the roman intrenchment manilius run forward with a company of he man to defend they and to prevent the escape of the veientine guard all the approach to the camp the veientine find themselves thus shut in begin to fight with such fury that they slew manilius and would have destroy all the rest of the roman army have not the prudence of one of the tribune open a way for the veientine to retreat here we see that so long as necessity compel the veientine fight most fiercely but on find a path open for escape prefer flight to combat on another occasion when the volscian and equian pass with they army across the roman frontier the consul be send out to oppose they and a engagement ensue it so happen that when the combat be at its height the army of the volscian command by vectius mescius suddenly find themselves shut in between they own camp which a division of the roman have occupy and the body of the roman army when see that they must either perish or cut a way for themselves with they sword vectius say to they _ come on my man here be no wall or rampart to be scale : we fight man with man in valor we be they equal and necessity that last and mightiest weapon give we the advantage _ here then necessity be speak of by titus livius as _ the last and mightiest weapon _ camillus the wisest and most prudent of all the roman commander when he have get within the town of veius with he army to make its surrender easier and not to drive its inhabitant to desperation call out to he man so that the veientine might hear to spare all whom they find unarmed whereupon the defender throw away they weapon the town be take almost without bloodshed and this device be afterwards follow by many other captain chapter xiii -- _ whether we may trust more to a valiant captain with a weak army or to a valiant army with a weak captain _ coriolanus be banish from rome betook himself to the volscian and when he have get together a army wherewith to avenge himself on he countryman come back to rome yet again withdraw not constrain to retire by the might of the roman arm but out of reverence for he mother from this incident say titus livius we may learn that the spread of the roman power be due more to the valor of she captain than of she soldier for before this the volscian have always be route and only grow successful when coriolanus become they captain but though livius be of this opinion there be many passage in he history to show that the roman soldier even when leave without leader often perform astonishing feat of valor nay sometimes maintain better discipline and fight with greater spirit after they consul be slay than they have before for example the army under the scipio in spain after its two leader have fall be able by its valor not merely to secure its own safety but to overcome the enemy and preserve the province for the roman republic so that to state the case fairly we find many instance in which the valor of the soldier alone gain the day as well as many in which success be wholly due to the excellence of the captain from which it may be infer that the one stand in need of the other and here the question suggest itself : which be the more formidable a good army badly lead or a good captain command a indifferent army though be we to adopt the opinion of cæsar on this head we ought lightly to esteem both for when cæsar go to spain against afranius and petreius who be there in command of a strong army he make little account of they say _ that he go to fight a army without a captain _ indicate thereby the weakness of these general and conversely when he go to encounter pompeius in thessaly he say _ i go against a captain without a army _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- a further question may also be raise whether it be easier for a good captain to make a good army or for a good army to make a good captain as to this it might be think there be barely room for doubt since it ought to be far easier for many who be good to find one who be good or teach he to become so than for one who be good to find or make many good lucullus when send against mithridate be wholly without experience in war : but he brave army which be provide with many excellent officer speedily teach he to be a good captain on the other hand when the roman be badly off for soldier arm a number of slave and give they over to be drill by sempronius gracchus he in a short time make they into a serviceable army so too as i have already mention pelopida and epaminonda after rescue thebe they native city from spartan thraldom in a short time make such valiant soldier of the theban peasantry as to be able with they aid not only to withstand but even to defeat the spartan army so that the question may seem to be equally balanced excellence on one side generally find excellence on the other a good army however when leave without a good leader as the macedonian army be on the death of alexander or as those veteran be who have fight in the civil war be apt to grow restless and turbulent wherefore i be convince that it be better to trust to the captain who have time allow he to discipline he man and mean wherewith to equip they than to a tumultuary host with a chance leader of its own choosing but twofold be the merit and twofold the glory of those captain who not only have have to subdue they enemy but also before encounter they to organize and discipline they force this however be a task require quality so seldom combine that be many of those captain who now enjoy a great name with the world call on to perform it they would be much less thought of than they be -lrb- footnote 1 : professus ante inter suo ire se ad exercitum sine duce et inde reversurum ad ducem sine exercitu -lrb- _ suet in vita j cae _ -rrb- -rrb- chapter xiv -- _ of the effect produce in battle by strange and unexpected sight or sound _ that the disorder occasion by strange and unexpected sight or sound may have momentous consequence in combat might be show by many instance but by none better than by what befall in the battle fight between the roman and the volscian when quintius the roman general see one wing of he army begin to waver shout aloud to he man to stand firm for the other wing be already victorious which word of he give confidence to he own troops and strike the enemy with dismay win he the battle but if a cry like this produce great effect on a well disciplined army far greater must be its effect on one which be ill disciplined and disorderly for by such a wind the whole mass will be move as i shall show by a well-known instance happen in we own time a few year ago the city of perugium be split into the two faction of the baglionus and the oddus the former hold the government the latter be in exile the oddeschus however with the help of friend have get together a armed force which they lodge in village of they own near perugium obtain by the favor of some of they party a entrance into the city by night and move forward without discovery come as far as the public square and as all the street of perugium be bar with chain draw across they at they corner the oddeschus have in front of they a man who carry a iron hammer wherewith to break the fastening of the chain so that horseman might pass when the only chain remain unbroken be that which close the public square the alarm have now be give the hammerman be so impede by the crowd press behind he that he could not raise he arm to strike freely whereupon to get more room for he work he call aloud to the other to stand back and the word back pass from rank to rank those furthest off begin to run and presently the other also with such precipitancy that they fall into utter disorder in this way and from this trifling circumstance the attempt of the oddeschus come to nothing here we may note that discipline be need in a army not so much to enable it to fight accord to a settle order as that it may not be throw into confusion by every insignificant accident for a tumultuary host be useless in war simply because every word or cry or sound may throw it into a panic and cause it to fly wherefore it behove a good captain to provide that certain fixed person shall receive he order and pass they on to the rest and to accustom he soldier to look to these person and to they only to be inform what he order be for whenever this precaution be neglect the gravest mishap be constantly see to ensue as regard strange and unexpected sight every captain should endeavor while he army be actually engage with the enemy to effect some such feint or diversion as will encourage he own man and dismay he adversary since this of all thing that can happen be the likeliest to ensure victory in evidence whereof we may cite the example of cneius sulpitius the roman dictator who when about to give battle to the gaul after arm he sutler and camp follower mount they on mule and other beast of burden furnish they with spear and banner to look like cavalry and place they behind a hill order they on a give signal when the fight be at the hottest to appear and show themselves to the enemy all which be carry out as he have arrange throw the gaul into such alarm that they lose the battle a good captain therefore have two thing to see to : first to contrive how by some sudden surprise he may throw he enemy into confusion and next to be prepare should the enemy use a like stratagem against he to discover and defeat it as the stratagem of semirami be defeat by the king of indium for semiramis see that this king have elephant in great number to dismay he by show that she too be well supply cause the skin of many ox and buffalo to be sew together in the shape of elephant and place upon camel and send to the front but the trick be detect by the king turn out not only useless but hurtful to its contriver in a battle which the dictator mamercus fight against the people of fidenae the latter to strike terror into the mind of the roman contrived that while the combat rage a number of soldier should issue from fidenae bear lance tip with fire thinking that the roman disturb by so strange a sight would be throw into confusion we be to note however with regard to such contrivance that if they be to serve any useful end they should _ be _ formidable as well as _ seem _ so for when they menace a real danger they weak point be not so soon discern when they have more of pretence than reality it will be well either to dispense with they altogether or resort to they to keep they like the muleteer of sulpitius in the background so that they be not too readily find out for any weakness inherent in they be soon discover if they be bring near when as happen with the elephant of semiramis and the fiery spear of the man of fidenae they do harm rather than good for although by this last-mentioned device the roman at the first be somewhat disconcerted so soon as the dictator come up and begin to chide they ask if they be not ashamed to fly like bee from smoke and call on they to turn on they enemy and _ with she own flame efface that fidena whom they benefit could not conciliate _ they take courage so that the device prove of no service to its contriver who be vanquish in the battle chapter xv -- _ that one and not many should head a army : and why it be harmful to have more leader than one _ the man of fidenae rise against the colonist whom the roman have settle among they and put they to the sword the roman to avenge the insult appoint four tribune with consular power : one of whom they retain to see to the defense of rome while the other three be send against the fidenatus and the veientine but these three fall out among themselves and be divide in they counsel return from they mission with discredit though not with loss of which discredit they be themselves the cause that they sustain no loss be due to the valor of they soldier but the senate perceive the source of the mischief to the end that one man might put to rights what three have throw into confusion resort to the appointment of a dictator here we see the disadvantage of have several leader in one army or in a town which have to defend itself and the case could not be put in clearer word than by titus livius where he say _ the three tribune with consular authority give proof how hurtful it be in war to have many leader for each form a different opinion and each abide by he own they throw opportunity in the way of they enemy _ and though this example suffice by itself to show the disadvantage in war of divide command to make the matter still plainer i shall cite two further instance one ancient and one modern in the year 1500 loui xii of france after recover milan send troops to restore pisa to the florentine giovambattista ridolfus and luca d'antonio albizzus go with they as commissary now because giovambattista have a great name and be older than luca the latter leave the whole management of everything to he and although he do not show he jealousy of he by oppose he he betray it by he silence and by be so careless and indifferent about everything that he give no help in the business of the siege either by word or deed just as though he have be a person of no account but when in consequence of a accident giovambattista have to return to florence all this be change for luca remain in sole charge behave with the greatest courage prudence and zeal all which quality have be hide while he hold a joint command further to bear I out i shall again borrow the word of titus livius who in relate how when quintius and agrippa he colleague be send by the roman against the equian agrippa contrived that the conduct of the war should rest with quintius observe _ most wholesome be it that in affair of great moment supreme authority be vest in one man _ very different however be the course follow by the republic and prince of we own day who think to be better serve be use to appoint several captain or commissioner to fill one command a practice give rise to so much confusion that be we seek for the cause of the overthrow of the french and italian army in recent time we should find this to be the most active of any rightly therefore may we conclude that in send forth a army upon service it be wiser to entrust it to one man of ordinary prudence than to two of great part but with a divide command chapter xvi -- _ that in time of difficulty true worth be seek after whereas in quiet time it be not the most deserving but those who be recommend by wealth or connection who be most in favor _ it always have happen and always will that the great and admirable man of a republic be neglect in peaceful time because at such season many citizen be find who envy the reputation these man have justly earn seek to be regard not merely as they equal but as they superior touch this there be a notable passage in thucydide the greek historian where he tell how the republic of athen come victorious out of the peloponessian war wherein she have bridle the pride of sparta and bring almost the whole of greece under she authority be encourage by the greatness of she renown to propose to herself the conquest of sicily in athen this scheme be much debate alcibiade and certain other who have the public welfare very little in they thought but who hope that the enterprise be they place in command might minister to they fame recommend that it should be undertake nicia on the other hand one of the best esteem of the athenian citizen be against it and in address the people give it as the strongest reason for trust he advice that in advise they not to engage in this war he urge what be not for he own advantage for he know that while athen remain at peace numberless citizen be ready to take precedence of he : whereas be war declare he be certain that none would rank before he or even be look upon as he equal here we see that in tranquil time republic be subject to the infirmity of lightly esteem they worthiest citizen and this offend these person for two reason : first because they be not give the place they deserve and second because they see unworthy man and of ability inferior to they own as much or more consider than they injustice such as this have cause the ruin of many republic for citizen who find themselves undeservedly slight and perceive the cause to be that the time be tranquil and not trouble will strive to change the time by stir up war hurtful to the public welfare when i look for remedy for this state of thing i find two : first to keep the citizen poor so that wealth without worth shall corrupt neither they nor other second to be so prepared for war as always to be ready to make war for then there will always be a need for worthy citizen as be the case in rome in early time for as rome constantly keep she army in the field there be constant opportunity for man to display they valor nor be it possible to deprive a deserving man of he post and give it to another who be not deserving or if ever this be do by inadvertency or by way of experiment there forthwith result such disorder and danger that the city at once retrace its step and revert to the true path but other republic which be not regulate on the same plan and make war only when drive to it by necessity can not help commit this injustice nay will constantly run into it when if the great citizen who find himself slight be vindictive and have some credit and follow in the city disorder will always ensue and though rome escape this danger for a time she too as have elsewhere be say have no longer after she have conquer carthage and antiochus any fear of war come to think she might commit she army to whom she would make less account of the valor of she captain than of those other quality which gain favor with the people accordingly we find paulus emilius reject oftener than once when he seek the consulship nor in fact obtain it until the macedonian war break out which be judge a formidable business be by the voice of the whole city commit to he management after the year 1494 we city of florence be involve in a series of war in conduct which none of we citizen have any success until chance throw the command into the hand of one who show we how a army should be lead this be antonio giacominus and so long as there be dangerous war on foot all rivalry on the part of other citizen be suspend and whenever a captain or commissary have to be appoint he be unopposed but when a war come to be undertake as to the issue of which no misgiving be feel and which promise both honor and preferment so numerous be the competitor for command that three commissary have to be choose to conduct the siege of pisa antonio be leave out and though it can not with certainty be show that any harm result to we republic from he not have be send on this enterprise we may reasonably conjecture that such be indeed the case for as the people of pisa be then without means either for subsistence or defense it may be believe that have antonio be there he would have reduce they to such extremity as would have force they to surrender at discretion to the florentine but pisa be besiege by captain who know neither how to blockade nor how to storm it hold out so long that the florentine who should have reduce it by force be oblige to buy its submission neglect like this might well move antonio to resentment and he must need have be both very patient and very forgiving if he feel no desire to revenge himself when he could by the ruin of the city or by injury to individual citizen but a republic should beware not to rouse such feeling as i shall show in the follow chapter chapter xvii -- _ that we be not to offend a man and then send he to fill a important office or command _ a republic should think twice before appoint to a important command a citizen who have sustain notable wrong at the hand of he fellow-citizen claudius nero quit the army with which he be oppose hannibal go with a part of he force into the march of ancona design to join the other consul there and after join he to attack hasdrubal before he come up with he brother now claudius have previously command against hasdrubal in spain and after drive he with he army into such a position that it seem he must either fight at a disadvantage or perish by famine have be outwit by he adversary who while divert he attention with proposal of term contrived to slip through he hand and rob he of the opportunity for effect he destruction this become know in rome bring claudius into so much discredit both with the senate and people that to he great mortification and displeasure he be slightingly speak of by the whole city but be afterwards make consul and send to oppose hannibal he take the course mention above which be in itself so hazardous that all rome be fill with doubt and anxiety until tiding come of hasdrubal 's defeat when subsequently ask why he have play so dangerous a game wherein without urgent necessity he have stake the very existence of rome claudius answer he have do so because he know that be he to succeed he would recover whatever credit he have lose in spain while if he fail and he attempt have a untoward issue he would be revenge on that city and on those citizen who have so ungratefully and indiscreetly wrong he but if resentment for a offence like this so deeply move a roman citizen at a time when rome be still uncorrupted we should consider how it may act on the citizen of a state not constitute as rome then be and because there be no certain remedy we can apply to such disorder when they arise in republic it follow that it be impossible to establish a republic which shall endure always since in a thousand unforeseen way ruin may overtake it chapter xviii -- _ that it be the highest quality of a captain to be able to forestall the design of he adversary _ it be a say of epaminonda the theban that nothing be so useful and necessary for a commander as to be able to see through the intention and design of he adversary and because it be hard to come at this knowledge directly the more credit be due to he who reach it by conjecture yet sometimes it be easier to fathom a enemy 's design than to construe he action and not so much those action which be do at a distance from we as those do in we presence and under we very eye for instance it have often happen that when a battle have last till nightfall the winner have believe himself the loser and the loser have believe himself the winner and that this mistake have lead he who make it to follow a course hurtful to himself it be from a mistake of this sort that brutus and cassius lose the battle of philippus for though brutus be victorious with he wing of the army cassius whose wing be beat believe the entire army to be defeat and under this belief give way to despair and slew himself so too in we own day in the battle fight by franci king of france with the swiss at santa cecilium in lombardy when night fall those of the swiss who remain unbroken not know that the rest have be route and slay thought they have the victory and so believe would not retreat but remain on the field renew the combat the follow morning to they great disadvantage nor be they the only sufferer from they mistake since the army of the pope and of spain be also mislead by it and well-nigh bring to destruction for on the false report of a victory they cross the po and have they only advance a little further must have be make prisoner by the victorious french a instance be record of a like mistake have be make in the camp both of the roman and of the equian for the consul sempronius be in command against the equian and give the enemy battle the engagement last with vary success till nightfall when as both army have suffer what be almost a defeat neither return to they camp but each draw off to the neighbor hill where they think they would be safer the roman separate into two division one of which with the consul the other with the centurion tempanius by whose valor the army have that day be save from utter rout at daybreak the consul without wait for further tiding of the enemy make straight for rome and the equian in like manner withdraw to they own country for as each suppose the other to be victorious neither think much of leave they camp to be plunder by the enemy it so chance however that tempanius who be himself retreat with the second division of the roman army fall in with certain wounded equian from whom he learn that they commander have flee abandon they camp on hearing which he at once return to the roman camp and secure it and then after sack the camp of the equian go back victorious to rome he success as we see turn entirely on he be the first to be inform of the enemy 's condition and here we be to note that it may often happen that both the one and the other of two opposed army shall fall into the same disorder and be reduce to the same strait in which case that which soonest detect the other 's distress be sure to come off best i shall give a instance of this which occur recently in we own country in the year 1498 when the florentine have a great army in the territory of pisa and have closely invest the town the venetian who have undertake its protection see no other way to save it resolve to make a diversion in its favor by attack the territory of the florentine in another quarter wherefore have assemble a strong force they enter tuscany by the val di lamona and seize on the village of marradus besiege the stronghold of castiglione which stand on the height above it get word of this the florentine seek to relieve marradus without weaken the army which lay round pisa they accordingly raise a new levy of foot-soldier and equip a fresh squadron of horse which they despatch to marradi under the joint command of jacopo iv d'appiano lord of piombino and count rinuccio of marciano these troops take up they position on the hill above marradus the venetian withdraw from the investment of castiglione and lodge themselves in the village but when the two army have confront one another for several day both begin to suffer sorely from want of victuals and other necessaries and neither of they daring to attack the other or know to what extremity the other be reduce both simultaneously resolve to strike they camp the following morning and to retreat the venetian towards berzighellum and faenza the florentine towards casaglium and the mugello but at daybreak when both army have begin to remove they baggage it so happen that a old woman whose year and poverty permit she to pass unnoticed leave the village of marradus come to the florentine camp where be certain of she kinsfolk whom she desire to visit learn from she that the venetian be in retreat the florentine commander take courage and change they plan go in pursuit of the enemy as though they have dislodge they send word to florence that they have repulse the venetian and gain a victory but in truth this victory be wholly due to they have notice of the enemy 's movement before the latter have notice of theirs for have that notice be give to the venetian first it would have work against we the same result as it actually work for we chapter xix -- _ whether indulgence or severity be more necessary for control a multitude _ the roman republic be distract by the feud of the noble and common nevertheless on war break out quintius and appius claudius be send forth in command of roman army from he harshness and severity to he soldier appius be so ill obey by they that after sustain what almost amount to a defeat he have to resign he command quintius on the contrary by kindly and humane treatment keep he man obedient and return victorious to rome from this it might seem that to govern a large body of man it be better to be humane than haughty and kindly rather than severe and yet cornelius tacitus with whom many other author be agree pronounce a contrary opinion where he say _ in govern a multitude it avail more to punish than to be compliant _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- if it be ask how these opposite view can be reconcile i answer that you exercise authority either over man use to regard you as they equal or over man who have always be subject to you when those over whom you exercise authority be you equal you can not trust wholly to punishment or to that severity of which tacitus speak and since in rome itself the common have equal weight with the noble none appoint they captain for a time only could control they by use harshness and severity accordingly we find that those roman captain who gain the love of they soldier and be considerate of they often achieve greater result than those who make themselves fear by they in a unusual degree unless like manlius torquatus these last be endow with consummate valor but he who have to govern subject such as those of whom tacitus speak to prevent they grow insolent and trample upon he by reason of he too great easiness must resort to punishment rather than to compliance still to escape hatred punishment should be moderate in degree for to make himself hate be never for the interest of any prince and to escape hatred a prince have chiefly to guard against tamper with the property of any of he subject for where nothing be to be gain by it no prince will desire to shed blood unless as seldom happen constrain to do so by necessity but where advantage be to be gain thereby blood will always flow and neither the desire to shed it nor cause for shed it will ever be want as i have fully show when discuss this subject in another treatise quintius therefore be more deserving of praise than appius nevertheless the opinion of tacitus duly restricted and not understand as apply to a case like that of appius merit approval but since i have speak of punishment and indulgence it seem not out of place to show how a single act of humanity avail more than arm with the citizen of falerius -lrb- footnote 1 : in multitudine regenda plus poena quam obsequium valet but compare annals iii 55 obsequium inde in principem et æmulandi amoi validioi quam poena ex legibus et metus -rrb- chapter xx -- _ how one humane act avail more with the man of falerius than all the might of the roman arm _ when the besiege army of the roman lay round falerius the master of a school wherein the best-born youth of the city be teach think to curry favor with camillus and the roman come forth from the town with these boy on pretence of give they exercise and bring they into the camp where camillus be present they to he say _ to ransom these that city would yield itself into you hand _ camillus however not only reject this offer but cause the schoolmaster to be strip and he hand tie behind he give each of the boy a scourge and bid they lead the fellow back to the town scourge he as they go when the citizen of falerius hear of this so much be they please with the humanity and integrity of camillus that they resolve to surrender they town to he without further defense this authentic instance may lead we to believe that a humane and kindly action may sometimes touch man 's mind more nearly than a harsh and cruel one and that those city and province into which the instrument and engine of war with every other violence to which man resort have fail to force a way may be throw open to a single act of tenderness mercy chastity or generosity whereof history supplies we with many example besides the one which i have just now notice for we find that when the arm of rome be powerless to drive pyrrhus out of italy he be move to depart by the generosity of fabritius in disclose to he the proposal which he slave have make the roman to poison he again we read how scipio gain less reputation in spain by the capture of new carthage than by he virtue in restore a young and beautiful wife unviolated to she husband the fame of which action win he the love of the whole province we see too how much this generous temper be esteem by a people in its great man and how much it be praise by historian and by those who write the life of prince as well as by those who lay down rule of human conduct among whom xenophon have take great pain to show what honor and victory and how fair a fame accrue to cyrus from he be kindly and gracious without taint of pride or cruelty or luxury or any other of those vice which cast a stain upon man 's life and yet when we note that hannibal by method wholly opposite to these achieve splendid victory and a great renown i think i be bind to say something in my next chapter as to how this happen chapter xxi -- _ how it happen that hannibal pursue a course contrary to that take by scipio work the same result in italy which the other achieve in spain _ some i suspect may marvel to find a captain take a contrary course nevertheless arrive at the same end as those who have pursue the method above speak of since it must seem as though success do not depend on the cause i have name nay that if glory and fame be to be win in other way these cause neither add to we strength nor advance we fortune wherefore to make my meaning plain and not to part company with the man of whom i have be speak i say that as on the one hand we see scipio enter spain and by he humane and generous conduct at once secure the good-will of the province and the admiration and reverence of its inhabitant so on the other hand we see hannibal enter italy and by method wholly opposite to wit by violence and rapine by cruelty and treachery of every kind effect in that country the very same result for all the state of italy revolt in he favor and all the italian nation range themselves on he side when we seek to know why this be several reason present themselves the first be that man so passionately love change that commonly speak those who be well off be as eager for it as those who be badly off : for as already have be say with truth man be pampered by prosperity sour by adversity this love of change therefore make they open the door to any one who put himself at the head of new movement in they country and if he be a foreigner they adopt he cause if a fellow-countryman they gather round he and become he partisan and supporter so that whatever method he may there use he will succeed in make great progress moreover man be move by two chief passion love and fear he who make himself fear command with no less authority than he who make himself love nay as a rule be follow and obey more implicitly than the other it matter little however which of these two way a captain choose to follow provide he be of transcendent valor and have thereby win for himself a great name for when like hannibal or scipio a man be very valiant this quality will cloak any error he may commit in seek either to be too much loved or too much fear yet from each of these two tendency grave mischief and such as lead to the ruin of a prince may arise for he who would be greatly love if he swerve ever so little from the right road become contemptible while he who would be greatly fear if he go a jot too far incur hatred and since it be impossible we nature not allow it to adhere to the exact mean it be essential that any excess should be balance by a exceed valor as it be in hannibal and scipio and yet we find that even they while they be exalt by the method they follow be also injure by they how they be exalt have be show the injury which scipio suffer be that in spain he soldier in concert with certain of he ally rise against he for no other reason than that they stand in no fear of he for man be so restless that if ever so small a door be open to they ambition they forthwith forget all the love they have bear they prince in return for he graciousness and goodness as do these soldier and ally of scipio when to correct the mischief he be force to use something of a cruelty foreign to he nature as to hannibal we can not point to any particular instance wherein he cruelty or want of faith be see to have be directly hurtful to he but we may well believe that naple and other town which remain loyal to the roman people do so by reason of the dread which he character inspire this however be abundantly clear that he inhumanity make he more detest by the roman than any other enemy they ever have so that while to pyrrhus in italy with he army they give up the traitor who offer to poison he hannibal even when disarm and a fugitive they never forgive until they have compass he death to hannibal therefore from he be account impious perfidious and cruel these disadvantage result but on the other hand there accrue to he one great gain notice with admiration by all historian namely that in he army although make up of man of every race and country no dissension ever break out among the soldier themselves nor any mutiny against they leader this we can only ascribe to the awe which he character inspire which together with the great name he valor have win for he have the effect of keep he soldier quiet and united i repeat therefore that it be of little moment which method a captain may follow if he be endow with such valor as will bear he out in the course which he adopt for as i have say there be disadvantage incident to both method unless correct by extraordinary valor and now since i have speak of scipio and hannibal the former of whom by praiseworthy the latter by odious quality effect the same result i must not i think omit to notice the character of two roman citizen who by different yet both by honorable method obtain a like glory chapter xxii -- _ that the severity of manlius torquatus and the gentleness of valerius corvinus win for both the same glory _ there live in rome at the same time two excellent captain manlius torquatus and valerius corvinus equal in they triumph and in they renown and in the valor which in obtain these they have display against the enemy but who in the conduct of they army and treatment of they soldier follow very different method for manlius in he command resort to every kind of severity never spare he man fatigue nor remitting punishment while valerius on the contrary treat they with all kindness and consideration and be easy and familiar in he intercourse with they so that while the one to secure the obedience of he soldier put he own son to death the other never deal harshly with any man yet for all this diversity in they mode of act each have the same success against the enemy and each obtain the same advantage both for the republic and for himself for no soldier of theirs ever flinch in battle or rise in mutiny against they or in any particular oppose they will though the command of manlius be of such severity that any order of excessive rigor come to be speak of as a _ manlian order _ here then we have to consider first of all why manlius be oblige to use such severity next why valerius could behave so humanely thirdly how it be that these opposite method have the same result and lastly which of the two method it be better and more useful for we to follow now if we well examine the character of manlius from the moment when titus livius first begin to make mention of he we shall find he to have be endow with a rare vigor both of mind and body dutiful in he behavior to he father and to he country and most reverent to he superior all which we see in he slaying the gaul in he defense of he father against the tribune and in the word in which before go forth to fight the gaul he address the consul when he say _ although assure of victory never will i without thy bidding engage a enemy _ but when such a man as this attain to command he look to find all other like himself he dauntless spirit prompt he to engage in daring enterprise and to insist on they be carry out and this be certain that where thing hard to execute be order to be do the order must be enforce with sternness since otherwise it will be disobey and here be it note that if you would be obey you must know how to command and that they alone have this knowledge who have measure they power to enforce with the willingness of other to yield obedience and who issue they order when they find these condition combine but otherwise abstain wherefore a wise man be wont to say that to hold a republic by force there must be a proportion between he who use the force and he against whom it be use and that while this proportion obtain the force will operate but that when he who suffer be stronger than he who use the force we may expect to see it bring to a end at any moment but return to the matter in hand i say that to command thing hard of execution require hardness in he who give the command and that a man of this temper and who issue such command can not look to enforce they by gentleness he who be not of such a temper must be careful not to impose task of extraordinary difficulty but may use he natural gentleness in impose such as be ordinary for common punishment be not imputed to the prince but to the law and ordinance which he have to administer we must believe therefore that manlius be constrain to act with severity by the unusual character of the command which he natural disposition prompt he to issue such command be useful in a republic as restore its ordinance to they original efficacy and excellence and be a republic as i have before observe fortunate enough to come frequently under the influence of man who by they example reinforce its law and not only retard its progress towards corruption but bring it back to its first perfection it might endure for ever manlius therefore be of those who by the severity of they command maintain the military discipline of rome urge thereto in the first place by he natural temper and next by the desire that whatever he be mind to command should be do valerius on the other hand could afford to act humanely because for he it be enough if all be do which in a roman army it be customary to do and since the custom of that army be good custom they suffice to gain he honor while at the same time they maintenance cost he no effort nor throw on he the burthen of punish transgressor as well because there be none who trangress as because have there be any they would as i have say have imputed they punishment to the ordinary rule of discipline and not to the severity of they commander in this way valerius have room to exercise that humane disposition which enable he at once to gain influence over he soldier and to content they hence it be that both these captain obtain the same obedience could while follow different method arrive at the same end those however who seek to imitate they may chance to fall into the error of which i have already speak in connection with hannibal and scipio as breed contempt or hatred and which be only to be correct by the presence of extraordinary valor and not otherwise it rest now to determine which of these two method be the more to be commend this i take it be matter of dispute since both method have they advocate those writer however who have lay down rule for the conduct of prince describe a character approach more nearly to that of valerius than to that of manlius and xenophon whom i have already cite while give many instance of the humanity of cyrus conform closely to what livius tell we of valerius for valerius be make consul against the samnite on the eve of battle speak to he man with the same kindliness with which he always treat they and livius after tell we what he say remark of he : _ never be there a leader more familiar with he man cheerfully share with the meanest among they every hardship and fatigue even in the military game wherein those of the same rank be wont to make trial of they strength or swiftness he would good-naturedly take a part nor disdain any adversary who offer meeting victory or defeat with a unruffled temper and a unchanged countenance when call on to act he bounty and generosity never fall short when he have to speak he be as mindful of the feeling of other as of he own dignity and what more than anything else secure the popular favor he maintain when exercise he magistracy the same bearing he have worn in seek they _ of manlius also titus livius speak in like honorable term point out that he severity in put he son to death bring the roman army to that pitch of discipline which enable it to prevail against the latin nay he go so far in he praise that after describe the whole order of the battle compare the strength of both army and show all the danger the roman run and the difficulty they have to surmount he wind up by say that it be the valor of manlius which alone gain for they this great victory and that whichever side have manlius for its leader must have win the day so that weigh all that the historian tell we of these two captain it might be difficult to decide between they nevertheless not to leave the question entirely open i say that for a citizen living under a republic i think the conduct of manlius more deserving of praise and less dangerous in its consequence for method like he tend only to the public good and in no way subserve private end he who show himself harsh and stern at all time and to all man alike and be see to care only for the common welfare will never gain himself partisan since this be not the way to win personal friend to whom as i say before the name of partisan be give for a republic therefore no line of conduct could be more useful or more to be desire than this because in follow it the public interest be not neglect and no room be give to suspect personal ambition but the contrary hold as to the method follow by valerius for though the public service they render be the same misgiving must need arise that the personal good-will which in the course of a prolonged command a captain obtain from he soldier may lead to consequence fatal to the public liberty and if this be not find to happen in the case of valerius it be because the mind of the roman people be not yet corrupt and because they have never remain for a long time and continuously under he command have we however like xenophon to consider what be most for the interest of a prince we should have to give up manlius and hold by valerius for undoubtedly a prince should strive to gain the love of he soldier and subject as well as they obedience the latter he can secure by discipline and by he reputation for valor but for the former he will be indebted to he affability kindliness gentleness and all those other like quality which be possess by valerius and which be describe by xenophon as exist in cyrus that a prince should be personally love and have he army wholly devoted to he be consistent with the character of he government but that this should happen to a person of private station do not consist with he position as a citizen who have to live in conformity with the law and in subordination to the magistrate we read in the early annals of the venetian republic that once on the return of the fleet a dispute break out between the sailor and the people result in tumult and armed violence which neither the effort of the public officer the respect feel for particular citizen nor the authority of the magistrate could quell but on a certain gentleman who the year before have be in command of these sailor show himself among they straightway from the love they bear he they submit to he authority and withdraw from the fray which deference on they part arouse such jealousy and suspicion in the mind of the venetian senator that very soon after they get rid of this gentleman either by death or exile the sum of the matter therefore be that the method follow by valerius be useful in a prince but pernicious in a private citizen both for he country and for himself for he country because such method pave the way to a tyranny for himself because he fellow-citizen grow suspicious of he conduct be constrain to protect themselves to he hurt and conversely i maintain that the method of manlius while hurtful in a prince be useful in a citizen and in the highest degree for he country and moreover seldom give offence unless the hatred cause by he severity be augment by the jealousy which the fame of he other virtue inspire : a matter now to be consider in connection with the banishment of camillas chapter xxiii -- _ why camillus be banish from rome _ it have be show above how method like those of valerius be hurtful to the citizen who employ they and to he country while method like those of manlius be advantageous for a man 's country though sometimes they be hurtful to the man himself this be well see in the example of camillus whose bear more nearly resemble that of manlius than that of valerius so that titus livius in speaking of he say _ he virtue be at once hate and admire by he soldier _ what gain he they admiration be he care for they safety he prudence he magnanimity and the good order he maintain in conduct and command they what make he hate be he be more stern to punish than bountiful to reward and livius instance the following circumstance as give rise to this hatred first he have apply the money get by the sale of the goods of the veientine to public purpose and not divide it along with the rest of the spoil second he have on the occasion of he triumph cause he chariot to be draw by four white horse seek in he pride man say to make himself the equal of the sun god and third he have vow to apollo a tenth of the veientine plunder which if he be to fulfil he vow he have to recover from he soldier into whose hand it have already come herein we may well and readily discern what cause tend to make a prince hateful to he people the chief whereof be the deprive they of some advantage and this be a matter of much importance for when a man be deprive of what be in itself useful he never forget it and every trifling occasion recall it to he mind and because such occasion recur daily he be every day remind of he loss another error which we be here teach to guard against be the appear haughty and proud than which nothing be more distasteful to a people and most of all to a free people for although such pride and haughtiness do they no hurt they nevertheless hold in detestation any who display these quality every show of pride therefore a prince should shun as he would a rock since to invite hatred without result advantage be utterly rash and futile chapter xxiv -- _ that prolonged command bring rome to servitude _ if we well examine the course of roman history we shall find two cause lead to the break-up of that republic : one the dissension which arise in connection with the agrarian law the other the prolongation of command for have these matter be rightly understand from the first and due remedy apply the freedom of rome have be far more lasting and possibly less disturbed and although as touch the prolongation of command we never find any tumult break out in rome on that account we do in fact discern how much harm be do to the city by the ascendency which certain of its citizen thereby gain this mischief indeed would not have arise if other citizen whose period of office be extend have be as good and wise as lucius quintius whose virtue afford a notable example for term of accord have be settle between the senate and common of rome the latter think they tribune well able to withstand the ambition of the noble prolong they authority for a year whereupon the senate not to be outdo by the common propose out of rivalry to extend the consulship of quintius he however refuse absolutely to lend himself to they design and insist on they appoint new consul tell they that they should seek to discredit evil example not add to they by set worse have this prudence and virtue of he be share by all the citizen of rome the practice of prolong the term of civil office would not have be suffer to establish itself nor have lead to the kindred practice of extend the term of military command which in progress of time effect the ruin of they republic the first military commander whose term be extend be publius philo for when he consulship be about to expire he be then engage in the siege of palæopolis the senate see he have the victory in he hand would not displace he by a successor but appoint he _ proconsul _ which office he be the first to hold now although in thus act the senate do what they think best for the public good nevertheless it be this act of theirs that in time bring rome to slavery for the further the roman carry they arm the more necessary it seem to they to grant similar extension of command and the oftener they in fact do so this give rise to two disadvantage : first that a smaller number of man be train to command second that by the long continuance of he command a captain gain so much influence and ascendency over he soldier that in time they come to hold the senate of no account and look only to he this it be that enable syllum and marius to find adherent ready to follow they even to the public detriment and enable cæsar to overthrow the liberty of he country whereas have the roman never prolong the period of authority whether civil or military though they might have take longer to build up they empire they certainly have be later in incur servitude chapter xxv -- _ of the poverty of cincinnatus and of many other roman citizen elsewhere i have show that no ordinance be of such advantage to a commonwealth as one which enforce poverty on its citizen and although it do not appear what particular law it be that have this operation in rome -lrb- especially since we know the agrarian law to have be stubbornly resist -rrb- we find as a fact that four hundred year after the city be found great poverty still prevail there and may assume that nothing help so much to produce this result as the knowledge that the path to honor and preferment be close to none and that merit be seek after wheresoever it be to be find for this manner of confer honor make riches the less court in proof whereof i shall cite one instance only when the consul minutius be beset in he camp by the equian the roman people be fill with such alarm lest they army should be destroy that they appoint a dictator always they last stay in season of peril they choice fall on lucius quintius cincinnatus who at the time be live on he small farm of little more than four acre which he till with he own hand the story be nobly tell by titus livius where he say : _ this be worth listen to by those who contemn all thing human as compare with riches and think that glory and excellence can have no place unless accompany by lavish wealth _ cincinnatus then be plough in he little field when there arrive from rome the messenger send by the senate to tell he he have be make dictator and inform he of the danger which threaten the republic put on he gown he hasten to rome and get together a army march to deliver minutius but when he have defeat and spoil the enemy and release minutius he would not suffer the army he have rescue to participate in the spoil say _ i will not have you share in the plunder of those to whom you have so nearly fall a prey _ minutius he deprive of he consulship and reduce to be a subaltern in which rank he bid he remain till he have learn how to command and before this he have make lucius tarquininus although force by he poverty to serve on foot he master of the knight here then we see what honor be pay in rome to poverty and how four acre of land suffice to support so good and great a man as cincinnatus we find the same poverty still prevail in the time of marcus regulus who when serve with the army in africa seek leave of senate to return home that he might look after he farm which he labourer have suffer to run to waste here again we learn two thing worthy we attention : first the poverty of these man and they contentment under it and how they sole study be to gain renown from war leave all its advantage to the state for have they think of enrich themselves by war it have give they little concern that they field be run to waste further we have to remark the magnanimity of these citizen who when place at the head of army surpass all prince in the loftiness of they spirit who care neither for king nor for commonwealth and whom nothing could daunt or dismay but who on return to private life become once more so humble so frugal so careful of they slender means and so submissive to the magistrate and reverential to they superior that it might seem impossible for the human mind to undergo so violent a change this poverty prevail down to the day of paulus emilius almost the last happy day for this republic wherein a citizen while enrich rome by he triumph himself remain poor and yet so greatly be poverty still esteem at this time that when paulus in confer reward on those who have behave well in the war present he own son-in-law with a silver cup it be the first vessel of silver ever see in he house i might run on to a great length point out how much better be the fruit of poverty than those of riches and how poverty have bring city province and nation to honor while riches have work they ruin have not this subject be often treat by other chapter xxvi -- _ how woman be a cause of the ruin of state _ a feud break out in ardea touch the marriage of a heiress whose hand be seek at the same time by two suitor the one of plebeian the other of noble birth for she father be dead she guardian wish she to wed the plebeian she mother the noble and so hot grow the dispute that resort be have to arm the whole nobility siding with they fellow-noble and all the plebeian with the plebeian the latter faction be worst leave the town and send to the volscian for help whereupon the noble seek help from rome the volscian be first in the field and on they arrival encamped round ardea the roman come up later shut in the volscian between themselves and the town and reduce they by famine force they to surrender at discretion they then enter ardea and put all the ringleader in this dispute to the sword compose the disorder of the city in connection with this affair there be several point to be note and in the first place we see how woman have be the occasion of many division and calamity in state and have work great harm to ruler as when accord to we historian the violence do to lucretium drive the tarquin from they kingdom and that do to virginium break the power of the decemvir and among the chief cause which aristotle assign for the downfall of tyrant be the wrong do by they to they subject in respect of they woman whether by adultery rape or other like injury to they honor as have be sufficiently notice in the chapter wherein we treat _ of conspiracy _ i say then that neither absolute prince nor the ruler of free state should underrate the importance of matter but take heed to the disorder which it may breed and provide against they while remedy can still be use without discredit to themselves or to they government and this should have be do by the ruler of ardea who by suffer the rivalry between they citizen to come to a head promote they division and when they seek to reunite they have to summon foreign help than which nothing sooner lead to servitude but now let we turn to another subject which merit attention namely the means whereby divide city may be reunite and of this i propose to speak in the follow chapter chapter xxvii _ how a divide city may be reunite and how it be a false opinion that to hold city in subjection they must be keep divide _ from the example of the roman consul who reconcile the citizen of ardea we be teach the method whereby the feud of a divide city may be compose namely by put the ringleader of the disturbance to death and that no other remedy should be use three course indeed be open to you since you may either put to death as these consul do or banish or bind the citizen to live at peace with one another take security for they good behavior of which three way the last be the most hurtful the most uncertain and the least effectual because when much blood have be shed or other like outrage do it can not be that a peace impose on compulsion should endure between man who be every day bring face to face with one another for since fresh cause of contention may at any moment result from they meeting it will be impossible for they to refrain from mutual injury of this we could have no better instance than in the city of pistoja fifteen year ago this city be divide between the panciatichus and cancellierus as indeed it still continue the only difference be that then they be in arm whereas now they have lay they aside after much controversy and wrangle these faction would presently proceed to bloodsh to pull down house plunder property and all the other violent course usual in divide city the florentine with whom it lay to compose these feud strive for a long time to do so by use the third of the method mention but when this only lead to increase tumult and disorder lose patience they decide to try the second method and get rid of the ringleader of both faction by imprison some and banish other in this way a sort of settlement be arrive at which continue in operation up to the present hour there can be no question however that the first of the method name would have be the surest but because extreme measure have in they a element of greatness and nobility a weak republic so far from know how to use this first method can with difficulty be bring to employ even the second this as i say at the beginning be the kind of blunder make by the prince of we time when they have to decide on matter of moment from they not consider how those man act who in ancient day have to determine under like condition for the weakness of the present race of man -lrb- the result of they enfeeble education and they ignorance of affair -rrb- make they regard the method follow by the ancient as partly inhuman and partly impracticable accordingly they have they own newfangled way of look at thing wholly at variance with the true as when the sage of we city some time since pronounce that _ pistoja be to be hold by feud and pisa by fortress _ not perceive how useless each of these method be in itself have speak of fortress already at some length i shall not further refer to they here but shall consider the futility of try to hold subject city by keep they divide in the first place it be impossible for the ruling power whether prince or republic to be friend with both faction for wherever there be division it be human nature to take a side and to favor one party more than another but if one party in a subject city be unfriendly to you the consequence will be that you will lose that city so soon as you be involve in war since it be impossible for you to hold a city where you have enemy both within and without should the ruling power be a republic there be nothing so likely to corrupt its citizen and sow dissension among they as have to control a divided city for as each faction in that city will seek support and endeavor to make friend in a variety of corrupt way two very serious evil will result : first that the govern city will never be contented with its governor since there can be no good government where you often change its form adapt yourself to the humor now of one party and now of another and next that the factious spirit of the subject city be certain to infect you own republic to which biondo testify when in speaking of the citizen of florence and pistoja he say _ in seek to unite pistoja the florentine themselves fall out _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be easy therefore to understand how much mischief attend on such division in the year 1501 when we lose arezzo and when all the val di tevere and val di chiana be occupy by the vitellus and by duke valentino a certain m de lant be send by the king of france to cause the whole of the lose town to be restore to the florentine who find in all these town man who come to he claim to be of the party of the _ marnocco _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- greatly blame this distinction observe that if in france any of the king 's subject be to say that he be of the king 's party he would be punish since the expression would imply that there be a party hostile to the king whereas it be he majesty 's desire that all he subject should be he friend and live unite without any distinction of party but all these mistaken method and opinion originate in the weakness of ruler who see that they can not hold they state by they own strength and valor have recourse to like device which if now and then in tranquil time they prove of some slight assistance to they in time of danger be show to be worthless -lrb- footnote 1 : _ flav blondri hist _ dec ii lib 9 basle ed 1559 p 337 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the heraldic lion of florence -rrb- chapter xxviii _ that a republic must keep a eye on what its citizen be about since often the seed of a tyranny lie hide under a semblance of generous deed _ the granary of rome not suffice to meet a famine with which the city be visit a certain spurius melius a very wealthy citizen for these day privately lay in a supply of corn wherewith to feed the people at he own expense gain thereby such general favor with the common that the senate apprehend that he bounty might have dangerous consequence in order to crush he before he grow too powerful appoint a dictator to deal with he and cause he to be put to death here we have to note that action which seem good in themselves and unlikely to occasion harm to any one very often become hurtful nay unless correct in time most dangerous for a republic and to treat the matter with greater fulness i say that while a republic can never maintain itself long or manage its affair to advantage without citizen of good reputation on the other hand the credit enjoy by particular citizen often lead to the establishment of a tyranny for which reason and that thing may take a safe course it should be so arrange that a citizen shall have credit only for such behavior as benefit and not for such as injure the state and its liberty we must therefore examine by what way credit be acquire these briefly be two public or secret public when a citizen gain a great name by advise well or by act still better for the common advantage to credit of this sort we should open a wide door hold out reward both for good counsel and for good action so that he who render such service may be at once honor and satisfied reputation acquire honestly and openly by such means as these can never be dangerous but credit acquire by secret practice which be the other method speak of be most perilous and prejudicial of such secret practice may be instanced act of kindness do to this or the other citizen in lend he money in assist he to marry he daughter in defend he against the magistrate and in confer such other private favor as gain man devoted adherent and encourage they after they have obtain such support to corrupt the institution of the state and to violate its law a well-governed republic therefore ought as i have say to throw wide the door to all who seek public favor by open course and to close it against any who would ingratiate themselves by underhand means and this we find be do in rome for the roman republic as a reward to any citizen who serve it well ordain triumph and all the other honor which it have to bestow while against those who seek to aggrandize themselves by secret intrigue it ordain accusation and impeachment and when from the people be blind by a false show of benevolence these prove insufficient it provide for a dictator who with regal authority might bring to bound any who have stray beyond they as instanced in the case of spurius melius and if conduct like he be ever suffer to pass unchastised it may well be the ruin of a republic for man when they have such example set they be not easily lead back into the right path chapter xxix -- _ that the fault of a people be due to its prince _ let no prince complain of the fault commit by a people under he control since these must be ascribe either to he negligence or to he be himself blemish by similar defect and be any one to consider what people in we own time have be most give to robbery and other like offence he would find that they have only copy they ruler who have themselves be of a like nature romagna before those lord who rule it be drive out by pope alexander vi be a nursery of all the worst crime the slightest occasion give rise to wholesale rapine and murder this result from the wickedness of these lord and not as they assert from the evil disposition of they subject for these prince be poor yet choose to live as though they be rich be force to resort to cruelty innumerable and practice in diver way and among other shameful device contrived by they to extort money they would pass law prohibit certain act and then be the first to give occasion for break they nor would they chastise offender until they see many involve in the same offence when they fall to punish not from any zeal for the law which they have make but out of greed to realize the penalty whence flow many mischief and more particularly this that the people be impoverished but not correct seek to make good they injury at the expense of other weaker than themselves and thus there spring up all those evil speak of above whereof the prince be the true cause the truth of what i say be confirm by titus livius where he relate how the roman envoy who be convey the spoil of the veientine as a offering to apollo be seize and bring on shore by the corsair of the liparus island in sicily when timasitheus the prince of these island on learn the nature of the offer its destination and by whom send though himself of liparus behave as a roman might show he people what sacrilege it would be to intercept such a gift and speak to such purpose that by general consent the envoy be suffer to proceed upon they voyage take all they possession with they with reference to which incident the historian observe : _ the multitude who always take they color from they ruler be fill by timasitheus with a religious awe _ and to like purport we find it say by lorenzo de ' medicus : -- a prince 's act he people imitate for on they lord the eye of all man wait -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : e quel che fa il signer fanno pous moltus chè nel signer son tutti gli occhi volti -lrb- _ la rappresentazione di san giovanni e paolo _ -rrb- -rrb- chapter xxx -- _ that a citizen who seek by he personal influence to render signal service to he country must first stand clear of envy how a city should prepare for its defense on the approach of a enemy _ when the roman senate learn that all etrurium be assemble in arm to march against rome and that the latin and hernician who before have be the friend of the roman have range themselves with the volscian the ancient enemy of the roman name they foresee that a perilous contest await they but because camillus be at that time tribune with consular authority they think all might be manage without the appointment of a dictator provide the other tribune he colleague would agree to he assume the sole direction of affair this they willingly do _ nor _ say titus livius _ do they account anything as take from they own dignity which be add to he _ on receive they promise of obedience camillus give order that three army should be enrol of the first which be to be direct against the etruscan he himself assume command the command of the second which he mean to remain near rome and meet any movement of the latin and hernician he give to quintius servilius the third army which he design for the protection of the city and the defense of the gate and curia he entrust to lucius quintius and he further direct that horatius one of he colleague should furnish supplies of arm and corn and of all else needful in time of war finally he put forward he colleague cornelius to preside in the senate and public council that from day to day he might advise what should be do for in those time these tribune be ready either to command or obey as the welfare of they country might require we may gather from this passage how a brave and prudent man should act how much good he may effect and how serviceable he may be to he country when by the force of he character and worth he succeed in extinguish envy for this often disable man from act to the best advantage not permit they to obtain that authority which it be essential they should have in matter of importance now envy may be extinguish in one or other of two way : first by the approach of some flagrant danger whereby see themselves like to be overwhelm all forego they own private ambition and lend a willing obedience to he who count on he valor to rescue they as in the case of camilla who from have give many proof of surpass ability and from have be three time dictator and always exercise the office for the public good and not for he private advantage have bring man to fear nothing from he advancement while he fame and reputation make it no shame for they to recognize he as they superior wisely therefore do titus livius use concern he the word which i have cite the other way in which envy may be extinguish be by the death whether by violence or in the ordinary course of nature of those who have be you rival in the pursuit of fame or power and who see you better esteem than themselves could never acquiesce in you superiority or put up with it in patience for when these man have be bring up in a corrupt city where they training be little likely to improve they nothing that can happen will induce they to withdraw they pretension nay to have they own way and satisfy they perverse humor they will be content to look on while they country be ruin for envy such as this there be no cure save by the death of those of whom it have take possession and when fortune so befriend a great man that he rival be remove from he path by a natural death he glory be establish without scandal or offence since he be then able to display he great quality unhindered but when fortune be not thus propitious to he he must contrive other means to rid himself of rival and must do so successfully before he can accomplish anything any one who read with intelligence the lesson of holy writ will remember how mose to give effect to he law and ordinance be constrain to put to death a endless number of those who out of mere envy withstand he design the necessity of this course be well understand by the friar girolamo savonarolum and by the gonfalonier piero soderinus but the former could not comply with it because as a friar he himself lack the needful authority while those of he follower who might have exercise that authority do not rightly comprehend he teaching this however be no fault of he for he sermon be full of invective and attack against _ the wise of this world _ that be the name he give to envious rival and to all who oppose he reform as for piero soderinus he be possess by the belief that in time and with favourable fortune he could allay envy by gentleness-and by benefit confer on particular man for as he be still in the prime of life and in the fresh enjoyment of that good-will which he character and opinion have gain for he he think to get the better of all who out of jealousy oppose he without give occasion for tumult violence or disorder not know how time stay not worth suffice not fortune shift and malice will not be win over by any benefit wherefore because they could not or know not how to vanquish this envy the two whom i have name come to they downfall another point to be note in the passage we be consider be the careful provision make by camillus for the safety of rome both within and without the city and truly not without reason do wise historian like we author set forth certain event with much minuteness and detail to the end that those who come after may learn how to protect themselves in like danger further we have to note that there be no more hazardous or less useful defense than one conduct without method or system this be show in camillus cause a third army to be enrol that it might be leave in rome for the protection of the city many person doubtless both then and now would esteem this precaution superfluous thinking that as the roman be a warlike people and constantly under arm there could be no occasion for a special levy and that it be time enough to arm when the need come but camillus and any other equally prudent captain would be of the same mind judge otherwise not permit the multitude to take up arm unless they be to be bind by the rule and discipline of military service let he therefore who be call on to defend a city take example by camillus before all thing avoid place arm in the hand of a undisciplined multitude but first of all select and enroll those whom he propose to arm so that they may be wholly govern by he as to where they shall assemble and whither they shall march and then let he direct those who be not enrol to abide every man in he own house for its defense whosoever observe this method in a city which be attack will be able to defend it with ease but whosoever disregard it and follow not the example of camillus shall never succeed chapter xxxi -- _ that strong republic and valiant man preserve through every change the same spirit and bearing _ among other high saying which we historian ascribe to camillus as showing of what stuff a truly great man should be make he put in he mouth the word _ my courage come not with my dictatorship nor go with my exile _ for by these word we be teach that a great man be constantly the same through all vicissitude of fortune so that although she change now exalt now depress he remain unchanged and retain always a mind so unmoved and in such complete accordance with he nature as declare to all that over he fortune have no dominion very different be the behavior of those weak-minded mortal who puff up and intoxicate with they success ascribe all they felicity to virtue which they never know and thus grow hateful and insupportable to all around they whence also the change in they fortune for whenever they have to look adversity in the face they suddenly pass to the other extreme become abject and base and thus it happen that feeble-minded prince when they fall into difficulty think rather of flight than of defense because have make bad use of they prosperity they be wholly unprepared to defend themselves the same merit and defect which i say be find in individual man be likewise find in republic whereof we have example in the case of rome and of venice for no reverse of fortune ever break the spirit of the roman people nor do any success ever unduly elate they as we see plainly after they defeat at cannæ and after the victory they have over antiochus for the defeat at cannæ although most momentous be the third they have meet with no whit daunt they so that they continue to send forth army refuse to ransom prisoner as contrary to they custom and despatch no envoy to hannibal or to carthage to sue for peace but without ever look back on past humiliation think always of war though in such strait for soldier that they have to arm they old man and slave which fact be make know to hanno the carthaginian he as i have already related warn the carthaginian senate not to lay too much stress upon they victory here therefore we see that in time of adversity the roman be neither cast down nor dismayed on the other hand no prosperity ever make they arrogant before fight the battle wherein he be finally route antiochus send messenger to scipio to treat for a accord when scipio offer peace on condition that he withdraw at once into syrium leave all he other dominion to be deal with by the roman as they think fit antiochus refuse these term fight and be defeat and again send envoy to scipio enjoin they to accept whatever condition the victor might be please to impose but scipio propose no different term from those he have offer before say that _ the roman as they lose not heart on defeat so wax not insolent with success _ the contrary of all this be see in the behavior of the venetian who think they good fortune due to valor of which they be devoid in they pride address the french king as son of st mark and make no account of the church and no longer restrict they ambition to the limit of italy come to dream of found a empire like the roman but afterwards when they good fortune desert they and they meet at vailà a half-defeat at the hand of the french king they lose they whole dominion not altogether from revolt but mainly by a base and abject surrender to the pope and the king of spain nay so low do they stoop as to send ambassador to the emperor offering to become he tributary and to write letter to the pope full of submission and servility in order to move he compassion to such abasement be they bring in four day ' time by what be in reality only a half-defeat for on they flight after the battle of vailà only about a half of they force be engage and one of they two provedditorus escape to verona with five and twenty thousand man horse and foot so that have there be a spark of valor in venice or any soundness in she military system she might easily have renew she army and again confront fortune have stand prepared either to conquer or if she must fall to fall more gloriously and at any rate might have obtain for herself more honorable term but a pusillanimous spirit occasion by the defect of she ordinance in so far as they relate to war cause she to lose at once she courage and she dominion and so will it always happen with those who behave like the venetian for when man grow insolent in good fortune and abject inn evil the fault lie in themselves and in the character of they training which when slight and frivolous assimilate they to itself but when otherwise make they of another temper and give they better acquaintance with the world cause they to be less dishearten by misfortune and less elate by success and while this be true of individual man it hold good also of a concourse of man live together in one republic who will arrive at that measure of perfection which the institution of they state permit and although i have already say on another occasion that a good militia be the foundation of all state and where that be want there can neither be good law nor aught else that be good it seem to I not superfluous to say the same again because in read this history of titus livius the necessity of such a foundation be make apparent in every page it be likewise show that no army can be good unless it be thoroughly train and exercise and that this can only be the case with a army raise from you own subject for as a state be not and can not always be at war you must have opportunity to train you army in time of peace but this have regard to the cost you can only have in respect of you own subject when camillus as already related go forth to meet the etruscan he soldier on see the great army of they enemy be fill with fear think themselves too to withstand its onset this untoward disposition be report to camillus he show himself to he man and by visit they tent and converse with this and the other among they be able to remove they misgiving and finally without other word of command he bid they _ each do he part as he have learn and be accustom _ now any one who well consider the method follow by camillus and the word speak by he to encourage he soldier to face they enemy will perceive that these word and method could never have be use with a army which have not be train and discipline in time of peace as well as of war for no captain can trust to untrained soldier or look for good service at they hand nay though he be another hannibal with such troops he defeat be certain for as a captain can not be present everywhere while a battle be be fight unless he have take all measure beforehand to render he man of the same temper as himself and have make sure that they perfectly understand he order and arrangement he will inevitably be destroy when a city therefore be armed and trained as rome be and when its citizen have daily opportunity both singly and together to make trial of they valor and learn what fortune can effect it will always happen that at all time and whether circumstance be adverse or favourable they will remain of unaltered courage and preserve the same noble bearing but when its citizen be unpractised in arm and trust not to they own valor but wholly to the arbitration of fortune they will change they temper as she change and offer always the same example of behavior as be give by the venetian chapter xxxii -- _ of the method which some have use to make peace impossible _ the town of cære and velitræ two of she own colony revolt from rome in expectation of be protect by the latin but the latin be route and all hope of help from that quarter at a end many of the townsman recommend that envoy should be send to rome to make they peace with the senate this proposal however be defeat by those who have be the prime mover of the revolt who fear that the whole punishment might fall on they head to put a stop to any talk of a adjustment incite the multitude to take up arm and make a foray into the roman territory and in truth when it be desire that a prince or people should banish from they mind every thought of reconciliation there be no surer or more effectual plan than to incite they to inflict grave wrong on he with whom you would not have they be reconcile for then the fear of that punishment which they will seem to themselves to have deserve will always keep they apart at the close of the first war wage by the roman against carthage the soldier who have serve under the carthaginian in sardinium and sicily upon peace be proclaimed return to africa where be dissatisfy with they pay they mutiny against the carthaginian and choose two of they number mato and spendio to be they leader seize and sack many town subject to carthage the carthaginian be loath to use force until they have try all other method for bring they to reason send hasdrubal they fellow-citizen to mediate with they think that from formerly have command they he might be able to exercise some influence over they but on he arrival spendio and mato to extinguish any hope these mutineer might have have of make peace with carthage and so leave they no alternative but war persuade they that they best course be to put hasdrubal with all the other carthaginian citizen whom they have take prisoner to death whereupon they not only put they to death but first subject they to a infinity of torture crowning they wickedness by a proclamation to the effect that every carthaginian who might thereafter fall into they hand should meet a like fate this advice therefore and its consummation have the effect of render these mutineer relentless and inveterate in they hostility to the carthaginian chapter xxxiii -- _ that to insure victory in battle you must inspire you man with confidence in one another and in you _ to insure a army be victorious in battle you must inspire it with the conviction that it be certain to prevail the cause which give it this confidence be its be well armed and disciplined and the soldier know one another these condition be only to be find unite in soldier bear and breed in the same country it be likewise essential that the army should think so well of its captain as to trust implicitly to he prudence which it will always do if it see he careful of its welfare attentive to discipline brave in battle and otherwise support well and honourably the dignity of he position these condition he fulfil when while punish fault he do not needlessly harass he man keep he word with they show they that the path to victory be easy and conceal from they or make light of thing which see from a distance might appear to threaten danger the observance of these precaution will give a army great confidence and such confidence lead to victory this confidence the roman be wont to inspire in the mind of they soldier by the aid of religion and accordingly they consul be appoint they army be enrol they soldier march forth and they battle be begin only when the augury and auspices be favourable and without attend to all these observance no prudent captain would ever engage in combat know that unless he soldier be first assure that the god be on they side he might readily suffer defeat but if any consul or other leader ever join battle contrary to the auspices the roman would punish he as they do claudius pulcher the truth of what i affirm be plainly see from the whole course of the roman history but be more particularly establish by the word which livius put into the mouth of appius claudius who when complain to the people of the insolence of the tribune and tax they with have cause the corruption of the auspices and other rite of religion be make to say _ and now they would strip even religion of its authority for what matter it they will tell you that the fowl refuse to peck or come slowly from the coop or that a cock have crow these be small matter doubtless but it be by not contemn such small matter as these that we forefather build up this great republic _ and indeed in these small matter lie a power which keep man unite and of good courage which be of itself the chief condition of success but the observance of religion must be accompany by valor for otherwise they can nothing avail the man of praneste lead forth they army against the roman take up they position near the river allium on the very spot where the roman have be route by the gaul select this ground that it might inspire they own side with confidence and dishearten they enemy with the unhappy memory which it recall but although for the reason already note this be a course which promise success the result nevertheless show that true valor be not to be daunt by trifling disadvantage and this the historian well express by the word he put in the mouth of the dictator as speak to he master of the knight _ see how these fellow in encamp on the bank of the allium have choose they ground in reliance upon fortune do you therefore rely on discipline and valor fall upon then center _ for true valor tight discipline and the feeling of security gain by repeat victory be not to be counteract by thing of no real moment dismay by empty terror or quell by a solitary mishap as be well see when the two manlius be consul in command against the volscian rashly allow a part of they army to go out forage and both those who go out and those who stay behind find themselves attack at the same moment for from this danger they be save by the courage of the soldier and not by the foresight of the consul with regard to which occurrence titus livius observe _ even without a leader the steadfast valor of the soldier be maintain _ here i must not omit to notice the device practice by fabius to give he army confidence when he lead it for the first time into etrurium for judge such encouragement to be especially need by he man since they be enter a unknown country to encounter a new foe he address they before they join battle and after recite many reason for expect a victory tell they that _ he could have mention other favourable circumstance make victory certain have it not be dangerous to disclose they _ and as this device be dexterously use it merit imitation chapter xxxiv -- _ by what report rumor or surmise the citizen of a republic be lead to

from the charge lay against he by marcus pomponius tribune of the people and though the means he take to effect this be somewhat violent and irregular so please to everyone be he filial piety and affection that not only do he escape rebuke but when military tribune have to be appoint he name be second on the list of those choose to explain he good fortune it will i think be useful to consider what be the method follow by the citizen of a republic in estimate the character of those on whom they bestow honor so as to see whether what i have already say on this head be true namely that a people be more discriminate in award honor than a prince i say then that in confer honor and office the people when it have no knowledge of a man from he public career follow the estimate give of he by the general voice and by common report or else be guide by some prepossession or preconceived opinion which it have adopt concern he such impression be form either from consideration of a man 's descent -lrb- it be assume until the contrary appear that where he ancestor have be great and distinguished citizen they descendant will resemble they -rrb- or else from regard to he manners and habit and nothing can be more in he favor than that he frequent the company of the grave and virtuous and such as be generally repute wise for as we can have no better clue to a man 's character than the company he keep he who frequent worthy company deservedly obtain a good name since there can hardly fail to be some similarity between himself and he associate sometimes however the popular estimate of a man be found on some remarkable and noteworthy action though not of public moment in which he have acquit himself well and of all the three cause which create a prepossession in a man 's favor none be so effectual as this last for the presumption that he will resemble he ancestor and kinsman be so often misleading that man be slow to trust and quick to discard it unless confirm by the personal worth of he of whom they be judge the criterion of character afford by a man 's manners and conversation be a safer guide than the presumption of inherit excellence but be far inferior to that afford by he action for until he have give actual proof of he worth he credit be build on mere opinion which may readily change but this third mode of judge which originate in and rest upon he action at once give he a name which can only be destroy by he afterwards do many action of a contrary nature those therefore who live in a republic should conform to this third criterion and endeavor as do many of the roman youth to make they start in life with some extraordinary achievement either by promote a law conducive to the general well-being or by accuse some powerful citizen as a transgressor of the law or by perform some similar new and notable action which can not fail to be much speak of action like this be necessary not only to lay a foundation for you fame but also to maintain and extend it to which end they must continually be renew as we find do by titus manlius throughout the whole course of he life for after win he earliest renown by he bold and singular defense of he father when some year have pass he fight he famous duel with the gaul from whom when he have slay he he take the twist golden collar which give he the name of torquatus nor be this the last of he remarkable action for at a later period when he be of ripe year he cause he own son to be put to death because he have fight without leave although successfully which three action gain for he at the time a greater name and have make he more renown through after age than all he triumph and victory though of these he have as large a share as fall to the lot of any other roman the explanation of which be that while in he victory manlius have many who resemble he in these particular action he stand almost or entirely alone so too with the elder scipio all whose victory together do not obtain for he so much reputation as do he rescue while he be yet young of he father at the ticino and he undaunted bearing after the rout at cannæ when with he naked sword he constrain a number of the roman youth to swear never to abandon they country as some among they have before be mind to do it be these two action therefore which lay the foundation of he future fame and pave the way for he triumph in spain and africa and the fair esteem in which man hold he be still further heighten when in spain he restore a daughter to she father a wife to she husband nor be it only the citizen who seek reputation as lead to civil honor who must act in this way the prince who would maintain he credit in he princedom must do likewise since nothing help so much to make a prince esteem as to give signal proof of he worth whether by word or by deed which tend to promote the public good and show he to be so magnanimous generous and just that he may well pass into a proverb among he subject but to return to the point whence i digress i say that if a people when they first confer honor on a fellow-citizen rest they judgment on any one of the three circumstance above-mentioned they build on a reasonable foundation but when many instance of noble conduct have make a man favourably know that the foundation be still better since then there be hardly room for mistake i speak merely of those honor which be bestow on a man at the outset of he career before he have come to be know by continue proof or be find to have pass from one kind of conduct to another and dissimilar kind and i maintain that in such case so far as erroneous judgment or corrupt motive be concern a people will always commit fewer mistake than a prince but since a people may happen to be deceive as regard the character reputation and action of a man think they better or greater than in truth they be a error a prince be less likely to fall into from he be inform and warn by he adviser in order that the people may not lack similar advice wise founder of republic have provide that when the highest dignity of the state to which it would be dangerous to appoint incapable man have to be fill up and it appear that some incapable man be the object of the popular choice it shall be lawful and account honorable for any citizen to declare in the public assembly the defect of the favored candidate that the people be make acquaint therewith may be better able to judge of he fitness that this be the practice in rome we have proof in the speech make by fabius maximus to the people during the second punic war when in the appointment of consul public favor lean towards titus ottacilius for fabius judge he unequal to the duty of the consulship at such a crisis speak against he and point out he insufficiency and so prevent he appointment turn the popular favor towards another who deserve it more in the choice of its magistrate therefore a people judge of those among whom it have to choose in accordance with the surest indication it can get and when it can be advise as prince be make fewer mistake than they but the citizen who would make a beginning by gain the good-will of the people must to obtain it perform like titus manlius some noteworthy action chapter xxxv -- _ of the danger incur in be the first to recommend new measure and that the more unusual the measure the greater the danger _ how perilous a thing it be to put one 's self at the head of change whereby many be affect how difficult to guide and bring they to perfection and when perfect to maintain they be too wide and arduous a subject to be treat here wherefore i reserve it for a fitter occasion and shall now speak only of those danger which be incur by the citizen of a republic or by the counsellor of a prince in be the first to promote some grave and important measure in such manner that the whole responsibility attend it rest with they for as man judge of thing by they result any evil which ensue from such measure will be imputed to they author and although if good ensue he will be applaud nevertheless in matter of this kind what a man may gain be as nothing to what he may lose selim the present sultan or grand turk as he be call be in readiness as some who come from he country relate to set forth on a expedition against egypt and syrium be urge by one of he bashaw whom he have station on the confines of persium to make war upon the sofus in compliance with which advice he go on this new enterprise with a vast army but come to a great plain wherein be many desert and few stream and encounter the same difficulty as in ancient time have prove the ruin of many roman army he suffer so much from pestilence and famine that although victorious in battle he lose a great part of he man this so enraged he against the bashaw on whose advice he have act that he forthwith put he to death in like manner we read of many citizen who have strenuously promote various measure be banish when these turn out badly certain citizen of rome for instance be very active in forwarding a law allow the appointment of a plebeian to be consul this law pass it so happen that the first plebeian consul who go forth with the army be route and have it not be that the party in whose behalf the law be make be extremely powerful its promoter would have fare badly it be plain therefore that the counsellor whether of a republic or of a prince stand in this dilemma that if they do not conscientiously advise whatsoever they think advantageous for they city or prince they fail in they duty if they do advise it they risk they place and they life all man be subject to this infirmity of judge advice by the event when i consider in what way this reproach or this danger may best be escape i find no other remedy to recommend than that in give advice you proceed discreetly not identify yourself in a special manner with the measure you would see carry out but offer you opinion without heat and support it temperately and modestly so that if the prince or city follow it they shall do so of they own good-will and not seem to be drag into it by you importunity when you act thus neither prince nor people can reasonably bear you a grudge in respect of the advice give by you since that advice be not adopt contrary to the general opinion for you danger lie in many have oppose you who afterwards should you advice prove hurtful combine to ruin you and although in take this course you fall short of the glory which be earn by he who stand alone against many in urge some measure which succeed you have nevertheless two advantage to make up for it : first that you escape danger and second that when you have temperately state you view and when in consequence of opposition you advice have not be take should other counsel prevail and mischief come of they you credit will be vastly enhance and although credit gain at the cost of misfortune to you prince or city can not be matter of rejoice still it be something to be take into account on this head then i know of no other advice to offer for that you should be silent and express no opinion at all be a course hurtful for you prince or city and which would not absolve you from danger since you would soon grow to be suspect when it might fare with you as with the friend of perseus the macedonian king for perseus be defeat by paulus emilius and make he escape with a few companion it happen that one of they in review the past begin to point out to the king many mistake which he have make and which have be he ruin whereupon perseus turn upon he say _ traitor hast thou wait till now when there be no remedy to tell I these thing _ and so say slew he with he own hand such be the penalty incur by one who be silent when he should have speak and who speak when he should have be silent and who find no escape from danger in have refrain from give advice wherefore i believe that the course which i have recommend should be observe and follow chapter xxxvi -- _ why it have be and still may be affirm of the gaul that at the beginning of a fray they be more than man but afterwards less than woman _ the bravery of the gaul who on the bank of the anio challenge any among the roman to fight with he and the combat that thereupon ensue between he and titus manlius remind I of what titus livius oftener than once observe in he history that _ at the beginning of a fray the gaul be more than man but ere it be end show themselves less than woman _ touch the cause of this many be content to believe that such be they nature which indeed i take to be true but we be not therefore to assume that the natural temper which make they brave at the outset may not be so trained and regulate as to keep they brave to the end and to prove this i say that army be of three kind in one of these you have discipline with bravery and valor as its consequence such be the roman army which be show by all historian to have maintain excellent discipline as the result of constant military training and because in a well-disciplined army none must do anything save by rule we find that in the roman army from which as it conquer the world all other should take example none either eat or sleep or buy or sell or do anything else whether in he military or in he private capacity without order from the consul those army which do otherwise be not true army and if ever they have any success it be owe to the fury and impetuosity of they onset and not to train and steady valor but of this impetuosity and fury trained valor when occasion require will make use nor will any danger daunt it or cause it to lose heart its courage be keep alive by its discipline and its confidence feed by the hope of victory which never fail it while that discipline be maintain but the contrary happen with army of the second sort those namely which have impetuosity without discipline as be the case with the gaul whose courage in a protracted conflict gradually wear away so that unless they succeed in they first attack the impetuosity to which they trust have no support from disciplined valor soon cool when as they have nothing else to depend on they effort cease the roman on the other hand be less disquiet in danger by reason of they perfect discipline and never lose hope fight steadily and stubbornly to the last and with the same courage at the end as at the outset nay grow heat by the conflict only become the fiercer the longer it be continue in army of the third sort both natural spirit and trained valor be want and to this class belong the italian army of we own time of which it may be affirm that they be absolutely worthless never obtain a victory save when by some accident the enemy they encounter take to flight but since we have daily proof of this absence of valor it be needless to set forth particular instance of it that all however may know on the testimony of titus livius what method a good army should take and what be take by a bad army i shall cite the word he represent papirius cursor to have use when urge that fabius he master of the knight should be punish for disobedience and denounce the consequence which would ensue be he absolve say : -- _ let neither god nor man be hold in reverence let the order of captain and the divine auspices be alike disregard let a vagrant soldiery range without leave through the country of friend or foe reckless of they military oath let they disband at they pleasure let they forsake they desert standard and neither rally nor disperse at the word of command let they fight when they choose by day or by night with or without advantage of ground with or without the bidding of they leader neither maintain they rank _ nor observe the order of battle and let we army from be a solemn and consecrated company grow to resemble some dark and fortuitous gathering of cut-throat _ with this passage before we it be easy to pronounce whether the army of we time be _ a dark and fortuitous gathering _ or _ a solemn and consecrated company _ nay how far they fall short of anything worthy to be call a army possess neither the impetuous but disciplined valor of the roman nor even the mere undisciplined impetuosity of the gaul chapter xxxvii -- _ whether a general engagement should be precede by skirmish and how avoid these we may get knowledge of a new enemy _ besides all the other difficulty which hinder man from bring anything to its utmost perfection it appear as i have already observe that in close vicinity to every good be find also a evil so apt to grow up along with it that it be hardly possible to have the one without accept the other this we see in all human affair and the result be that unless fortune aid we to overcome this natural and common disadvantage we never arrive at any excellence i be remind of this by the combat between titus manlius and the gaul concern which livius write that it _ determine the issue of the entire war since the gaul abandon they camp hastily withdraw to the country about tivolus whence they presently pass into campanium _ it may be say therefore on the one hand that a prudent captain ought absolutely to refrain from all those operation which while of trifling moment in themselves may possibly produce a ill effect on he army now to engage in a combat wherein you risk you whole fortune without put forth you entire strength be as i observe before when condemn the defense of a country by guard its defile a utterly foolhardy course on the other hand it be to be say that a prudent captain when he have to meet a new and redoubtable adversary ought before come to a general engagement to accustom he man by skirmish and passage of arm to the quality of they enemy that they may learn to know he and how to deal with he and so free themselves from the feeling of dread which he name and fame inspire this for a captain be a matter of the very greatest importance and one which it might be almost fatal for he to neglect since to risk a pitched battle without first give you soldier such opportunity to know they enemy and shake off they fear of he be to rush on certain destruction when valerius corvinus be send by the roman with they army against the samnite these be new adversary with whom up to that time they have not measure they strength titus livius tell we that before give battle he make he man make trial of the enemy in several unimportant skirmish _ lest they should be dismay by a new foe and a new method of warfare _ nevertheless there be very great danger that if you soldier get the worst in these encounter they alarm and self-distrust may be increase and a result follow contrary to that intended namely that you dispirit where you mean to reassure this therefore be one of those case in which the evil lie so nigh the good and both be so mixed up together that you may readily lay hold of the one when you think to grasp the other and with regard to this i say that a good captain should do what he can that nothing happen which might discourage he man nor be there anything so likely to discourage they as to begin with a defeat for which reason skirmish be as a rule to be avoid and only to be allow where you fight to great advantage and with a certainty of victory in like manner no attempt should be make to defend the pass lead into you country unless you whole army can co-operate nor be any town to be defend save those whose loss necessarily involve you ruin and as to those town which you do defend you must so arrange both in respect of the garrison within and the army without that in the event of a siege you whole force can be employ all other town you must leave undefended for provide you army be keep together you do not in lose what you voluntarily abandon forfeit you military reputation or sacrifice you hope of final success but when you lose what it be you purpose and what all know it be you purpose to hold you suffer a real loss and injury and like the gaul on the defeat of they champion you be ruin by a mishap of no moment in itself philip of macedon the father of perseus a great soldier in he day and of a great name on be invade by the roman lay waste and relinquish much of he territory which he think he could not defend rightly judge it more hurtful to he reputation to lose territory after a attempt to defend it than to abandon it to the enemy as something he care little to retain so likewise after the battle of cannæ when they affair be at they worst the roman refuse aid to many subject and protected state charge they to defend themselves as best they could and this be a better course than to undertake to defend and then to fail for by refuse to defend you lose only you friend whereas in fail you not only lose you friend but weaken yourself but to return to the matter in hand i affirm that even when a captain be constrain by inexperience of he enemy to make trial of he by means of skirmish he ought first to see that he have so much the advantage that he run no risk of defeat or else and this be he better course he must do as marius do when send against the cimbrian a very courageous people who be lay italy waste and by they fierceness and number and from the fact of they have already route a roman army spread terror wherever they come for before fight a decisive battle marius judge it necessary to do something to lessen the dread in which these enemy be hold by he army and be a prudent commander he on several occasion post he man at point where the cimbrian must pass that see and grow familiar with they appearance while themselves in safety and within the shelter of they intrenched camp and find they to be a mere disorderly rabble encumber with baggage and either without weapon or with none that be formidable they might at last assume courage and grow eager to engage they in battle the part thus prudently take by marius should be carefully imitate by other who would escape the danger above speak of and not have to betake themselves like the gaul to a disgraceful flight on sustain some trifling defeat but since in this discourse i have refer by name to valerius corvinus in my next chapter i shall cite he word to show what manner of man a captain ought to be chapter xxxviii -- _ of the quality of a captain in whom he soldier can confide _ valerius corvinus as i have say already be send in command of a army against the samnite who be then new enemy to rome wherefore to reassure he soldier and familiarize they with they adversary he make they engage with they in various unimportant passage of arm but not think this enough he resolve before deliver battle to address he man and by remind they of they valor and he own to make it plain how little they should esteem such enemy and from the word which titus livius put in he mouth we may gather what manner of man the captain ought to be in whom a army will put its trust for he make he say : -- _ bear ye also this in mind under whose conduct and auspices you be about to fight and whether he whom you be to obey be great only in exhort bold only in word and all unpractised in arm or whether he be one who himself know how to use he spear to march before the eagle and play he part in the thickest of the fight soldier i would have you follow my deed and not my word and look to I for example rather than for command for with this right hand i have win for myself three consulship and a unsurpassed renown _ which word rightly understand give every one to know what he must do to merit a captain 's rank and if any man obtain it by other means he will soon discover that advancement due to chance or intrigue rather take away than bring reputation since it be man who give lustre to title and not title to man from what have be say it will likewise be understand that if great captain when match against a unfamiliar foe have have to resort to unusual method for reassure the mind even of veteran soldier much more will it be necessary for they to use all they address when in command of a raw and untried army which have never before look a enemy in the face for if a unfamiliar adversary inspire terror even in a veteran army how much greater must be the terror which any army will inspire in the mind of untrained man and yet we often find all these difficulty overcome by the supreme prudence of a great captain like the roman gracchus or the theban epaminonda of whom i have before speak who with untried troops defeat the most practiced veteran and the method they be say to have follow be to train they man for some month in mimic warfare so as to accustom they to discipline and obedience after which they employ they with complete confidence on actual service no man therefore of warlike genius need despair of create a good army if only he have the man for the prince who have many subject and yet lack soldier have only to thank he own inertness and want of foresight and must not complain of the cowardice of he people chapter xxxix -- _ that a captain should have good knowledge of place _ among other qualification essential in a good captain be a knowledge both general and particular of place and country for without such knowledge it be impossible for he to carry out any enterprise in the best way and while practice be need for perfection in every art in this it be need in the highest degree such practice or particular knowledge as it may be term be sooner acquire in the chase than in any other exercise and accordingly we find it say by ancient historian that those hero who in they day rule the world be breed in the wood and train to the chase for this exercise not merely give the knowledge i speak of but teach countless other lesson needful in war and xenophon in he life of cyrus tell we that cyrus on he expedition against the king of armenia when assign to each of he follower the part he be to perform remind they that the enterprise on which they be engage differ little from one of those hunting expedition on which they have go so often in he company liken those who be to lie in ambush in the mountain to the man send to spread the toil on the hill-top and those who be to overrun the plain to the beater whose business it be to start the game from its lair that it may be drive into the toil now this be related to show how in the opinion of xenophon the chase be a mimic representation of war and therefore to be esteem by the great as useful and honorable nor can that knowledge of country which i have speak of as necessary in a commander be obtain in any convenient way except by the chase for he who join therein gain a special acquaintance with the character of the country in which it be follow and he who have make himself specially familiar with one district will afterwards readily understand the character of any strange country into which he come for all country and the district of which they be make up have a certain resemblance to one another so that from a knowledge of one we can pass easily to the knowledge of another he therefore who be without such practical acquaintance with some one country can only with difficulty and after a long time obtain a knowledge of another while he who possess it can take in at a glance how this plain spread how that mountain slope whither that valley wind and all other like particulars in respect of which he have already acquire a certain familiarity the truth of what i affirm be show by titus livius in the case of publius decius who be military tribune in the army which the consul cornelius lead against the samnite when the consul advance into a defile where the roman army be like to be shut in by the enemy perceive the great danger they run and note as livius relate a hill which rise by a steep ascent and overhang the enemy 's camp and which though hard of access for heavy-armed troops present little difficulty to troops lightly armed turn to the consul and say : -- _ seest thou aulus cornelius yonder height over above the enemy which they have be blind enough to neglect there be we manfully to seize it might we find the citadel of we hope and of we safety _ whereupon he be send by the consul with three thousand man to secure the height and so save the roman army and as it be part of he plan to make he own escape and carry off he man safely under shelter of night livius represent he as say to he soldier : -- _ come with I that while daylight still serve we may learn where the enemy have post they guard and by what exit we may issue hence _ accordingly put on the cloak of a common soldier lest the enemy should observe that a officer be make he round he survey they camp in all direction now any one who carefully study the whole of this passage must perceive how useful and necessary it be for a captain to know the nature of place which knowledge have decius not possess he could not have decide that it would be for the advantage of the roman army to occupy this hill nor could he have judge from a distance whether the hill be accessible or no and when he reach the summit and desire to return to the consul since he be surround on all side by the enemy he never could have distinguish the path it be safe for he to take from those guard by the foe for all which reason it be absolutely essential that decius should have that thorough knowledge which enable he by gain possession of this hill to save the roman army and to discover a path whereby in the event of he be attack he and he follower might escape chapter xl -- _ that fraud be fair in war _ although in all other affair it be hateful to use fraud in the operation of war it be praiseworthy and glorious so that he who get the better of he enemy by fraud be as much extol as he who prevail by force this appear in the judgment pass by such as have write of the life of great warrior who praise hannibal and those other captain who have be most note for act in this way but since we may read of many instance of such fraud i shall not cite they here this however i desire to say that i would not have it understand that any fraud be glorious which lead you to break you plighted word or to depart from covenant to which you have agree for though to do so may sometimes gain you territory and power it can never as i have say elsewhere gain you glory the fraud then which i here speak of be that employ against a enemy who place no trust in you and be wholly direct to military operation such as the stratagem of hannibal at the lake of thrasymene when he feign flight in order to draw the roman consul and he army into a ambuscade or when to escape from the hand of fabius maximus he fasten light to the horn of he ox similar to the above be the deceit practice by pontius the samnite commander to inveigle the roman army into the caudine fork for after he have draw up he force behind the hill he send out a number of he soldier disguise as herdsman to drive great herd of cattle across the plain who be capture by the roman and interrogate as to where the samnite army be all of they as they have be teach by pontius agree in say that it have go to besiege nocera : which be believe by the consul lead they to advance within the caudine valley where no sooner be they come than they be beset by the samnite and the victory thus win by a fraud would have be most glorious for pontius have he but take the advice of he father herennius who urge that the roman should either be set at liberty unconditionally or all be put to death but that a mean course _ which neither gain friend nor get rid of foe _ should be avoid and this be sound advice for as have already be show in affair of moment a mean course be always hurtful chapter xli -- _ that we country be to be defend by honor or by dishonor and in either way be well defend _ the consul together with the whole roman army fall as i have relate into the hand of the samnite who impose on they the most ignominious term insist that they should be strip of they arm and pass under the yoke before they be allow to return to rome the consul be astounded by the harshness of these condition and the whole army overwhelm with dismay lucius lentulus the roman lieutenant stand forward and say that in he opinion they ought to decline no course whereby they country might be save and that as the very existence of rome depend on the preservation of she army that army must be save at any sacrifice for whether the means be honorable or ignominious all be well do that be do for the defense of we country and he say that be she army preserved rome in course of time might wipe out the disgrace but if she army be destroy however gloriously it might perish rome and she freedom would perish with it in the event he counsel be follow now this incident deserve to be note and ponder over by every citizen who be call on to advise he country for when the entire safety of we country be at stake no consideration of what be just or unjust merciful or cruel praiseworthy or shameful must intervene on the contrary every other consideration be set aside that course alone must be take which preserve the existence of the country and maintain its liberty and this course we find follow by the people of france both in they word and in they action with the view of support the dignity of they king and the integrity of they kingdom for there be no remark they listen to with more impatience than that this or the other course be disgraceful to the king for they king they say can incur no disgrace by any resolve he may take whether it turn out well or ill and whether it succeed or fail all maintain that he have act as a king should chapter xlii -- _ that promise make on compulsion be not to be observe _ when after be subject to this disgrace the consul return to rome with they disarm legion spurius posthumius himself one of the consul be the first to contend in the senate that the term make in the caudine valley be not to be observe for he argue that the roman people be not bind by they though he himself doubtless be together with all the other who have promise peace wherefore if the people desire to set themselves free from every engagement he and all the rest who have give this promise must be make over as prisoner into the hand of the samnite and so steadfastly do he hold to this opinion that the senate be content to adopt it and send he and the rest as prisoner back to samnium protest to the samnite that the peace be not binding and so kind be fortune to posthumius on this occasion that the samnite would not keep he as a prisoner and that on he return to rome notwithstanding he defeat he be hold in higher honor by the roman than the victorious pontius by he countryman here two point be to be note first that glory may be win by any action for although commonly it follow upon victory it may also follow on defeat if this defeat be see to have happen through no fault of yours or if directly after you perform some valiant action which cancel it the other point to be note be that there be no disgrace in not observe promise wring from you by force for promise thus extort when they affect the public welfare will always be break so soon as the pressure under which they be make be withdraw and that too without shame on the part of he who break they of which we read many instance in history and find they constantly occur at the present day nay as between prince not only be such compulsory promise break when the force which extort they be remove but all other promise as well be in like manner disregard when the cause which lead to they no longer operate whether this be a thing to be commend or no and whether such method ought or ought not to be follow by prince have already be consider by I in my _ treatise of the prince _ wherefore i say no more on that subject here chapter xliii -- _ that man bear in the same province retain through all time nearly the same character _ the wise be wont to say and not without reason or at random that he who would forecast what be about to happen should look to what have be since all human event whether present or to come have they exact counterpart in the past and this because these event be bring about by man whose passion and disposition remain in all age the same naturally give rise to the same effect although doubtless the operation of these cause take a higher form now in one province and now in another accord to the character of the training wherein the inhabitant of these province acquire they way of life another aid towards judge of the future by the past be to observe how the same nation long retain the same custom remain constantly covetous or deceitful or similarly stamp by some one vice or virtue any one read the past history of we city of florence and note what have recently befall it will find the french and german nation overflow with avarice pride cruelty and perfidy all of which four vice have at diver time work much harm to we city as a instance of they perfidy every one know how often payment of money be make to charle viii of france in return for which he engage to restore the fortress of pisa yet never do restore they manifest thereby he bad faith and grasp avarice or to pass from these very recent event all may have hear of what happen in the war in which the florentine be involve with the viscontus duke of milan when florence be leave without other resource resolve to invite the emperor into italy that she might be assist by he name and power in she struggle with lombardy the emperor promise to come with a strong army to take part against the viscontus and to protect florence from they on condition that the florentine pay he a hundred thousand ducat on he set out and another hundred thousand on he arrival in italy to which term the florentine agree but although he then receive payment of the first instalment and afterwards on reach verona of the second he turn back from the expedition without effect anything allege as he excuse that he be stop by certain person who have fail to fulfil they engagement but if florence have not be urge by passion or overcome by necessity or have she read of and understand the ancient usage of the barbarian she would neither on this nor on many other occasion have be deceive by they see that these nation have always be of the same character and have always in all circumstance and with all man alike use the same method for in ancient time we find they behave after the same fashion to the etruscan who when overpower by the roman by whom they have be repeatedly route and put to flight perceive that they could not stand without help enter into a compact with the gaul dwelling in the part of italy south of the alp to pay they a certain sum if they would unite with they in a campaign against the roman but the gaul after take they money refuse to arm on they behalf allege that they have not be pay to make war on the enemy of the etruscan but only to refrain from pillage they land and thus the people of etrurium through the avarice and perfidy of the gaul be at once defraud of they money and disappointed of the help which they have count on obtain from which two instance of the etruscan in ancient time and of the florentine in recent we may see that barbaric race have constantly follow the same method and may easily draw we conclusion as to how far prince should trust they chapter xliv -- _ that where ordinary method fail hardihood and daring often succeed _ when attack by the roman the samnite as they could not without help stand against they in the field resolve to leave garrison in the town of samnium and to pass with they main army into etrurium that country be then at truce with rome and thus ascertain whether they actual presence in arm might not move the etruscan to renew hostility against rome which they have refuse to renew when invite through envoy during the negotiation which on this occasion pass between the two nation the samnite in explain the chief cause that lead they to take up arm use the memorable word -- _ they have rise because peace be a heavier burthen for slave than war for freeman _ in the end partly by they persuasion and partly by the presence of they army they induce the etruscan to join force with they here we be to note that when a prince would obtain something from another he ought if the occasion allow to leave he no time to deliberate but should so contrive that the other may see the need of resolve at once as he will if he perceive that refusal or delay in comply with what be ask of he will draw upon he a sudden and dangerous resentment this method we have see employ with good effect in we own time by pope julius ii in deal with france and by m de foix the general of the french king in deal with the marquis of mantua for pope julius desire to expel the bentivoglus from bologna and think that for this purpose he need the help of french troops and to have the venetian neutral after sound both and receive from both hesitate and ambiguous answer determine to make both fall in with he view by give they no time to oppose he and so set forth from rome with as strong a force as he could get together he march on bologna send word to the venetian that they must stand aloof and to the king of france to send he troops the result be that in the brief time allow they neither of the two power could make up they mind to thwart he and know that refusal or delay would be violently resent by the pope they yield to he demand the king send he soldier and the venetian maintain neutrality m de foix again be with the king 's army in bologna when word come that brescium have rise could not rest till he have recover that town but to get there he have to choose between two route one long and circuitous lead through the territory of the king the other short and direct in take the latter route however not only would he have to pass through the dominion of the marquis of mantua but also to make he way into these through the lake and marsh wherewith that country abound by follow a embanked road close and guard by the marquis with fort and other defensive work resolve nevertheless to take the shortest road at all hazard he wait till he man be already on they march before signify to the marquis that he desire leave to pass through he country so that no time might be leave he to deliberate take aback by the unexpected demand the marquis give the leave seek which he never would have give have de foix act with less impetuosity for he be in league with the venetian and with the pope and have a son in the hand of the latter all which circumstance would have afford he fair pretext for refusal but carry away by the suddenness and urgency of the demand he yield and in like manner the etruscan yield to the instance of the samnite the presence of whose army decide they to renew hostility which before they have decline to renew chapter xlv -- _ whether in battle it be better to await and repel the enemy 's attack or to anticipate it by a impetuous onset _ decius and fabius the roman consul be each of they in command of a separate army one direct against the samnite the other against the etruscan : and as both deliver battle we have to pronounce in respect of the two engagement which commander follow the better method decius attack he enemy at once with the utmost fury and with he whole strength fabius be content at first merely to maintain he ground for judge that more be to be gain by a later attack he reserve he force for a final effort when the ardor of the enemy have cool and he energy spend itself the event show fabius to be more successful in he tactic than decius who be exhaust by he first onset and see he rank begin to waver to secure by death the glory he could no longer hope from victory follow the example set he by he father and sacrifice himself to save the roman legion word whereof be bring to fabius he to gain while he yet live as much honor as the other have earn by he death push forward all the troops he have reserve for he final effort and so obtain a unexampled victory whence we see that of the two method that of fabius be the safer and the more deserving we imitation chapter xlvi -- _ how the characteristic of family come to be perpetuate _ manners and institution differ in different city seem here to produce a harder and there a softer race and a like difference may also be discern in the character of different family in the same city and while this hold good of all city we have many instance of it in read the history of rome for we find the manlius always stern and stubborn the valerius kindly and courteous the claudius haughty and ambitious and many family besides similarly distinguish from one another by they peculiar quality these quality we can not refer wholly to the _ blood _ for that must change as a result of repeat intermarriage but must ascribe rather to the different training and education give in different family for much turn on whether a child of tender year hear a thing well or ill speak of since this must need make a impression on he whereby he whole conduct in after life will be influence be it otherwise we should not have find the whole family of the claudius move by the desire and stir by the passion which titus livius note in many of they and more especially in one hold the office of censor who when he colleague lay down he magistracy as the law prescribe at the end of eighteen month would not resign maintain that he be entitle to hold the office for five year in accordance with the original law by which the censorship be regulate and although he refusal give occasion to much controversy and breed great tumult and disturbance no means could be find to depose he from he office which he persist in retain in opposition to the will of the entire common and a majority of the senate and any who shall read the speech make against he by publius sempronius tribune of the people will find therein all the claudian insolence expose and will recognize the docility and good temper show by the body of the citizen in respect the law and institution of they country chapter xlvii -- _ that love of he country should lead a good citizen to forget private wrong _ while command as consul against the samnite manlius be wound in a skirmish he army be thereby endanger the senate judge it expedient to send papirius cursor as dictator to supply he place but as it be necessary that the dictator should be nominate by fabius the other consul who be with the army in etrurium and as a doubt be feel that he might refuse to nominate papirius who be he enemy the senate send two messenger to entreat he to lay aside private animosity and make the nomination which the public interest require move by love of he country fabius do as he be ask although by he silence and by many other sign he give it to be know that compliance be distasteful from he conduct at this juncture all who would be think good citizen should take example chapter xlviii -- _ that on find a enemy make what seem a grave blunder we should suspect some fraud to lurk behind _ the consul have go to rome to perform certain ceremonial rite and fulvius be leave in charge of the roman army in etrurium the etruscan to see whether they could not circumvent the new commander plant a ambush not far from the roman camp send forward soldier disguise as shepherd drive large flock of sheep so as to pass in sight of the roman army these pretend shepherd come close to the wall of he camp fulvius marvelling at what appear to he unaccountable audacity hit upon a device whereby the artifice of the etruscan be detect and they design defeat here it seem proper to note that the captain of a army ought not to build on what seem a manifest blunder on the part of a enemy for as man be unlikely to act with conspicuous want of caution it will commonly be find that this blunder be cover to a fraud and yet so blind be man 's mind by they eagerness for victory that they look only to what appear on the surface after defeat the roman on the allium the gaul hasten on to rome find the gate of the city leave open and unguarded but fear some stratagem and be unable to believe that the roman could be so foolish and cowardly as to abandon they city they wait during the whole of that day and the follow night outside the gate without daring to enter in the year 1508 when the florentine avere engage in besiege pisa alfonso del mutolo a citizen of that town happen to be take prisoner be release on he promise to procure the surrender to the florentine of one of the gate of the city afterwards on pretence of arrange for the execution of this surrender he come repeatedly to confer with those whom the florentine commissary have depute to treat with he come not secretly but openly and accompany by other citizen of pisa whom he cause to stand aside while he converse with the florentine from all which circumstance he duplicity might have be suspect since have he mean to do as he have engage it be most unlikely that he should be negotiate so openly but the desire to recover possession of pisa so blind the florentine that they allow themselves to be conduct under he guidance to the lucca gate where through he treachery but to they own disgrace they lose a large number of they man and officer chapter xlix -- _ that a commonwealth to preserve its freedom have constant need of new ordinance of the service in respect of which quintius fabius receive the surname of maximus _ it must happen as i have already say in every great city that disorder need the care of the physician continually spring up and the graver these disorder be the greater will be the skill need for they treatment and if ever in any city most assuredly in rome we see these disorder assume strange and unexpected shape as when it appear that all the roman wife have conspire to murder they husband many of they be find to have actually administer poison and many other to have drug in readiness for the purpose of like nature be the conspiracy of the bacchanal discover at the time of the macedonian war wherein many thousand both man and woman be implicate and which have it not be find out or have the roman not be accustom to deal with large body of offender must have prove perilous for they city and indeed if the greatness of the roman republic be not declare by countless other sign as well as by the manner in which it cause its law to be observe it might be see in the character of the punishment which it inflict against wrong-doer for in vindicate justice it would not scruple or hesitate to put a whole legion to death to depopulate a entire city or send eight or ten thousand man at a time into banishment subject to the most stringent condition which have to be observe not by one of these exile only but by all as in the case of those soldier who fight unsuccessfully at cannæ who be banish to sicily subject to the condition that they should not harbor in town and should all eat standing but the most formidable of all they punishment be that whereby one man out of every ten in a entire army be choose by lot to be put to death for correct a great body of man no more effectual means could be devise because when a multitude have offend and the ringleader be not know all can not be punish they number be too great while to punish some only and leave the rest unpunished be unjust to those punish and a encouragement to those pass over to offend again but where you put to death a tenth choose by lot where all equally deserve death he who be punish will blame he unlucky fortune while he who escape will be afraid that another time the lot may be he and for that reason will be careful how he repeat he offence the poisoner and the bacchanal therefore be punish as they crime deserve although disorder like these occasion mischievous result in a commonwealth still they be not fatal since almost always there be time to correct they but no time be give in the case of disorder in the state itself which unless they be treat by some wise citizen will always bring a city to destruction from the readiness wherewith the roman confer the right of citizenship on foreigner there come to be so many new citizen in rome and possess of so large a share of the suffrage that the government itself begin to alter forsake those course which it be accustom to follow and grow estrange from the man to whom it have before look for guidance which be observe by quintius fabius when censor he cause all those new citizen to be class in four _ tribe _ that be reduce within this narrow limit they might not have it in they power to corrupt the entire state and this be a wisely contrived measure for without introduce any violent change it supply a convenient remedy and one so acceptable to the republic as to gain for fabius the well-deserved name of maximus the end end of
