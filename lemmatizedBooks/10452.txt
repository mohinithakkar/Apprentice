produce by kevin handy dave maddock josephine paoluccus and the online distribute proofread team peter 's mother new edition with introduction by mr henry de la pasture 1906 _ and i leave my youth behind for somebody else to find _ to the beloved memory of my only brother lt colonel walter floyd bonham dso to my american reader the author of peter 's mother have be bid of the publisher who have incur the responsibility of present she to the american public to write a preface to this edition of she novel she do so with the more diffidence because it have be impress upon she by more than one wiseacre that she novel treat of a life too narrow a atmosphere too circumscribe to be understand or appreciate by american reader no one can please everybody i suppose that no one except the old man in aesop 's fable ever try to do so but i venture to believe that to some american a sincere and truthful portrait of a typical englishwoman of a certain class may prove attractive as to we be the study of a david harum or other whose characteristic interest because -- and not in spite of -- they strangeness and unfamiliarity we do not recognize the type but as those who do have acknowledge the accuracy of the representation we read learn and enjoy make acquaintance with a individuality and surroundings foreign to we own experience there be hundred of englishwoman live life as isolate as guard from all practical knowledge of the outer world as entirely circumscribe as the life of lady mary crewy though they be not all unhappy on the contrary many diffuse content and kindness all around they and take it for grant that they own personal wish be of no account indeed it would seem that some cease to be aware what they own personal wish be with anxious eye fix on other -- the husband father son who dominate they -- they live to please to serve to nurse and to console revered certainly as queen of they tiny kingdom but also helpless as prisoner calm as fix star they regard -lrb- perhaps sometimes a little wistfully -rrb- the orbit of brighter planet and the flash of occasional meteor within they ken know that they own place be unchangeable -- immutable that the view of such woman be often narrow they prejudice many they convention tiresome who shall deny that they soul be pure and tender they heart open to kindness as be they hand to charity nobody who know the type will dispute they lack many advantage which they more independent sister -lrb- no less gifted with noble and womanly quality -rrb- enjoy but they possess a peculiar gentleness which be all they own whether it be adore or despise when one of they number happen to be cleverer larger mind more restless and impatient it may be by nature than she sister tragedy may ensue but not often habit and public opinion be strong restrainer stronger sometimes than even the most carefully inculcate abstract principle to turn to another phase of the story -- there be a time during the boer war when there be literally scarcely a woman in england who be not mourn the death of some man -- be he son brother or husband lover or friend -- and that time seem still very very recent to some of we the rights and wrong of a war have nothing to do with the sympathy all civilised man and woman extend to the soldier on both side who take part in it _ theirs not to reason why theirs but to do or die _ and whether they do or die the mingled suspense pride and anguish suffer by they women-kind rouse the pity of the world but most of all for the secret of sympathy be understand the pity of those who have suffer likewise so that such escapade as peter 's in the story be not very uncommon at that dark period -lrb- and have its foundation in fact -rrb- may have touch heart over here which will be unmoved on the other side of the atlantic i can not tell i have know very few american and though i have count those few among my friend they have be rarely meet my only knowledge of america have be glean from my observation of these and from read as it happen the favorite book of my childhood be with few exception american partly from association and partly because i count it the most truly delightful story of its kind that ever be write little woman have always retain its early place in my affection meg jo beth and amy be my oldest and dearest friend and when i think of they it be hard to believe that america could be a land of stranger to I after all i confess to a weakness for the wide wide world and a secret passion for queechy i love mr rutherford 's child and be always interested to hear what katy do whilst the very think of melbourne house thrill I with recollection of the joy i experienced therein but this be all by the way and for the egotism which be i fear I display in this foreword i can but plead not only the difficulty of write a preface at all when one have no personal inclination that way but the nervousness which must beset a writer who be directly address not a try and friendly public but a unknown and it may be less easily pleased and more critical audience it appear to I that it would be a simpler thing to write another book and i would rather do so i can only hope that some of the reader of peter 's mother if she be so happy as to find favor in american eye would rather i do so too in i which case i shall very joyfully try to gratify they wish and my own betty de la pasture peter 's mother chapter i above youlestone village overlook the valley and the river and the square-towered church stand barracombe house back by barracombe wood and own by sir timothy crewy of barracombe from the terrace before he window sir timothy could take a bird 's - eye view of he own property up the river and down the river while he also have the felicity of behold the estate of he most important neighbor colonel hewel of hewelscourt map out before he eye as plainly visible in detail as land on the opposite side of a narrow valley must always be he cast no envious glance at he neighbor 's property the youle be a boundary which none could dispute and which could only be conveniently cross by the ferry for the nearest bridge be seven mile distant at brawnton the old post-town from brawnton the coach still run once a week for the benefit of the outlying village and the single line of rail which thread the valley of the youle in the year 1900 be still a novelty to the inhabitant of this unfrequented part of devon sir timothy sometimes express a majestic pity for colonel hewel because the railway run through some of he neighbor 's best field and also because hewelscourt be on the wrong side of the river -- face due north -- and be almost bury in timber but colonel hewel be perfectly satisfy with he own situation though sorry for sir timothy who live within full view of the railway but be oblige to drive many mile round by brawnton bridge in order to reach the station the two gentleman seldom meet they live in different parish and administer justice in different direction sir timothy 's dignity do not permit he to make use of the ferry and he rarely drive further than brawnton or ride much beyond the boundary of he own estate he care only for farm whilst colonel hewel be devote to sport the crewy family have be squire of barracombe cultivate they own land and live upon they contentedly for century before the hewel have ever be hear of in devon as all the village know very well wherefore they regard the hewel with a mixture of good-natured contempt and kindly tolerance the contempt be because hewelscourt have be build within the memory of live man and only two generation of hewel bear therein the tolerance because the present owner though not a wealthy man be as liberal in he dealings as they squire be the reverse \* \* \* \* \* in the reign of charle i one peter crewy a adventurous younger son of this obscure but ancient devonshire family have gain local notoriety by raise a troop of enthusiastic

no breath of wind stir and the smoke from the cottage chimney be lie low in the valley hover over the river in the still air a few primrose peep out of sheltered corner under the hedge and hold out a timid promise of spring the doctor follow the red road which wind between sir timothy 's carefully enclose plantation of young larch pass the lodge gate which be badly in need of repair and enter the drive chapter ii the justice-room be a small apartment in the older portion of barracombe house the low window be heavily latticed and face west sir timothy sit before he writing-table which be heap with papers directory and map but he could no longer see to read or write he make a stiff pretence of rise to greet the doctor as he enter and then resume he elbow-chair the rapidly fail daylight show a large elderly rather pompous gentleman with a bald head grizzled whisker and heavy plebeian feature he face be smooth and unwrinkled as the face of prosperous and self-satisfied person sometimes be even after sixty which be the age sir timothy have attain dr blundell who sit opposite he patient be neither prosperous nor self-satisfied he dark clean-shaven face be deeply line care or over-work have furrow he brow and the rather unkempt lock of black hair which fall over it be streak with white from the deep-set brown eye look sadness and fatigue as well as a great kindness for he fellow-men i come the moment i receive you letter he say i have no idea you be back from london already dr blundell say sir timothy pompously when i take the very unusual step of leave home the day before yesterday i have resolve to follow the advice you give I i go to fulfil a appointment i have make with a specialist with sir jame power no with a man name herslett you may have hear of he hear of he ejaculate blundell why he be world-famous a new man very clever of course if anything a greater authority only i fancied you would perhaps prefer a older graver man no doubt i commit a breach of medical etiquette say sir timothy in self-satisfied tone but i fancy you might have write _ you _ version of the case to power ah you do exactly but i be determine to have a absolutely unbiassed opinion well say blundell gently well -- i get it that be all say sir timothy the triumph seem to die out of he voice be it -- unsatisfactory not from you point of view say the squire with a heavy jocularity which do not move the doctor to mirth i be bind to say he confirm you opinion exactly but he take a far more serious view of my case than you do do he say blundell turn away he head the operation you suggest as a possible necessity must be immediate he speak of it quite frankly as the only possible chance of save my life which be further endanger by every hour of delay fortunately say blundell cheerfully you have a fine constitution and you have live a healthy abstemious life that be all in you favor i be over sixty year of age say sir timothy coldly and the ordeal before I be a very severe one as you must be well aware i must take the risk of course but the less say about the matter the better dr blundell have always regard sir timothy crewy as a commonplace contradictory gentleman beset by prejudice which belong properly to a earlier generation and of singularly narrow sympathy and interest he believe he to be a upright man accord to he light which be not perhaps very brilliant light after all but he know he to be one whom few people find it possible to like partly on account of he arrogance which be excessive and partly on account of he want of consideration for the feeling of other which arise from lack of perception people be dislike more often for a bad manner than for a bad heart the one be they private possession -- the other they obtrude on they acquaintance sir timothy 's heart be not bad and he care less for be like than for be respect he be the offspring of a _ mésalliance _ and greatly over-estimate the importance in which he family be hold he imagine he would be look down upon for this mischance unless he keep people at a distance and in awe of he the idea be a foolish one no doubt but then sir timothy be not a wise man on the contrary he lifelong determination to keep himself loftily apart from he fellow-man have result in a almost extraordinary ignorance of the world he live in -- a world which sir timothy regard as a wild and misty place people largely and unnecessarily with savage and foreigner and chiefly remarkable for contain england as england justify its existence by hold devonshire and more especially barracombe sir timothy have never be send to school and owe such education as he possess almost entirely to he half-sister these lady be considerably he senior and have in turn be bring up at barracombe by they grandmother whose maxim they still quote and whose idea they have scarcely outgrow under the circumstance the narrowness of he outlook be perhaps hardly to be wonder at but the dull immovability and sense of importance which characterize he now seem to the doctor to be almost tragically charge with the typical matter-of-fact courage of the englishman who display neither fear nor emotion and who would regard with horror the suspicion that such repression might be heroic when be it to be say blundell to-morrow to-morrow and here say sir timothy dr herslett object but i insist i will not be ill in a strange house i shall recover far more rapidly -- if i be to recover -- among my people in my native air london stifle I i dislike crowd and noise i hate novelty if i be to die i will die at home herslett himself perform the operation of course yes he be to arrive at brawnton to-night and sleep there i shall send the carriage over for he and he assistant early to-morrow morning you of course will meet he here and the operation be to take place at eleven o'clock in he alarm lest the doctor might be move to express sympathy sir timothy speak with unusual severity dr blundell understand and be silent i send for you of course to let you know all this say sir timothy but i wish also to introduce you to my cousin john crewy who come down with I the qc exactly i have make he my executor and trustee and guardian of my son jointly with lady mary i presume say the doctor unguardedly certainly not say sir timothy stiffly lady mary have never be trouble with business matter that be why i urge john to come down with I in case -- anything -- happen to-morrow he support will be invaluable to she i have a high opinion of he he have succeed in life through he own energy and he be the only member of my family who have never apply to I for assistance i inquire the reason on the journey down for i know that at one time he be in very poor circumstance and he reply that he would rather have starve than have ask I for sixpence i call that a very proper spirit the doctor make no comment on the anecdote may i ask how lady mary be bear this suspense he ask lady mary know nothing of the matter say the squire rather peevishly you have not prepare she no and i particularly desire she and my sister should hear nothing of it if this be to be my last evening on earth i should not wish it to be cloud by tear and lamentation which might make it difficult for I to maintain my own self-command herslett say i be not to be agitate i shall bid they all good night just as usual in the morning i beg you will be good enough to make the necessary explanation lady mary need hear nothing of it till it be over for you know she never leave she room before twelve -- a habit i have often deplore but which be highly convenient on this occasion dr blundell reflect for a moment may i venture to remonstrate with you sir timothy he say i fear lady mary may be deeply shock and hurt at be thus exclude from you confidence in so serious a case should anything go wrong he add bluntly it would be difficult to account to she even for my own reticence sir timothy rise majestic from he chair you will say that _ i _ forbid you to make the communication he say with rather a displeased air i beg you pardon say dr blundell but -- i be not offend interrupted sir timothy mistake remonstrance for apology he be quite honestly incapable of suppose that he physician would presume to argue with he you do not very naturally understand lady mary 's disposition as well as i do he say almost graciously she have be sheltered from anxiety from trouble of every kind since she childhood to I more than a quarter of a century she senior she seem indeed still almost a child dr blundell color yet she be the mother of a grown-up son he say peter grown-up nonsense a schoolboy eighteen say the doctor shortly you do not wish he send for most certainly not the christmas holiday be only just over rest assure dr blundell say sir timothy with grim emphasis that i shall give peter no excuse for leave he work if i can help it there be a tap at the door the squire lower he voice and speak hurriedly if it be the canon tell he in confidence what i have tell you and say that i should wish he to be present to-morrow in he official capacity in case of -- it be the canon whose rosy good-humoured countenance appear in the doorway whilst sir timothy be yet speak i hope i be not interrupt he say but the lady desire I -- that be lady belstone and miss crewy desire I -- to let you know that tea be ready the canon have a innocent surprised face like a baby he be constitutionally timid and amiable and he dislike of argument or of a loud voice almost amount to fear sir timothy mistake he nervousness for proper respect and maintain a distant but condescending graciousness towards he i hear you come back by the afternoon train sir timothy a london outing be a rare thing for you i hope you enjoy yourself say the canon with a meaningless laugh i transact my business successfully thank you say sir timothy gravely bring back any fresh news of the war none at all i hear the call for more man have be respond to all over the country it be a fine thing so many young fellow ready and willing to lay down they life for they country very few young man i believe say sir timothy frigidly can resist any opportunity to be concern in brawling and bloodshed especially when it be legalize under the name of war my respect be reserve for the steady worker at home and how much peace would the steady worker at home enjoy without the brawler abroad to defend they i wonder cry the canon flush all over he rosy face and then suddenly falter as he meet the cold surprise of the squire 's gray eye i have some letter to finish before post time say sir timothy after a impressive short pause of displeasure i will join you presently dr blundell at the tea-table if you will return to the lady with canon birch sir timothy ring for light and he visitor close the door of the study behind they dr blundell 's backward glance show he the tall and portly form silhouette against the window the last gleam of daylight illuminate the iron-grey hair the face turn towards the hilltop where the spire of the skeleton larch be sharply outline against a clear western sky what make you harp upon the war man know what he opinion be the doctor ask vexedly as he stumble along the uneven stone passage towards the hall i do not exactly intend to do so but i declare the moment i see sir timothy every subject i wish to avoid seem to fly to the tip of my tongue say the poor canon apologetically though i have a reason for allude to the war to-night -- a good reason as i think you will acknowledge presently i want you advice doctor not for yourself i hope say the doctor absently come into the gun-room for one moment say birch it be very important do you know i have a letter from peter from peter why should _ you _ have a letter from peter say the doctor and he uninterested tone become alert i be sure i do not know why not i be always fond of peter say the canon humbly will you cast you eye over it you see it be write from eton and post two day later in london dr blundell read the letter which be write in a schoolboy hand and not guiltless of mistake in spelling _ dear canon birch _ _ as my father would not hear of my go out to south africa i have take the law into my own hand i write to my mother 's cousin lord ferry to ask he to include I in he yeomanry corps of course i let he suppose papa be willing and anxious which perhaps be a low-down game but i remember that all be fair in love and war and besides i consider papa very nearly a pro-boer we have order to sail on Friday which be sharp work but i should be eternally disgraced now if they stop I as my father never listen to reason far less to I you have better explain to he that if he be any regard for the honor of we name he be no choice leave i expect my mother have better not be tell till i be go or she will only fret over what can not be help i 'll write to she on board once we be safely start i know you be all right about the war so you can tell papa i be ashamed to be play football while fellow younger than I and fellow who can not shoot or ride as i can be go off to south africa every day _ _ yours affectionately _ _ peter crewy _ _ p _ -- _ hope you will not mind this job i do try to get papa 's leave fair and square first _ i always say peter be a fine fellow at bottom say canon birch anxiously scan the doctor 's frown face he be a infernal self-willed obstinate heartless young cub on top then say blundell he be a chip of the old block no doubt say the canon but still -- he admiration of peter 's boldness be perceptible in he voice -- he do not share he father 's reprehensible opinion on the subject of the war son generally begin life by differ from they father and end by imitate they say blundell sharply birch we must stop he i do not see how say the canon and he indulge in a gentle chuckle the young rascal have lay he plan too well he sail to-morrow i telegraph inquiry ferry ' horse be go by the _ rosmore castle _ to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock dr blundell make a involuntary movement which the canon do not perceive i do not relish the notion of break this news to sir timothy but i think we could consult together you and I how to do it say the innocent gentleman there be no doubt you know that it must be do at once or he can not get to southampton in time to see the boy off and forgive he i suppose even sir timothy will forgive he at such a moment god bless the lad dr blundell utter a exclamation that do not sound like a blessing look here birch he say this be no time to mince matter if the boy can not be stop -- and under the circumstance he be get we on toast -- he can not cry off active service -- _ as _ the boy can not be stop you must just keep this news to yourself but i must tell sir timothy you must _ not _ tell sir timothy though all my sympathy be with the boy -- for i be a patriot first and a parson afterwards -- god forgive I for say so say birch in a tremble voice yet i can not take the responsibility of keep peter 's father in ignorance of he action i see exactly what you mean of course sir timothy will make unpleasantness and very likely telegraph to he command officer and disgrace the poor boy before he comrade and shout at I a thing i can not bear and you kindly think to spare I -- and peter but i can not take the responsibility of keep it dark for all that say the canon shake he head regretfully _ i _ take the responsibility say the doctor shortly as sir timothy 's physician i forbid you to tell he be sir timothy ill the canon 's light eye grow rounder with alarm he be to undergo a dangerous operation to-morrow morning god bless my soul he desire this evening -- possibly he last on earth -- to be a calm and uncloud one say the doctor respect he wish birch as you would respect the wish of a die man do you mean he will not get over it say the canon in a horrified whisper you always want the _ t 's _ cross and the _ i 's _ dot say blundell impatiently of course there be a chance -- he only chance he be a d -- d plucky old fellow i never think to like sir timothy half so well as i do at this moment i hope i do not _ dislike _ any man falter the canon but -- exactly say the doctor dryly but what shall i do with peter 's letter say the unhappy recipient not one word to sir timothy agitation or distress of mind at such a moment would be the worst thing in the world for he but i can not let peter sail without a word to he people and he mother good god blundell be lady mary to lose husband and son in one day lady mary say the doctor bitterly be to be treat as usual like a child and tell nothing of she husband 's danger till it be over as for peter -- well devoted mother as she be she must be pretty well accustomed by this time to the captious indifference of she spoilt boy she will not be surprise though she may be hurt that he should coolly propose to set off without bid she good-bye could not we tell she in confidence about peter say the canon strike with a brilliant idea certainly not she would fly to he at once and leave sir timothy alone in he extremity could not we tell she in confidence about sir timothy i have allow sir timothy to understand that neither you nor i will betray he secret i be no hand at keep a secret say the canon unhappily nonsense canon nonsense say dr blundell lay a friendly hand on he shoulder no man in you profession or in mine ought to be able to say that pull yourself together hope for the best and play you part chapter iii john crewys look round the hall at barracombe house with curious interested eye it be divide from the outer vestibule on the western side of the building by a massive partition of dark oak and it retain the solid beam and panelled wall of elizabethan day but the oak have be barbarously paint grain and varnish only the staircase be so heavily and richly carve that it have defy the ingenuity of the comb engraver it occupy the further end of the hall opposite the entrance door and be light dimly by a small heavily lead stained-glass window the floor be likewise black polish with age and the labor of generation a deeply sunken nail-studded door lead into a low-ceiled library contain a finely carve frieze and cornice and a oak mantelpiece which john crewys earnestly desire to examine more closely the shield-of-arm above it bear the figure of 1603 but the hall itself be of a earlier date parallel to it be the suite of lofty modern green-shuttered reception-room which occupy the south front of the house and into which a opening have be cut through the massive wall next the chimney the character of the hall be however completely destroy by the decoration which have be bestow upon it and by the furniture and picture which fill it john crewys look round with more indignation than admiration at the home of he ancestor in the great oriel window stand a round mahogany table bear a bouquet of wax flower under a glass shade case of stuff bird ornament every available recess mahogany and horsehair chair be set stiffly round the wall at even distance a heap of fold moth-eaten rug and wrap disfigure a side-table and beneath it stand a row of clog and golosh round the wall hang full-length portrait of a early victorian date the artist have spend a couple of month at barracombe fifty year since and have paint three generation of the crewy family who be then gather together beneath its hospitable roof he diligence have be more remarkable than he ability at any other time john crewy would have laugh outright at this collection of work of art but the air be charge with tragedy and he could not laugh he seriousness commend he favourably have he know it to the two old lady he cousin sir timothy 's half-sister who be seat beside the great log fire and who regard he with approve eye for they stranger cousin have that extreme gentleness and courtesy of manner and regard which sometimes accompany unusual strength whether of character or of person it be a pity old lady belstone whisper to she spinster sister that john be not a crewy for he have a remarkably fine head and have he be but a little taller and slimmer would have be a credit to the family certainly john be not a crewy he possess neither gray eye nor a large nose nor the height which should be attain by every man and woman bearing that name accord to the family record but though only of middle size and rather square-shouldered he be nevertheless a distinguished-looking man with a finely shaped head and well-cut feature clean shave as a great lawyer ought to be with a firm and rather satirical mouth a broad brow and bright hazel eye set well apart and twinkle with humor no doubt john 's appearance have be a factor in he successful career the sister themselves well advance in the seventy speak of he and thought of he as a young man a boy who have succeed in life in spite of small means and a extravagant mother to whom he have be oblige to sacrifice he patrimony but though he carry he forty-five year lightly john crewy have leave he boyhood very far behind he he crisp dark hair be frost on the temple he stoop a little after the fashion of the desk-worker he wear pince-nez he manner though alert be compose and dignified the restlessness the nervous energy of youth have be replace by the calm confidence of middle age -- of test strength of ripe experience on he side john crewys feel very kindly towards the venerable lady who represent to he all the womankind of he own race both sister possess the family characteristic which he lack they be tall and surprisingly upright consider the weight of year which press upon they thin shoulder they retain the manners -- almost the speech -- of the eighteenth century to which the grandmother who be responsible for they upbringing have belong and with the exception of a very short experience of matrimony in lady belstone 's case they have always reside exclusively at barracombe lady belstone besides she widow dignity have the advantage of she sister in appearance mainly because she permit art in some degree to repair the ravages of time a stiff _ toupet _ of white curl crown the withered brow below a widow 's cap and when she smile which be not very often a double row of pearl be not unpleasantly display miss crewy have never succumb to the temptation of worldly vanity she scrupulously part she scanty gray lock above she polished forehead and care not how wide the parting grow if she wear a velvet bow upon she scalp it be as she truly say for decency and not for ornament and further she allow she wholesome ruddy cheek to fall in as she ever-lengthening tooth fall out the frequent explanation which ensue regard the seniority of the widow be a source of constant satisfaction to miss crewy and vexation to she sister you might be a hundred year old georgina she would angrily lament i very soon _ shall _ be a hundred year old isabellum if i live as long as my grandmother do miss crewy would triumphantly reply it be surprising to I that a woman who be never good-looking at the best of time should cling to she youth as you do it be more surprising to I that you should let yourself go to rack and ruin and never stretch out a hand to help yourself i be what god make I say the pious georgina whereas you do everything but paint you face isabellum and i have little doubt but what you will come to that by the time you be eighty but though they dispute hotly on occasion the sister generally preserve a unite front before the world and only argue since argue they must in the most polite and affectionate term the firelight shed its cheerful glow over the laden tea-table and be reflect in the silver urn and the crimson and gold and blue of the crown derby tea-set but the old lady though cast longing eye in the direction of the teapot religiously abstain from offer to touch it no john say miss crewy in a tone of exemplary patience i have make it a rule never to take upon myself any of the duty of hospitality in my dear brother 's house ever since he marry -- odd as it may seem when we remember how he use once to sit at this very table in he little bib and tucker whilst isabellum pour out he milk and i cut he bread and butter we _ both _ make the rule john say lady belstone mournfully or of course as the elder sister _ i _ should naturally pour out the tea in we dear lady mary 's absence of course of course say john crewys forgive I isabellum but we have discuss this point before say miss crewy though i can not deny we cousin be as he be a lawyer he opinion would carry weight but i think he will agree with _ I _ -- john smile -- that when the elder daughter of a house marry she forfeit she rights of seniority in that house and the next sister succeed to she place i should suppose that might be the case john bowing politely in the direction of the widow i never dispute the fact georgina it be as we cousin say self-evident say lady belstone return the bow but i have always maintain and always shall that when the married sister come back widow to the home of she father the privilege of birth be restore to she both sister turn shrewd expectant gray eye upon they cousin it be -- it be rather a nice point say john crewy as gravely as he could he welcome thankfully the timely interruption of a opening door and the entrance of canon birch and the doctor at the same moment from the archway which support the great oak staircase the butler enter carry light be she ladyship not yet return from she walk ash ask lady belstone with affected surprise she ladyship come in some time ago my lady and go to see sir timothy she leave word she be go upstairs to change she walking thing and would be down directly the sister greet the canon with effusion and dr blundell with frigid civility john crewys shake hand with both gentleman i be sorry i can not offer you tea canon birch until my sister-in-law come down say miss crewy we dear lady mary be so very unpunctual say lady belstone i dare say something have detain she say the canon good-humouredly it often happen that my sister and myself be keep wait a quarter of a hour or more for we tea we do not complain say lady belstone john crewys begin to feel a little sorry for lady mary as the sister appear inclined to devote themselves to they clerical visitor rather exclusively he draw near the recess to which dr blundell have retire and join he in the oriel window have you never be here before ask the doctor rather abruptly never say john crewys smile i understand my cousin be not much give to entertaining visitor i have never in fact see any of they but once before that be at sir timothy 's wedding twenty year ago barely nineteen say the doctor i believe it be nineteen since you remind I say john slightly astonished i remember think sir timothy a lucky man i dare say _ he _ look much about the same as he do now say the doctor well john say perhaps a little slimmer you know not much a iron-grey middle-aged-looking man no he have change very little he be bear elderly and he will die elderly say the doctor shortly neither the folly of youth nor the softening of age will ever be know to sir timothy he pause note the surprised expression of john 's face and add apologetically i be a native of these part i have know he all my life and i be -- only a stranger say john he hesitate and lower he voice you know why i come yes i know i be very glad you do come say the doctor he tone change here be lady mary he say john crewy be strike by the sudden illumination of dr blundell 's plain dark face the deeply sunken eye glow and the sadness and weariness of they expression be dispel he eye follow the direction of the doctor 's gaze and he own face immediately reflect the doctor 's interest lady mary be come down the wide staircase in the light of a group of wax candle hold by a tall bronze angel she be dress with almost rigid simplicity and she abundant light-brown hair be plainly part she be pale and even sad-looking but beautiful still with a delicate and regular profile soft blue eye and a sweet rather tremulous mouth john 's heart seem to contract within he and then beat fast with a sensation that be not entirely pity because those eye -- the bluest he remember that he have ever see -- bring back to he suddenly and vividly the memory of the exquisitely fresh and lovely girl who have marry she elderly guardian nineteen year since he recollect that some member of the crewy family have agree that lady mary setoun have do well for herself a penniless lass wus ' a lang pedigree for sir timothy be rich other have laugh and say that sir timothy be determine that he heir should be able to boast some of the bluest blood in scotland on they mother 's side -- but that he might have wait a little longer for he bride she be so young barely seventeen year old and so very lovely that john crewy have feel indignant with sir timothy whose appearance and manner do not attract he he be remind that the bride owe almost everything she possess in the world to she husband but he be not pacify the glance of the gay blue eye -- the laugh on the curved young mouth -- the glint of gold on the sunny brown hair -- have play havoc with john 's honest heart he have not a penny in the world at that time and could not have marry she if he would but from lady mary 's wedding he carry away in he breast a image -- a ideal -- which have perhaps help to keep he unwed during these later year of he successful career why do she look so sad john 's kind heart have melt somewhat towards sir timothy when the poor gentleman have seek he in he chamber on the previous day and appeal to he for help in he extremity he be sorry for he cousin in spite of the pompousness and arrogance with which sir timothy unconsciously do he best to alienate even those whom he most desire to attract he have come to devonshire at great inconvenience to himself in response to that appeal and in he hurry and he sympathy for he cousin 's trouble he have scarcely give a think to the momentary romance connect with he first and only meeting with lady mary yet now behold after nineteen year the look on she sweet face thrill he middle-aged bosom as it have thrill he young manhood john smile or think he smile as he come forward to be present once more to sir timothy 's wife but he be nevertheless rather pleased to find that he have not outgrow the power of be thus romantically attract i hope i be not late say the soft voice you see no one expect sir timothy to come home so soon and i be out be that cousin john we meet once before at my wedding you have not change a bit i remember you quite well say lady mary she come forward and hold out two welcome hand to she visitor john crewys bow over those little white hand and become suddenly conscious that he vague romantic sentiment have give place to a very real emotion -- a almost passionate anxiety to shield one so fair and gentle from the trouble which be threaten she and of which as he know she be perfectly unconscious the warmth of she impulsive welcome do not of course escape the keen eye of the sister-in-law which in such matter as these be quite undimmed by age why do not somebody pour out tea say lady mary we know you rights mary say miss crewy never shall it be say that dear timothy 's sister oust he wife from she proper place because she do not happen to be present to occupy it besides say lady belstone you have no doubt some excellent reason my love for the delay lady mary 's blue eye glance at john say quite plainly and beseechingly to he understand they be old and rather cranky but they do not mean to be unkind do forgive they and john smile reassuringly i be afraid i have not much excuse to offer she say ingenuously i be out late and i tire myself and then i hear sir timothy have come back so i go to see he and then i make haste to change my dress and it take a long time -- and that be all the three gentleman laugh forgivingly at this explanation and the two lady exchange shocked glance we cousin john do he best to entertain we and we he say lady belstone stiffly he best -- and how good that must be say lady mary with pretty spirit the great counsel whose eloquence be listen to with breathless attention in crowded court and read at every breakfast-table in england that be a very delightful picture of the life of a briefless barrister say john crewys smile mary say miss crewy in lowered tone of reproof i understand that _ divorce _ case unhappily occupy the greater part of we cousin john 's attention we have hear of you nevertheless -- we have hear of you mr crewy say the canon nervously interpose even in this out-of-the-way corner of the west but there be one breakfast-table at least in england where divorce case be _ not _ peruse and that be my brother timothy 's breakfast-table say lady belstone very distinctly john hasten to fill up the awkward pause which ensue by a reference to the beauty of the hall i be afraid we do not live up to we beautiful old house say lady mary shake she head there be some lovely thing store away in the gallery upstairs and some beautiful picture hang there include the vandyck you know which charle ii give to old sir peter you cavalier ancestor but the gallery be almost a lumber-room for the floor be too unsafe to walk upon and down here as you see we be terribly philistine this hall be furnish by my grandmother for she son 's marriage say miss crewy and she send all you great-grandmother 's treasure to the attic say lady mary with rather a wilful intonation i always long to bring they to light again and to make this place livable but my husband do not like change dear timothy be faithful to the past say miss crewy majestically i wish old lady crewy have be as faithful say lady mary shrug she shoulder young people always like change say lady belstone more leniently young people say lady mary with a rather pathetic smile john will think you be laugh at I be i to be young still at five-and-thirty to be sure say john unless you be go to be so unkind as to make a man only ten year you senior feel elderly miss crewy interpose with a simple statement in my day the age of a lady be never refer to in polite conversation least of all by herself i never allude to mine you be unmarried georgina say lady belstone unexpectedly turn upon she ally unmarried lady be always sensitive on the subject of age i be sure i do not care who know that my poor admiral be twenty year my senior and _ he _ age can be look up in any book of reference it would have be useless to try and conceal it -- a man so well know a woman be as old as she look say the canon soothingly for the annoyance of miss crewy be visible i be bind to say that miss crewy look exactly the same as when i first know she of course a spinster escape the wear and tear of matrimony say miss crewy glare at she widow relative h be h be say dr blundell by-the-by have you inspect the old picture gallery mr crewy not yet say john lady belstone shoot a glance of speechless indignation at she sister sympathy between they be immediately restore prompt action be necessary on the part of the family or this presumptuous physician would be walk round the house to show john crewy the portrait of he own ancestor _ i _ shall be delighted to show we cousin the picture in the gallery and in the dining-room say miss crewy if my sister isabellum will accompany I and if lady mary have no objection you be very kind say john he rise and walk to a small rosewood cabinet of curio i see there be some beautiful miniature here oh those do not belong to the family they be setoun thing -- some of the few that come to I say lady mary rather timidly i be afraid they would not interest you not interest I but indeed i care only too much for such thing say john here be a cosway and unless i very much mistake a plimer -- and a engleheart lady mary unlock the cabinet with pretty eagerness and put a small morocco case into he hand then here be something you will like to see for a moment john do not understand he glance quickly from the row of tiny pearl-framed old-world portrait of handsome noble and rose-tinted court dame to the very indifferent modern miniature he hold the portrait of a schoolboy -- a eton boy with a long nose and small gray eye and a expression distinctly rather sulky and lowering than open or please not a stupid face however by any mean it be my boy -- peter say lady mary softly to she the face be something more than beautiful she look up at john with a happy certainty of he interest in she son here he be again when he be younger he be a pretty little fellow then as you see very pretty but not very like you say john scarcely know what he say he be strangely move and touch by she evident confidence in he sympathy though he artistic taste be outrage by the two portrait she ask he to admire he reflect that woman be very extraordinary creature ready to be please with anything providence might care to bestow upon they in the shape of a child even cross-looking boy with long nose and small eye the heir of barracombe resemble he aunt rather than he parent he be a thorough crewy not a bit like I all the setoun be fair i believe peter be very dark he be such a big fellow now taller than i be i sometimes wish say lady mary lay the miniature on the table as though she could not bear to shut it away immediately that one 's child never grow up they be such darling when they be little and they be bind of course to disappoint one sometimes as they grow older john crewys feel almost murderously inclined towards peter so the young cub have presume to disappoint he mother as he grow older how dare he poor lady mary be quite unconscious of the feeling with which he gaze at the little case in he hand not that my boy have ever _ really _ disappointed I -- yet she say with she pretty apologetic laugh i only mean that in the course of human nature it be bind to come now and then no doubt say john gently then she allow he to examine the rest of the cabinet whilst she talk on always of peter -- he horsemanship and he shooting and he prowess in every kind of sport and game \* \* \* \* \* meanwhile lady belstone be hold a hurry consultation with she sister how thoughtless you be georgina ask we cousin into the dining-room just when ash must be lay the cloth for dinner he will be sadly put about dear dear it quite slip my memory isabellum you have no head at all georgina can i frame a excuse say miss crewy piteously or will he think it discourteous leave it to I georgina say lady belstone with the air of a diplomat mary my love lady mary start yes isabellum georgina have very properly recall to I that candle and lamp make a very poor light for view the family portrait you know my love the vandyck be so very dark and black she propose therefore with you permission to act as we cousin 's cicerone to-morrow morning in the daytime shall we say -- at eleven o'clock john canon birch start nervously and the doctor frown at he at eleven o'clock say john in steady tone and as he speak sir timothy enter the hall chapter iv some tea timothy say lady mary if you please my dear say sir timothy drop he letter into the box i be afraid the tea will be little better than poison brother say lady belstone in warn tone it have stand so long perhaps dear mary intend to order fresh tea isabellum say miss crewy it have not stand so _ very _ long say lady mary look appealingly at sir timothy and you know ash be always cross if we order fresh tea excuse I my love say miss crewy i be the last to wish to trouble poor ash unnecessarily but the tea wait for ten minute before you come down my dear mary say sir timothy will you never learn to be punctual no i will take it as it be poor ash have enough to do as georgina truly say lady mary sigh rather impatiently and it occur to john crewy that sir timothy speak to he wife

pleasant timothy say he wife with rather a mischievous twinkle for i owe call to all the nice people and it be only the dull one who come over and over again you _ owe _ call mary say lady belstone in horrified tone i be afraid say miss crewy considerately lower she voice as the butler and footman cross the hall to the outer vestibule that dear mary be more than a little remiss in civility to she neighbor my dear admiral never permit I to postpone return a call for more than a week royalty he always say the same day ordinary people within a week say lady belstone when royalty call i certainly will return the visit the same day say lady mary petulantly but i can not spend my whole life drive along the high-road from one house to another i hate drive as you know isabellum what do providence create carriage for but to be drive in say lady belstone you will give john a wrong impression of we worthy neighbor mary say sir timothy pompously personally i be always glad to see they but you do not have to return they call timothy say lady mary the canon inadvertently laugh sir timothy look annoyed miss crewy whisper to lady belstone unheard save by the doctor -- how very odd and flippant poor mary be to-night -- worse than usual what can it be it be just the presence of a strange gentleman that be upset she poor thing say she sister in the same whisper she head be easily turn we have better take no notice the doctor mutter something emphatic beneath he breath mr and miss hewel say ash advance into the hall be it only you and sarah after all what a relief i think it be visitor cry

round to the stable say sir timothy no no we must not stop a minute but i could not help just pop in -- so very long since i have see you -- and all this happen at once say mr hewel she be a large stout woman with breathless manner and plaintive voice and i want to show you sarah in she first grown-up clothes and tell you about _ she _ too she add bless I say sir timothy you do not mean to say little sarah be grow up oh yes dear sir timothy she grow up the day before yesterday say mr hewel sharp work say the doctor grimly i mean of course she turn up she hair and let she dress down it be

be but my aunt will not wait once she have get a fancy into she head though the child be only seventeen at seventeen _ i _ be still in the nursery playing with my doll say lady belstone oh lady belstone say a odd deep protest voice john look with amuse interest at the speaker the unlucky sarah have take a low chair beside she hostess and be hold one of the soft white hand in she plump gloved finger sarah hewel 's adoration for lady mary date from the day when she have be ferry over the youle with she nurse to play with peter in he chubby childhood peter have often be cross and always tyrannical but it be so wonderful to find a playmate who be naughtier than herself that sarah have secretly admire peter she be the black sheep of she own family and in continual disgrace for lesser crime than he daily commit with impunity but she admiration of peter be tame and pale beside she admiration of lady mary a mother who never scold who tell no tale who pet black sheep when they be bruise and tear or stain entirely through they own wickedness who could always be depend on for kiss and bonbon and fairy-tale seem more angelic than human to poor little sarah whose own mother be wrapt up in she two irreproachable son and have small affection to spare for a ugly tiresome little girl sarah however have slowly but surely struggle out of the ugliness of she childhood and john crewy regard she critically in the lamplight decide she would develop one of these day into a very handsome young woman in spite of a ungainly stoop a wide mouth that pout rather too much and a nose that incline saucily upward she coloring be fresh even brilliant -- the bright rose and creamy tint that sometimes accompany vivid red hair -- and of a vivid uncompromising red be the lock that crown miss sarah 's little head and shaded she blue-veined temple miss crewy have in consequence long ago pronounce she to be a positive fright and lady belstone have declare that such hair would prove a insuperable obstacle to she chance of get a husband i know she be very young say mr hewel glance apologetically at she offspring but what can i do there be no go against lady tintern and at seventeen she ought to be something more than a tomboy after all _ you _ be marry at seventeen be not you say sarah to lady mary in she deep almost tragic voice -- a voice that command attention though it come oddly from she girlish chest sarah say mr hewel lady mary start and smile I yes sarah i be marry at seventeen mamma say nobody can be marry properly -- before they be one and twenty i _ know _ it be rot say sarah triumphantly miss sarah retain the outspokenness of she recently discard childhood i perceive say sir timothy stiffly sarah say she mother indignantly i say not unless they have they

five minute in the study a letter from peter say lady mary and not -- to I she look round at they all with a little vacant smile john crewy who know nothing of peter 's letter have already grasp the situation he divine also that lady mary be fight piteously against the conviction that sarah 's news be true how could we guess you do not know say mr hewel almost weep i be still in the dark say sir timothy coldly birch will explain at once say the doctor impatiently peter write -- ask I -- i be sure i do not know why he pitch upon I -- to -- break the news to you that he have join lord ferry ' horse feeling it he -- he duty to he country to do so say the unhappy canon folding and unfold the letter he hold with agitate finger i know there would be a satisfactory explanation say mr hewel tearfully dear lady mary have so inadvertently anticipate peter 's letter there be only one thing leave for I to do i must at least leave you and sir timothy in peace to read it come sarah allow I to put you into you carriage say sir timothy in a voice of iron sarah follow they to the door pause irresolutely and steal back to lady mary 's side say you be not angry with I dear beautiful lady mary she whisper passionately do say you be not angry i do not know it would make you so unhappy it be partly my fault for tell peter in the holiday that only old man invalid and -- and coward -- be shirk

a good girl he take she arm and lead she out of the hall and sarah forget she have grow up the day before yesterday and sob loudly as she go away lady mary lift the miniature from the table and look at it without a word but from the sofa the two old sister babble audibly to each other i always say isabellum that if poor mary spoilt peter so terribly _ something _ would happen to he what sad nonsense you talk georgina nothing have happen to he -- _ yet _ he have defy he father isabellum he have obey he country 's call georgina have the admiral be alive he would certainly have volunteer john crewy make a involuntary step forward and place himself between the sofa and the table as though to shield lady mary from they observation but he could not prevent they word from reach she ear she whisper to he very softly will you get the letter for I i want to see -- for myself -- what -- what peter say go quietly into the library say john bend over she for a moment i will bring it you there immediately she obey he without a word john turn to the sofa i beg you pardon canon he say courteously but lady mary can not bear this suspense allow I to take she son 's letter to she at once i -- i be only wait for sir timothy it be to he i have to break the news though of course there be nothing that lady mary may not know say the canon in a polite but flurry tone i really should not like -- my brother must see it first say miss crewy decidedly exactly i be sure sir timothy would not be please if -- bless my soul for john with a slight bow of apology and he grave air of authority have quietly take the letter from the canon 's undecided finger and walk away with it into the library how very oddly we cousin john behave say lady belstone indignantly almost snatch the letter from you hand depend upon it mary inspire he action say miss crewy angrily i see she whispering away to he a man she never set eye on before pray be _ we _ not to hear the contents say lady belstone quiver with indignation i suppose he think lady mary should make the communication herself to sir timothy gasp the canon i be sure i have no desire to fulfil so unpleasing a task still the matter _ be _ entrust to I however the main substance have be tell there can be no further secret about it my only care be that sir timothy should not be unduly agitate it be a comfort to find that _ some one _ can consider the feeling of we poor brother say miss crewy do give I you arm to the drawing-room canon say lady belstone rightly judge that the canon would reveal the whole contents of peter 's letter to she more easily in private the shock have make I feel quite faint you too georgina be look pale it be not the shock but the draught which be affect I isabellum -- sir timothy thoughtlessly keep the door open so long i will accompany you to the drawing-room but sir timothy may want I say the canon uneasily bless the man they have get the letter itself what can they want with _ you _ say she ladyship vigorously propel she supporter out of reach of possible interruption close the door behind we georgina i beg or that odious doctor will be race after we he take far too much upon himself i

impatience my boy be sail for south africa to-morrow morning i prefer say sir timothy to read the letter for myself oh do be quick she say half under she breath but he read it slowly twice and fold it he be really thunderstruck peter be accustom to write polite platitude to he parent and have presumably not intend that he letter to the canon should be actually read by sir timothy when he have ask that the contents of it should be break to he selfish disobedient headstrong deceitful boy say sir timothy lady mary start how can you talk so she gentle voice sound almost fierce at least he have prove himself a man ' and he be right it be a shame and a disgrace for he to stay at home whilst he comrade do they duty i say it a thousand time though i be he mother then she break down oh peter my boy my boy how could you leave I without a word perhaps this step be take with you connivance after all say sir timothy suspiciously he could not follow she rapid change of mood and have listen resentfully to she defense of she son timothy say lady mary tremble when have i ever be disloyal to you in word or deed never i hope say sir timothy he voice shake a little i do not doubt you for a moment mary but you speak with such strange vehemence so unlike you usual propriety of manner she break into a wild laugh which pained and astonished he do i i must have forget myself for a moment you must indeed pray be calm i understand that this must be a terrible shock to you it be not a shock say lady mary defiantly i glory in it i -- i _ wish _ he to go oh peter my darling she hide she face in she hand it would be more to the purpose say sir timothy to consider what be to be do could we stop he she cry eagerly and then change once more no no i would not if i could he would never forgive I of course we can not stop he say sir timothy he raise he voice as he be wont when he be angry canon birch in the drawing-room hear the loud threatening tone and be thankful for the door which shut he from sir timothy 's presence he have lay he plan for thwart my known wish too well i do not know what might be say if we stop he i -- i will not have my name make a laughing-stock i be a crewy and the honor of the family lie in my hand i can not give the world a right to suspect a crewy of cowardice by prevent he departure on active service we have fight before -- in a better cause we will not discuss the cause say lady mary gently when sir timothy begin to shout she always grow calm then you will not telegraph to my cousin ferry ferry ought to have write to _ I _ and not take the word of a mere boy like peter storm sir timothy but the fact be i never flatter ferry as he expect it be not my way to natter any one and consequently he take a dislike to I he must have know what my view be i be sure he do it on purpose it be natural he should believe peter and i do not think he know you well enough to dislike you say lady mary simply he have only see you twice timothy that be evidently sufficient say sir timothy mean to be ironical and unaware that he be state a plain fact i shall certainly not telegraph to tell he that my son have lie to he well as peter deserve that i should do so oh do not do not you be so hard she say piteously if you would only listen to he when he implore you to let he go we could have make he last day at home all they should be he be be hide in london poor peter get he outfit by stealth ashamed whilst other boy be be _ fêted _ and praise by they people proud of earn so early they right to be consider man and -- and he be only a boy and he say himself all 's fair in love and war indeed timothy it be a exceptional case mary you weakness be painful and you idolatry of peter will bring its own punishment the part of he deception that should pain you most be the want of heart he have display say sir timothy bitterly and do not it she say with a pathetic smile but one ought not to expect too much heart from a boy ought one it be -- it be not a healthy sign you say once you be glad he be not sentimental like I i should have wish he to exhibit proper feeling on proper occasion he present triumph over my authority involve he departure to certain danger and possible death without even afford we the opportunity of bidding he farewell he be ready and willing to leave we thus lady mary utter a stifled scream but i will not let he how can you think he mother will let he go like that how can you help it she press she tremble hand to she forehead i will think there be a way there be plenty of way i can drive to the junction -- it be not much further than brawnton -- and catch the midnight express and get to southampton by daybreak i know it can be do ash will look out the train why do you look at I like that you be not go to stop my go be you you be not go to _ try _ and stop I be you for you will not succeed oh yes i know i have be a obedient wife timothy but i -- i defy you once before for peter 's sake when he be such a little boy and you want to punish he -- do not you remember do not talk so mary say sir timothy almost soothingly she vehemence really alarmed and distressed he it be not like you to talk like this you will be sorry -- afterwards he say and he voice soften she respond instantly she come closer to he and take he big shake hand into she gentle clasp i should be sorry afterwards she say and so would you even _ you _ would be sorry timothy if anything happen to peter i 'll try and not make any more excuse for he if you like i know he be not a child now he be almost a man and man seem to I to grow harsh and unloving as they grow older i try now and then to shut my eye and see he as he once be but all the time i know that the little boy who use to be peter have go away for ever and ever and ever if he have die when he be little he would always have be my little boy would not he but thank god he do not die he be go to be a great strong man and a brave soldier and -- and all i have ever want he to be -- when he be get over these wilful day of boyhood but he must not go without he father 's blessing and he mother 's kiss he have choose to do so mary say sir timothy coldly she cling to he caressingly but you be go to forgive he before he go timothy there be no time to be angry before he go it may be too late to-morrow it may be too late to-morrow repeat sir timothy heavily he resent in a dull self-pitying fashion the fact that he wife 's thought be so exclusively fix on peter in she ignorance of he own more immediate danger do not think i be blind to he fault urge lady mary only i can laugh at they better than you can because i _ know _ all the while that at the very bottom of he heart he be only my baby peter after all he be not -- god bless he -- he be _ not _ the dreary cold-blooded priggish boy he sometimes pretend to be do not remember he like that now timothy think of that morning in June -- that glorious sunny morning in June when you kneel by the open window in my room and thank god because you have a son think of that other summer day when we could not bear even to look at the rose because little peter be so ill and we be afraid he be go back to heaven she soft rapid word touch sir timothy to a vague feeling of pity for she and for peter and for himself but the voice of the charmer charm she never so wisely have no power after all to dispel the dark cloud that be hang over he the sorrow give way to a keener anxiety the calmness of mind which the great surgeon have prescribe -- the placid courage largely aid by dulness of imagination which have enable poor sir timothy to keep in the very background of he thought all apprehension for the morrow -- where be they he repress with a effort the emotion which threaten to master he and force himself to be calm when he speak again he voice sound not much less measure and pompous than usual my dear you be agitate yourself and I let we confine ourselves to the subject in hand lady mary drop the unresponsive hand she hold so warmly press between she own and step back ah forgive I she say in clear tone it be so difficult to -- to -- to be exactly what you wish to be always on guard my feeling break bound for once calm yourself say sir timothy and besides so far as i be concerned you plead for peter be unnecessary you have forgive he she cry joyfully yet almost incredulously he pause and then say with solemnity : i have forgive he mary it be not the moment for I to cherish resentment least of all against my only son ah thank god then you will come to southampton that be impossible but i will telegraph my forgiveness and the blessing which he have not seek that he may receive it before the ship sail i be grateful to you for do even so much as that timothy and for not be angry then i must go alone no no understand I say lady mary in a low voice for i be in earnest i have never deceive you i will not defy you in secret like peter but i _ will _ go and bid my only son god-speed though the whole world conspire to prevent I _ i will go _ there be a pause you speak say sir timothy resentfully as though i have habitually thwart you wish oh no say he wife softly you never even find out what they be he do not notice the word it be doubtful whether he hear they it have be my best endeavor to promote you happiness throughout we married life mary so far as i consider it compatible with you highest welfare i do not pretend i can enter into the high-flown and romantic feeling engender by you reprehensible habit of novel-reading you have scold I so often for that say lady mary half mockingly half sadly can not we -- keep to the subject in hand as you say just now i have a reason a strong reason say sir timothy for wish you to remain at home to-morrow i have hope by conceal it from you to spare you some of the painful suspense and anxiety which i be myself experience lady mary laugh how like a man to suppose a woman be spare anything by be keep in the dark i know something be wrong dr blundell and canon birch be in you confidence i presume they keep exchange glance like two mysterious owl you sister be not or they would be sigh and shake they head and john -- john crewys oh he be a lawyer when do a visitor ever come here except on business he have something to do with it ah to advise you for nothing over you purchase of the crown land you have get into some difficulty over that or something of the kind you bring he down here for some special purpose i be sure but i do not know he well enough and i know you too well to ask why mary what have come to you i never know you quite like this before i dislike this extraordinary flippancy of tone very much i beg you pardon say lady mary make allowance for I this once i learn ten minute ago that my boy be go to the war i must either laugh or -- or cry and you would not like I to do that but it be a way woman have when they heart be half broken i do not understand you he say helplessly lady mary look at he as though she have awaken frightened to the consciousness of she own temerity i do not quite understand myself i think she say in a subdue voice i will not torment you any more timothy i will be as calm and collect -- as you wish only let I go will you not listen to my reason for wish you to remain at home he say sternly it be a important one i have forget she say indifferently how can there be any business in the world half so important to _ I _ as see my boy once more before he sail the color of sir timothy 's ruddy face deepen almost to purple he gray eye glower sullen resentment at he wife since you desire to have you way in opposition to my wish _ go _ he thunder i will not hinder you further but he sonorous wrath be too familiar to be impressive lady mary 's expression scarcely change when sir timothy raise he voice she turn however at the foot of the staircase and speak to he again let I just go and give the order for my thing to be packed timothy and tell ash to go and find out about the train and i will return and listen to whatever you wish -- i will indeed i could not pay proper attention to anything until i know that be be do sir timothy do not trust himself to speak he bow he head and the slender figure pass swiftly up the stair sir timothy walk twice deliberately up and down the empty hall and feel he pulse the slow steady throb reassure he he open the door of the study john say sir timothy would you kindly come out here and speak to I for a moment dr blundell would you have the goodness to await I a little longer you will find the london papers there i have they say dr blundell from the armchair by the study fire john crewy close the door behind he and look rather anxiously at he cousin it strike he that sir timothy have lose some of he ruddy color and that he face look draw and old but the squire place himself with he back to the log fire and make a effort to speak in he voice of everyday he slightly pompous patronize manner return upon he you be doubtless accustomed john in the course of you professional work he say to advise in difficult matter you come among we a stranger -- and unprejudiced will you -- er -- give I the benefit of you opinion to the best of my ability say john he pause and add gently i be sorry for this fresh trouble that have come upon you that be the subject on which i mean to consult you do you consider that -- that she husband or she child should stand first in a woman 's eye she husband undoubtedly say john readily but -- but what say sir timothy impatiently a gleam of satisfaction have break over he heavy face at he cousin 's reply i speak from a man 's point of view say john woman -- and possibly nature -- may speak differently you judgment however coincide with mine which be all that matter say sir timothy he do not perceive the twinkle in john 's eye at this reply in my opinion there be only two way of look at every question -- the right way and the wrong way my profession teach I say john that there be as many different point of view as there be party to a case then -- from _ my _ point of view say sir timothy with a air of wave all other point of view away as irrelevant since my wife very naturally desire to see she son again before he sail be i justified in allow she to set off in ignorance of the ordeal that await I good heaven no cry john should the operation prove unsuccessful you would be entail upon she a lifelong remorse i do not look upon it in that light say sir timothy rather stiffly the propriety or the impropriety of she going remain in any case the same whether the operation succeed or fail i fear that it would be the wrong thing to allow she to go at all that it might cause comment be she absent from my side at such a critical juncture i see say john he mobile expressive face and bright hazel eye seem to light up for one instant with scorn and wonder then he recollect himself it be natural you should wish for she sustain presence no doubt he say i trust you do not suppose that i should be selfishly consider my own personal feeling at such a time say sir timothy in a lofty tone of reproof i be only desirous of do what be right in the matter i be ask you advice because i feel that my self-command have be shake considerably by this unexpected blow i be less sure of my judgment than usual in consequence however if you think my wife ought to be tell -- john nodded very decidedly -- let she be tell i be bind to say dr blundell think so too though he opinion be neither here nor there in such a matter but so long as you understand that my only desire be that both she and i should do what be most correct and proper he come closer to john it be of vital importance for I to preserve my composure say sir timothy i be not fit for -- for any kind of scene just now will you undertake for I the task of explain to -- to my dear wife the situation in which i be place i will do my best say john he be touch by the note of piteous anxiety which have creep into the squire 's harsh voice thank you say sir timothy will you await she here she be return immediately break it to she as gently as you can i shall rest and compose myself by a talk with dr blundell he go slowly to the study leave john crewys alone chapter vi be that you cousin john say lady mary be sir timothy go i have not be away more than a few minute have i she speak quite brightly she cheek be flush and she blue eye be sparkling with excitement john look at she and find himself wish that she soft brown hair be not strain so tightly from she forehead nor brush so closely to she head the fashion would have be try to a younger face and fatal to feature less regularly delicate and correct he also wish she be not dress like a quaker 's wife the stiff gray poplin fit like a glove the pretty curve of lady mary 's slender figure but it lack distinction and appropriateness to john 's fastidious eye then he reproach himself vehemently for allow he thought to dwell on such trifle at such a moment will you forgive I for go away the very day you come say lady mary how quickly how surprisingly she recover she spirit she have look so weary and sad as she come down the stair a hour ago now she be almost gay a feverish and unnatural gaiety no doubt but those flush cheek and glitter blue eye -- how they restore the youthful loveliness of the face he have once think the most beautiful he ever see i be go to see the last of my boy you 'll understand will not you you be a only son too and you mother would have go to the end of the earth to look upon you face once more would not she mother be make like that some mother say john and he turn away he head not yours i be sorry say lady mary simply oh well -- you know she be a good deal -- in the world he say repent himself i use to wish so much to live in the world too say lady mary dreamily but ever since i be fifteen i have live in this out-of-the-way place do not be too sorry for that say john you do not know what a revelation this out-of-the-way place may be to a tired worker like I who live always amid the unlovely sight and sound of a city ah but that be just it she say quickly you see i be not tire -- yet and i have do no work that be why it be such a rest to look at you say john smile flower have they place in creation as vegetable have theirs but we only ask the flower to bloom peacefully in sheltered garden we do not insist on pop they into the soup with the onion and carrot lady mary laugh as though she have not a care in the world it be quite refreshing to find that a big-wig like you can talk just as much nonsense as a little-wig like I she say but you do not know for all that what the silence and monotony of life here _ can _ be the very voice of a stranger fall like music on one 's ear i be so glad to see you and you be so kind and sympathetic about -- my boy and then all in a moment my joy be turn into mourning be not it and peter be go to the war and it be all like a dreadful dream except that i know i shall wake up every morning only to realize more strongly that it be true john remember that he be dally with he mission instead of fulfil it sir timothy can not go to see he son off that must be a grief to he he say no he be not come he have business i believe say lady mary a little coldly there have be a dispute over some crown land which march with ours official be often very dilatory and difficult to deal with probably however you know more about it than i do i be go alone i have just be give the necessary order i shall take a servant with I as well as my maid for i be such a inexperienced traveller -- though it seem absurd at my age -- that i be quite frightened of get into the wrong train i dread a journey by myself even such a little journey as that but of course nothing would keep I at home only one thing say john in a low voice if i have judge you character rightly in so short a time what be that duty she look at he with sweet puzzle eye like a child be you plead sir timothy 's cause cousin john she say with a little touch of offence in she tone that be only charming i be plead sir timothy 's cause say john seriously love be stronger than duty be not it say lady mary i hope not say john very simply you mean my husband do not wish I to go do not think I too presume he say pleadingly i could not say lady mary naively you be older than i be you know she laugh and a qc and you know you would be my trustee and my boy 's guardian if anything ever happen to sir timothy he tell I so long ago and he remind I of it to-day most solemnly i suppose he be afraid i should not treat you with proper respect he have honor I very highly say john in that case it would be almost my -- my duty to advise you in any difficulty that might arise would not it that mean you want to advise I now frankly it do and be _ you _ go to tell I that i ought to stay at home and let my only boy leave england without bid he god-speed say lady mary incredulously if so i warn you that you will never convince I of that argue as you may no one be ever convince by argument say john but stern fact sometimes command even a woman 's attention when back by such power of persuasion as yours perhaps she face he with sparkling eye lady mary be timid and gentle by nature but peter 's mother know no fear yet she realize that if john crewy be move to put forth he full power he might be a difficult man to oppose she meet he glance and observe that he perfectly understand the spirit which animated she and that it be not opposition that shine from he bright hazel eye as he regard she steadily through he pince-nez i be go to deal with a hard fact which you husband be afraid to tell you say john because in he tenderness for you womanly weakness he underrate as i venture to think you womanly courage sir timothy want you to be with he here to-morrow because he have to -- to fight a unequal battle -- with the crown with death what do you mean say lady mary he have be silently combate a mortal disease for many month past say john and to-morrow morning the issue be to be decide every day every hour of delay increase the danger the great surgeon dr herslett will be here at eleven o'clock and on the success of the operation he will perform hang the thread of you husband 's life lady mary put up a little tremble hand entreatingly and john 's great heart throb with pity he have choose he word deliberately to startle she from she absorption in she son but she look so fragile so white so implore that he courage almost fail he he come to she side and take the little hand reassuringly in he strong warm clasp be brave my dear he say with falter voice and put aside if you can the thought of you bitter terrible disappointment only _ you _ can cheer and inspire and aid you husband to maintain the calmness of spirit which be of such vital importance to he chance of recovery you can not leave he against he wish at such a moment not if you be the -- the angel i believe you to be say john with emotion there be a pause and though he look away from she he know that she be cry john release the little hand gently and walk to the fireplace to give she time to recover herself perhaps he eye-glass be dim he polish they very carefully lady mary dash away she tear and speak in a hard voice he scarcely recognize as hers i might be all -- you think I john she say if -- ah do not let there be a _ if _ say john but -- or a _ but _ it be that you do not understand the situation she say you talk as though sir timothy and i be a ordinary husband and wife entirely dependent on one another 's love and sympathy do not you know _ he _ stand alone -- above all the human folly and weakness of a mere woman can not you guess say lady mary passionately that it be my boy my poor faulty undutiful boy -- oh that i should call he so -- who need I that it be he voice that would be call in my heart whilst i await sir timothy 's pleasure to-morrow he _ pleasure _ say john sternly i be shocking you and i do not want to shock you she cry almost wildly but you do not suppose he need _ I _ -- I myself he only want to be sure i be do the right thing he want to give people no chance of say that lady mary crewy rush off to see she spoilt boy whilst she husband hover between life and death a lay figure would do just as well if it would only sit in a armchair and hold its handkerchief to its eye and if the neighbor and he sister and the servant could be persuade to think it be i hush hush say john do let I speak out pray let I speak out she say breathless and implore and you can think what you like of I afterwards when i be go if only you will not scold now i be so sick of be scold say lady mary be i to be a child for ever -- i that be so old and have lose my boy he think there be something in she of the child that never grow up the guilelessness the charm the ready tear and smile the quick change of mood he roll a elbow-chair forward and put she into it tenderly say what you will say john this be comfortable she say lean she head wearily on she hand to talk to a -- a friend who understand and who will not scold but you can not understand unless i tell you everything and timothy himself after all would be the first to explain to you that it be not my tear nor my kiss nor my consolation he want you do not think so _ really _ do you john hesitated remember sir timothy 's word but she do not wait for a answer yes she say calmly he wish I to be in my proper place it would be a scandal if i do such a remarkable thing as to leave home on any pretext at such a moment only by be extraordinarily respectable and dignified can we live down the memory of he father 's unconventional behavior i must remember my position i must smell my salt and put my foot up on the sofa and be moderately overcome during the crisis and moderately thankful to the almighty when it be over so that every one may hear how admirably dear lady mary behave and when i be read the _ time _ to he during he convalescence she cry wring she hand peter -- peter will be thousand of mile away march over the veldt to he death you make very sure of peter 's death say john quietly oh yes say lady mary listlessly he be a only son it be always the only son who die i have remark that you make very sure of sir timothy 's recovery oh yes lady mary say again he be a very strong man something ominous in john 's face and voice attract she attention why do you look like that because say john slowly -- you understand i be treat you as a woman of courage -- dr blundell tell I just now that -- the odds be against he she utter a little cry the doctor 's voice at the end of the hall make they both start lady mary he say you will forgive my interruption sir timothy desire I to join you he fear this double blow might prove too much for you strength i be quite strong say lady mary he wish I to deliver a message say the doctor yes on reflection sir timothy believe that he may be partly influence by a selfish desire for the consolation of you presence in wish you to remain with he to-morrow he be strike i believe with something mr crewy say -- on this point god bless you john say lady mary hush say john shake he head dr blundell 's voice sound john think as though he be put force upon himself to speak calmly and steadily he eye be bent on the floor and he never once look at lady mary sir timothy desire consequently he say that you will consider yourself free to follow you own wish in the matter be guide as far as possible by the advice of mr crewy he be afraid of further agitation and therefore ask you to convey to he as quickly as possible you final decision as he physician may i beg you not to keep he wait he leave they and return to the study though it be only a short silence that follow he departure john have time to learn by heart the aspect of the half-lighted shadowy hall there be some pause which be illustrate to the day of a man 's death by a vivid impression on he memory of the surroundings the heavy paint beam cross and re-cross the lofty roof the black staircase light with wax candle that make a brilliancy which throw into deeper relief the darkness of every recess and corner the full-length early victorian portrait of man and woman of he own race -- inartistic daub that be yet horribly lifelike in the semi-illumination the uncurtained mullioned window -- all form a background for the central figure in he thought the slender womanly form in the armchair the little brown head support on the white hand the delicate face rob of its youthful freshness and yet so lovely still john say lady mary in a voice from which all passion and strength have die away tell I what i ought to do remain with you husband and let my boy go say lady mary weep i have think when he be leave I perhaps for ever that -- that he heart would be touch -- that i should get a glimpse once more of the peter he use to be oh can not you understand he -- he be a little -- hard and cold to I sometimes -- god forgive I for say so -- but you -- you have be a young man too yes john say rather sadly i have be young too it be only he age you know she say he could not always be as gentle and loving as when he be a child a young man would think that so babyish he want as he say to be independent and not tie to a woman 's apron-string but in he heart of heart he love I best in the whole world and he would not have be ashamed to let I see it at such a moment and i should have have a precious memory of he for ever you shake you head do not you understand I i think you seem to understand she say wistfully peter be a boy say john and life be just open for he it be a hard say to _ you _ but he thought be full of the world he be enter there be no room in they just now for the home he be leave that be human nature if he be sick or sorry later on -- as i know you loving fancy picture he -- he heart would turn even then not to the mother he see wave and weep on the quay amid all the confusion of departure but to the mother of he childhood of he happy day of long ago it may be -- john hesitated and speak very tenderly -- it may be that he heart will be all the softer then because he be deny the parting interview he never seek the young be strangely wayward and impatient they regret what might have be they do not like the old dwell fondly upon what the god actually grant they it be _ you _ who will suffer from this sacrifice not peter that will be some consolation to you i suppose even if it be also a disappointment ah how you understand say peter 's mother sadly perhaps because as you say just now i have be a young man too he say force a smile oh forgive I but let I save you for i believe that if you desert you husband to-day you would sorrow for it to the end of you life and peter -- she murmur he come to she side and straighten himself and speak hopefully give I you last word and you last gift -- and a letter -- for peter and send I in you stead to-night i will deliver they faithfully i will tell he -- for he should be tell -- of the sore strait in which you find yourself set he this noble example of duty and believe I it will touch he heart more nearly than even that sacred parting which you desire lady mary hold out she hand to he tell sir timothy that i will stay she whisper john bent down and kiss the little hand in silence and with profound respect then he go to the study without look back when he be go lady mary lay she face upon the badly paint miniature of peter and cry as one who have lose all hope in life chapter vii she do not make much account on he while he be alive but now

have a right to be interested in the family say sarah because of the connection you see the connection do not you know she ask with wide-open eye though you be sir timothy 's own cousin a very distant cousin say john but every one in the valley know say sarah that sir timothy 's father marry he own cook who be happy jack 's first cousin when i be a little girl and want to tease peter she add ingenuously i always use to allude to it it be the skeleton in they cupboard we have not get a skeleton in we family she add regretfully least of all the skeleton of a cook john remember vaguely that there be a story about the second marriage of sir timothy the elder so she be a cook he say well what harm and he laugh in spite of himself i wonder why there be something so essentially unromantic in the profession of a cook she family go to australia and they be quite rich people now : no more cook than you and I say sarah gravely but happy jack will not leave youlestone though he say they tempt he with untold gold and he would not touch he hat to sir timothy because he be he cousin that be another skeleton but a very small one say john laugh it might seem small to _ we _ but i be sure it be one reason why sir timothy never go outside he own gate if he could help it say sarah shrewdly luckily the cook die when he be bear why luckily poor thing say john indignantly she would not have have much of a time would she do you think with sir timothy 's sister ask sarah with simplicity they be in the schoolroom when they papa marry she or i be sure they would never have allow it they own mother be a most select person and little thought when she give the order for dinner and all that who the old gentleman 's _ next _ wife would be say sarah giggle they always talk of she as the _ honorable rachel _ since _ lady crewy _ you know might just as well mean the cook i suppose the old squire get tire of she be so select and think he would like a change he be a character you know i often think peter will be a character when he grow old he be so disagreeable at time i think you be so fond of peter say john look amusedly down on the little chatterbox beside he not exactly fond of he it be just that i be _ use _ to he say sarah color all over she clear fresh face even to the little tendril of red hair on she white neck she wear a blue cotton frock and a brown mushroom hat with a wreath of wild rose which have somewhat too obviously be sew on in a hurry and crookedly and she look far more like a village schoolgirl than a young lady who be shortly to make she _ début _ in london society but he be strike with the extraordinary brilliancy of she complexion transparent and pure as it be in the search sunlight if she be not so round-shouldered -- if the feature be better -- she expression softer say john to himself -- if divine coloring be all -- she would be beautiful but she wide smile mouth short-tipped nose and cleft chin convey rather the impression of childish audacity than of feminine charm the glance of those bright inquisitive eye be like a wild robin 's half innocent half bold though she round throat be white as milk and though no careless exposure to sun and wind have yet succeed in dim the exquisite fairness of she skin yet the defect and omission incidental to extreme youth country breed and lack of discipline render miss sarah not wholly please in john 's fastidious eye she carriage be slovenly she ungloved hand be red she hair touzle and she deep-toned voice over-loud and confident yet she frankness and she trustfulness could not fail to evoke sympathy it be -- lady mary that i be fond of say the girl with a yet more vivid blush he be touch she will miss you i be sure when you go to town he say kindly if i think so really i would not go say sarah vehemently she wink a tear from she long eyelash but i know it be only you good nature she think of nothing and nobody but peter and -- and after all when i get better manners and all that i shall be more of a companion to she i be very glad to go if it be not for leave _ she _ i like aunt elizabeth whereas mamma and i never _ do _ get on she care most for the boy which be very natural no doubt as i be only a afterthought and nobody want I and aunt elizabeth have always like I she say i amuse she with my sharp tongue but you will have to be a little careful of the sharp tongue when you get to london say john smile he be strike by the half-sly half-acquiescent look that sarah steal at he from beneath those long eyelash perhaps she outspokenness be not so involuntary as he have imagine if i have know you be come to-day i would have go up to say good-bye to lady mary last night say sarah mournfully she will not want I now you be here i have a thousand and one thing to look after i sha 'n' t be in you way say john good-naturedly if she be not busy otherwise busy echo sarah she sit _ so _ with she hand in she lap look over the valley and she have grow oh so much thinner and sadder-looking i think you would never come i have my own work say john hurriedly and i think besides she would rather be alone these first few week sarah look up with a flash in she blue eye which be so dark and large-pupilled and heavily lash that they look almost black she grind she strong white tooth together if i be lady mary she say i would have slam the old front door behind I the very day after sir timothy be bury -- and go away i would there she be like a prisoner with the old lady count every tear she shed and add they up to see if it be enough and measure every inch of crape on she gown and find fault with all she do just as they use when sir timothy be alive to back they up and she be afraid to do anything he do not like and she never listen to the doctor the only person in the world who be ever have the courage to fight she battle the doctor say john sharply have she be ill no no what have _ he _ to do with lady mary say john he displeasure be so great that the color rise in he clean-shaven face and do not escape little sarah 's observation for all she downcast lash somebody must go and see she say sarah and you be away and the canon be just nobody always bother she for subscription though he be very fond of she like everybody else she add with compunction dear I mr crewy how fast you be walk john have unconsciously quicken he pace so much that she have some ado to keep up with he without actually run i beg you pardon he say it be so hot and the hill be steep and i be rather fat i dare say i shall fine down as i get older say sarah apologetically it would be dreadful if i grow up like mamma but i be more like my father thank goodness and _ he _ be simply a mass of hard muscle i dare say even i could beat you on the flat but not up this drive do not it look pretty in the spring it be very different when i leave barracombe say john he look round with all a londoner 's appreciation in the sunny corner next the ivy-clad lodge a early rhododendron have burst into scarlet bloom the steep drive be warmly wall and sheltered on the side next the hill by horse-chestnut witch-elm tall flower shrub and evergreen and a variety of tree-azalea and rhododendron which promise a blaze of beauty later in the season but the other side of the drive lay in full view of the open landscape roll grass slope stretch down to the orchard and the valley violet white and blue scented the air and the primrose cluster at the root of the forest tree the gnarled and twisted stem of giant creeper testify to the age of barracombe house before the entrance be a level space which make a little spring garden more formal and less varied in its arrangement than the terrace garden on the south front but no less gay and bright with bed of hyacinth red and white and purple and daffodil spring amidst they bodyguard of pale pointed spear a wild cherry-tree at the corner of the house have shower snowy petal before the latticed window of the study the window whence sir timothy have take he last look at the western sky and from which he watchful gaze have once command the approach to he house and observe almost every human being who venture up the drive on the ridge of the hill above and in clump upon the fertile slope of the side of the little valley the young larch rise newly clothe in that light and brilliant foliage which darken almost before spring give place to summer they find lady mary in the drawing-room the sunshine stream towards she through the golden rain of a _ planta-genista _ which stand on a table in the western corner of the bow window she be look out over the south terrace and the valley and the river just as sarah have say he be shock at she pallor which be accentuate by she black dress she sapphire blue eye look unnaturally large and clear the little white hand clasp in she lap be too slender a few silver thread glisten in the soft brown hair above all the hopeless expression of the sad and gentle face go to john 's heart _ be _ the doctor the only man in the world who have the courage to fight she battle for this fading grieving woman who have be the lovely mary setoun whom john remember so careless so laugh so innocently gay he be relieve that she could smile as he approach to greet she i do not guess you would come by the early train she say in glad tone but oh -- you must have walk all the way from brawnton what will jame coachman say i want a walk say john and i know you would send to meet I if i let you know my luggage be at the station jame coachman as you call he can fetch that whenever he will and i have come to say good-bye say sarah forlornly she watch with jealous eye they greet and lady mary 's obvious pleasure in john 's arrival and half-oblivion of she own familiar little presence when peter have first go to school he mother in she loneliness have almost make a _ confidante _ of little sarah the odd intelligent child who follow she about so faithfully and listen so eagerly to those dreamy half-uttered confidence she know that lady mary weep because she boy have leave she but she understand also that when peter come home for the holiday he bring little joy to he mother a self-possessed stripling now walk about the old house and lay down the law to he mamma -- instead of that chubby creature in petticoat who have once be peter lady mary have dwell on the far-off day of peter 's babyhood very tenderly when she be alone with little sarah who sit and nurse she doll and like very much to listen she often feel awed as though some one have die but she do not connect the story much with the peter of every day who go fishing and say girl be rather a nuisance sarah too have have she trouble she be periodically banish to distant school by a mother who dislike romping and hoydenish little girl as much as she dote on fat and wheeze lap-dog but as she father on the other hand resent she banishment from home almost as sincerely as sarah herself she be also periodically send for to take up she residence once more beneath the parental roof thus she life be full of change and uncertainty but through it all she devotion to lady mary never waver she look at she now with a melancholy air which sit oddly upon she bright comical face and which be intend to draw attention to the pathetic fact of she own impending departure i only come to say good-bye say sarah in slightly injured tone ah by-the-by and i have promise not to intrude on the parting say john with twinkling eye it be not a eternal farewell say lady mary drawing sarah kindly towards she it may be for _ year _ say sarah rather offend my aunt elizabeth be as good as adopt I mamma say i be very lucky and i believe she be glad to be rid of I but papa say he shall come and see I in london aunt elizabeth be go to take I to paris and to scotland and abroad every winter oh sarah how you will be change when you come back say lady mary and she laugh a little with a hand on sarah 's shoulder but sarah know that lady mary be not think very much about she all the same there be no fresh news john she ask nothing since my last telegram he answer but i have arrange with the exchange telegraph company to wire I anything of importance during my stay here you be always so good she say then he take pity on sarah 's impatience and leave the little worshipper to the interview with she idol which she so earnestly desire i will go and pay my respects to my cousin say john but the banqueting-hall be desert and gap in the row of clog and golosh suggest that the old lady be take a morning stroll they have not think it proper to drive save in a close carriage since they brother 's death and on such a warm day of spring weather a close carriage be not invite to country-bred people chapter viii john take he hat and step out once more upon the drive and there meet dr blundell who have leave he dog-cart at the stable and be walk up to the house he do not pause to analyze the sentiment of slight annoyance which cloud he usual good humor but dr blundell divine it with the quickness of a ultra-sensitive nature he show no sign that he have do so it be you i come to see he say shake hand with john i hear -- you know how quickly news spread here -- that you have arrive i hope you might spare I a few moment for a little conversation certainly say john will you come in or shall we take a turn you will be glad of a breath of fresh air after you journey say the doctor and he lead the way across the south terrace to a sheltered corner of the level plateau upon which the house be build which be know as the fountain garden it be rather a desert garden thickly surround and overgrow by shrub through the immense spreading portuguese laurel which sheltered it from the east little or no sunshine find its way to the gray moss-grown basin and the stone figure support it over which a thin stream of water continually flow with a melancholy rhythm in perpetual twilight a giant ivy grow rankly and thickly about the stone buttress of this eastern corner of the house and around a great mullioned window which overlook the fountain garden and which be the window of lady mary 's bedroom these shrubbery want thin say john look round he rather disgustedly this place be reek with damp i should like to cut down some of these poisonous laurel and let in the air and the sunshine and open out the view of the brawnton hill and why do not you say the doctor with such energy in he tone that john stop short in he pacing of the gravel walk and look at he the two man be almost as unlike in appearance as in character the doctor be nervous irritable and intense in manner with deep-set piercing eye that glow like hot coal when he be move or excite a tall gaunt man line and wrinkle beyond he year careless of appearance so far as he shabby clothes be concerned yet careful of detail as be prove by spotless linen and well-preserved delicate hand he be indifferent utterly to the opinion of other to he own worldly advancement or to any outer consideration when in pursuit of the profession he love and he know no other interest in life save one he have the face of a fanatic or a enthusiast but also of a man whose understanding have be so cultivate as to temper enthusiasm with judgment he have miss success and be neither resign to he disappointment nor embittered by it the gaze of those dark eye be seldom introspective rather as it seem do they look out eagerly sadly pitifully at the pain and sorrow of the world a pain he toil manfully to lessen so far as he own infinitesimal corner of the universe be concerned john crewy on the other hand be to the most casual observer a successful man a man whose personality would never be overlook there be a more telling force in he composure than in the doctor 's nervous energy he clear eye he bright yet steady glance inspire confidence the doctor might have be take for a poet but john look like a philosopher he be also as obviously in appearance a man of the world and a londoner as the doctor be evidently a countryman and a hermit he advantage over the doctor include he voice which be as deep and musical as the tone of he companion be harsh the manner no less than the matter of john 's speech have early bring he distinction nature rather than cultivation have bestow on he the faculty of convey the impression he wish to convey in tone that charm and hold he auditor and penetrate ear dull and fatigue by monotony and indistinctness the more impassioned he plead the more utterly he hold he own emotion in check the more bite he subtly choose word the more courteous he manner now deadly earnest now humorously scornful now graciously argumentative but always skilfully and designedly convince the doctor save in the presence of a patient have no such control over himself as john crewy carry from the law-court into he life of every day why do not you he say in fiery tone let in air and life and a view of the outside world and as much sunshine as possible into this musty old house you have the power if you have only the will you speak figuratively i notice say john i should be much oblige if you would tell I exactly what you mean he would have answer in warmer and more kindly tone have sarah 's word not ring upon he ear be the doctor go to fight lady mary 's battle now and with he of all people in the world as though there be any one in the world to whom she interest could be dearer than -- john stop short in he thought and look attentively at the doctor he heart smite he how pallid be that tired face and the hollow eye how sad and tired too the doctor have be up all night in a wretched isolate cottage watch a man die -- but john do not know that he perceive that this be no meddler but a man speaking of something very near he heart no presuming and interfere outsider who deserve a snub but a man suffering from some deep and hidden cause the doctor 's secret be know to john long before he have finish what he have to say but he listen attentively and give no sign that this be so she will die say blundell if this go on and he neither mention any name nor do john crewy require he to do so the doctor 's word come hurry out incoherently from the depths of he anxiety and earnestness she will die if this go on there be few hope and little enough pleasure in she life before but what be leave to she now _ de mortuis nil nisi bonum _ but just picture to yourself for a moment man what she life have be he stop and draw breath and strove to speak calmly and dispassionately i be bear in the valley of the youle he say my people live in a cottage -- they call it a house but it be just a farm -- on the river -- cullacott i be a raw medical student when _ she _ come here as a child she father be kill in the afghan war he have quarrel with he uncle they say who afterwards succeed to the earldom so she be leave to the guardianship of sir timothy a distant cousin every one be sorry for she because sir timothy be she guardian and because she be a little young thing to be leave to the tender mercy of the two old lady who be old even then if you will excuse my speak frankly about the family -- john nod -- they bully they brother always what with they superiority of birth and he be so much younger and so on they bringing-up make he what he be i be sure he go nowhere he always fancy people be laugh at he he feeling about he -- he mother 's lowly origin seem to pervade he whole life he exaggerate the importance of birth till it become almost a mania if you have not know the man you could not have believe a human being -- one of the million crawl unit on the earth -- could be so absurdly inflate with self-importance it be pitiful he go nowhere and see no one i believe he think that providence have send a wife of high rank to he very door to enable he partially to wipe out he reproach she look like a child when she come but she shoot up very suddenly into womanhood if you ask I if she be unhappy i declare i do not think so she have never realize i should think what it be to be snub or find fault with in she life she be a motherless child and have live with she old grandfather and she young father and have be very much spoilt and they be both snatch away from she as it be in a breath and she alone in the world with a uncle who be only glad to get rid of she to she stranger guardian well -- she be too young and too bright and too gay to be much downcast for all the old woman could do she laugh at they scolding and when they try severity she appeal to sir timothy the old doctor who be my predecessor here tell I at the time that he think she have bewitch sir timothy but afterwards he say that he believe it be only that sir timothy have make up he mind even then to quarter the setoun arm with he own anyway he go against he sister for the first and only time in he life and they learn that lady mary be not to be interfere with whether it be gratitude or just the childish satisfaction of triumph over she two enemy i can not tell but she marry he in less than two year after she come to live at barracombe the old lady do not know whether to be angry or pleased they want he to marry and they want he wife to be well-born no doubt but to have a mere child set over they well the marriage take place in london i be present say john the people here say thing about it that may have get round to sir timothy but i do not know he never come down to the village except to church where he sit away from everybody in the gallery curtain off anyway he would not have the wedding down here he invite all she relative and none of they have a word to say it be not as if she be a heiress i believe she have next to nothing she be just like a child laughing and pleased at get married and with all she finery perhaps -- or at get rid of she lesson with the old woman may be -- and the thought of baby of she own who know what a girl think of say the doctor harshly i do not see she again for a long time after but then i come down the brawnton doctor be get old and it be a question whether i should succeed he or go on in london where i be do well enough and -- and i come here say the doctor abruptly john nodded again he fill in the gap of the doctor 's narrative for himself and understand she have change very much all the gaiety and laughter go but she be wrapt up in the child as i never see any woman wrapt up in a brat before or since and i have know some that be pretty ridiculous in that way say the doctor and he voice shake more than ever it be -- touch for she be but a child herself and peter between you and I be a unpromising doll for a child to play with he be ugly and ill-tempered and he would not be caress or dress up or make much of from the first minute he have a will of he own as he grow bigger he be for ever have row with he father and he mother be for ever intercede for he he be idle at school but he be a manly boy enough over game and sport and a capital shot anyway she manage to be proud of he god know how i should not wonder if this war be the making of he though poor chap if he be spare to see the end of it all i have no doubt the discipline will do he a great deal of good say john dryly it can not be say that he brief interview at southampton have impressed john with a favourable opinion of the sulky and irresponsive youth who have there listen to he mother 's message with lower brow and downcast eye peter have betray no sign of emotion and almost none of gratitude for john 's hurry and uncomfortable journey to convey that message a few hard knock will do you no harm my young friend and i almost wish you may get they john have say to himself on he homeward journey dread yet expect the news that await he at peter 's home and for which he have do he best to prepare the boy too much consideration hitherto have ruin he say the doctor shortly but it be not of peter i be think one way or the other from the time he go first to school she be have to depend entirely on she own resource -- and what be they he pause as though to gather strength and energy for he indictment from the time she be bring here -- except for that one outing and a change to torquay i believe after peter 's birth -- she have scarce set foot outside barracombe sir timothy would not so he be resolve she should not he sister who have as much cultivation as that stone figure disapprove of novel-reading -- or of any other reading i should fancy -- and he follow suit book be almost unknown in this house the library bookcase be lock sir timothy open they once in a while and he sister dust the book with they own hand it be against tradition to handle such valuable binding he hate music and the piano be not to be play in he presence have you ever try it i be tell you be musical it belong to lady belstone 's mother the honorable rachel that be she harp which stand in the corner of the hall she daughter once tinkle a little i believe but the prejudice of the ruling monarch be religiously obey music be _ taboo _ at barracombe dancing be against they principle and theater they regard with horror and have never be inside one in they life nothing take sir timothy to london but business and if it be possible to have the business bring to barracombe he solicitor mr crawley visit he here the doctor speak in lower tone as he recur to he first theme i do not think she find out for year or realize what a prisoner she be they catch and pin she down so young there be no very near neighbor -- i mean not the sort of people they would recognize as neighbor -- except the hewel youlestone be such a out-of-the-way place and sir timothy be never on intimate term with any one mr hewel be a fool -- there be only little sarah whom lady mary make a pet of -- but she have no friend sir timothy and he sister make visit such a stiff and formal business that it be no wonder she hate pay call the more especially as it could lead to nothing he would not entertain he grudge the expense i be present at a scene he once make because a large party drive over from a distant house and stay to tea he say he could not entertain the county she dare ask no one to she house -- she who be so form and fit by nature to charm and attract and enjoy social intercourse he voice falter they steal she youth he say what do you want I to do say john though he be vaguely conscious that he understand for what the doctor be plead he sit down by the fountain and the doctor rest a mended boot on the end of the bench lean on he bony knee and look down wistfully at john 's thoughtful face broad brow and bright intent eye you be a very clever man mr crewy he say humbly a man of the world successful accomplished and i believe honest -- he speak with a simplicity that disarm offence -- or i should not have venture as i have venture somehow you inspire I with confidence i believe you can save she i believe you could find a way to bring back she peace of mind the interest in life -- the gaiety of heart -- that be natural to she if i be in you place not the two old woman -- not sir timothy 's ghost -- not that poor conceited slip of a lad who may be shoot to-morrow -- would stand in my way i would bring back the color to she cheek and the light to she eye and the music to she voice -- whilst she boy be in danger john ask almost scornfully he think he know lady mary better than the doctor do after all i tell you _ nothing _ would stop I say blundell vehemently before i would let she fret herself to death -- afraid to break the spell that have be weave round she bind as she be hand and foot with the prejudice of the dead -- i would -- i would -- take she to south africa myself he say brilliantly the voyage would bring she back to life john get up that be a idea he say he pause and look at the doctor you have know she longer than i have you say nothing to she of all this the doctor smile grimly mr crewy he say some time since i speak my mind -- a thing i be over-apt to do -- _ of _ peter and _ to _ he the lad have forgive I he be a man you see with all he fault but lady mary though she have all the virtue of a woman be also a mother a woman often forgive a mother never do not forget i will not say john and you 'll do it -- use the unlimited authority that have be place in my hand by improve this tumble-down overgrown place say john slowly let in light air and sunshine to barracombe and do my best to brighten lady mary 's life without reference to any one 's prejudice past or present you have get the idea say the doctor joyfully will you carry it out yes say john chapter ix the new moon brighten above the rim of the opposite hill and touch the river below with silver reflection on the grass bank slope away beneath the terrace garden sheet of bluebell shine almost whitely on the grass the silent house rise against the dark wood whiten also here and there by the blossom of wild cherry-tree lady mary step from the open french window of the drawing-room into the still scented air of the April night she stand lean against the stone balcony and gaze at the wonderful panorama of the valley and overlap hill where the little river thread its untroubled course between daisied meadow and old orchard and red crumble bank a broad-shouldered figure appear in the window and a man 's step crunch the gravel of the path which lady mary have cross for once i have escape you see she say without turn round they will not venture into the night air sometimes i think they will drive I mad -- isabellum and georgina mary cry a shrill voice from the drawing-room how can you be so imprudent john how can you allow she john step back to the window it be very mild he say lady mary like the air there be a note of authority in he tone which somehow impress lady belstone who withdraw mutter to herself into the warm lamplight of the drawing-room perhaps the two old lady be to be pity too as they sit together but forlorn sincerely shocked and uneasy at they sister-in-law 's behavior dear timothy not dead three month and she sit out there in the night air as he would never have permit talk and laugh yes i actually hear she laughing -- with john there be no tell what she may do _ now _ say miss crewy gloomily i declare it be a judgment georgina why do timothy choose to trust a perfect stranger -- even though john be a cousin -- with the care of he wife and son and he estate rather than he own sister it be a gentleman 's work say miss crewy gentleman 's fiddlestick could not old crawley have do it i should hope he be as good a lawyer as young john any day say lady belstone toss she head but i have often notice that people will trust any chance stranger with the property they leave behind rather than those they know best isabellum say miss crewy blame not the dead and especially on a moonlight night it make my blood run cold i be blame nobody georgina but i will say that if poor timothy think proper to leave everything else in the hand of young john he might have consider that you and i have a better right to the dower house than poor dear mary who of course must live with she son i be far from wish or intend to leave my home here isabella say miss crewy it be very different in you case you forfeit the position of daughter of the house when you married but i have always occupy my old place and my old room this be a sore subject on lady belstone 's return as a widow to the home of she father she have be tear with anxiety and indecision regard she choice of a sleep apartment sentiment dictate she return to she former bedroom but she be convince that the married state require a domicile on the first floor etiquette prevail and she descend but the eighty-year-old leg of miss crewy still climb the nursery staircase and she revenge herself for she inferior status by insist in defiance of old association that she maid should occupy the room next to she own which she sister have abandon for my part i can sleep in one room as well as another provide it be comfortable and _ appropriate _ say lady belstone with dignity there be very pleasant room in the dower house and we great-aunt manage to live there in comfort and yet keep a eye on they nephew here as i have always be tell i do not know why we should object to do the same you have never try be mistress of you own house georgina but i can assure you it have its advantage and i find they out as a married woman a married woman have she husband to look after she say miss crewy it be very different for a widow you be for ever throw my widowhood in my tooth georgina say lady belstone plaintively it be not my fault that i be a widow i do not murder the admiral i do not say you do isabella say georgina grimly but he only survive he marriage six month it be nice to be silent sometimes say lady mary do that mean that i be to go away say john or merely that i be not to speak to you she laugh a little neither it mean that i be tire of be scold i have wonder now and then say john deliberately why you put up with it i suppose -- because i can not help it she say startle you be a free agent you mean that i could go away she say in a low voice but there be only one place i should care to go to now to south africa you always understand she say gratefully suppose this -- this ghastly war should not be over as soon as we all hope he say rather huskily i could escort you myself in a few week ' time to the cape or -- or arrange for you go earlier if you desire and if i could not get away probably you would get no further than cape town but it might be easier for you wait there -- than here i shall thank you and bless you always for thinking of it she interrupt softly but there be something -- that i never tell anybody he wait after peter have the news of he father 's death say lady mary with a sob in she throat you do not know that he -- he telegraph to I from madeira he foresee immediately i suppose whither my foolish impulse would lead I and he ask I -- i should rather say he order I -- under no circumstance whatever to follow he out to south africa john remember the doctor 's warning and say nothing so you see -- i can not go say lady mary there be a pause i be bind to say say john presently that in peter 's place i should not have like my mother or any woman i love to come out to the seat of war he show only a proper care for you in forbid it perhaps i be less courageous than he in think more of the present benefit you would derive from the voyage and the change of scene than of the peril and discomfort which might await you for aught we can foretell now at the end of it peter certainly show judgment in telegraph to you do you really think so that it be care for I that make he do it she ask a distant doubtful joy sound in she voice somehow i never think of that i remember he old dislike of be follow about or take care of or -- or spy upon as he use to call it boy just turn into man be often sensitive on those point say john heedful always of the doctor 's warn it be odd i do not see the telegram in that light say poor lady mary i must read it again she speak as hopefully as though she have not read it already a hundred time over try to read loving meaning that be not there between the curt and peremptory line it be not odd thought john to himself it be because you know he too well and he wonder whether he explanation of peter 's action be charitable or merely unscrupulous but lady mary be not really deceive only very grateful to the man who be so tender of heart so tactful of speech as to make it seem even faintly possible that she have misjudge she boy she say to herself that parent be often unreasonable expect impossibility in they wild desire for perfection in they offspring a outsider be unprejudiced by anxiety could judge more fairly john find that the telegram which have almost break she heart be reasonable and justified nay even that it display a dutiful regard for she safety and comfort of which no one but a stranger could possibly have suspect peter she be grateful to john it be a relief and joy to feel that it be she who be to blame and not peter whose heart be in the right place after all and yet though john be so clever and have such a experience of human nature it be the doctor who have put the key into he hand which presently unlock lady mary 's confidence you must not think john that i do not understand what it will be like later when peter come of age of course this house will be he and he be not the kind of young man to be tie to he mother 's apron-string he always want to be independent it be human nature say john i be not blind to he fault say lady mary humbly though they all think so it be of little use to try and hide they from you who will see they for yourself directly my darling come back i pray god it may be soon of course he be spoilt but i be to blame because i make he my idol a only son be always more or less spoil say john he remember he own boyhood and smile sardonically in the darkness he will grow out of it he will come back a man after this experience yes yes and he will want to live he life and i -- i shall have to learn to do without he i know she say i must learn while he be away to -- to depend on myself it be not likely that -- that a woman of my age should have much in common with a manly boy like peter sometimes i wonder whether i really understand my boy at all it be my belief say john that no generation be in perfect touch with another each stand on a different ring of the ladder of time you may stoop to lend a help hand to the younger or reach upward to take a farewell of the older but there must be a look down or a look up no face-to-face talk be possible except upon the same level no real and true comradeship the very word imply a march together under the same circumstance to a common goal and how can we who have to be the commanding officer of the young be they true companion he say lightly and cheerfully i dare say i have expect impossibility say lady mary as though reproach herself it comfort I to think so but i have have time to reflect on many thing since -- February she pause i do not deny i have try to make plan for the future but there be these day to be live through first -- until he come home i be go to propose say john that if agreeable to you i should spend my summer and autumn holiday here instead of go as usual to switzerland i should be only too glad she say in tone of awaken interest but surely -- it would be very dull for you not at all there be a great deal to be do and in accordance with my trust i be bind to set about it say john i propose to spend the next few day in examine the report of the survey that have already be make and in judge of they accuracy for myself when i return here later i could have the work begin and then for some time i could superintend matter personally which be always a good thing do you mean -- the wood she ask i know they have be neglect sir timothy would never have a tree cut down but they be so wild and beautiful there be hundred of pound ' worth of timber perish for want of attention i be responsible for it all until peter come of age say john as i be for the rest of he inheritance it be part of my trust to hand over to he he house and property in the best order i can accord to my own judgment i know something of forestry he add simply you know i be not breed a cockney i be to have be a hertfordshire squire on a small scale have not circumstance necessitate the let of my father 's house when he die but it will be yours again some day no say john quietly it have to be sell -- afterwards he give no further explanation but lady mary recollect instantly the abuse that have be shower on he mother by she sister-in-law when john be report to have sacrifice he patrimony to pay she debt i rather agree with you about the wood she say it vex I always to see a beautiful young tree that should be straight and strong turn into a twisted dwarf in the shade of the overgrowth and the overcrowding the woodman will be delighted he be always grumble it be not only the wood there be the house i suppose it want repair say lady mary have not that better be put off till peter come home i can not neglect my trust say john gravely besides he add the state of the roof be simply appalling many of the beam be actually rotten then there be the drain they be on a system that should not be tolerate in these day nothing have be do for over sixty year and i can hardly say how long before will not it all cost a great deal of money say lady mary a good deal but there be a very large sum of money lie idle which as the will direct may be apply to the general improvement of the house and estate during peter 's minority but over which he be to have no control should it remain unspent until he come of age that be to say it will then -- or what be leave of it -- be invest with the rest of he capital which be all strictly tie up so as old crawley say it will relieve peter 's income in the future if we spend what be necessary now accord to we power in put he house and estate in order it would have to be do sooner or later most assuredly sir timothy as you must know say john gently do not spend above a third of he actual income and so far as mr crawley know spend nothing at all on repair beyond job to the village carpenter and mason i do not know say lady mary he always tell I we be very badly off -- for we position i know nothing of business i do not attend much to mr crawley 's explanation at the time you be unable to attend to he then say john but now i think you should understand the exact position of affair surely my cousin must have talk it over isabellum and georgina never talk business before I you forget i be still a child in they eye she say smile i gather that they be disappointed poor timothy have leave they nothing and that they think i have too much that be all they way of look at it be scarcely in accordance with justice say john shrug he shoulder they each have ten thousand pound leave to they by they father in settlement this be to return to the estate if they die unmarried or childless you have two thousand a year and the dower house for you life but you forfeit both if you re-marry of course say lady mary indifferently i suppose that be the usual thing not quite especially when you personal property be so small i do not know i have any personal property about five hundred pound a year perhaps a little more from the setoun she cry from you father surely you must have know lady mary be silent a moment no i do not know she say presently it do not matter now but timothy never tell I i think i have not a farthing in the world he never mention money matter to I at all then she laugh faintly i could have live all by myself in a cottage in scotland without be beholden to anybody -- on five hundred pound a year could not i there be no reason you should not have a cottage in scotland now if you fancy one say john cheerfully the only memory i have in the world outside my life in this place be of my childhood at home she say john suddenly realize how very very limited she experience have be and wonder less at the almost childish simplicity which characterize she and which in no way mar she natural graciousness and dignity lady mary do not observe he silence because she own thought be busy with a scene which memory have paint for she and far away from the moonlit valley of the youle she see a tall narrow turreted building against a ruddy sunset sky a bare ridge of hill crown sparsely with ragged scotch fir a sea of heather which have seem boundless to a childish imagination i could not go back to scotland now she say with that little wistful-sounding patient sob which move john to such pity that he could scarce contain himself but some day when i be free -- when nobody want I london be the only place worth living in just now whilst we be in such terrible anxiety he say boldly at least there be the papers and telegram all day long and none of this dreary long wait between the post and there be other thing -- to distract one 's attention and keep up one 's courage i do not know what isabellum and georgina would say say lady mary but you -- would you not care to come oh she say half sob it be because i be afraid of care too much life seem to call so loudly to I now and then as though i be tire of sit alone and look up the valley and down the valley i know it all by heart it would be fresh life the stir the movement other people fresh idea beautiful new thing to see but indeed you must not tempt I there be a accent of yearning in she tone a hint of eager anticipation as of a good time come a dream postpone which she would nevertheless be willing one day to enjoy i must not go anywhere i could not -- until my boy come home if he ever come home she add under she breath but when he come home safe and sound as please god he may say john cheerfully why then you have a great deal of lose time to make up ah yes say lady mary and again that wistful note of longing sound i have think sometimes i would not like to die before i have see my birthplace once more and there be -- _ italy _ she say as though the one word convey every vision of earthly beauty which mortal could desire to behold -- as indeed it do and again she add but i do not know what my sister-in-law would say it would be against all the tradition surely lady belstone at least must be less absurdly narrow-minded say john almost impatiently shall i tell you the history of she marriage say lady mary she pretty laugh ring out softly in the darkness and thrill john 's heart and shocked yet further the old lady who sit within strain they ear for the sound of return footstep it take place about forty year ago or less a cousin of she mother 's sir william belstone come to spend a few day here i believe the poor man invite himself because he happen to be stay in the neighborhood he be a gallant old sailor and very polite to both he cousin and one day isabellum interpret he compliment into a proposal of marriage georgina have give I to understand that no one be ever more astounded and terrify than the admiral when he find himself engage to isabellum but apparently he be a chivalrous old gentleman and would not disappoint she it be really rather a sad little story because he die of heart disease very soon after the marriage old mr ash the housekeeper always declare she mistress come home even more old-maidish in she way than she go away and that she quarrel with the poor admiral from morning till night perhaps that be why she have never lighten she garb of woe and she make my life a burden to I because i will not wear a cap ah how heartless it all sound and yet how ridiculous dear cousin john have not i bore you let we go in with characteristic energy john crewys set in hand the repair which he have declare to be so necessary the late squire have apparently be as well aware of the neglect state of he ancestral hall as of he tangled and overgrown wood but he have also it seem be unable to make up he mind to take any step towards amend the condition of either -- or to part with he ever-increasing balance at he banker ' sir timothy have carry both he obstinacy and he dullness into he business affair the family solicitor mr crawley back up the new administrator with all he might over sixty thousand pound uninvested and lie idle at the bank he say lift he hand and eye and one long miserable grumbling over the expense of keep up barracombe one good tenant after another lose because the landlord would keep nothing in repair gardener after gardener leave for want of a shilling increase in weekly wages in case sir peter should turn out to resemble he father we have best not let the grass grow under we foot mr crewy say the shrewd gentleman chuckle but take full advantage of the power entrust to you for the next two year and a quarter sir peter luckily do not come of age until October 1902 that be just what i intend to do say john odd be not it say the lawyer confidentially how often a man will put unlimited power into the hand of a comparative stranger and leave he own son tie hand and foot not a penny of all this capital will sir peter ever have the handling of perhaps a good job too oh dear when i look at the state of he affair in general i feel positively guilty and ashamed to have have even the nominal management of they but what could a man do under the circumstance he pay for my advice and then act directly contrary to it and think he have do a clever thing and outwit he own lawyer but now we shall get thing a bit straight i hope what about buy speccot farm mr crewy it be be we naboth 's vineyard for many a day but we haggle over the price and could not make up we mind to give what the farmer want he 'll have to sell in the end you know but i suppose he could hold out a few year longer if we do not give way he be be to I already say john the price he ask be no doubt a bit above its proper value but it be accommodation land and it would be disappointing if it slip through we finger i propose to offer he pretty nearly what he ask he 'll take it say mr crawley with satisfaction i could never make sir timothy see that it would not pay the fellow to turn out unless he get something over and above the value of he mortgage the next thing i want you to arrange be the purchase of those twenty acre of rough pasture and gorse right in the center of the property say john rent by the man who live outside youlestone at what they call pott 's farm for he wretched half-starved beast to graze upon he be save we the trouble of exterminate the rabbit there i notice he be a inveterate poacher a good thing to give he no further excuse to hang about the place what do you propose to do compensate he burn the gorse cut the bracken and plant larch there be enough picturesque common on the top of the hill where the soil be poor and land be cheap we do not want they in the valley now i propose to give we mind to the restoration of the house the drain the stable and the home farm here be my estimate though mr crawley be so loyal a supporter of the regent of barracombe yet john 's project improvement be far too thorough-going to gain the approval of the potter old retainer of the crewy family though they be unable to question he knowledge or he judgment i telled ` im tu du thing by the little say the woodman who be keep at work mark tree and sapling as he have never work before though john be generous of help and liberal of pay but lard he bai not one tu covet nobody 's gude advice i be vair terrify tu zee arl he know about the dree the squoire ` ee wur like a babe unbarn beside ` un he luke I straight in the eye and ` luke ' sezzee ` we ` a ' get tu git the place in vamous arder vur young zur peter ' sezzee ` a ' i be responsible and danged but what ` a 'll du ` t ' ` ee zays a ' i touch my yead zo and i zays ` very gude zur ' ' a zay ` a ' zo ` twill be yu may depend o not ' perhaps the unwonted stir and bustle the come and go of john crewy the confusion of workman the novel interest of renovate and restore the old house help to brace and fortify lady mary during the month which follow month nevertheless of suspense and anxiety which reduce she almost to a shadow of she former self for peter 's career in south africa prove a adventurous one he have the good luck to distinguish himself in a skirmish almost immediately after he arrival and to win not only the approval of he noble relative and commander but he commission he next exploit however end rather disastrously and peter find himself a prisoner in the now historic bird-cage at pretorium where he spend a dreary restless and perhaps not wholly unprofitable time in the society of man greatly he superior in soldierly and other quality john fear that he mother 's resolution not to follow she boy must inevitably be break when the news of he capture reach barracombe but perhaps peter 's letter have repeat the peremptory injunction of he telegram for she never propose to take the journey to south africa the wave of relief and thankfulness that sweep over the country when the release of the imprison officer become known restore not a little of lady mary 's natural courage and spirit she become more hopeful about she son and more interested daily in the beautify and restoration of he house she say little in she letter to peter of the work at barracombe for john advise she that the boy would probably hardly understand the necessity for it and she herself be doubtful of peter 's approval even if he have understand she have too much intelligence to be doubtful of john 's wisdom or of mr crawley 's zeal for he interest the letter she receive be few and scanty for peter be but a poor correspondent and he make little comment on the explanatory letter regard he father 's will which john and mr crawley think proper to send he the solicitor be justly indignant at sir peter 's neglect to reply to this carefully thought-out and faultlessly indited epistle he be just a chip of the old block say mr crawley but he mother divine that peter be partly offend at he own utter exclusion from any share of responsibility and partly too much occupy to give much attention to any matter outside he soldier she say to herself that he be really too young to be trouble with business and she begin to believe as the work at barracombe advance that the result of so much planning and forethought must please he after all the consolation of work in he interest be delightful to she she day be fill almost miraculously as it seem to she with new occupation fresh hope and happier idea than the idle dream which be all that have hitherto be permit to she john desire she help or she suggestion at every turn and constantly consult she taste she artistic instinct for decoration be hardly less strong than he own though infinitely less cultivate he send she the most engrossing and delightful book to repair the omission and he bring she plan and drawing which he beg she to copy for he the day which have hang so heavily on she hand be scarcely long enough the careful restoration of the banqueting-hall necessitate new curtain and chair-cover lady mary look doubtfully at john when this matter have be decide and then at the upholstery of the drawing-room face the south terrace the fade magenta silk tarnish gilded mirror and gold-starred wall-paper which decorate these apartment have offend she eye for year john laugh at she hesitation and advise she to consult she sister-in-law on the subject and this settle the question they would choose bottle-green she say in horror and she salve she conscience by pay for the redecoration of the drawing-room out of she own pocket john discover that lady mary have never draw a cheque in she life and that mr crawley 's lesson in the management of she own affair fill she with as much awe as amusement \* \* \* \* \* so the old order change and give place to the new at barracombe and the summer grow to winter and winter to summer again and peter do not return as he might with the corps in which he have the honor to serve want of energy be not one of he defect he be a strong hardy young man a fine horseman and a good shot and eager to gain distinction for himself he pass into a fresh corps of newly raise yeomanry and go through the winter campaign of 1901 from April to September without a scratch he mother implore he to come home but peter 's letter be contemptuous of danger if he be to be shoot plenty of better fellow than he have be do for he write and come home to go to oxford or whatever he guardian might be please to order he to do be not at all in he line when he be really wanted elsewhere to do he justice he have no idea how boastfully he letter read he have not the art of express himself on paper and he be always in a hurry the moment when he be move by a vague affection for he home or he mother be seldom the actual moment which he devote to correspondence and the pass idea of the moment be all peter know how to convey lady mary could not but be aware of she son 's complete independence of she but the realization of it no longer fill she with such dismay as formerly she outlook upon life be widen insensibly the young soldier 's luck desert he at last barely six week before the declaration of peace peter be wound at rooiwal the war office and the account of the action in the newspaper report he injury as severe but a telegram from peter himself bring relief and even rejoice to barracombe -- _ shot in the arm do splendidly invalide home sailing as soon as doctor allow _ chapter x i never complain canon birch say lady belstone resignedly but it be a great relief as i can not deny to open my mind to you who know so well what this place use to be like in my dear brother 's time the canon have be absent from youlestone on a long holiday and on he return find that the workman who have reign over barracombe for nearly two year have at length depart the inhabitant have be hunt from one part of the house to another as the work proceed but now the usual living-room have be restore to they occupant and peace and order prevail where all have be noise and confusion i should not have know the place say the canon gaze round he nor i we make a point of _ say _ nothing say miss crewy pathetically but it be almost impossible not to _ look _ now and then speak for yourself georgina say she sister with asperity one can not _ look _ furniture out of one room and into another the old lady sit forlornly in they corner by the great open hearth whereon the log be pile in readiness for a fire because they often find the early June evening chilly but the sofa with broken spring which they specially affect have be mend and recover and be no longer they sadly agree near so comfortable as in its cripple past the banqueting-hall which be the very heart of barracombe house have be carefully and skilfully restore to its ancient dignity the paint and graining which have disfigure its mighty beam and solid panelling have be remove and the freshly polish oak shone forth in its noble age shear of all tawdry disguise the space of wall and roof between the beam and above the panel be now of a creamy tint not far remove as the two indignant critic point out from common whitewash a great screen of spanish leather sheltered the door from the vestibule and secure somewhat more privacy for the hall as a sitting-room the vandyck command the staircase attract immediate attention as it face the principal entry in the wide space between the two great window be two portrait of equal size the famous sir peter crewy by lely paint to resemble as nearly as possible he royal master in dress and attitude and he brother timothy by kneller farmer timothy 's small shrewd gray eye appear to follow the gazer all over the hall and he sober wear apparel a plain green coat without collar or cape contrast effectively with the cavalier 's lace doublet and feathered hat go be the early victorian portrait go the big glass case of stuff bird and weasel go the round mahogany table the waxen bouquet and the horsehair chair the ancient tapestry beside the carven balustrade of the staircase remain but it have be clean and even mend a oak dresser black with age and laden with blue and white china lurk in a shadowy corner comfortable easy-chair and odd old-fashioned settee furnish the hall in the oriel window stand a spinning-wheel and a grandfather 's chair a great bowl of rose stand on the broad window-seat there be rose indeed everywhere and book on every table but the crowning grievance of all be the cottage piano which john have send to lady mary the case have be specially make of hand-carven oak to match the room as nearly as might be it be open and beside it be a heap of music and on it another bowl of rose ay you may well look horrify say miss crewy to the canon whose admiration and delight be very plainly depict on he rubicund countenance where be we cloak and umbrella that be what i say to isabellum where be we golosh where be anything indeed that one would expect to find in a gentleman 's hall not so much as a walking-stick everything to be keep in the outer hall where tramp could as easily step in and help themselves but we poor foolish mary fancy that peter will be delighted to find he old home turn upside down my belief be say lady belstone that peter will just insist on all this wooden rubbish trot back to the attic where my dear granny not be accustom to wooden furniture very properly hide it away if you will believe I canon that dresser be bring up from the _ kitchen _ and every single pot and pan that decorate it use to be keep in the housekeeper 's room that lumber old chest be in the harness-room pretty ornament for a gentleman 's sitting-room if peter have grow up anything like my poor brother he will not put up with it at all i suppose in one sense it be peter 's house or will be very shortly say the canon in _ every _ sense it be peter 's house cry lady belstone and he come of age thank heaven in October i have hope to hear he have sail say the canon no news be good news i hope the last telegram say he wound be do well but do not give any date for he return young john say we may expect he any time i do not know what he know about it more than any one else however say miss crewy he letter give no detail about himself say lady belstone he make no fuss about he wounded arm he be a thorough crewy not give to make a to-do about trifle he could only write a few word with he left hand say miss crewy more could not have be expect of he yet poor mary be quite put out as i plainly see though she say nothing because the boy have not write at greater length i find they have make a good many preparation for he welcome down in the village say the canon in case he should take we by surprise so many of the officer have get passage at the last moment unexpectedly and we shall turn out to receive he _ en masse _ mr crewy have give we _ carte blanche _ for firework and flag and they be to have a fine bean-feast we cousin john take a great deal upon himself and have make uncommonly free with peter 's money say lady belstone shake she head i wish he may not find himself pretty nigh ruin when he come to look into he own affair in my opinion fred crawley be little better than a fool he be most devoted to peter 's interest my dear lady say the canon warmly and he inform I that mr john crewy have do wonder in the past two year he have turn the whole place topsy-turvy in two year in my opinion say miss crewy i do not deny that he be a rise young man and that he manners be very take but what can a cockney lawyer know about timber pray no man on earth lawyer or no lawyer say lady belstone emphatically will ever convince I that one can be better than _ well _ my sister allude to the drain it be a sore point canon say miss crewy in my opinion it be all this modern drainage that set up typhoid fever and nothing else bless I say the canon we poor mary have grow so dependent on john however that she will hear nothing against he one have to mind one 's p 's and q 's say lady belstone he plan the alteration in this very hall say miss crewy and the only excuse he offer so far as i could understand be that it would amuse poor mary to carry they out do a widow wish to be amuse say lady belstone indignantly and be she amuse dear lady ask the canon anxiously when she see we horror and dismay she smile do you call that a smile georgina i call it a laugh it take almost nothing to make she laugh nowadays you would not wish she to be too melancholy say the canon almost pleadingly one so -- so charming so -- canon birch say lady belstone in awful tone she be a widow the canon be silent display a embarrassment which do not escape the vigilant observation of the sister who exchange a meaning glance well may you remind we of the fact isabellum say miss crewy for she have discard the last semblance of mourning time fly so fast say the canon as though impel to defend the absent it be -- get on for three year since poor sir timothy die it be but two year and four month say miss crewy it be thirty-three year since the admiral go aloft say lady belstone who often become slightly nautical in phrase when allude to she depart husband and look at I the pocket-handkerchief she hold up be deeply border with ink orthodox streamer float on either side she severe countenance the canon look and shake he head he feel that the mystery of a widow 's garment have best not be discuss by one who dwell so to speak outside they poor mary can do nothing gradually say miss crewy she leap in a single hour out of a black dress into a white one she anguish when we poor timothy succumb to that fatal operation surpass even the bound of decorum say lady belstone and yet -- she would not wear a cap she appeal to the canon with such a pathetic expression in she small red-rimmed gray eye that he could not answer lightly they face he with anxious look and droop tremulous mouth they have grow curiously alike during the close association of nearly eighty year though in they far-off day of girlhood no one have think they to resemble each other miss crewy crochet a shawl with hand so delicately care for and preserve that they scarce show any sign of she great age she sister wear glove as be the habit of both when unoccupied and she grasp she handkerchief in black kid finger that tremble slightly with emotion the canon realize that the old lady be seriously troubled concern they sister-in-law 's delinquency we speak to you of course as we _ clergyman _ say miss crewy and the poor gentleman could only bow sympathetically i be a old friend he say feelingly and you confidence be sacred but i think in you very natural -- er -- affection for lady mary -- the word stick in he throat -- you be perhaps over-anxious in judge those younger than ourselves say the canon gallantly coupling himself with he auditor ' though acutely conscious that he be some twenty year the junior of both we must not forget that they recover they spirit by a merciful dispensation of providence more quickly than we should ourselves in the like circumstance say the canon who be as light-hearted a cleric as any in england they do indeed say lady belstone emphatically when they can sing and play all the day and half the night like we dear mary and young john you see the piano block up the hall though sir timothy hate music say miss crewy she own mourning be thoughtfully graduate to indicate the time which have elapse since sir timothy 's decease she wear a violet silk of sombre hue ornament by a black silk apron and a black lace scarf the velvet bow which serve so very imperfectly as a skull-cap be also violet intimate a semi-assuaged but respectfully lengthen grief for the depart and now this maddest scheme of all say miss crewy bless I what mad scheme a house in london be to be hire as soon as peter come home be that all but surely that be very natural for my part i have often wonder why none of you ever care to go to london if only for you shopping i be very fond of a trip to town myself now and then for a few day a few day it seem would not suffice we cousin john 's notion he be pleased to think peter may require skilled medical attendance and since he write he be in rag a new outfit these it seem can only be obtain in the metropolis nowadays my brother 's tailor still live in exeter and with all he fault -- and nobody can dislike he more than i do -- i have never hear it deny that dr blundell be a skilful apothecary _ very _ skilful add miss crewy you remember isabellum how quickly he put you poor little fido out of he agony that be nothing all doctor understand animal ' illness they kill number of guinea-pig before they be allow to try they hand on human being say lady belstone the point be that if my poor brother timothy have not be mad enough to go to london he would have be alive at this moment i have never hear of dr blundell find it necessary -- much as i detest the man -- to perform a operation on anybody apart from this painful subject my dear lady murmur the canon i presume it be only a furnished house that lady mary contemplate during all the year of he married life sir timothy never hire a furnished house say miss crewy the home of he father suffice he she may want a change suggest the canon miss crewy interpret he literally no she be in the best of health better than i have ever see she and -- and _ gayer _ say lady belstone with emphasis people who be gay and bright in disposition be the very one who -- who pine for a little excitement at time say the courageous canon there be so much to be see and do and hear in london for instance as you say -- she be passionately fond of music she get plenty _ we _ get more than enough say miss crewy grimly i mean _ good _ music then he recollect himself in alarm no no i do not mean hers be not charming and mr john 's playing be delightful but -- there be a organ in the parish church say miss crewy crochet more busily than ever i have hear no complaint of the choir have you no no but -- besides music there be so many other thing he say dismally she like picture too it do not look like it canon say lady belstone sorrowfully she wave she handkerchief towards the panelled wall she have remove the family portrait to the lumber-room at least the vandyck have never be see to greater advantage say the canon hopefully and i hear the gallery upstairs have be restore and support to render it safe to walk upon which will enable you to take pleasure in the fine picture there i be sadly afraid that it be not picture that poor mary hanker after but _ theater _ say miss crewy john have persuade she if persuasion be need which i take leave to doubt that there be nothing improper in visit such place my dear brother think otherwise you know i do not share you opinion on that point say the canon though not much of a theatre-goer myself still -- a widow at the theater say lady belstone even in the admiral 's lifetime i do not go be a sailor and _ not _ a clergyman she add sternly he frequent such place of amusement but he say he could not have enjoy a ballet properly with I look on he feeling be singularly delicate i be afraid people must be talk about dear mary a good deal canon say miss crewy whisk a ball of wool from the floor to she knee with much dexterity she keen eye gleam at she visitor through she spectacles though she finger never stop for a moment i hope not i have hear nothing my experience of man say lady belstone be that they never _ do _ hear anything but a widow can not be too cautious in she behavior all eye be fix i know not why upon a widow she add modestly we do we best to guard dear mary 's reputation say miss crewy the impetuous canon spring to he foot with a half-uttered exclamation then recollect the age and temperament of the speaker he check himself and try to laugh i do not know he say who have say or ever could say one single word against that -- against we dear and sweet lady mary but if there _ be _ any one i can only say that such word have better not be utter in my presence that be all dear I canon birch you excite yourself very unnecessarily say lady belstone with assume surprise you be just confirm we suspicion what suspicion almost shout the canon that we dear lady mary 's extraordinary partiality for we cousin john have _ not _ escape the observation of a censorious world though we have do we best never to leave he alone with she for a single moment interpolate miss crewy the canon turn rather pale there can be no question of censure he say lady mary be a very charming and beautiful woman who could dare to blame she if she contemplate such a step as -- as a second marriage a second marriage we say nothing of a second marriage say lady belstone sharply you go a great deal too fast canon luckily we poor mary be debar from any such act of folly i have no patience with widow who re-marry debar from a second marriage be it possible you do not know the sister exchange mean glance he look from one to the other in bewilderment if we sister-in-law remarry say miss crewy she forfeit the whole of she jointure be that all he cry be that all echo miss crewy much offend it be no less than two thousand a year in my opinion far too heavy a charge on poor peter 's estate no man with any self-respect say lady belstone would desire to marry a widow without a jointure i should have form a low opinion indeed of any gentleman who ask _ I _ to marry he without first make sure that the admiral have provide for I as he ought and as he _ have _ the canon though mentally echo the sentiment with much warmth think it wiser to change the topic of conversation experience have teach he to discredit most of the assumption of lady mary 's sister-in-law where she be concerned and he rise in hope of effect he escape without further ado i believe i be to meet mr crewy at luncheon he say and with you permission i will stroll out into the grounds and look he up he tell I where he be to be find he be to be find all over the place he seize every opportunity of come down here i can not believe in he make so much money in london when he manage to get away so often as for mary you know she way of invite people to lunch and then go out for a walk or up to she room as likely as not but i suppose she will be down directly if you like to wait here say lady belstone who have plenty more to say i should be glad of a turn before luncheon say the canon who have no mind to hear it and there be a hour and a half yet you lunch at two i come straight from the school-house as lady mary suggest i want to have a look at the improvement sarah hewel be come to lunch say miss crewy i can not say we approve of she since she have be out so much in london and become such a notorious young person it be very odd to I say the canon benevolently little sarah grow up into a fashionable beauty i often see she name in the papers she be exactly the kind of person to attract we cousin john who be quite foolish about she red hair in my young day red hair be just a misfortune like any other say miss crewy dr blundell be lunch here also i need hardly say since my dear brother 's death we keep open house it use not to be the fashion to encourage country doctor to be tame cat say lady belstone viciously but he pretend to like the innovation and get round young john and inquire after peter and please mary ay ay it will be a great moment for she when the boy come back a great moment for you all say the canon absently he stand with he back to the tall leather screen which guard the entrance to the hall and do not hear the gentle opening of the great door i trust say miss crewy that we be not a family prone to display weak emotion even on the most try occasion to be sure not say the canon disconcert still i can not think of it myself without a little -- a great deal -- of thankfulness for he preservation through this terrible war now so happily end and to think the boy should have earn so much distinction for himself and behave so gallantly god bless the lad you be well aware say the canon blow he nose that i have always be fond of peter thank you canon say peter for a moment no one be sure that it be peter who have come so quietly round the great screen and into the hall though he stand somewhat in the shadow still a young man look older than he age and several inch taller than peter have be when he go away a young man deeply tan and very wiry and thin in figure with

the wide step and in she hand she carry a quantity of rose a black ribbon be bind about she waist and seem only to emphasize the slenderness of she form she brown hair be wave loosely above she brow it be not much less abundant though much less bright than in she girlhood the freshness of youth have go for ever but she loveliness have depend less upon that radiant color which have once be hers than upon she clear-cut feature and exquisitely shaped head and throat she blue eye look forth from a face white and delicate as a shell cameo beneath finely pencil brow but they shine now with a new hopefulness -- a timid expectancy of happiness they be no longer pensive and downcast as peter have know they best the future have be shroud by a heavy mist of hopelessness always -- for lady mary but the fog have lift and a fair landscape lay before she not bright alas with the brightness and the promise of the morning-time but yet -- there be sunny afternoon and the landscape be bright still though long shadow from the past fall across it peter see only that he mother for some extraordinary reason look many year younger than when he have leave she and that she have exchange she customary dull old-fashioned garb for a beautiful and become dress he give a involuntary start and immediately she perceive he she stretch out she arm to he with a cry that ring through the rafter of the hall the rose be scatter my boy o god my darling boy in the space of a flash -- a second -- lady mary have see and understand she arm be round he and she face hide upon he empty sleeve she be as still as death peter stoop he head and lay he cheek against she hair he feel for one fleeting moment that he have never know before how much he love he mother forgive I for keep it dark mother he whisper

you eye she cry in sudden anxiety no no i be just a little short-sighted that be all he mumble rather awkwardly he find it difficult to explain that he have travel home with a distinguished man who have captivate he youthful fancy and cause he to fall into a fit of hero-worship and to imitate he idol as closely as possible hence the eyeglass and a few harmless mannerism which temporarily distinguish peter and astonish he previous acquaintance but there be something else in peter 's manner too for the moment a new tenderness which peep through he old armor of sulky indifference the chill armor of he boyhood which have grow something too strait and narrow for he even now and from which he would doubtless presently emerge altogether -- but not yet though lady mary laugh she be tremble and shake with emotion peter come to the sofa and knelt beside she there and she take he hand in both hers and lay she face upon it and they be very still for a few moment mother dear say

put off the evil day as long as possible like my father do i see say lady mary she smile faintly and when it _ do _ arrive say peter my wife will just have to understand that she come second i have no

lady mary of course they be snappish at time i suppose all old people get like that but on the whole you manage to jog along pretty comfortably do not you oh yes say lady mary we jog along pretty comfortably then do not you see how snug we shall be say peter triumphantly i can tell you a fellow learn to appreciate home when he have be without one so to speak for over two year and home would not be home without you mother dear lady mary sink suddenly back among the cushion she feeling be divide between dismay and self-reproach yet she be faintly amuse too -- amuse at peter and herself she boy have return to she with sentiment that be surely all that a mother could desire and yet -- yet she feel instinctively that peter be peter still that he thought be not she thought nor he way she way then the self-reproach begin to predominate in lady mary 's mind how could she criticize she boy she darling who have prove himself a son to be proud of and who have come back to she with a heart so full of love and loyalty and _ you _ could not live without _ I _ could you say peter affectionately and he laugh i suppose you mean to go into that little damp tumble-down dower house and watch over I from there now do not you mummy i -- i think when you come of age falter lady mary that i should give up barracombe house to you naturally i could come and stay with you sometimes -- whether you be marry or not you know and -- and of course the dower house _ do _ belong to I i will not hear of you go there say peter stoutly whether i be married or not it be a beastly place it be very picturesque say lady mary guiltily and i -- i be not thinking of live there all the year round why where on earth else could you have go he demand regard she with astonishment through the eyeglass there be several place -- london she falter london say peter but my father have a perfect horror of london he would not have like it at all he belong -- to the old school say lady mary meekly to younger people perhaps -- a occasional change might be pleasant and profitable oh to _ younger _ people say peter in mollify tone i do not say i shall _ never _ run up to london i dare say i shall be oblige now and then on business not often though i hate absentee landlord as my father do travel be say to open the mind murmur lady mary weakly pursue she argument as she suppose it to be i have see enough of the world now to last I a lifetime say peter in sublime unconsciousness that any fate but he own could be in question i do not think you would have change so much as this peter she say rather dismally you use to find this place so dull i know i use peter agree but oh mother if you know how sick i have be now and then with longing to get back to it i make up my mind a thousand time how it should all be when i come home again and that you and I would be everything in the world to each other as you use to wish when i be a selfish boy think only of get away and be independent i be afraid i use to be rather selfish mother perhaps you be -- a little say lady mary you will never have to complain of _ that _ again say peter she look at he with a faint pathetic smile i shall take care of you and look after you just as my father use to do say peter now you rest quietly here -- and he gently lay she down among the cushion on the sofa -- whilst i take a look round the old place let I come with you darling good heaven no i should tire you to death my father never like you to go climb about i be much more active than i use to be say lady mary no no you must lie down you look

face and then regard she in a curious doubtful manner you be change mother i can not think what it be be not you hair do differently -- or something poor lady mary lift both hand to she head and look at he with something like alarm in she blue eye be it perhaps it be she falter do not you like it peter i like the old way best say peter but this be so much more become peter a fellow do not care say peter loftily whether he mother 's hair be become or not he like to see she always the same as when he be a little chap it be -- sweet of you to have such a thought murmur lady mary she take she courage in both hand but the other way be out of fashion peter why mother you never use to follow the fashion before i go away you will not begin now at you age will you _ at my age _ repeat lady mary blankly then she look at he with that wonder pathetic smile which seem to have replace already since peter come home the joyousness which have timidly steal back from she vanish youth at my age say lady mary you be not very complimentary peter you do not expect a fellow to pay compliment to he mother say peter stare at she why mother what have come to you and besides -- besides i be sure papa hate compliment and all that sort of rot peter blurt out in boyish fashion do not you remember how fond he be of quote ` praise to the face be open disgrace ' the late sir timothy like many middle-class people have take a compliment almost as a personal offence and regard the utterer however gracious or sincere with suspicion neither have the squire himself err on the side of flattering he fellow-creature oh yes i remember say lady mary and she rise from the sofa why what be the matter ask peter i have not vex you have i she turn impetuously and throw she arm round he as he stand by the hearth gaze down upon she in bewilderment vex with my boy my darling my only son on the very day when god have give he back to I she cry passionately my poor wounded boy my hero oh no no but i want only love from you to-day and no reproach peter why i be not dream of reproach you mother he hesitate only you be a bit different from what i expect -- that be all have i disappointed you no no only i -- well i think i might find you change but in a different way he say half apologetically perhaps older you know or -- or sadder lady mary 's white face flush scarlet from brow to chin but peter occupy with he monocle observe nothing i would prepare myself for that he say and to find you all in black and -- i throw off my mourning she murmur the very day i hear you be come home she pause and add hurriedly it be very thoughtless i be sorry i ought to have think of you feeling my darling aunt isabellum have never change hers have she say peter aunt isabellum be a good deal more conventional than i be and a great many year older say lady mary tremulously i do not see what that have to do with it say peter she turn away and begin to gather up she scattered rose a few moment since the rose have be less than nothing to she what be rose what be anything compare to peter now they creep back into they own little place in creation they beauty and fragrance dumbly convey a subtle comfort to she soul as she lovingly lay one against another until a glowing bouquet of coppery golden hue be form she lift a ewer from the old dresser and pour water into a great silver goblet wherein she plunge the stalk of she rose why should they be leave to fade because peter have come home you remember these she say from the great climber round my bedroom window i lean out and cut they -- little thinking -- peter signify a gloomy assent he stand before the chimneypiece watch he mother but not offer to help she rather as though undecided as to what he next word ought to be peter darling it be so funny to see you stand there so tall and so change -- but though it be so funny the tear be drop from she blue eye which fill and overflow like a child 's without painful effort or grimace you -- you remind I so of you father she say almost involuntarily i be glad i be like he say peter she sigh how i use to wish you be a little tiny bit like I too but i be not be i no you be not not one tiny bit she answer wistfully but you do love I peter have not i prove i love you say peter and she perceive that he feeling be hurt come back and -- and think only of you and -- and of never leave you any more why mother -- for in a agony of love and remorse she be cling to he and sob with she face press against he empty sleeve -- why mother peter repeat in softened tone of course i love you the drawing-room door be cautiously open and peter 's aunt come into the hall on tiptoe follow by the canon ah i think so say lady belstone in the self-congratulatory tone of the successful prophet it have be too much for poor mary she have be overcome by the joy of dear peter 's return chapter xii try my salt dear mary say miss crewy hasten to apply the remedy which be always to be find in she black velvet reticule i blame myself say the canon distressfully -- i blame myself i should have insist on break the news to she gently lady mary smile upon they all on the contrary she say i be offer not a moment ago to take peter round and show he the improvement we have be so much occupy with each other that he have not have time to look round he i wish he may think they improvement my love say lady belstone miss crewy joyously scent battle hasten to join force with she sister we be far from criticize any change you dear mother may have be induce to make she say but as you aunt isabellum have frequently observe to I what _ can _ a londoner know of landscape gardening a londoner say peter you guardian my boy say the canon nervously he have slightly open out the view that be all you good aunt be intend to say peter 's good aunt open she mouth to contradict this assertion indignantly but lady mary break in with some impatience i do not mean the tree of course the house be shut in far too closely by the tree at the back and side we want more air more light more freedom she draw a long breath and fling out she hand in unconscious illustration but there be many very necessary change that -- that peter will like to see say lady mary glance almost defiantly at the pursed-up mouth and lower eyelid of the sister peter walk suddenly into the middle of the banqueting-hall and look round he why what be come to the old place it be -- it be change somehow what have you be do to it he demand do not you -- do not you like it peter falter lady mary the roof be not safe you know and have to be mend and -- and when it be all do up the furniture and curtain look so dirty and ugly and inappropriate i send they away and bring down some of the beautiful old thing that belong to you great-grandmother and make the hall brighter and more livable peter examine the new aspect of he domain with lower brow i do not like it at all he announce finally i hate change the sister breathe again so like he father they allegiance to sir timothy have be transfer to he heir you guardian approve say lady mary she turn proudly away but she could not keep the pain altogether out of she voice neither would she stoop to solicit peter 's approval before she rejoicing opponent mr john crewy be a very great connoisseur say the canon he tax he memory for corroborative evidence and bring out the result with honest pride i believe curiously enough that he spend most of he spare time at the british museum lady mary 's lip quiver with laughter in the midst of she very real distress and mortification but the argument appear to the canon a most suitable one and he be further encourage by peter 's reception of it if my guardian approve i suppose it be all right say the young man with a effort my father leave all that sort of thing in he hand i understand and he know what he be do i say where 's that great vase of wax flower that use to stand on the center table under a glass shade darling say lady mary it jar so with the whole scheme of decoration i be take care of that in my room peter say miss crewy and the stuff bird and the weasel and the ferret that i be so fond of when i be a little chap you do not mean to say you have do away with those too cried peter wrathfully they -- they be in the gun-room say lady mary it seem such a -- such -- a appropriate place for they i believe say the canon nervously that stuffing be no longer consider decorative after all _ why _ should we place dead animal in we sitting-room he look round with the anxious smile of the would-be peacemaker they be very much worm-eaten peter say lady mary but if you would like they bring back -- perhaps the pain in she voice penetrate even peter 's perception for he glance hastily towards she it do not matter he say magnanimously if you and my guardian decide they be rotten there be a end of it of course i would rather have thing as they use to be but after all this time i expect there be bind to be a few change he turn from the contemplation of the hall to face he relative squarely with the air of a autocrat who have decree that the subject be at a end by-the-by say peter where _ be _ john crewy they tell I he be stop here he will be in directly say lady mary and sarah hewel ought to be here presently too she be come to luncheon sarah say peter i should like to see she again be she still such a rum little toad always get into scrape and come to you for comfort i think say lady mary and she blue eye twinkle -- i think you may be surprise to see little sarah she be grow up now of course say peter she be only a year younger than i be lady mary wonder why peter 's way of say _ of course _ jar upon she so much he have always be brusque and abrupt it be the family fashion be it because she have grow accustomed to the tactful and gentle method of john crewy that it seem to have become suddenly such a intolerable fashion sir timothy have quite honestly believe tactfulness to be a form of insincerity he do not recognize it as the highest outward expression of self-control but lady mary since she have know john crewy know also that it be consideration for the feeling of other which cause the wise man to order he speech carefully the canon shake he head when peter state that miss hewel be he junior by a twelvemonth she might be ten year older he say in awe-struck tone i have always hear that woman be extraordinarily adaptable but i never realize it before however to be sure she have see a good deal more of the world than you have more than most of we though in such a comparatively short space of time but she be one in a thousand for quickness see more of the world than i have say peter astonished why i have be soldier in south africa for over two year i do not think soldier bring much worldly wisdom in its train i should be rather sorry to think it do say lady mary gently but sarah have be with lady tintern all this while a very worldly woman indeed from all i have hear say miss crewy severely but a very great lady say lady mary who know all the famous people not only in england but in europe the daughter of a viceroy and the wife of a man who be not only a peer and a great landowner but also a distinguished ambassador and she have take sarah everywhere and the child be a acknowledged beauty in london and paris lady tintern be delighted with she and declare she have take the world by storm we never think she a beauty down here say peter rather contemptuously perhaps we do not appreciate she sufficiently down here say lady mary smile why who be she after all cry peter a very beautiful and self-possessed young woman and lady tintern 's niece ` whom not to know argue yourself unknown ' say lady mary laughing outright john say people be actually mob she picture in the academy he could not get near it i mean say peter almost sulkily that she be only old colonel hewel 's daughter whom we have know all we life perhaps one be in danger of undervalue people one have know all one 's life say lady mary lightly peter mutter something to the effect that he be sorry to hear sarah have grow up like that but he word be lose in the tumultuous entry of dr blundell who peal the front door bell and rush into the hall almost simultaneously he dark face be flush and enthusiastic he come straight to peter and hold out he hand a thousand welcome sir peter lady mary i congratulate you i come up in my dog-cart as fast as possible to let you know the people be turn out _ en masse _ to welcome you they be assemble at the crewy arm and go to hurry up to the house in a regular procession band and all we be proud of we young hero you see say the canon and he lay he hand affectionately on peter 's shoulder you will have to say a few word to they say lady mary must i say the hero let 's go out on the terrace and see what be go on we can watch they the whole way up he open the door into the south drawing-room and through the open window there float the distant strain of the village band canon you arm say lady belstone lady mary and she son have hasten out on to the terrace the old lady pause in the doorway they be particular in such matter i believe i take precedence georgina say lady belstone apologetically i be far from dispute it isabellum say miss crewy draw back with great dignity you be the elder age do not count in these matter i take precedence as a married woman will you bring up the rear georgina as my poor admiral would have say miss crewy bestow a parting toss of the head upon the doctor and follow she victorious sister the doctor laugh silently to himself stand in the pretty shady drawing-room now gay with flower and chintz and dresden china i wonder if she would not have be even more annoyed with my presumption if i _ have _ offer she my arm he say to himself amusedly than she be offend by my neglect to do so he do not follow the other into the blinding sunshine of the terrace he have have a long morning 's work and be hot and tired he look at he watch past one o'clock h be we be lucky if we get anything to eat before half-past two all the servant have run out of course no use ringing for whisky and seltzer all the better but at least one can rest the pleasantness of the room refresh he spirit the interior of he own house in brawnton be not much more entice than the exterior the doctor have no time to devote to such matter he sit down very willingly in a big armchair and enjoy a moment 's quiet in the shade glance through the half-closed green shutter at the brilliant picture without the top level of the terrace garden be carpet with pattern bed of heliotrope and lobelium and variegated foliage against the faint blue-green of the opposite hill rise the gray stone urn on the pillar of the balcony and from the urn hang trail ivy geranium with pink or scarlet blossom make splash of color on the background of gray distance round the pillar wind large blue clemati and white passion-flower lady mary stand full in the sunshine which lend once more the golden glory of she vanish youth to she brown hair and the dazzle of new-fallen snow to she summer gown close to she side touch she stand the young soldier straight and tall with uncovered head tower above the little group the old sister have parasol and the canon wear he shovel hat but the doctor waste no time in observe they manifestation of delight and excitement so my beautiful lady have get she precious boy back safe and sound save for he right arm and doubly precious because that be miss god bless she a thousand time he think to himself but she sweet face look more sorrowful than joyful when i come in what have he be say i wonder to make she look like

exclamation of horror why good heaven -- yes say the doctor quietly the poor fellow have lose he right arm there be a sound of distant cheer and the band could be hear faintly play the _ conquer hero _ he say nothing of it say john no he be a plucky chap with all he fault have he so many fault say john the doctor shake he head i be mistaken if he will not turn out a chip of the old block though he be better-looking than he father he be get sir timothy 's very expression he be turn out a gallant soldier anyway say john cheerily do not croak blundell we 'll make a man of he yet please god you may for he mother 's sake say the doctor and he return to he armchair john crewys stand by the open french window and drink in the refreshing breeze which flutter the muslin curtain he calm and thoughtful face be turn away from the doctor who know very well why john 's gaze be so intent upon the group without shall i warn he or shall i let it alone think blundell i suppose they have be wait only for this if that selfish cub object as he will -- i feel very sure of that -- will she be weak enough to sacrifice she happiness or can i trust john crewy he look strong enough to take care of himself and of she he look at john 's decide profile silhouette against the curtain and thought of peter 's narrow face weak but obstinate he mutter to himself shrewd suspicious eye but a recede chin what chance would the boy have against a man a man with strength to oppose he and brain to outwit he none save for the one undoubted fact -- the boy hold he mother 's heart in the hollow of he careless hand there be a tremendous burst of cheer no longer distant and the band play louder lady mary come hurry across the terrace weep and agitate and half blind by she tear she stumble over the threshold of the window and almost fall into john 's arm he draw she into the shadow of the curtain john she cry she see no one else oh i can not bear it oh peter peter my boy my poor boy the doctor with a swift and noiseless movement turn the handle of the window next he and let himself out on to the terrace when john look up he be already go lady mary do not hear the slight sound oh john she say my boy 's come

woman who want to be happy no more surely than to every man who love he work and see it slip from he grasp say john slowly it be a tragedy we all have to face for that matter but so much later say lady mary quickly i do not see why woman should leave off want to be happy any sooner than man he say stoutly but nature do she answer john 's eye twinkle for my part i be thankful to fate which cause I to fall in love with a woman only ten year my junior instead of with a girl young enough to be my daughter i have gain a companion as well as a wife and marvellously adaptive as young woman be i be conceit enough to think my idea have travel beyond the idea of most girl of eighteen and i be not conceit enough to suppose the girl of eighteen would not find I a old fogey very much in the way let boy mate with girl say i and man with woman lady mary smile in spite of herself you know john you would argue entirely the other way round if you happen to be in love with -- sarah she say to be sure say john it be my trade to argue for the side which retain my service i be you servant thank heaven and not sarah 's and i have no intention of quit you service he add more gravely we have settle the question of the future the empty future that suddenly grow so bright say lady mary dreamily do you remember how you talk of -- italy where we shall yet spend we honeymoon say john but i believe you like better to hear of my shabby room in london which you mean to share of course she say simply i know i should bring you so little money and you think barrister always live from hand to mouth and make no allowance for my have get on in my profession ah what do it matter i think you will find it make just a little difference john say smile outside circumstance make less difference to woman than man suppose say lady mary they be oh so willing to be pampered in luxury and oh so willing to fly to the other extreme and do without thing be they really say john rather dryly he glance at the little soft white hand he hold and smile it look so unfitted to help itself lady mary be rest in she armchair she delicate face still flush with emotion a transparent purple shade beneath the blue eye betray that she have be weep but she be calm by john 's strong and tranquil presence the shady room be cool and fragrant with the scent of heliotrope and mignonette the band have reach a level plateau below the terrace garden and be play martial air to encourage straggler in the procession and to give the principal inhabitant of youlestone time to arrive and to regain they wind after the steep ascent every time a batch of new arrival recognize peter 's tall form on the terrace a fresh burst of cheer rise from all side of the valley hurry figure could be see approach barracombe house the noise and confusion without seem to increase the sense of quiet within and the sound of the gathering crowd make they feel apart and alone together as they have never feel before so all we dream be to be shatter say john quietly because you prayer have be grant and peter have come home if you could have hear all he say she whisper sadly he have come home love I trust I dependent on I as he have never be before since he babyhood do not you see -- that even if it break my heart i could not fail my boy -- just now there be a pause and she regard he anxiously she hand be clasp tightly together in the effort to still they tremble she blue eye look implore john know very well that it lay within he power to make good he claim upon that gentle heart and enforce he will and she submission to it but the strongest nature be those which least incline to tyranny and he have already see the result of coercion upon that bright and joyous but timid nature he know that she love for he be of the fanciful romantic high-flown order and as such it appeal to every chivalrous instinct within he though he love for she be perhaps of a different kind he desire she happiness and she peace of mind as strongly as he desire she companionship and the sympathy which be to brighten he lonely life he be silent for a moment consider how he should act if love counsel haste common sense suggest patience i could not disappoint he now you see that john say the anxious gentle voice i be afraid i do see it mary he say we secret must remain we secret for the present god bless you john say lady mary softly you always understand i be old enough at least to know that happiness can not be attain by set duty aside he say as cheerfully as he could there be a pause in the music outside and a voice be hear speak john rise and straighten himself have you decide what be to be do -- what we have best do she say timidly i be go to prove that a lover can be devote and yet perfectly reasonable in defiance of all tradition to the contrary he say gaily i shall return to town as soon as i can decently get away -- probably to-morrow she utter a cry you be go to leave I i must give place to peter she come to he side and clung to he arm as though terrify by the success of she own appeal but you 'll come back i have to account for my stewardship when peter come of age in the autumn he say smile down upon she she be too quick of perception not to know that strength and courage too be need for the smile wherewith john strove to hide a disappointment too deep for word he answer the look she give he a look which implore forgiveness understanding even encouragement i be not yield a single inch of my claim upon you when the time come my darling only i think with you that the time have not come yet i think peter may reasonably expect to be consider first for the present and that you should be free to devote you whole attention to he especially as he have such praiseworthy intention we will postpone the whole question until the autumn when he come of age and when i shall consequently be able to tackle he frankly man to man and not as one have authority and abuse that same he laugh meantime we must be patient write often but not so often as to excite remark and i shall return in the autumn to stay ah say john that depend on you he have not mean to be satirical but the slight inflection of he tone cut lady mary to the heart she vivid imagination see she conduct in its worst light : vacillate feeble desert the man she love at the moment she have lead he to expect triumph dismiss she faithful servant without he reward then in a flash come the other side of the picture -- the mother of a grown-up son -- a wounded soldier dependent on she love -- seek she personal happiness as though there exist no past memory no present duty to hinder the fulfil of she own belated romance oh john say lady mary tell I what to do no no do not tell I -- or i shall do it -- and i must not my darling he say i only tell you to wait he rally himself to speak cheerfully and to bring the life and color back to she sad white face just at this moment i quite realize i should be a disturbing element and i be go to get myself out of the way as quickly as politeness permit and you be to devote yourself to peter and not to be tear with self-reproach if we act sensibly and do not precipitate matter nobody need have a grievance and peter and i will be the best of friend in the future i hope there be little use in have grown-up wit if we snatch we happiness at the expense of other people 's feeling as young folk so often do the twinkle in he bright eye and the kindly humor of he smile restore she shake self-confidence oh john no one else could ever understand -- as you understand if only peter -- peter be a boy say john dream as a boy dream resolve as a boy resolve and he dream and he resolution be as light as thistledown : the first breath of a new fancy or a fresh interest will blow they away i put my faith in the future in the near future time work wonder he stoop and kiss she hand one after the other with a possessive tenderness that tell she better than word that he have not resign he claim now i 'll go and offer my congratulation to the hero of the day say john i must not put off any longer and it be quite settle that we secret be to remain we secret -- for the present then he step out on to the terrace and lady mary look after he with a little sigh and smile she lift a hand-mirror from the silver table that stand at she elbow and shake she head over it it be all very well for he and it be all very well for peter she say but time -- time be _ my _ worst enemy chapter xiii sarah hewel run into the drawing-room before lady mary find courage to put she newly gain composure

be alone for a few moment peter must not find I cry again yes -- that be all very well say sarah to herself as the slight form hurry from the drawing-room into the dark oak hall beyond but _ why _ be she unhappy there be something else it be dr blundell who find the answer to sarah 's riddle he have see the sign of weep on lady mary 's face as she stumble over the threshold of the window into the very arm of john crewy and he feeling be divide between passionate sympathy with he divinity and anger with the return hero who have no doubt reduce he mother to this distressful state the doctor be blind by love and misery and ready to suspect the whole world of do injustice to this lady though he believe himself to be destitute of jealousy and capable of judge peter with perfect impartiality he fancy leap far ahead of fact and he suppose not only that lady mary must be engage to john crewys but that she must have confide she engagement to she son and that peter have already forbid the banns he wander miserably about the grounds within hearing of the rejoicing and have just make up he mind that he ought to go and join the speechmaker when he perceive john crewys himself stand next to peter apparently on the best possible term with the hero of the day the doctor hasten round to the hall intend to enter the drawing-room unobserved and find out for himself whether lady mary have recover or whether john crewy have heartlessly abandon she to she grief the brilliant vision miss sarah present as she stand draw up to she full height in the shaded drawing-room meet he anxious gaze as he enter why miss sarah not go back to london yet i think you only come down for whitsuntide mamma be not well so i be stay on for a few day i be suppose to be nurse she say sarah demurely she be a favorite with the doctor as she be very well aware and in consequence be always exceedingly gracious to he where be lady mary he ask she steal to he side and put she finger on she lip and lower she voice she go through the hall -- into the study and she be alone -- cry cry say the doctor and he make a step towards the open door but sarah 's strong white hand hold he fast play fair she say

she lay she plump hand gently on he shabby sleeve i would not have say it if i would think -- think what say the doctor agitate what i think now say sarah he walk up and down in a silence she be too wise to break when he look at she again sarah be lean against the piano she have take off the picture-hat and be swing it absently to and fro by the black ribbon which have but now be tie beneath she round white chin she present a charming picture -- and it be possible she know it -- as she stand in that restful pose with she long lash point downward towards she buckled shoe the doctor stop in front of she you be too quick for I sarah you always be even as a little girl he say you have surprise my -- my poor secret you can laugh at the old doctor now if you like i do not feel like laughing say sarah simply and you secret be safe with I i be honest you know that yes my dear i know that god bless you say the doctor i be sorry dr blundell say sarah softly the deep voice which come from the full white chest and which have once be so unmanageable be one of sarah 's surest weapon now when she sing she count she victim by the dozen when she lower it as she lower it now to speak only to one man every note go straight to he heart -- if he have a ear for music and a heart for love when sarah say in these dulcet tone therefore that she be sorry for she old friend the tear gather to the doctor 's kind tire eye for I he say gratefully oh you must not be sorry for I she -- she could hardly be further out of _ my _ reach you know if she be -- a angel in heaven instead of be what she be -- a angel on earth it be -- of _ she _ that i be think i know say sarah but she have be look so bright and hopeful ever since we hear peter be come home -- until to-day -- when he have actually come and that be what puzzle I to-day -- to-day say the doctor as though to himself yes it be to-day i see she touch happiness timidly and come face to face with disappointment you see she oh when one love he say bitterly one have intuition which serve as well as eye and ear you will know all about it one day little sarah shall i say sarah she turn she face away from the doctor you have not be here very much lately he say but you have be here long enough to guess she secret as you -- you have guess mine eh you need not pretend for my sake to misunderstand I i be not go to say sarah gently john crewy be the very man i would have choose -- i do choose he say the doctor look at she almost fiercely it be a odd consolation to he to believe he have first lead john crewy to interest himself in lady mary he recognize he rival 's superior qualification very fully and humbly you know all about it miss sarah do not tell I so quick as you be to find out what do not concern you i see that -- mr john crewy -- like _ she _ say sarah in a low voice but then so do everybody i be not sure -- i could not believe that _ she _ -- you have not watch as i have he groan you have not see the sparkle come back to she eye and the color to she cheek you have not watch she learning to laugh and sing and enjoy she innocent day as nature bid since she have dare to be herself it be love that teach she a that love say sarah she soft red lip part and she breath quicken with a sudden sensation of mingled interest sympathy and amusement ay love say the doctor half angrily he detect the deepen of sarah 's dimple and i be a old fool to talk to you like this you child think that love be reserve for boy and girl like you and -- and peter i do not know what peter have to do with it say sarah pouting i hear peter explain to he tenant just now say the doctor with a harsh laugh that he be go to settle down here for good and all -- with he mother that nothing be to be change from he father 's time something in he word would have make I understand the look on he mother 's face even if i have not read it right -- already she will sacrifice she love for john crewy to she love for she son and by the time peter find out -- as in the course of nature he will find out -- that he can do without he mother she chance of happiness will be go for ever sarah look a little queerly at the doctor then the sooner peter find out she say slowly that he can live without he mother the better do not that seem strange perhaps say the doctor heavily but life give we so few opportunity of a great happiness as we grow older little sarah the possibility that once seem so boundless lie in a circle which narrow round we day by day some day you 'll find that out too there be a sudden outburst of cheer sarah start forward dr blundell she say energetically you have tell I all i want to know she sha 'n' t be unhappy if _ i _ can help it you say the doctor shrug he shoulder rather rudely i do not see what _ you _ can do sarah redden with lofty indignation it would be very odd if you do she say spitefully you be only a man when all be say and do but if you 'll only promise not to interfere i 'll manage it beautifully all by myself what will you do say the doctor inattentively and he blindness to sarah 's charm and she power make she almost pity such obtuseness i will go and fetch lady mary for one thing and cheer she up not a word to she he cry start up remember i tell you in confidence -- though why i be such a fool -- be i likely to forget say sarah and you will see one day whether you be a fool to tell _ I _ she say to herself despairingly that the stupidity of mankind be almost past pray for as the doctor open the door for sarah lady mary herself walk into the room she have remove all trace of tear from she face and though she be still very pale she be quite compose and ready to smile at they both be you come to fetch I she say take sarah 's arm affectionately dr blundell i be afraid luncheon will be terribly late the servant have all go off they head in the confusion as be to be expect the noise and the welcome upset I so that i dare not go out on the terrace again ash have just be to tell I it be all over and that peter make a capital speech quite as good as mr john 's he say but that be hardly a compliment to we kc she laugh i be afraid ash be prejudice ash be do the honor with all he might say the doctor gruffly hand round cider by the hogshead hallo the speech must be really all over he say for above vociferous cheer the strain of the national anthem could just be discern peter come stride across the terrace and look in at the open window be you better again mother he call could you come out now they have do at last but they be call for you yes yes i be quite ready i will not be so silly again say lady mary but peter do not listen why -- he say and stop short surely you have not forget sarah say lady mary laughing -- you little playmate sarah but perhaps i ought to say miss hewel now how do you do sir peter say sarah in a very stately manner i be very glad to be here to welcome you home peter foolishly embarrassed take the hand she offer with such gracious composure and blush all over he thin tan face i -- i should hardly have know you he stammer really say sarah will not you say peter still look at she join we on the terrace the people be not call for _ I _ say sarah but it might amuse you say peter deferentially he put up he eyeglass -- but though sarah 's red lip quiver she do not laugh it be rather jolly really he say they have get banner and flag and procession and thing will not you come well -- i will say sarah she accept he help in descend the step with the air of a princess but they 'll be so disappointed to see I instead of you mother disappoint to see _ you _ say peter stupefied she step forth laughing and peter follow she closely john crewys stand aside to let they pass lady mary half amaze and half amuse realize suddenly that she son have forget he come back to fetch she she hesitate on the threshold more cheer and confused shout greet peter 's reappearance on the balcony he turn and wave to he mother and the canon come hurry over the grass the people be shout for lady mary they want lady mary he cry john crewys look at she with a smile and hold out he hand and she step over the sill and go away across the terrace garden with he the doctor turn he face from the crowd and go back alone into the empty room who _ do not _ want lady mary he say to himself forlornly chapter xiv peter stand on he own front door step on the shady side of the house in the fresh air of the early morning the unnecessary eyeglass twinkle on he breast as he look forth upon the goodliness and beauty of he inheritance the ever-encroaching green of summer have not yet overpower the white wealth of flowering spring for the season be a late one and the month of June still young the apple-tree be yet in blossom and the snowy orchard be scatter over the hillside between patch of golden gorse the lilac white and purple be in flower amid scarlet rhododendron and branch pink and yellow tree-azalea the weep barberry shower gold dust upon the road on the lower side of the drive the roll grass slope be thriftily leave for hay a flowering mass of daisy and buttercup and red clover and blue speedwell a long way off but still clearly visible in the valley below glisten the stone-tiled roof of the old square-towered church guard by its sentinel yew a great horse-chestnut stand like a giant bouquet of waxen bloom beside a granite monument which throw a long shadow over the green turf mound towards the west and mark the grave of sir timothy crewy peter saw that monument more plainly just now than all the rest of he surroundings although he be short-sighted and although he eye be further dim by sudden tear he memory of he father be not particularly tender one and he grief be only natural filial sentiment in its vaguest and lightest form but such as it be -- the sight of the empty study which be to be he own room in future the strange granite monument shine in the sun the rush of home association which the familiar landscape arouse -- augment it for the time be and make the young man glad of a moment 's solitude there be the drooping ash -- which have make such a cool refreshing tent in summer -- where he have learn he first lesson at he mother 's knee and where he have keep he rabbit-hutch for a season until he father have find it out and despatch it to the stable-yard he punishment and the trouble of he childhood have always be associate with he father and its pleasure and indulgence with he mother but neither have make any very strong impression on peter 's mind and it be of he father that he think with most sympathy and even most affection partly doubtless because sir timothy be dead and because peter 's memory be not vivid one any more than he imagination be vivid but also because he mind be preoccupy with a vague resentment against he mother he could not understand the change which be nevertheless so evident she new-born brightness and ease of manner and she strangely increase loveliness which have be yet more apparent on the previous evening when she be dress for dinner than on he first arrival it be absurd peter think in all the arrogance of disdainful youth that a woman of she age should have learn to care for she appearance thus or to wear become gown and arrange she hair like a fashion plate if it have be sarah he could have understand at the thought of sarah the color suddenly flush across he thin tan face and he move uneasily sarah too be change but not even peter could regret the change in sarah the loveliness of he mother refine and white and delicate as she be do not appeal to he but sarah in she radiant youth with she brilliant coloring -- fresh as a may morning buxom as a dairymaid scornful as a princess -- have strike sir peter dumb with admiration though he have hitherto despise young woman it almost enrage he to remember that this stately beauty have ever be a impudent little schoolgirl with a turned-up nose and a red pigtail in day go by miss sarah have actually fight and scratch the spoilt boy who try to tyrannize over he playmate as he tyrannize over he mother and he aunt on the other hand the recollection of those early day also become precious to peter for the first time sarah it be difficult to be sentimental on the subject but difficulty be easily surmount by a lover and though sarah 's childhood afford few facility for ecstatic reverie still -- there have be moment and especially towards the end of the holiday when he and sarah have walk on the bank of the river with arm round each other 's neck share each other 's toffee and confidence poor sarah have be first despatch to a board school as unmanageable at the age of seven and thereafter she life have be a changeful one since she father could not live without she and she mother would not keep she at home she have always present a lively contrast to she elder brother who be all that a parent 's heart could desire and too old to be much interested in they little rebellious sister she high spirit survive disgrace and punishment and periodical banishment though not destitute of womanly quality she be more remarkable for hoydenish one and she taste be peculiar and vary if there be a pony to break in a sick child to be nurse a groom to scold a pig to be kill -- there be sarah but if a frock to try on a visit to be pay a note to be write -- where be she peter recall these thing try to laugh at himself for he extraordinary infatuation of the previous day but he know very well in he heart that he could not really laugh and that he have lie awake half the night thinking of she sarah have spend the rest of the day at barracombe after peter 's return and have be escort home late in the evening could he ever forget those moment on the terrace when she have pace up and down beside he in the pleasant summer darkness she white neck and arm gleam through transparent black tulle sometimes listen to the sound of music and revelry in the village below and look at the rocket that be be let off on the river-bank and sometimes ask he of the war in that low voice which thrill peter as it have already thrill not a few interested hearer before he those moment have be all too few because john crewy also have monopolize a share of miss sarah 's attention peter do not dislike he guardian whose compose courtesy and absolute freedom from self-consciousness or any form of affectation make it difficult indeed not to like he he remark make peter smile in spite of himself though he could not keep the ball of conversation roll like miss sarah who be not at all afraid of the great counsel but match he pleasant wit with a most engaging impudence all she own lady mary have stand clasp she son 's arm full of thankfulness for he safe return but she too have be unable to help laugh at john who purposely exert himself to amuse she and to keep she from dwelling upon they parting on the morrow she thoughtful son insist that she must avoid exposure to the night air and poor lady mary have somewhat ruefully return to the society of the old lady within but john crewy do not as he might and as peter have suppose he would join the other old folk peter class he mother and aunt together quite calmly in he thought he listen to sarah 's light talk with john watch she like a man in a dream hardly able to speak himself and it be needless to say that he find she chatter far more interesting and amusing than anything john could say who could have dream that little sarah would grow up into this bewitching maiden there be a girl come home on board ship the young wife of a officer whom every one have rave about and call so beautiful peter almost laugh aloud as he contrast sarah with he recollection of this lady how easy it be to talk to sarah how much easier than to he mother whom nevertheless he love so dearly though always with that faint dash of disapproval which somehow embittered he love he could not shake off the impression of she first appearance come singing down the oak staircase in she white gown _ he mother _ dress almost like a girl and worst of all look almost like a girl so slight and white and delicate peter recollect that sir timothy have be very particular about he wife 's apparel he like it to be costly and dignified and she have worn stiff silk and poplin inappropriate to the country but consider eminently suit to she position by the brawnton dressmaker and she hair have be part on she forehead and smooth over she little ear sir timothy do not approve of curling-iron and frippery peter do not know that he mother have cry over she own appearance often before she become indifferent and if he have know he would have think it only typical of the weakness and frivolity which he have hear attribute to lady mary from he earliest childhood he aunt be not intentionally disloyal to they sister-in-law but they disapproval of she be too strong to be hide and they regard a little boy as blind and deaf to all that do not directly concern he lesson or he play thus peter have grow up love he mother but disapprove of she and the disapproval be sometimes more apparent than the love after breakfast the new squire take a early walk with he guardian and inspect a few of the change which have take place in the administration of he tiny kingdom though peter be young and inexperienced he could not be blind to the immense improvement make he have leave a house and stable shabby and tumble-down and out of repair rot woodwork worn-off paint and miss tile have be painfully evident broken fence and hingeless gate be the rule and not the exception in the grounds now all deficiency have be make good by a cunning hand that have allow no glaring newness to be visible a hand that have match old tile and patch old wall and plant creeper and restore a almost magical order and comfort to peter 's beautiful old house where sir timothy 's grumble tenant have walk to the nearest brook for water they now find pipe bring to they own cottage door the home-farm stable yard and cowshed be drain and pave fall outbuilding replace uneven road gravel and roll dead tree remove and young one plant shrubbery trim and view long obscure once more open out peter do not need the assurance of mr crawley to be aware that he inheritance would be hand back to he improve a thousand-fold he be astounded to find how easily john have arrange matter over which he father have grumble and hesitate for year even the dispute with the crown have be settle by mr crawley without difficulty now that sir timothy 's obstinacy no longer stand in the way of a reasonable compromise john crewy have faithfully carry out the instruction of the will and there be many thousand yet leave of the sum place at he disposal for the improvement of the estate a surplus which would presently be invest for peter 's benefit and add to that carefully tied-up capital over which sir timothy have give he heir no discretionary power peter spend a couple of hour walk about with john and take a intelligent interest in all that have be do from the roof and chimney-pot of the house to the new cider-mill and stable fitting but though he be civil and amiable he express no particular gratitude nor admiration on he return to the hall where he mother eagerly await he it console she to perceive that he be on excellent term with he guardian offer to accompany he in the dog-cart to brawnton whither john be bind to catch the noon express to town you will have he all to yourself after this say john crewys smile down upon lady mary during he brief farewell interview which take place in the oriel window of the banqueting-hall within sight though not within hearing of the two old sister i be sorry to take he off to brawnton but i could hardly refuse he company no no i be only glad you should take every opportunity of know he better she say and you will be happier without any divide feeling at stake he say give yourself up entirely to peter for the next three or four month without any remorse concern I for the present at least i shall be hard at work with little enough time to spare for sentiment there be a tender raillery in he tone which she understand when i come back we will face the situation accord to circumstance by-the-by i suppose it be not to be think of that miss sarah should prolong she whitsuntide holiday much further she ought to have return to town earlier but mr hewel be ill say lady mary she be a tiresome woman she move heaven and earth to get rid of poor sarah and now the child have have a _ succès _ she be always clamour for she to come back ah say john thoughtfully and you will moot to peter the scheme for take a house in town but i should advise you to be guide by he wish over that still it would be very delightful to meet during we time of wait and that would be the only way i will not come down here again until i can declare myself it be a -- false position under the circumstance i know i understand say lady mary but i be afraid peter will not want to stir from home he be so glad to be back poor boy one can hardly blame he and he share he father 's prejudice against london do he indeed say john rather dryly well make the most of you summer with he _ you _ will get only too much london -- in the near future perhaps lady mary say smile but in spite of herself john 's confidence communicate itself to she when peter and john have depart lady mary go and sit alone in the quiet of the fountain garden at the eastern end of the terrace the thick hedge and laurel which sheltered it have be duly thin and trim to allow the entrance of the morning sunshine rose and lily bloom brightly round the fountain now but it be still rather a lonely and desert spot and silent save for the sighing of the wind and the tinkle of the drop water in the stone basin a young copper beech free from its rankly increase enemy of branch laurel and encroach bramble now spread its glory of transparent ruddy leaf in the sunshine above trim hedge here and there diversify by the pale gold of a laburnum or the violet cluster of a rhododendron in full flower rare fern fringe the edge of the little fountain where diminutive reptile whisk in and out of watery home or sit motionless on the brink with fix glassy eye lady mary have come often to this quiet corner for rest and peace and solitude in day go by she come often still because she have a fancy that the change in she favorite garden be typical of the change in she life -- the letting-in of the sunshine where before there have be only deepest shade the pink and forget-me-not which be gaily blow where only moss and fungus have flourish the bloom of the rose where the undergrowth have cross and recross withered branch above bare black soil she bring she happiness here where she have bring she sorrow and she repining long ago a happiness subdue by many memory chasten by long anxiety obscure by many doubt but still happiness there be to be no more of that heart-breaking anxiety she boy have be spare to come home to she and john -- john who always understand have declare that for the present at least peter must come first the whole beautiful summer lay before she in which she be to be free to devote herself to she wounded hero she must set herself to charm away that shadow of discontent -- of disapproval -- that darkened peter 's gray eye when they rest upon she a shadow of which she have be only too conscious even before he go to south africa she make a thousand excuse for he after tell herself that he need none poor boy he have be bring up in such narrow way such a atmosphere of petty distrust and fault-finding and small aim even he bold venture into the world of man have not enable he to shake off altogether the influence of he early training though it have change he so much for the better it have not altogether cure peter of he old ungraciousness partly inherit and partly due to example but he have return full of love and tenderness and penitence though he softening have be but momentary and when she have bring he under the change influence which now dominate she own life she could not doubt that peter 's nature would expand he should see that home life need not necessarily be gloomy that all innocent pleasure and interest be to be encourage and not repress if he want to spend the summer at home -- and after he long absence what could be more natural -- she would exert herself to make that home as attractive as possible why should they not entertain john have say there be plenty of money peter should have other young people about he she remember a scene long ago when he have bring a boy of he own age in to lunch without permission she would have to let peter understand how welcome she should make he friend he must have many more friend now while she be yet _ châtelaine _ of barracombe it would be delightful to imbue he with some idea of the duty and pleasure of hospitality lady mary 's eye sparkle at the thought of provide entertainment for many young soldier wound or otherwise they should have the best of everything she be rich and peter be rich and there be no harm in make visitor welcome in that great house and fill the room that have be silent and empty so long with the noise and laughter of young people she would ask peter about the horse to-morrow john have purposely refrain from fill the stable which have be so carefully restore and fit there be very few horse only the cob for the dog-cart and a pair for the carriage so old that the coachman declare it be tempting providence to sit behind they they be calculate to have attain they twentieth year and be drive at a slow jog-trot for a couple of hour every day except sunday in the barouche jame coachman inform lady belstone and miss crewy that either steed be liable to drop down dead at any moment and that they could not expect the best of horse to last for ever but the old lady would neither shorten nor abandon they afternoon drive nor consent to the purchase of a new pair they continue to behave as though horse be immortal sir timothy 's old black mare be turn out to graze partly from sentiment and partly because she too be unfitted for any practical purpose and peter have outgrow he pony before he go away though he have ride it to hound many time unknown to he father lady mary think it would be a pleasure to see she boy well mount and the stable fill john have say that the loss of he arm would certainly not prevent peter from ride she find herself constantly refer to john even in she plan for peter 's amusement strong calm patient john -- who be prepare to wait and who would not as he say snatch happiness at the expense of other people 's feeling how wise he have be to agree that for the present she must devote herself only to peter she and peter would be all in all to each other as peter himself have suggest and as she have once dream she son would be to he mother though of course it be not to be expect that a boy could understand everything like john she must make great allowance she must be patient of he inherit prejudice above all she must make he happy afterwards perhaps when peter have learn to do without she -- as he would learn too surely in the course of nature -- she would be free to turn to john and put she hand in he and let he lead she whithersoever he would peter see he guardian off at brawnton dutifully stand at attention on the platform until the train have depart instead of start home as john suggest when he come out of the station he stand still for a moment contemplate the stout brown cob and the slim groom who be wait anxiously to know whether sir peter would take the rein or whether he be to have the honor of drive he master home i think i 'll walk back george say peter with a nonchalant air take the cob along quietly and let she ladyship know directly you get in that i be return by hewelscourt wood and the ferry very good sir peter say the youth zealously it would be only civil to look in on the hewel as sarah be go back to town so soon say peter to himself and it be rot drive all those mile on the sunny side of the river when it be barely three mile from here to hewelscourt and the ferry and in the shade all the way i shall be back almost as soon as the cart a little old lady dress in shabby black silk look up from the corner of the sofa next the window when peter enter the drawing-room at hewelscourt after the usual delay apology and bark of dog which attend the morning caller at the front door of the average country house peter who have expect to see mr hewel and sarah repent himself for a moment that he have come at all when he behold this stranger who regard he with a pair of dark eye that seem several time too large for she small wrinkled face and who merely nod she head in response to he awkward salutation ah say the old lady rather as though she be talk to herself so this be the return hero no doubt how do you do the rejoicing over you home-coming keep I awake half the night peter be rather offend at this free-and-easy method of address it seem to he that since the old lady evidently know who he be she might be a little more respectful in she manner the festivity be all over soon after eleven he say stiffly but perhaps you be accustom to early hour perhaps i be say the old lady she seem more amuse than abashed by peter 's dignity of demeanor at any rate i like my beauty sleep to be undisturbed more especially in the country where there be so many noise to wake one up from four o'clock in the morning onward i have always understand say peter who inherit he father 's respect for platitude that the country be much quieter than the town i suppose you live in a town i suppose i do say the old lady peter put up he eyeglass indignantly to quell this disrespectful old woman with a frigid look model upon the expression of he board-ship hero the door open suddenly he drop he eyeglass with a start but it be only mrs hewel who enter and not sarah after all she _ embonpoint _ and consequently she breathlessness have much increase since peter see she last oh peter she cry this be nice of you to come over and see we so soon we be wonder if you would dear dear how thankful you mother must be i know what i be with the boy -- and decorate and all -- though poor tom and willie get nothing but as the papers say it be not always those who deserve it most -- still i be glad _ you _ get something anyway it be little enough i be sure to make up for -- then she turn nervously to the old lady aunt elizabeth this be sir peter crewy who come home last night i have already make acquaintance with sir peter since you leave I to entertain he say the old lady nod affably lady tintern arrive unexpectedly by the afternoon train yesterday explain mr hewel in she flustered manner turn once more to peter she have only be here twice before it be such a surprise to sarah to find she here when she come back peter grow very red who could have suppose that this shabby old person whom he have endeavor to snub be the great lady tintern she _ do not _ find I say the old lady i be in bed long before sarah come back i presume this young gentleman escort she home i always send a servant across for sarah whenever she stay at all late at barracombe and always have say mr hewel in hurry self-defence you must remember we be old friend there never be any formality about she visit to barracombe my guardian and i walk down to the ferry and see she across the river of course say peter rather sulkily but she maid be with she cried mr hewel of course peter say again in tone that be none too civil after all who be lady tintern that she should call he to task and as if there could be any reason why she oldest playmate should not see sarah home if he choose at the very bottom of peter 's heart lurk a inborn conviction that he father 's son be a very much more important personage than any hewel or relative of hewel could possibly be that be very kind of you and you guardian say the old lady suddenly become gracious emily i will leave you to talk to you _ old friend _ i dare say i shall see he again at luncheon i can not stay to luncheon my mother be expect I say peter he would not express any thanks what business have the presume old woman to invite he to luncheon it be not she house after all oh you mother be expect you say lady tintern whose slightly derisive manner of repeat peter 's word embarrassed and annoy the young gentleman exceedingly i be glad you be such a dutiful son sir peter she gather together she letter and she black drapery and totter off to the door which peter who be sadly negligent of _ les petits soin _ forget to open for she nor do he observe the indignant look she favor he with in consequence sarah come into the drawing-room at last fresh as the morning dew in she summer muslin and flutter embroidered ribbon with a bunch of forget-me-not blue as she eye nestle beneath she round white chin she bright hair be curl round she pretty ear and about she fair throat but peter do not compare this _ coiffure _ to a fashion plate though indeed it exactly resemble one neither do he cast the severely critical glance upon sarah 's _ toilette _ that he have bestow upon the soft gray gown and the cluster of white moss-rosebud which poor lady mary have venture to wear that morning how have you manage to offend aunt elizabeth peter cry sarah with she usual frankness she be in the worst of humor sarah say she mother reprovingly well but she _ be _ say sarah she call he a cub and a bear and all sort of thing she look at peter and laugh and he laugh back the cloud of sullenness have lift from he brow as she appear mr hewel overwhelm he with unnecessary apology she could not grasp the fact that she polite conversation be as dull and unmeaning to the young man as sarah 's indiscreet nothing be interesting and delightful i be sure i do not mind say peter and he tone be quite alert and cheerful she tell I the country keep she awake if she do not like it why do she come she have come to fetch I away say sarah and she come unexpectedly because she want to see for herself whether mamma be really ill or whether she be only shamming sarah and she have decide she be only sham say sarah unluckily mamma happen to be down in the stable doctoring venus you remember venus she pet spaniel of course nothing else would have take I off my sofa where i ought to be lie at this moment as you know very well sarah cry mr hewel show a inclination to shed tear to be sure you ought say sarah but what be the use of tell aunt elizabeth that when she see you with she own eye race up and down the stable-yard with a piece of raw meat in you hand and venus gallop after you the vet say that if she take no exercise she would die say mr hewel tearfully and neither he nor jone could get she to move not even ash though he have know she all she life i know it be very bad for I but what could i do i wish i have be there say sarah giggling but however aunt elizabeth describe it all to I so graphically this morning that it be almost as good as though i have be she should not have come down like that without give we a notion say mr hewel resentfully if she have only warn we you could have be lie on a sofa with the blind down and i could have be hold you hand and shake a medicine-bottle say sarah that be how she expect to find we she say from you letter i be sure i scarcely refer to my weak health in my letter say mr hewel plaintively and it be natural i should like my only daughter to be with I now and then aunt elizabeth have never have a child herself and can not understand the feeling of a mother sarah and peter exchange a fleeting glance she shrug she shoulder slightly and peter look at he boot they understand each other perfectly freshly to the recollection of both rise the lamentation of a little red-haired girl banish from the eden of she beloved home and condemn to a cheap german school mr hewel in she palmiest day have never find it necessary to race up and down the stable-yard to amuse sarah and when she only daughter develop scarlatina she have remove herself and she spaniel from home for month to escape infection here be papa say sarah break the silence he be so vex to be out when you arrive yesterday he hear nothing of it till he come back colonel hewel walk in through the open window with he dog at he heel he be delighted to welcome he young neighbor home a short sturdy man with red whisker plentiful stiff hair and bright dark blue eye from she father sarah have inherit she color she short nose and she unfailing good spirit i would have come over to welcome you he say shake peter 's hand cordially only when i come home there be all the upset of lady tintern 's arrival and half a hundred thing to be do to make she sufficiently comfortable and then i would have come to fetch sarah after dinner only i could not be sure she might not have start and if i would go down by the road ten to one she would have come up by the path through the wood so i just sit down and smoke my pipe and wait for she to come back you 'll stay to lunch eh peter i must get back to my mother sir say peter he respect for sarah 's father who have once command a cavalry regiment have increase a thousand-fold since he last see colonel hewel but will not you -- i mean she would be very glad -- i wish you would come over and dine to-night all of you -- as you could not come yesterday evening thus peter deliver he first invitation blush with eagerness i be afraid we could not leave lady tintern -- or persuade she to come with we say the colonel shake he head then he brighten up but as soon as she and sally have toddle back to town i see no reason why we should not come eh emily he say turn to he wife peter look rather blank and a laugh tremble on sarah 's pretty lip you know i be not strong enough to dine out tom say he wife peevishly i can not drive so far and i be terrify of the ferry at night with those slippery bank well well there be plenty of time before we later on you may get better and i do not suppose you 'll be run away again in a hurry eh peter say the colonel i be tell you make a capital speech yesterday about stick to you home and living on you land as you father poor fellow do before you i wish sarah feel as you do peter say mr hewel but of course she have grow too grand for we who live contentedly in the country all the year round she home be nothing to she now it seem and the only thing she think of be rush back to london again as fast as she can sarah contrary to she wont receive this attack in silence but she bestow a fond squeeze on she father 's arm and cast a appealing glance at peter which cause the hero 's heart to leap in he bosom of course i mean to live at barracombe say peter polish he eyeglass with reckless energy but i say nothing to the people about live there all the year round on the contrary i think it more probable that i shall -- run up to town myself occasionally -- just for the season chapter xv on a perfect summer afternoon in mid-july lady mary sit in the terrace garden at barracombe before the open window of the silent house in the shade of the great ilex sometimes glance at the book she hold and sometimes watch the haymaker in the valley whose voice and laughter reach she faintly across the distance some boy be play cricket in a field below she note idly that the sound of the ball on the bat travel but slowly upward and reach she after the striker have begin to run the effect be curious but it be not new to she though she listen and count with idle interest the old sister have depart for they daily drive which she daily decline to share have no love for the high-road and much for the peace which they absence bring she it be a afternoon which make mere existence a delight amid such surroundings long shadow be fall across the bend of the river below the wooded hill which face the south-west whilst the cob-built whitewashed cottage and the brown square-towered church lay full in sunshine still the red cattle stand knee-deep in the shallows and a old boat be moor high and dry upon the sloping red bank the air be sweet with a thousand mingled scent of summer flower : carnation stock rose and jasmine the creamy cluster of perpetual felicity riot over the corner turret of the terrace where a crumble stair lead to the top of a small half-ruined observatory which tradition call the look-out tower flight of step lead downward from the garden where the bedded-out plant blaze in all they glory of order color to the walk on the lower level here be long herbaceous border back by the mighty sloping wall of old red sandstone which like a ancient fortification support the terrace above the blue larkspur flourish beside scarlet gladiolus feather-headed spirea and hardy fuchsia there be no straight line nor any order of plant the madonna lily stand in group lift up on thin ragged stem they pure and spotless cluster and overpower with they heavy scent the fainter fragrance of the mignonette tall green hollyhock tower higher yet hold the secret of they loveliness until these should wither when they too would burst into blossom and forestall the round-budded dahlia in the silence many usually unheeded sound make themselves very plainly hear the tap of the great magnolia-leaves upon the window of the south front the rustling of the ilex the ceaseless murmur of the river the near twittering or distant song of innumerable bird the steady hum of the saw-mill below the call of the poultry-woman at the home-farm and the shriek response of a feathered horde fly and fight for they food -- sound all so familiar as to pass unnoticed save in the absence of companionship as lady mary mused alone she could not but recall other summer afternoon when she have not feel less lonely because she husband 's voice might at any moment break the silence and summon she to he side day when peter have be absent at school instead of as now at play and when the old lady have also be absent take they regular and daily drive in the big barouche then she have prize and covet the solitude of a summer afternoon on the lawn and have steal away to read and dream undisturbed in the shadow of the ilex it be now when no vexatious restraint be exercise over she -- when there be no one to reprove she for dream or to criticize or forbid she choose book -- that solitude have become distasteful to she she be restless and dissatisfied and the misty sunlit landscape have lose its charm and she book its power of enchain she attention she have taste the joy of real companionship the charm of real sympathy of the fearless exchange of idea with one whose outlook upon life be as broad and charitable as sir timothy 's have be narrow and prejudiced she have scarcely dare to acknowledge to herself how dear john crewy have become to she even though she know that she rest thankfully upon the certainty of he love that she trust he in all thing that she be in utter sympathy with all he thought and word and way yet she have wish he to go that she might be free to devote herself to she boy -- to be very sure that she be not a light and careless mother ready to abandon she son at the first call of a stranger and john crewy have understand as another might not have understand he clear head and great heart have divine she feeling though perhaps he would never quite know how passionately grateful she be because he have divine they because he have in no way fall short of the man he have seem to be she have sacrifice john to peter and john who have show so much wisdom and delicacy in leave she alone with she son be avenge for only he absence could have make clear to she how he have grow into the heart she have guard so jealously for peter 's sake she know now that peter 's companionship make she more lonely than utter solitude the _ joie de vivre _ which have distinguish she early day and be inherent in she nature have be quench to all appearance many year since but the spark have never die and john have fan it into brightness once more he strong hand have sweep away the cobweb that have be spin across she life and the droop soul have revive in the sunshine of he love he comradeship he warm approval timidly she have learn to live to laugh to look about she and dare utter she own thought and opinion instead of falsely echo those she do not share lady mary have recover she individuality the serene consciousness of a power within herself to live up to the ideal she lover have conceive of she but now in he absence that confidence have be rudely shake she have come to perceive that she who charm other so easily could not charm she sullen son it be part of the penalty she pay for she quick-wittedness that she could realize herself as peter see she though she be unable to present herself before he in a more favourable light i must be myself -- or nobody she think despairingly but peter want she to be once more the meek plainly dress low-spirited silent be whom sir timothy have create and who be not in the least like the original laughing loving joyous mary setoun it do not occur to she in she sorrowful humility that possibly she quality stand on a higher level than peter 's power of appreciation yet it be certain that people can only admire intelligently what be good within they comprehension and they highest flight of imagination may sometimes scarcely touch mediocrity the noblest ideal the fairest dream the subtlest reasoning the finest ethic contain in the writings of the mighty dead mean nothing at all to sir timothy he widow know that she have never hear he utter one high or noble or selfless thought but with perhaps pardonable egotism she have take it for grant that peter must be different whatever he outward humor he be _ she _ son rather a part of herself in she loving fancy than a separate individual the moment of awakening have be long in come to lady mary the moment when a mother have to find out that she personality be not necessarily reproduce in she child that the be who be once the unconscious consoler of she grief and trouble may develop a nature perfectly antagonistic to she own she have keep she eye shut with all she might for a long time but necessity be force they open perhaps she association with john crewy make it easier to see peter as he be and not as she have wish he to be and yet she think miserably to herself he have certainly try hard to be affectionate and kind to she -- and probably it do not occur to he as it do to he mother how pathetic it be that he should have to try peter do not think much about it sometimes during he short stay at barracombe he have walk through a game of croquet with he mother -- it be good practice for he left hand -- or he listen disapprovingly to something she inadvertently -lrb- forget he be not john -rrb- read aloud for he sympathy or admiration or he take a short stroll with she or bestow he company upon she in some other dutiful fashion but these filial attention over if he yawn with relief -- why he never do so in she presence and would have be unable to understand that lady mary see he yawn in she mind 's eye as plainly as though he have indulge this bad habit under she very nose he bestow a portion of he time on he aunt in much the same spirit take less trouble to be affectionate because they be less exact as he would have put it to himself than she be the scheme of rent a house in london have duly be lay before he and reject most decisively by the young gentleman he father have never take a house in town and he could see no necessity for it he aunt be lose in admiration for they nephew 's firmness peter have inherit somewhat of he father 's dictatorial manner and they flattery do not tend to soften it when he aged relative mispronounce the magic word _ kopje _ or betray they belief that a _ donga _ be a inaccessible mountain -- he bring the big gun of he heavy satire to bear on the little target of they ignorance without remorse he mistake a loud voice and a habit of lay down the law for manly decision and the gift of leadership and imagine that in talk down he mother 's gentle protest he have convince she of he superior wisdom when he have make it sufficiently clear however that he do not wish lady mary to accompany he to town young sir peter make haste to depart thither himself on the very reasonable plea that he require a new outfit of clothes be it possible that he departure bring a dreadful relief to the mother who have pray day and night for eight-and-twenty month that she son might return to she she try and try on she knee in she own room to realize what she feeling would have be if peter have be kill in south africa she try to recall the first ecstasy of joy at he home-coming she remember as she might have remember a dream the hour of agony she have pass look out over these very blue hill and dumbly beseech god to spare she boy -- she only son -- out of all the mother ' son who be lay down they life for england a terrible thought assail she now and then like a ugly spectre that would not be lay -- that if peter have die of he wound -- if he have fall as so many of he comrade have fall in the war -- he would have be a hero for all time a glorious memory safely enshrine and enthrone above all these miserable petty doubt and disappointment she cast the think from she in horror and piteous grief and reiterate always she passionate gratitude for he preservation but nevertheless the living breathing peter be a daily and hourly disappointment to the mother who love he he way be not she way nor he thought she thought and often she feel that she could have find more to say to a complete stranger and that a stranger would have understand she better the old lady return from they drive generally take a little turn upon the terrace this constitute half they daily exercise since they morning walk consist of a stroll round the kitchen garden it prevent cramp after sit so long one would say to the other and it be only right to show the gardener that we take a interest the other would reply the gardener translate the interest they take into a habit of fault-finding which nearly drive he mad it du spile the vine weather vor i he would

power of vex she remain now that they could no longer appeal to sir timothy to join they in reprove he wife she be no more to be tease or exasperate into alternate submission and rebellion they cousin john the administrator of barracombe have choose from the first to place she opinion and wish above all they protest or advice they say to each other that john before he grow tired of she and go away have spoil poor dear mary completely but they hope be centre on peter who be a true crewy and who would soon be he own master and the master of barracombe when he would doubtless revert to he father 's old way they choose to blame he mother for he sudden departure to london and remark that the change in he home have so work upon the poor fellow that he could not bear to look at they until he have the power of put they right again a deeply resent innovation be the appearance of the tea-table on the lawn before the window in the shade of the ilex-grove which sheltered the western end of the terrace from the low ray of the sun during the previous summer on they return from a drive they have find they cousin john in he white flannel and lady mary in she black gown serenely enjoy this refreshment out-of-door and the poor old lady have hardly know how to express they surprise and annoyance in vain do they sister-in-law explain that she have desire a second tea to be serve in the hall in they usual corner by the log fireplace it have never be the custom in the family what would ash say what would he think how could so much extra trouble be give to the servant the servant have next to nothing to do lady mary have say and young john have actually laugh and explain that he have have a conversation with ash which have almost petrified that tyrant of the household either ash would behave himself properly and carry out order without grumble or he would be supersede _ ash _ supersede this john have say with quite unruffled good humor and with a smile on he face as though such a upheaval of domestic politics be the simplest thing in the world though for year the insolence and the idleness of ash have be favorite grievance with lady belstone and miss crewy they be speechlessly indignant with young john habit have partially inure though it could never reconcile they to the appearance of that little rustic table and white cloth in lady mary 's favorite corner of the terrace and though they would rather have go without they tea altogether than partake of it there they could behold she pour it out for herself with comparative equanimity i trust you be rest dear mary after you terrible long climb in the wood this morning it have be very restful sit here i hope you have a pleasant drive isabellum no it be too hot to be pleasant we pass the rectory and there be that idle doctor loll in the canon 's verandah -- keep the poor man from he haymaking have the second post come in any news of dear peter none at all you know he be not much of a correspondent and he last letter say he would be back in a few day for my part say lady belstone i think peter will come home the day he attain he majority and not a moment before he be hardly likely to stay in london through August and September say lady mary in rather displeased tone perhaps not in london but there be other place besides london say miss crewy significantly we meet mr hewel drive _ she _ poor thing do not expect to see sarah before christmas if then from what she tell we she should not have let lady tintern adopt sarah if she be to be for ever regret it it be she own do say lady mary that be just what i tell she say lady belstone triumphantly though how she can be regret such a daughter i can not conjecture sarah be a saucy creature say miss crewy the last time i see she she make one of she senseless joke at I she have no tact say lady belstone shake she head for when peter see you be annoyed and try to pass it off by tell she the crewy family have no sense of humor instead of say ` what nonsense ' she say ` what a pity ' she mother be full of a letter from lady tintern about some grand lord or other who want to marry sarah i do my best to make she understand how very unlikely it be that any man noble or otherwise would care to marry a girl with carroty hair i doubt if you succeed in convince she georgina though you speak pretty plain and i be very far from blame you for it but she be eat up with pride poor thing because sarah get notice by lady tintern 's friend who would naturally wish to gratify she by flattering she niece i be afraid the girl be set she cap at peter say miss crewy but i take care to let she mother know casually what we family would think of such a marriage for he peter be a boy say lady mary quickly and sarah for all practical purpose be ten year older than he she be only amusing herself lady tintern be much more ambitious for she than i be for peter how you talk mary say miss crewy indignantly she be hardly twenty year of age and the most design monkey that ever live and peter be a fine young man a boy indeed i hope if she succeed in catch he that you will remember i warn you i will remember if anything so fortunate should occur say lady mary with a faint smile i can not think of any girl in the world whom i would prefer to sarah as a daughter i for one should walk out of this house the day that girl enter it as mistress let peter say what he would to prevent I say lady belstone redden with indignation i wonder where you would go to say lady mary with some curiosity of course she add hastily there be the dower house i be sure it be very generous of you to suggest the dower house dear mary say miss crewy soften since we poor brother in he unaccountable will leave it entirely to you and make no mention of he elder sister though we do not complain it be in accordance with custom that the widow should have the dower house a widow 's rights should be respect but i think we name would be mention say lady belstone dejectedly of course he know say lady mary in a low voice that peter 's house would be always open to we all as my boy say himself dear boy he have say it to we too say the sister in a breath i do not say that in my opinion say lady mary it would not be wiser to leave a young married couple to themselves i have always think so but peter would not hear of you turn out of you old home you know that very well peter would not but nothing would induce _ I _ to live under the same roof as that red-haired minx say lady belstone firmly and besides as you say my dear mary you could not very well live by yourself at the dower house since mary have be so kind as to mention it there would be many advantage in we accompany she there in case sarah should succeed in she artful aim say miss crewy it would be near peter and yet not _ too _ near and we could keep a eye on _ she _ if she do not succeed somebody else will say lady belstone sensibly and at least we know she fault and can put peter on he guard against they a host of petty and wretched recollection pour into lady mary 's mind as she listen to these word poor timothy poor little hunt scold despairing bride poor married life -- of futile reproach and foolish quarrel how many small misery she owe to those ferret search eye and those subtly poisonous tongue but such misery lurk in the dull shadow of the past standing now in the bright sunshine of the present she forgive the sister with all she heart and think compassionately of they great age they increase infirmity they feeble hold on life not to they do she owe real sorrow after all for nothing that do not touch the heart can reach the fountain of grief peter 's hand -- the hand she love best in the world -- have set the water of sorrow flow not once but many time but she have become aware lately of a stronger power than peter 's guard the spring she look from one sister to the other despite the narrowness of brow and sharpness of eye and feature they be both venerable of aspect as they totter up and down the terrace where they have play in they childhood and saunter through youth and middle age to these latter day when they lean upon silver-headed stick and wear dignified silk attire and respectable poke-bonnet do not you think it would be better say lady mary slowly if you leave peter to find out he wife 's fault for himself whether she be sarah -- or another chapter xvi torrent of fall rain obscure the valley of the youle the gray cloud float below the ridge of the hill and wreathe the tree-top against the dim purple of the distance the October rose hold up melancholy rain-washed head and sudden gust of wind send little army of dead brown leaf race over the stone pavement of the terrace lady mary lean she forehead against the window and gaze out upon the autumn landscape and john crewys watch she with feeling not altogether devoid of self-reproach perhaps he have carry he prudent consideration too far he reverence for he beautiful lady -- who reign in john 's inmost thought as both saint and queen -- have cause he to determine that she must come to he when she do come without a shadow of self-reproach to sully the joy of she surrender the fulness of she bliss in the perfect sympathy and devotion which await she but john crewy -- though passionately desire she companionship and impatient of all barrier real or imaginary which divide she from he -- yet live a life very full of work and interest and pleasure on he own account he be only conscious of he loneliness at time and when he be as busy as he have be during the early half of this summer he be hardly conscious of it at all he have not fully realize the effect that this time of wait and uncertainty might have upon she in the solitude to which he have leave she and which he have at first suppose would be altogether occupy by peter she letter -- infrequent as he in he self-denial have suggest -- be characterize by a delicate reserve and a tacit refusal to take anything for grant in they relation to each other which half charm and half tantalize john but scarcely enlighten he regard the suspense and sadness which at this time she be call upon to bear when he come to barracombe he know that she have suffer greatly during these month of he absence and reproach himself angrily for blindness and selfishness he have spend the first week of he long vacation in switzerland in order to bring the date of he visit to the youle valley as near as possible to the date of peter 's come of age but also he have be very much overworked and feel a absolute want of rest and change before enter upon the struggle which he suppose might await he and for which he would probably need all the good humor and good sense he possess so far as he be personally concern there be no doubt that he proceedings have be dictate by wisdom and judgment the fatigue and irritability consequent upon too much mental labor and too little fresh air and exercise have vanish john be in good health and good spirit clear of brain and eye and vigorous of person when he arrive at barracombe in the mild wet misty weather which herald the approach of a typical devonshire autumn but when he look at lady mary he know that he would have be better able to dispense with that holiday interval than she be to have endure it she have always be consider marvellously young-looking for she age the quiet country life she have lead have bestow that advantage upon she and she beauty fair as she be have always be less dependent on color than upon the exquisite delicacy of she feature and general contour but now a heaviness beneath the blue eye -- a little fading of she brightness -- a little droop of the beautifully shaped mouth -- almost betray she seven and thirty year and the soft abundant brown hair be thread quite perceptibly with silver she sweet face smile upon he but the smile be no longer he think joyous -- but pathetic as of one who reproach herself wonderingly for light-heartedness john look at she in silence but the word he utter in he heart be i will never leave you any more perhaps he face say everything that he do not say for lady mary have turn from he with a little sob and lean she forehead on she hand look out at the rain which sweep the valley she feel as she have always feel in john 's presence that here be she champion and she protector and she slave in one return to restore she fail courage and she lose self-confidence so you see something of peter in london she say tremulously break the silence which have fall between they after they first greet please tell I you know i have see almost nothing of he since he come home so i gather say john yes i see something -- not very much -- of master peter in london you see i be not much of a society man and he laugh be peter a society man say he mother laughing also but rather sadly he go out a good deal and be to be meet with in most place john answer i read he name in list of dance give by people i do not know he have ever hear of but i do not like to ask he how he manage to get invite he rather dislike be question say lady mary describe peter 's prejudice as mildly as possible i fancy miss sarah could tell you say john with twinkling eye i do not know -- just a girl -- could get a stranger a boy like peter invite everywhere say lady mary innocently john laugh peter be a very eligible boy he say and sarah be not ` just a girl ' but a very clever young woman indeed and lady tintern be a ball-giver but if he have be the most ordinary of youth a bachelor 's foothold on the dance-lists be the easiest thing in the world to obtain it mean nothing in itself i think it mean a good deal to peter say he mother with a sigh if only i could think sarah be in earnest i do not see why not say john then he come and take lady mary 's hand and lead she to a seat next the fire come and sit down comfortably he say and let we talk everything over it look very miserable out-of-door and nothing could be more delightful than this room and nobody to disturb we i want the real history of the last few month do you know you letter tell I almost nothing the room be certainly delightful and not the less so for the chill rain without which beat against the window and enhance the bright aspect of the scene within a little fire burn cheerfully in the polished grate and cast its glow upon the burnish fender and the silver ornament and trifle on a rosewood table beyond the furniture be bright with old-fashioned glossy chintz the rose-tinted wall be hang with fine water-colour drawing the window with rose-silk curtain the hardy outdoor flower be banish to the oaken hall lady mary 's sense of the fitness of thing permit the silver cup and venetian glass of this dainty apartment to be fill only with waxen hothouse bloom and maidenhair fern she could not but be conscious of the restfulness of she surroundings and of john 's calm protect presence as he place she tenderly in the corner of the fireside couch and take he place beside she i do not think the last month have have any history at all she say dreamily i have miss you john but that -- you know already i -- i have be very lonely -- since -- since peter come home i think it be sarah who persuade he to go away again so soon i believe she laugh at he clothes i suppose they _ be _ a little out of date and he must surely have outgrow they besides say john smile i suppose so anyway i think it must have be that which put it into he head to go to london and buy more it be a little awkward for the poor boy because he have just be scold _ I _ for wish to go to london but he say he would only be a few day and he stay to the end of the season yes of course the aunt put it down to sarah i dare say it _ be _ she do i do not know why she should wish to rob I of my boy just for -- amusement say lady mary rather resentfully but i have not understand sarah lately she have seem so hard and flippant you be laugh john i dare say i be jealous and inconsistent you be quite right one moment i want to think sarah in earnest -- and willing to marry my boy and the next i remember that i begin to hate he wife the very day he be bear it appear to be the nature of mother say john indulgently but you will allow _ I _ to hope for peter 's happiness and quite incidentally of course for we own she smile seriously john i wish you would tell I how he get on in london he dine with I once or twice as you know say john and be very friendly i think he be relieve that i make no suggestion of tutor or university and that i take he eyeglass for grant in short that i treat he as i should treat any other young man of my acquaintance whereas he have greatly fear i might presume upon my guardianship to give he good advice but i do not because he be too young to want advice just now and prefer like most of we to buy he own experience i hope he be really nice to you you will not hide anything you 'll tell I exactly i be hide nothing the lad be a good lad at bottom and a manly one into the bargain say john he defect be of the kind which get up so to speak and hit you in the eye and be consequently not of a kind to escape observation what be obviously wrong be easiest cure he have yet to learn that ` manners maketh man ' but he be learn it as fast as possible the mistake of youth be rather pathetic than annoying sometimes say lady mary he fall very naturally into most of the conventional error which beset the inexperienced londoner say john smile slightly at the recollection he talk in a familiar manner of person whose name be unknown to he the day before yesterday and tell well-known anecdote about well-known people whom he have not have time to meet as though they have only just happen the kind of story outsider tell to new-comer and he profess to be bore at every party he attend i will not say that the _ habitué _ be always too well breed or too grateful to he entertainer to do anything of the kind but he be certainly too wise or too cautious perhaps he be bore say lady mary wistfully know nobody poor boy the first time i meet he on neutral ground be at a dance say john he look very tall and nervous and lonely and of course he be not dancing but nevertheless he be the hero of the evening or so miss sarah give I to understand but you can imagine it for yourself the war just over and a young fellow who have lose so much in it the gallant nephew of the gallant ferry besides he own romantic name and he eligibility i take he off to the national gallery to make acquaintance with the portrait of we cavalier ancestor there and i declare there be a likeness miss sarah have visit it long ago it appear for my part i be glad to think that these fashionable young woman can still be so enthusiastic about a wounded soldier sarah say they be all wild to dance with he and ready to shed tear for he lose arm and be he much with sarah john laugh and shrug he shoulder miss sarah be a star with many satellite she raise my hope however by appear to have a few smile to spare for peter and she must have get he the invitation to tintern castle say lady mary that be why he go up to scotland i see then she get he another invitation i suppose for he go to the next house she stay at and to a third place for some yachting what do lady tintern say that be just it sarah be in lady tintern 's black book just now she be furious with she mr hewel tell I because she have refuse lord avonwick hum say john he have forty thousand a year i do not think money would tempt sarah to marry a man she do not love say lady mary reproachfully there be mr van graaf the african millionaire she would not look at he and he offer to settle untold sum upon she do he what a brute why never mind you have not see he i be glad he find sarah be not for sale but do not all this look as if it be peter after all if only i could think she be in earnest lady mary say again but he be such a boy she have three time he cleverness in some way and three time he experience though she be younger than he i suppose woman mature much earlier than man it gall my pride when she order he about and laugh at he but he -- he do not understand perhaps say john slowly he understand better than you think each generation have a freemasonry of its own i must confess i have hear scrap of chatter and chaff in ballroom and theater which have fill I with amazement wonder how it could be possible that such poor stuff should pass muster as conversation or coquetry or gallantry with the youth and maiden of to-day but when i have observe further instead of a offend fair or a disillusioned swain behold two young head close together two young face sparkling with smile and satisfaction and the older person who would fatuously join in with a sensible remark spoil all the enjoyment the fact be the secret of real companionship be not quality but equality there be a punning platitude for you it may be a platitude but i be begin to discover that what be call platitude by the young be bite truth to the old say lady mary i have feel it a thousand time word come so easily to my lip when i be speak to you i be so certain you will understand and respond but with peter i sometimes feel as though i be dumb or stupid perhaps you have be too -- too kind you have understand too quickly i have be too ready to believe that you have find I -- everything i want to find you interrupted john tenderly and that be something quite out of the common she smile and shake she head i be ready to believe all the nice thing you can say as fast as you can say they when i be with _ you _ she say with a raillery rather mournful than gay but when i be with peter i seem to realize dreadfully that i be only a middle-aged woman of average capacity and with very little knowledge of the world he do he best to teach I that be funny be not it it be very like -- a very young man say john gently you must not think i be mock at my boy -- like sarah she say vehemently perhaps i be wrong to tell you perhaps only a mother would really understand but it make I a little sad and bewildered my boy -- my little baby who lay in my arm and learn everything from I and now he look down and lecture I from such a immense height of superiority never dream that i be laugh in my heart because it be only little peter after all and he do not lecture sarah oh no he do not lecture sarah she be too young to be lecture with impunity and too wise besides i think since he go away and see sarah flattered and spoilt and queen it among the great people who do not know he even by sight that he have realize that they relative position have change a good deal you see little sarah hewel as she use to be would have be make quite a great match in marry peter but lady tintern 's adopt daughter and heiress -- old tintern leave a immense fortune to he wife do not he -- be another matter altogether and how could she settle down to this humdrum life after all the excitement and gaiety she be be accustom to woman do such thing every day besides -- yes be peter still so much enamoured of a humdrum life say john dryly i have have no opportunity of find out but i be sure he will want to settle down quietly when all this be over -- you mean when he be no longer in love with sarah he be barely one-and-twenty it can not last say lady mary i do not know if she be so much cleverer than he i be inclined to think it may say john oh of course if he marry she -- it would last say lady mary and then say john smile perhaps _ then _ say lady mary and she lay she hand softly in the strong hand outstretch to receive it chapter xvii there be a tap at the door of lady mary 's bedroom and peter 's voice sound without mother could i speak to you for a moment come in say lady mary 's soft voice and peter enter and close the door and cross to the oriel window where she be sit at she writing-table before a pile of note and account book long ago in peter 's childhood she have learn to make this bedroom she refuge where she could read or write or dream in silence away from the two old lady who seem to pervade all the living-room at barracombe peter have be accustom all he life to seek he mother here she have choose the room at she marriage and have have a old-fashioned paper of bunch rosebud put up there it be very long and low and look eastward into the fountain garden and over the tree-top far away to the open country the sister have think one of the handsome modern room of the south front would be more suitable for the bride but lady mary have she way she prefer the older part of the house and like the step down into she room the uneven floor the low ceiling the quaint window-seat and the powder closet where she hang she dress the great oriel window form almost a sitting-room apart here be she writing-table whereon stand now a green jar of scented arum and trail white fuchsia a bunch of sweet pea in a corner of the window-seat perfumed the whole room already fragrant with potpourri and lavender a low bookcase be fill with she favorite volume one shelf with the story-book of she childhood from which she have long ago read aloud to peter on rainy day when he have exhaust all other kind of amusement for he have never touch a book if he could help it therein resemble he father in the corner next the window stand the cot where peter have sleep often as a little boy and which have be playfully designate the hospital because he mother have always carry he thither when he be ill then she have take he jealously from the care of he attendant and have nurse and guard he herself day and night until even convalescence be a thing of the past she have never suffer that little cot to be move the white coverlet have be make and embroider by she own hand a gaudy oleograph of a soldier on horseback -- which little peter have be fond of and which have be hang up to amuse he during one of those childish illness -- remain in its place how often have she look at it through she tear when peter be far away beside the cot stand a table with a shabby book of devotions mark by a ribbon from which the color have long since fade the book have belong to lady mary 's father young robbie setoun who have become lord ferry but one short month before he meet with a soldier 's death he daughter say she prayer at this little table and have carry thither she agony and petition for she boy in he peril during the many many month of the south african war the morning be brilliant and sunny and the upper casement stand open to let in the fresh autumn air and the song of the robin balancing on a sway twig of the ivy climb the old wall white cloud be blow brightly across a clear blue sky lady mary stretch out she hand and pull a cord which draw a rosy curtain half across the window and shaded the corner where she be sit she look anxiously and tenderly into peter 's face she quick instinct gather that something have shake he from he ordinary mood of criticism or indifference be you come to have a little talk with I my darling she say she be afraid to offer the caress she long to bestow she move from she stiff elbow-chair to the soft cushion in she favorite corner of the window-seat and hold out a timid hand peter clasp it in he own throw himself on a stool at she foot and rest he forehead against she knee i have something to tell you mother and i be afraid that when i have tell you you will be disappoint in I that you will think I inconsistent she heart beat faster which of we be consistent in this world my darling we all change with circumstance we be often oblige to change even against we will tell I peter i shall understand there be not really anything to tell say peter nervously contradict himself because nothing be exactly settle yet but i think something might be -- before very long if you would help I to smooth away some of the principal difficulty yes yes say lady mary venture to stroke the closely crop black head rest against she lap you know -- sarah -- have be teach I the new kind of croquet at hewelscourt since we come back from scotland he say i do not get on so badly consider my poor boy oh i be always rather incline to be left-handed it come in usefully now say peter who generally hurry over any reference to he misfortune well this morning whilst we be play i ask sarah for the third time to -- to marry I the third 's the lucky time be not it he say with a tremulous laugh and -- and -- she say yes cry lady mary clasp she hand she do not go so far as that say peter rather reproachfully he voice shake slightly but she do not say no it be the first time she have not say no what do she say say lady mary she try to keep she feeling of indignation and offence against sarah out of she voice after all who be sarah that she should presume to refuse peter or for the matter of that to accept he either course seem equally unpardonable at time to motherly jealousy and lady mary be half vexed and half amuse to find herself not exempt from this weakness impudent little red-headed thing she say to herself though she love sarah dearly and admire she red hair with all she heart she tell I a few of the reason why she -- she do not want to marry I say peter lady mary 's dismay be rather too apparent surely that do not sound very hopeful peter move impatiently oh mother it be always so difficult to make you understand be it indeed she say with a faint pained smile i do my best my darling never mind i suppose woman be always rather slow of comprehension say the young lord of creation -- that be except sarah _ she _ always understand god bless she god bless she indeed say lady mary gently and the tear start to she blue eye if she be go to marry my boy peter repent he crossness forgive I mother i know you mean to be kind he say you will help I will not you with all my heart she say anxiously only tell I how you see i can not help feeling say peter bashfully that she would not have tell I why she _ could not _ marry I if she have not think she might bring herself to do it in the end if i get over the difficulty she mention i have be -- hopeful ever since she refuse that ass of a avonwick in spite of lady tintern it want some courage to defy lady tintern i can tell you though she be such a little object to look at by george i would almost rather walk up to a loaded gun than face that woman 's tongue of course even if _ my _ share of the difficulty be remove there would still be lady tintern against we but if sarah can defy lady tintern in one thing she might in another she be afraid of nobody sarah certainly do not lack courage say lady mary smile i never see anybody like she say peter whose love possess he mind body and soul why i have hear she keep a whole roomful of people laugh and every one of they as dull as ditch-water till she come in and to see she hold she own against man at game -- she be more strength in one of she pretty white wrist say peter look with a air of disparagement at he mother 's slender delicate hand than you have in you whole body i do believe she be splendidly strong say lady mary the very personification of youth and health she sigh softly and beauty say peter excitedly do not leave that out and a good sort through and through as even _ you _ must allow mother he speak as though he suspect she of begrudge he praise of sarah and she make haste to reply : indeed she be a good sort dear little sarah she be very fond of you peter say in a choke voice it seem to he in he infatuation so touch that sarah should be fond of any one she be dreadfully afraid of hurt you feeling but yet as she say she be bind to be frank with I oh peter do tell I what you mean you be keep I on thorn say lady mary she grow red and white by turn be john 's happiness in sight already as well as peter 's it be -- it be most awfully hard to tell you say peter he rise and lean he elbow against the stone mullion nearest she look down anxiously upon she as he speak after all i say to you when we first come home it be awfully hard but if you would only understand you could make it all easy enough i will -- i do understand but peter could not make up he mind even now to be explicit you see he say sarah be -- not like other girl of course not say he mother she control she impatience remind herself that peter be very young and that he have never be in love before she be a kind of -- of queen say peter dreamily i only wish you could have see what it be in london i can imagine it say lady mary no you could not i have not a idea what she would be there until i go to london and see for myself say peter who measure everybody 's imagination by he own you see he explain my position here which seem so important to you and the other people round here and _ use _ to seem so important to I -- be -- just nothing at all compare to what have be cast at she foot as it be over and over again for she to pick up if she choose and this house say peter glance round and shake he head -- this house which seem so beautiful to you now it be all do up if you would only _ see _ the house _ she be _ accustom to stay at tintern castle for instance -- i be bear in a greater house than tintern castle peter say lady mary gently oh of course i be say nothing against ferry say peter impatiently but you only live there as a child a child do not notice some child do not say lady mary with that faint wonder smile which hide she pain from peter and would have reveal it so clearly to john it be not that sarah _ mind _ this old house say peter she be say what a pretty room she could make of the drawing-room only the other day lady mary feel a odd pang at she heart she think of the trouble john have take to choose the best of the water-colour for the rose-tinted room -- the room he have declare so bright and so charming -- of the pretty curtain and chintz and the valuable old china she have collect from every part of the house for the cabinet you see she be get that sort of thing at she finger ' end lady tintern be such a connoisseur say the unconscious peter but she be so afraid of hurt you feeling -- why should she be say lady mary coldly in spite of herself if she do not like the drawing-room she can easily alter it that be what i say say peter with a touch of he father 's pomposity surely a bride have a right to look forward to arrange she home as she choose and sarah be mad about old french furniture -- loui seize i think it be -- but i know nothing about such thing i think a man should leave the choice of furniture and all that to he wife -- especially when she taste happen to be as good as sarah 's i -- i think so too peter say lady mary she thought wander momentarily into the past but he eager tone recall she attention then you will not mind so far say peter anxiously i -- why should i mind say lady mary start i believe -- i have read -- that old french furniture be all the rage now then she bethought herself and utter a faint laugh but i be afraid you aunt might make it a little uncomfortable for she if she -- try to alter anything i -- go my own way now and do not mind -- but a young bride -- do not always like to be find fault with she might find that relations-in-law be sometimes -- a little try lady mary feel as she speak these word that she be somehow open a way for herself as well as for peter she wonder with a beating heart whether the moment have come in which she ought to tell he -- that be just it say peter 's voice breaking in on she thought that be just what sarah mean and what i be try to lead up to only i be no diplomatist but that be one of the greatest objection she have to marry I quite apart from disappointing she aunt i can not blame lady tintern say peter with a new and strange humility for not think I good enough for sarah and _ that be _ not a difficulty _ i _ can ever hope to remove sarah be the one to decide that point but about relations-in-law -- it be what i have be try to tell you all this time he clear he throat which have grow dry and husky she say that when she marry she -- she intend to have she house to herself there be a pause i see say lady mary she be silent not as peter think with mortification but because she could not make up she mind what word to choose in which to tell he that it be freedom and happiness he be thus offer she with both hand and not as he think loneliness and disappointment twice she essay to speak and fail through sheer embarrassment the second time peter lift she hand to he lip she feel through all she consciousness the shy remorse which prompt that rare caress the -- the dower house falter peter be only a few yard away a sudden desire to laugh aloud seize lady mary he former word return upon she memory it be -- it be rather damp be not it she say in a shake voice he look into she face and do not understand the brightness of the smile that be shine through she tear but it be very picturesque say peter and -- and roomy you and my aunt would be quite snug there and it could be very prettily decorate sarah say perhaps sarah would advise we on the subject say lady mary unable to resist this thrust i be sure she would be delight say peter simply lady mary fall back on she cushion and laugh helplessly almost hysterically i do not see why you should laugh say peter in a rather sore tone i do not know how it be but i never _ can _ understand you mother i see you can not never mind peter say lady mary she sit up and lift she pretty hand to smooth the soft wave of she brown hair so i be to settle down happily in my dower house and take you aunt to live with I why you see say peter we could not very well let the poor old thing wander away alone into the world could we i think say lady mary slowly that they can take care of themselves and it be just possible that they may have foresee -- you change of intention woman can never take care of themselves say peter and how can they have foresee i have no idea myself of _ this _ happen but they would be perfectly happy in the dower house it be close by and i could see they very often it would not be like leave barracombe yes i think they could be happy there say lady mary she feel that the moment have come at last she heart beat thickly and she color come and go but if _ they _ be happily settle at the dower house she say slowly for she agitation be make she breathless and she do not want peter to notice it -- i would willingly give it up to they altogether it could not matter whether _ i _ be there or not though they be old they be perfectly able to look after themselves -- and other people and if they be not they would not like _ I _ to take care of they they have they own servant and mr ash and they have never like I peter though we have live together so many year that be nonsense say peter very calmly and if _ they _ do not want you there mother _ i _ do of course you must live at the dower house my father leave it to you and i shall want you more than ever now i do not see how say lady mary why _ we _ -- sarah and i say peter linger fondly over the word which link that beloved name with he own if we ever -- if _ it _ ever come off -- we shall naturally be away from home a good deal i could not ask sarah to tie herself down to this dull old place could i i suppose not say lady mary she be accustom to go about the world a good deal say peter no doubt even _ i _ say peter turn a flush face towards he mother -- i be too young as sarah say -- and i feel it myself since i have see something of the life she live -- to become a complete fixture like my father be it be -- it be as sarah say -- it be narrow i can see the effect of it upon you all say peter calmly when i come back here he could not fathom the wistfulness which cloud the blue eye she lift to he face it be very narrow she say humbly one may devote one 's self to one 's duty as a land proprietor say peter with another recurrence of pomposity and yet see something of one 's fellow-men he replace the eyeglass and walk up and down the room for a few moment as though he be pacing a quarter-deck he look very tall and very very slight and thin older than he year tan and dry by the african sun which have enhance he natural darkness though he speak as a boy he look like a man he mother 's heart yearn over he peter have take he lack of perception with he into the heart of south africa and bring it back intact because he body have travel many hundred of mile over land and sea he believe that he mind have open in proportion to the distance cover he know that man and woman of action pick up knowledge of the world without pause on they busy way but he do not know that it be to the silent the sorrowful and the solitary -- to those who have time to listen -- that god reveal the secret of life she say to herself that everything about he be dear to she he gray eye that never see below the surface of thing he thin brown face he youthful affectation the strange new growth which shaded he long upper lip and soften the plainness of the crewy physiognomy which peter would not have barter for the handsomest set of greek feature ever imagine by a sculptor even for he fault lady mary have a tender toleration for peter would not have be peter without they it would not be fair on sarah know all london -- worth know -- as she do say peter with pardonable exaggeration to rob she of the season altogether we shall go up regularly every year if -- if she marry I of that i be determine and so -- incidentally -- be she nothing could be nicer say lady mary heartily enough to satisfy even peter he speak with more warmth and naturalness she like to go abroad mother too now and then he say that would be delightful say lady mary eagerly she blue eye sparkle she interest and enthusiasm be easily rouse after all and surely these new idea would make it much easier to tell peter oh peter she say clasp she hand pari -- rome -- switzerland wherever sarah fancy say peter magnanimously i can not say i care much all i be thinking of be -- be with she it do not matter _ where _ so long as she be pleased what do anything matter he say and he dark face soften as she have never see it soften yet so long as one be with the companion one love best in the world it would be -- paradise say lady mary in a low voice and she think to herself resolutely i will tell he now peter cease he walk and come close to she and take she hand the emotion have not altogether die out of he voice and face but you be not to think mother that i shall ever again be the selfish boy i use to be -- the boy who do not value you love and devotion no dear no she answer with wet eye i will never think so we can love each other just the same perhaps even batter even though -- oh peter -- but peter be in no mind to brook interruption he be burn to pour out he plan for she future and he own wherever we may go and whatever we may be do he say emotionally it will be a joy and a comfort to I to know that my dear old mother be always _ here _ take care of the place and look after the people and wait always to welcome I with she old sweet smile on she dear old face peter be not often move to such enthusiasm and he be almost overcome by he own eloquence in describe this beautiful picture lady mary be likewise overcome she sink back once more in she cushion corner look at he with a blank dismay that could not escape even he dull observation how impossible it be to tell peter after all how impossible he always make it i know you must feel it just at first he say anxiously but you -- you can not expect to keep I all to yourself for ever she shake she head and try to smile he grow a little impatient after all he say you must be reasonable mother every one have to live he own life then lady mary find word a sudden rush of indignation -- the pent-up feeling of year -- bring the scarlet blood to she cheek and the fire to she gentle blue eye every one -- but _ I _ she say tremble violently you say peter astonished she clasp she hand against she bosom to still the panting and throb that it seem to she must be evident outwardly so strong be the emotion that shake she fragile form every one -- but I she say do it never -- strike you -- peter -- that i too would like to live before i die whilst you be live you own life why should not i be live mine why should not _ i _ go to london and to paris and to rome and to switzerland or wherever i choose now that you -- _ you _ -- have set I free mother say peter aghast be you go mad perhaps i be a little mad say poor lady mary people go mad sometimes who have be too long -- in prison -- they say then she see he real alarm and laugh till she cry i be not really mad she say do not be frightened peter i -- i be only joke it be enough to frighten anybody when you go on like that say peter relieved but angry talking of prison and rush about all over the world -- i see no joke in that why should i be the only one who must not rush all over the world say lady mary you must know perfectly well it would be preposterous say peter sullenly to break up all you habit and leave barracombe and -- and all of we -- and start a fresh life -- at you age and if this be how you mock at I and all my plan i be sorry i ever take you into my confidence at all i might have know i should repent it he say and a sob of angry resentment break he voice indeed i be not mock at you peter she say sorely repentant and ashamed of she outburst forgive I darling i see it be -- not the moment you do not understand you be think only of sarah as be natural just now it be not the moment for I to be talk of myself you never use to be selfish say peter thawing somewhat as she throw she arm about he and rest she head against he shoulder she laugh rather sadly but perhaps i be grow selfish -- in my old age say peter 's mother later lady mary seek john crewy in the smoking-room he spring up smile at she and hold out he hand so peter have be confide he scheme to you how do you know i only guess when a man seek a _ tête-à-tête _ so earnestly it be generally to talk about himself do the scheme include -- sarah they include sarah -- marriage -- travel -- london -- change of every kind already cry john bravo peter and hurray for one-and-twenty and you be free oh no i be not to be free what do he scheme include you not altogether that be surely illogical if yours be to include he she smile faintly i be to be always here to look after the place when he and sarah be travel or in london i be to live with he aunt he want to be able to think of I as always wait here to welcome he home as -- as i have be all he life not actually in this house because -- sarah -- my little sarah -- would not like that it seem but in the dower house close by i see say john how delightfully ingenuous and how pleasingly unselfish a very young man can sometimes be ah do not laugh at I john she say tremulously indeed just now i can not bear it laugh at you my queen -- my saint how little you know I say john tenderly it be at peter that i be presume to smile be it a laughing matter she say wistfully i think it will be mary i try so hard to tell he say lady mary but i could not somehow he make it impossible he look upon I as quite quite old john laugh outright a laugh that ring true even to lady mary 's sensitive perception but do not _ you _ look upon everybody over thirty as quite old when you be one-and-twenty i be sure i do perhaps but yet -- i do not know i be he mother it be natural he should feel so he make I realize how preposterous it be for I the mother of a grown-up son to be think selfishly of my own happiness as though i be a young fresh girl just start life i have hope say john quietly that you might be think a little of my happiness too oh john but you happiness and mine seem all the same thing she say ingenuously yet he think of my life as finish and i be think of it as though it be begin all over again he make I feel so ashamed so conscience-stricken she hide she face in she hand how could i tell he i think say john that the time have come when he must be tell i mean to put it off until he attain he majority but since he have broach the subject of you leave this house himself he have give we the best opportunity possible and i also think -- that the tell have better be leave to I chapter xviii john crewys stand on the walk below the terrace with peter by he side enjoy a after-breakfast smoke and watch a party of sportsman climb up the bracken-clothed slope of the opposite hillside a dozen beater be toiling after the gun among whom the short and sturdy figure of colonel hewel be very plainly to be distinguish a boy be lead a pony-cart for the game sarah have accept a invitation to dine and spend the evening with she beloved lady mary at barracombe but peter have another appointment with she besides of which lady mary know nothing he be to meet she at the ferry and picnic on the moor at the top of the hill on he side of the river but through all the secret joy and triumph that possess he at the remembrance of this rendezvous he could not but sigh as he watch the little procession of sportsman opposite and almost involuntarily he regret escape he in the half-muttered word -- i shall never shoot again there be thing even better worth do in life say john sympathetically colonel hewel would not give in to that say peter he be rather a one-idea 'd man john agree but if you ask he whether he would sacrifice all the sport he be ever likely to enjoy for one chance to distinguish himself in action -- why you be a soldier and you know best what he would say peter 's brow clear you have get a knack he say almost graciously of put a fellow in a good humor with himself cousin john i generally find it easier to be in a good humor with myself than with other people say john whimsically one expect so little from one 's self that one be scarcely ever disappointed and so much from other people that nothing they can do come up to one 's expectation i do not know about that say peter bluntly old crawley say _ you _ take it out of yourself like anything since i come back this time he be be hold forth to I about all you have do for I and the estate and all that i do not know my father have leave thing in such a mess and that be a smart thing you do about buy in the farm and settle the dispute with the crown which my father use to be so worried over i see i have get a good bit to thank you for cousin john i -- i be no end grateful and all that all right say john do not bother to make speech old boy i must say one thing though say peter awkwardly i be against all the change and think they might have be leave till i come home but i do not realize it be to be now or never as old crawley put it and that i be not to have the right to touch my capital when i come of age the whole arrangement be rather a unusual one but everything 's work out all right and as far as the estate go you 'll find it in pretty fair order to start upon and value increase say john quietly but crawley have the whole thing at he finger ' end and the interest of the place thoroughly at heart you could not have a better adviser he be well enough say peter somewhat ungraciously shall we take a turn up and down say john he light a fresh cigarette there be a chill feeling in the air though it be such a lovely morning it will be warmer when the sun have conquer the mist say peter with a slight shiver the white dew on the long grass and the gossamer cobweb spin in a single night from twig to twig of the rose-tree glitter in the sunshine the autumn rose bloom cheerfully in the long border and the robin be sing loudly on the terrace above the heavy head of the dahlia droop beneath they weight of moisture in these last day of they existence before the frost would bring they to a sudden end capucine in every shade of brown and crimson and gold run riot over the ground peter draw a pipe from he pocket put it in he mouth take out he tobacco-pouch and fill the pipe with he left hand john watch he with interest that be dexterously do i be get pretty handy say the hero with satisfaction strike a match but -- he face fall anew -- no more football one feel that sort of thing just at the beginning of the season no more game it would not tell so much on a fellow like you cousin john who be perfectly happy with a book and who -- who be too old for game suggest john oh there be always golf say peter a refuge for the aged eh say john and he eye twinkle but miss sarah say you bid fair to beat she at croquet oh she be -- just rot say peter and the tone touch john though he detest slang and what be croquet after all to a fellow that be use to exercise i suppose i shall be all right again hunting when i have get my nerve back a bit at present it be rotten a fellow feel so beastly helpless and one-sided however that 'll wear off i expect i hope so say john they reach the end of the long walk and stand for a moment beneath the eastern turret watch the sparkle on the brown surface of the river below and the white mist float away down the valley talking of advice say peter abruptly -- if i want _ that _ i would rather come to you than to old crawley after all though you will not be my guardian much longer you be still my mother 's trustee yes say john smile the law still entitle I to take a interest in -- in you mother of course i should not dream of mention she affair or mine either for that matter to any one else say peter he make a exception in he own mind but decide that it be not necessary to explain this to john for the moment thank you peter say john my mother -- seem to I say peter slowly to have change very much since i go to south africa have you notice it i have say john dryly i do not suppose say peter quicken he step that any one could realize exactly what i feel about it i think -- perhaps -- i could say john without visible satire dimly and no doubt inadequately the fact be say peter and the warm color rush into he brown face even to he thin temple i -- i be hope to get marry very soon though nothing 's exactly settle yet a man in you position generally marry early say john i think you be quite right as my mother like -- the girl i want to marry say peter i hope it would make everything straight but she seem quite miserable at the thought of settle down quietly in the dower house ah in the dower house say john then you will not be want she to live here with you after all it be the same thing though say peter as i have try to explain to she she would be only a few yard off and she could still be look after the place and my interest and all that as she do now and whenever i be down here i should see she constantly you know how devoted i be to my mother of course i can not deny i do lead she to hope i should be always with she but a man can not help it if he happen to fall in love of course if -- if all happen as i hope as i have reason to hope i shall _ have _ to be away from she a good deal but that be all in the course of nature as a fellow grow up i sha 'n' t be any the less glad to see she when i _ do _ come home and yet here she be talk quite wildly of leave barracombe altogether and go to london and travel all over the world and do all sort of thing she be never do in she life it be not like my mother and i can not bear to think of she like that i tell you she be change altogether say peter and there be tear in he gray eye john feel a odd sympathy for the boy he recognize that though peter 's limitation be obvious he anxiety be sincere peter too have he ideal if they be ideal conventional and out of date that be hardly he fault john figure to himself very distinctly that imaginary mother whom peter hold sacred the mother who stay always at home and part she hair plainly and say many prayer and do much needlework but who nevertheless be not and never could be the real lady mary whom peter do not know but it be a tender ideal in its way though it belong to that past into which so many tender and beautiful vision have fade the maiden of to-day still dream of the knightly armour-clad hero of the twelfth century it be not she fault that she be presently glad to fall in love with a gentleman on the stock exchange in a top hat and a frock coat i have see something of woman of the world say peter who have scarcely yet skim the bubble from the surface of that society whose depths he believe himself to have explore i suppose that be what my mother want to turn into when she talk of london and paris _ my mother _ who have live in the country all she life i suppose some woman be worldly say john as gravely as possible and no doubt the shallow-hearted the stupid the selfish be to be find everywhere and belong to either sex but nevertheless solid virtue and true kindness be to be meet with among the dame of mayfair as among the matron of the country-side they shibboleth be different that be all perhaps -- it be possible -- that the speech of the town lady be the more charitable that they seek more persistently to do good to they fellow-creature i do not know comparison be odious but so he add with a slight laugh be general conclusion found on popular prejudice rather than individual experience -- odious here john perceive that he word of wisdom be convey hardly any mean to peter who be only wait impatiently till he have come to a end of they so he pursue this topic no further and contented himself by inquire : what do you want I to do i want you to explain to she say peter eagerly how unsuitable it would be and to advise she to settle down quietly at the dower house as i be sure my father would have wish she to do that be all i see say john you want I to put the case to she from you point of view i wish you would say peter earnestly every one say you be so eloquent surely you could talk she over i hope i be not eloquent in private life say john laughing but if you want to know how it appear to I -- peter nod gravely pipe in mouth let we see to start with say john thoughtfully you go off a boy from eton to serve you country when you think and rightly that you country have need of you you distinguish yourself in south africa -- surely you need not go into all that say peter stare excuse I say john smile in put you case i can not bear to leave out vital detail merely professional prejudice shortly then you fully sustain you share in a long and arduous campaign you win you commission you be wound decorate and invalide home he stop short in the brilliant sunshine which now flood they path and look gravely at peter some of we say john have imagination enough to realize even without the help of war-correspondent the scene of horror through which you and score of other boy fresh from school like you have to live through we can picture the long hour on the veldt -- on the march -- in captivity -- in the hospital -- in the blockhouse -- when soldier have be sick at heart weary to death with physical suffering and haunt by ghastly memory of dead comrade peter hurriedly draw he left hand from the pocket where the beloved tobacco-pouch repose and pull he brown feel hat down over he eye as though the October sunlight hurt they i think at such time peter say john quietly continue he walk by the boy 's side that you must have long now and then for you home for this peaceful english country you green english wood and the silent hall where you mother wait for you tremble for you pray for you i think you heart must have ache then as so many man 's heart have ache to remember the time when you might have make she happy by a word or a look or a smile and you do not do it peter -- _ you do not do it _ peter make a restless movement indicative of surprise and annoyance but he be silent still and john change he tone and speak lightly and cheerfully well then you come home and you joy of life of youth of health all return and you look forward naturally to take you share of the pleasure open to other young man of you standing but you never mean to forget you mother as so many careless son forget those who have watch and wait for they even though you fall in love you still think of she when you be weary of travel or pleasure connect with the outside world you mean always to return to she you like to think she would still be wait for you faithfully gratefully wait within the sacred precinct of you childhood 's home and now when you remember she submission to you father 's wish in the past and she single-hearted devotion to yourself you be shocked and disappointed to find that she can wish to descend from she beautiful and guard solitude here and mix with she fellow-creature in the work-a-day world why say john in a tone rather of dream and tenderness than of argument that would be to tear the jewel from its setting -- the noble central figure from the calm landscape light by the evening sun there be a pause during which peter smoke energetically well he say presently of course i can not follow all that highfalutin ' style you know -- of course not say john i understand you be a plain englishman exactly say peter relieved i be but one thing i will say -- you have get the idea thank you say john if you can put it like that to my mother say peter still busy with he pipe but speak very emphatically why all i can say be that i believe it be the way to get round she i have often notice how useless it seem to talk common-sense to she but a word of sentiment -- and there you be strange to say she like nothing better than -- er -- poetry i hope you do not mind my call you rather poetical say peter in a tone of sincere apology i wish john you would go straight to my mother and put the whole case before she just like that the whole case say john but my dear fellow that be only half the case what do you mean the other half say john be the case from _ she _ point of view i do not see say peter how she point of view can be different from mine john 's thought fly back to a February evening more than two year earlier it seem to he that sir timothy stand before he surprise pompous argumentative but he see only peter look at he with he father 's gray eye set in a boy 's thin face my experience as a barrister he say with a curious sense of repeat himself have teach I that it be possible for two person to take diametrically opposite view of the same question and what happen then say peter stupidly we bread and butter but _ why _ should my mother leave the place she be live in for year and year and go gad about all over the world -- at she time of life i do not see what can be say for the wisdom of that nothing from you point of view i dare say say john much from hers if you be willing to listen and if he add smile as a afterthought you will promise not to interrupt well say peter rather doubtfully all right i promise you will not be long i suppose he glance stealthily down towards the ferry though he know that sarah would not be there for a couple of hour at least and that he could reach it in less than ten minute but half the pleasure of meeting sarah consist in wait for she at the trysting-place john observe the glance and smile imperceptibly he take out he watch i shall speak he say carefully examine it for four minute let 's sit say peter it be warm enough now in all conscience they sit upon a old stone bench below the turret peter lean back with he black head rest against the wall he feel hat tip over he eye and he pipe in he mouth he look comfortable even good-humoured go ahead he murmur to understand the case from you mother 's point of view i be afraid it be necessary say john to take a rapid glance at the circumstance of she life which have -- which have make she what she be she come here as a child do not she when she father die and though he have just succeed to the earldom he die a very poor man you father as she guardian spare no pain nor expense for that matter in educate and maintain she when she be barely seventeen year old he marry she there be a slight dryness in john 's voice as he make the statement which account for the gruffness of peter 's acquiescence of course -- she be quite willing say john understand the offence imply by peter 's growl but as we be look at thing exclusively from she point of view just now we must not forget that she have see nothing of the world nothing of other man she have also -- he catch he breath -- a bright gay pleasure-loving disposition but she mould herself to seriousness to please she husband to whom she owe everything when other girl of she age be play at love -- thinking of dance and game and outing -- she be absorb in motherhood and household care a perfect wife a perfect mother as poor human nature count perfection lady mary would have cry out in vehement contradiction and self-reproach have she hear these word but peter again growl reluctant acquiescence when john pause in one day say john slowly she be rob of husband and child she husband by death she boy she only son by he own will he desert she without even bid or intend to bid she farewell hush -- remember this be from _ she _ point of view peter have start to he foot with a angry exclamation but he sit down again and bent he sullen gaze on the garden path as john continue he brown face be flush but john 's low deep tone now tender now scornful presently enchain and even fascinate he attention he listen intently though angrily she grief be passionate but -- she life be not over say john she who have be guide from childhood by the wish of other now find that without neglect any duty she could consult she own inclination indulge she own taste choose she own friend enjoy with all the fervor of a unspoilt nature the world which open freshly before she : a world of art of music of literature of a thousand interest which mean so much to some of we so little to other to she return this formerly undutiful son and find -- a passionately devoted mother indeed but also a woman in the full pride of she beauty and maturity and this boy would condemn _ she _ -- the most delightful the most attractive the most unselfish companion ever desire by a man -- to sit in the chimney-corner like a old crone with a distaff throughout all the year that fate may yet hold in store for she -- with no greater interest in life than to watch the fading of she own sweet face in the glass and to await the interval during which he would be graciously pleased to afford she the consolation of he presence have you do say peter furiously i could say a good deal more say john grow suddenly cool but -- he show he watch -- my time be up what -- what do you mean by all this say the boy stammer with passion what be my mother to _ you _ the time have come john 's bright hazel eye have grow stern he middle-aged face flush with the emotion he own word have arouse yet control and calm in every line of handsome feature and steady brow confront peter 's angry bewildered gaze she be the woman i love say john the woman i mean to make my wife he remain seat silently wait for peter to imbibe and assimilate he word after a quick gasp of incredulous indignation peter too sit silent at he side john give he time to recover before he speak again i hope he say very gently that when you have think it over you will not mind it so much as it be go to be -- it would be pleasanter if you and i could be friend i think later on you may even perceive advantage in the arrangement -- under the circumstance when you have recover from you natural regret in realize that she must leave barracombe -- it be not that say peter hoarsely he feel he must speak and he also desire it must be confess to speak offensively and relieve himself somewhat of the accumulate rage and resentment that be burn in he breast it be -- it be simply -- he say flushing darkly and turn he face away from john 's calm and friendly gaze -- that to I -- to _ I _ the idea be -- ridiculous ah say john he rise from the stone bench a spark of anger come to he too as he look at peter but he control he voice and he temper the time will come he say when you imagination will be able to grasp the possibility of love between a man in the forty and a woman in the thirty at least for you sake i hope it will why for my sake say peter because i should be sorry say john if you die young chapter xix nearly a thousand foot above the fertile valley of the youle stretch a waste of moorland here all the tree be gnarl and dwarf above the patch of rust-coloured bracken save only the delicate silver birch which sway and yield to the wind great boulder be scatter among the thorn bush and over they rough and glistening breast be fling velvet covering of green moss and gray lichen on this October day the heather yet sturdily bear a few last rosy blossom and the ripe blackberry shine like black diamond on the straggle bramble here and there a belated furze-bush erect its golden crown over the dim purple of the distant hill a brighter purple line proclaim the sea closer at hand on a ridge expose to every wind of heaven sigh a little wood of stunt larch and dull blue pine against a clear and brilliant sky sarah be enthrone on a mossy stone beneath the yellowing foliage of a shelter beech she glorious ruddy hair be uncovered and a tyrolese hat be hang on a neighbouring bramble beside a little tweed coat she wear a loose white canvas shirt and short tweed skirt a brown leather belt and brown leather boot be less indifferent to creature-comfort than to the preservation of she complexion miss sarah be pay great attention to the contents of a market-basket by she side she have choose a site for the picnic near a bubble brook and have fill she glass with clear sparkling water therefrom before seat herself to enjoy she cold chicken and bread and butter and a slice of game-pie peter be very far from feel any inclination towards display the hilarity which a outdoor meal be suppose to provoke he be oblige to collect stick and put a senseless round-bottomed kettle on a damp reluctant fire to himself he use much stronger adjective in describe both he relieve he feeling slightly by say that he never eat lunch and by gloomily eye the game-pie instead of aid sarah to demolish it it would not be a picnic without a kettle and a fire and we _ must _ have hot water to wash up with i bring a dish-cloth on purpose say sarah i can not think why you do not enjoy yourself you use to be fond of eating and drinking -- _ anywhere _ -- and most of all on the moor -- in the good old day that be go i be not a philosopher like you say peter angrily i be anything but that say sarah with provoke cheerfulness a philosopher be a thoughtful middle-aged person who put off enjoy life until it be too late to begin i hate middle-aged people say peter i be not very fond of they myself as a rule say sarah indulgently they be not nice and amusing to talk to like you and I or rather -lrb- with a glance at she companion 's face -rrb- like _ I _ and they be not picturesque and fond of spoil we as _ really _ old people be they be just busy try to get all they can out of the world that be all but there be exception or of course it would not be a rule you mother be a exception no one young or old be ever more picturesque or -- or more altogether delicious it be i who teach she that new way of do she hair by-the-by how do you like it i do not like it at all growl peter perhaps you prefer the old way say sarah turn up she short nose rather scornfully part indeed and brush down flat over she ear exactly like that horrid old mr ash mr ash have live with we for thirty year say peter in a tone imply that he desire no liberty to be take with the name of he faithful retainer that do not make she any better look however retort sarah in fact she might have have more chance of learn how to do she hair properly anywhere else now i come to think of it of course everything at barracombe be ugly and old-fashioned say peter gloomily except you mother say sarah sarah i can not stand any more of this rot say peter start from he couch of heather will you talk sense or let I sarah shot a keen glance of inquiry at he moody face well she say in resigned tone i do hope to finish my lunch in peace i see there be something the matter when you come stride up the hill without a word but i think it be only that you find the basket too heavy of course if i have know it be only to be lunch for one i would not have put in so many thing and certainly not a whole bottle of papa 's best claret in fact if i have know i be to picnic practically alone i would not have cross the river at all then she see that peter be in earnest and with a sigh of regret sarah return the dish of jam-puff to the basket i could not talk sense or even listen to it with those heavenly puff under my very nose she say now what be it i hate tell you -- i hate talking of it say peter and a dark flush rise to he frown eyebrow he throw himself once more at sarah 's foot and turn he face away from she and towards the blue streak of distant sea john crewys want to marry -- my mother he say in choke tone be that all say sarah i have see that for age be not you glad glad say peter i think sarah say innocently that _ you _ want to marry _ I _ sarah well say sarah she look rather oddly at peter 's recumbent figure then she push the loosen wave of she red hair from she forehead with a determine gesture well she say defiantly be not that one obstacle to we marriage remove you aunt will go to the dower house and you mother will leave barracombe and you 'll have the place all to yourself and you dare to tell I you be sorry yes say peter sit up and face she i dare i be glad of that say sarah she deep voice soften i should have think less of you if you have not dare suddenly she rise from she mossy throne shake the crumb off she skirt and look down upon peter with blue eye sparkling beneath she long lash and the fresh red color deepen and spread in she cheek until even the tip of she delicate ear and she creamy throat turn pink _ well _ say sarah go and stop it make you mother sorry and ashamed it would be very easy tell she she be too old to be happy but say good-bye to I first sarah why be it to be all sunshine for you and all shade for she say sarah have not she weep enough to please you may not she have she st martin 's summer god give it to she will _ you _ take it away sarah he look up at she crimsoned tearful face in dismay be this sarah the infantile -- the pink-and-white -- the seductive laughing impudent sarah and yet how passionately peter admire she in this mood of virago which he have never see since the day of she childish rage of long ago why do you suppose say sarah disdainfully that i have be let you follow _ I _ about all this summer and desert _ she _ except to show she how little you be to be depend upon to bring home to she how foolish she would be to fling away she happiness for you sake _ you _ who at one word from I be willing to turn she out of she own home to live in a wretched little villa at you very door do not interrupt I say sarah stamp and say you be not willing you tell she so i mean you to tell she and yet -- i could have kill you peter when i hear she sweet voice falter out to I that she would be ready and glad to give up she place to she boy 's wife whenever the time should come _ she _ tell you cry peter but she do not say you would ask she cried sarah scornfully _ i _ know it but she never guess i do she be only gently smooth away as she hope the difficulty that lay in the path to _ you _ happiness oh that she could have believe it of I but she think only of you happiness _ you _ who would snatch away hers this minute if you could she never dream i know you would say a word she pause in she impassioned speech and the tear drop from the dark blue eye sarah be cry and peter be speechless with awe and dismay i think she would have die peter say sarah solemnly before she would have tell I how brutal you would be and how stupid and how selfish i mean you to show she all that i think it would open she eye i be such a fool as if anything could open the eye of a mother to the fault of she only son peter look at she with such despair and grief in he dark face that she heart almost soften towards he but she harden it again immediately do you mean that you -- you have be play with I all this time sarah they -- everybody tell I -- that you be only play -- but i have never believe it i _ mean _ to play with you say sarah turn if possible even redder than before i mean to teach you a lesson and throw you over and the more i saw of you the more i do not repent you who dare to think yourself superior to you mother and indeed to any woman king be enslave by woman you know say miss sarah toss she head and statesman be lead by they though they ought not to be and -- and poet worship they or how could they write poetry there would be nothing to write about it be reserve for boy and savage to look down upon they she sit scornfully down again on she boulder and put she hand to she loosen hair i can not think why a scene always make one 's hair untidy say sarah suddenly burst into a laugh but the whiteness of peter 's face frighten she and she have some ado to laugh naturally and i be lose without a looking-glass she add in a somewhat quavering tone of bravado she pull out a great tortoise-shell dagger and a heavy mass of glorious red-gold hair fall about she piquant face and she pretty milk-white throat down to she waist dear I say miss sarah she look around near the bubble brook dark peaty hollow hold little pool which offer nature 's mirror for she toilet she go to the side of the stream and kneel down she plump white hand dexterously twist and secure the long burnished coil then she glance slyly round at peter he lay face downward on the grass he shoulder heave the pretty picture miss sarah 's coquetry present have be lose upon the foolish youth she return in a leisurely manner to she place and lean she chin on she hand and she elbow on she knee regard he thoughtfully where be i yes i remember it be a lesson for a girl peter never to marry a boy or a savage sarah say peter he raise he face and look at she he eye be red but he be too miserable to care he be as she have say only a boy sarah you be not in earnest you can not be i -- i know i ought to be angry miss sarah laugh derisively yes you laugh for you know too well i can not be angry with you i love you say peter passionately though you be -- as cruel as though i have not have pretty well as much to bear to-day as i know how to stand first john crewy and now you -- say -- just the truth say sarah calmly i do not deny say peter in a quivering voice that -- that some of the beastly thing he say come -- come home to I i have be a selfish brute to _ she _ i always have be you have say so pretty plainly and i -- i dare say it be true i think it be true but to _ you _ -- and i be so happy he hide he face in he hand i be glad you have the grace to see the error of you way at last say sarah encouragingly it make I quite hopeful about you but i be sorry to see you be still only think of _ we _ happiness -- i mean _ yours _ she correct herself in haste for a sudden eager hope flash across peter 's miserable young face yours yours _ yours _ it be you happiness and not hers you think of still though you have all you life before you and she have only half hers but no one have ever think of she -- except I and one other john crewy say peter angrily not john crewy at all snapped sarah he be just think of he own happiness like you be all man be alike except the one i be think of but though i make no doubt that john crewy be just as selfish as you be which be say a good deal yet as it happen john crewy be the only man who could make she happy what man be you think of say peter jealousy be a potent factor in he love for sarah he forget he mother instantly as he have forget she on the day of he return when sarah have walk on to the terrace -- and into he heart i name no name say sarah but i hope i know a hero when i see he and that man be a hero though he be -- nothing much to look at it amuse she to observe the vary expression on she lover 's face which she artless word call forth one after another if you be really not go to eat any luncheon peter she say i must trouble you to help I to wash up and pack the basket the fire be out and the water be cold but it can not be help the picnic have be a failure we have the whole afternoon before we i can not see that there be any hurry say peter not stir i do not mean to break bad news to you say sarah until we would have a pleasant meal together in comfort and rest ourselves but since you insist on spoil everything with you horrid premature disclosure i do not see why i should not do the same i must be at home by four o'clock because aunt elizabeth be come to hewelscourt this very afternoon lady tintern cry peter in dismay then you will not be able to come to barracombe this evening i be not in the habit of throw over a dinner engagement say sarah with dignity but in case they will not let I come she add with great inconsistency i 'll put a light candle in the top window of the tower as usual but you can guess how many more of these enjoyable expedition we shall be allow to make not that we need regret they if they be all to be as lively as this one still -- she help herself to a jam-puff and offer the dish to peter with a engaging smile he help himself absently i do not deny i be fond of take meal in the open air and more especially on the top of the moor say sarah with a sigh of content what have she come for say peter i shall be better able to tell you when i have see she do not you know i can pretty well guess she be go to forgive I for one thing then she 'll tell I that i do not deserve my good luck but that lord avonwick be so patient and so long-suffering that he be accept she assurance that i do not know my own mind -lrb- and i be not sure i do -rrb- and he be go to give I one more chance to become lady avonwick though i be so foolish as to say ` no ' to he last offer you do not say ` no ' to _ my _ last offer cry peter i do not believe a offer of marriage be even legal before you be one-and-twenty say miss sarah derisively what do it matter what i say have not i tell you i be only play you may tell I so a thousand time say peter doggedly but i shall never believe you until i see you actually marry to somebody else chapter xx lady tintern be please to leave paddington by a much earlier train than could have be expect she hire a fly and a pair of broken-kneed horse at brawnton and once more take she relation at hewelscourt by surprise on this occasion however she be not fortunate enough to find she invalid niece at play in the stable-yard though she detect she at luncheon and warmly congratulate she upon she robust appearance and she excellent appetite she journey have no doubt be undertake with the very intention sarah have describe but another motive also prompt she which sarah have not divine much as she desire to marry she grand-niece to lord avonwick she be not blind to the young man 's personal disadvantage which be undeniable and which peter have rudely sum up in a word by allude to he rival as a ass he be distinguish among the admirer of miss sarah 's red and white beauty by he brainlessness no less than by he eligibility nevertheless lady tintern have favor he suit she know he to be a good fellow although he be a simpleton and she be very sure that he love sarah sincerely whoever the girl marry she will rule he with a rod of iron she have better marry a fool and be do with it so why not a eligible and title and good-natured fool the old lady have write to mr hewel who be very far from understand such reasoning and weep resentfully over the letter why should lady tintern snatch she only daughter away from she in order to marry she to a fool mr hewel be of opinion that a sensible young man like peter would be a better match she suppose nobody would call sir peter crewy of barracombe a fool and as for he be young he be only a few month younger than lord avonwick and sarah would have just as pretty a title even if she husband be only a baronet instead of a baron thus she argue to herself and write the gist of she argument to she aunt why be sarah to go hunting the highway and byway for title fool when there be peter at she very door -- a young man she have know all she life and one of the oldest family in devon and seven thousand acre of land only next week when he would come of age and could marry whomever he like though of course sarah must not go against she aunt who have promise to do so much for she and give she so many beautiful thing whether young girl ought to wear jewellery or not this be the distract letter which be bring lady tintern to hewelscourt she have be annoy with sarah for refuse lord avonwick and think it would do the rebellious young lady no harm to return for a time to the bosom of she family and thus miss newmarket which sarah particularly desire to attend since no society function interested she half so much as race the old lady have not in the least object to sarah 's friendship for young sir peter crewy sarah as john have truly say be a star with many satellite and among those satellite peter do not shine with any remarkable brilliancy be so obviously a awkward country-bred lad not at home in the surroundings to which she friendship have introduce he and rather incline to be surly and quarrelsome than pleasant or agreeable lady tintern have not take such a boy 's attention to she grand-niece seriously but if sarah be take they seriously she think she have better inquire into the matter at once therefore the energetic old woman not only arrive unexpectedly at hewelscourt in the middle of luncheon but route she niece off she sofa early in the afternoon and propose that she should immediately cross the river and call upon peter 's mother i have never see the place except from these window perhaps i be underrate it say lady tintern i have never meet lady mary crewy though i know all the setoun that ever be bear never mind who ought to call on I first what do i care for such nonsense the boy be a cub and a bear -- _ that _ i know -- since he stay in my house for a fortnight and never speak to I if he could possibly help it he be a nobody sir peter fiddlestick who ever hear of he or he family i should like to know outside this ridiculous place he name be spell wrong of course i have hear of crewy kc everybody have hear of he that have nothing to do with it yes i know the young man do well in south africa all we young man do well in south africa pray be sarah to marry they all if _ that _ be what she be after the sooner i take it in hand the better lunching by herself on the moor indeed no i be not at all afraid of the ferry emily if you be i will go alone or take you good man the colonel be out shooting as you know and will not be back till tea-time say mr hewel become more and more flurry under this torrent of lively scold the colonel why do not you say tom colonel indeed say lady tintern very well i shall go alone but this mr hewel would by no means allow she reluctantly abandon the effort to dissuade she aunt put on she visit thing with as much speed as be possible to she and finally accompany she across the river to pay the propose visit to barracombe house lady mary receive she visitor in the banqueting hall a apartment which excite lady tintern 's warmest approval the old lady date the oak carve in the hall and in the yet more ancient library name the artist of the various picture criticize the ceiling and praise the window mr hewel fear she outspokenness would offend lady mary but she could perceive only pleasure and amusement in the face of she hostess between whom and the worldly old woman there spring up a friendliness that be almost instantaneous and you be like a cosway miniature yourself my dear say lady tintern peer out of she dark eye at lady mary 's delicate white face eh -- the bright color must be a little fade -- all the setoun have pretty complexion -- and carmine be a perishable tint as we all know sarah have a brilliant complexion strike in mr hewel zealously endeavor to distract she aunt from the personality in which she prefer to indulge sarah look like a milkmaid my love say the old lady who do not choose to be interrupted and when she can hunt as much as she wish and live the outdoor life she prefer she will get the complexion of a boatwoman she turn to lady mary with a gracious nod but _ you _ may live out of door with impunity time seem to leave something better than color to a few heaven-blessed woman who manage to escape wrinkle and harden and crossness i be often cross and so be younger folk than i and you boy peter -- though how he come to be you boy i do not know -- be very often cross too you have be very kind to peter say lady mary laughing i be sorry you find he cross no i be not kind to he i be not particularly fond of cross people say the old lady it be sarah who have be kind and she look sharply again at lady mary i be get on in year and very infirm say lady tintern and i must ask you to excuse I if i lean upon a stick but i should like to take a turn about the garden with you i hear you have a remarkable view from you terrace lady mary offer she arm with pretty solicitude and guide she aged but perfectly active visitor through the drawing-room -- where she stop to comment favourably upon the water color -- to the terrace where john be sit in the shade of the ilex-tree absorb in the london papers lady mary introduce he as peter 's guardian and cousin how do you do mr crewy you name be very familiar to I say the old lady though to tell you the truth sir peter look so much older than he age that i forget he have a guardian at all he will only have one for a few day longer say john smile my authority will expire very shortly but you be at any rate the very man i want to see say lady tintern who seldom waste time in preliminary i would always rather talk business with a man than with a woman so if mr crewy will lend I he arm to supplement my stick i will take a turn with he instead of with you my dear if you have no objection do you ever hear anything like she say poor mr hewel turn to lady mary as soon as she aunt be out of hear what mr crewy must think of she i can not guess she always say she have to exercise so much reticence as a ambassadress that she have give she tongue a holiday ever since but there be only one possible subject _ they _ can have to talk about and how can we be sure she interference will not spoil everything she be quite capable of ask what peter 's intention be she be the most indiscreet person in the world say sarah 's mother wring she hand i think _ peter _ have make he intention pretty obvious say lady mary she smile but she eye be anxious and you be sure you do not mind dear lady mary for who can depend on lady tintern after all she be suppose to be go to do so much for sarah but if she take it into she head to oppose the marriage i can do nothing with she i never could i be very far from mind say lady mary but it be sarah on whom everything depend what do she say i wonder what do she want it be no use ask _ I _ what sarah want say mr hewel plaintively time after time i have tell she father what would come of it all if he spoil she so outrageously he be ready enough to find fault with the boy poor fellow who never do anything wrong but he always think sarah perfection and nothing else sarah be very fortunate for peter have the same opinion of she fortunate lady mary if i be to tell you the chance that girl have have -- not but what i have far rather she marry peter -- though she might have do that all the same if she have never leave home in she life i be not so sure of that say peter 's mother lady tintern 's turn take she no further than the fountain garden where she sink down upon a bench and graciously request she escort to occupy the vacant space by she side i start at a unearthly hour this morning and i be not so young as i be she say but i be particularly desirous of a good night 's rest and i never can sleep with anything on my mind so i come over here to talk business by-the-by i should have come over here long ago if any one have have the sense to give I a hint that i have only to cross a muddy stream in a flat-bottomed boat in order to see a face like _ that _ -- she nod towards the terrace john 's color rise slightly he put the nod and the smile and the sharp glance of the dark eye together and perceive that lady tintern have draw certain conclusion there be some expression in she face say the old lady musingly which make I think of marie stuart 's farewell to france i do not know why i have odd fancy i believe the queen of scot have hazel eye whereas this pretty lady mary have the bluest eye i ever see -- quite remarkable eye those blue eye say john smile have never look beyond this range of hill since lady mary 's childhood the old lady nod again eh -- a state prisoner yes yes she have that kind of look then she turn to john with mingled slyness and humor on va changer tout celum as you have divine he answer laugh in spite of himself though how you have divine it pass my poor power of comprehension lady tintern be pleased she like tribute to she intelligence as other woman enjoy recognition of they good look it be very easy to a observer she say she be frighten at she own happiness yes yes and that cub of a boy would not make it easier by-the-by i come to talk of the boy you be he guardian for a week what do it signify for how long five minute will settle my view thank heaven i do not come later or i should have have to talk to he instead of to a man of sense you must have see what be go on what do you think of it the arrangement suit I so admirably say john smile that i be hardly to be rely upon for a impartial opinion will you tell I he circumstance john explain they in a few word and with admirable terseness and lucidity and she nod comprehensively all the while that be capital he can not make duck and drake of it all tie up on the child i hope they will have a dozen it would serve sarah right now for my side whatever sum the trustee decide to settle upon sir peter 's wife i will put down double that sum as sarah 's dowry we solicitor can fight the rest out between they the property be much better than i have be give any reason to suspect i have no more to say they can be marry in a month that be settle i never linger over business we may shake hand on it they do so with great cordiality it be not that i be overjoy at the match she explain with great frankness i think sarah be a fool to marry a boy but i have observe she be a fool who always know she own mind the fancy of some girl of that age be not worth attend to miss sarah be a young lady of character say john gravely ay she will settle he say lady tintern she small grim face relax into a witchlike smile the lad be a good lad no one have ever say a word against he and he be as steady as old time i believe miss sarah 's choice if he be she choice will be justify say john i do not think he be a murderer or a drunkard say lady tintern cheerfully she phraseology be often startling to stranger but he be absolutely devoid of -- what shall i say chivalry yes that be it few young man have much nowadays i be tell but sir peter have none -- absolutely none it will come no it will not come it be a quality you be bear with or without he be bear without sarah know all about it it will not hurt she she have the method of a ox she go direct to she point and trample over everything that stand in she way if he be less thick-skinned she would be the death of he but fortunately he have the hide of a rhinoceros i think you do they both a great deal less than justice say john but he be unable to help laugh oh you do do you i like to be disagree with she voice shake a little you must make allowance -- for a old woman -- who be -- disappointed say lady tintern john say nothing but he bright hazel eye look down on the small bent figure grow suddenly gentle and sympathetic it be a pleasure to be able to congratulate somebody she say return he look i congratulate _ you _ -- and lady mary thank you most of all because there be nothing modern about she she have walk straight out of the middle age with the face of a saint and a dreamer and a beautiful woman all in one i be a old witch and i be never deceive in a woman man i be sorry to say no longer take the trouble to deceive I now we business be over will you

happy jack 's cottage he dream eye see only lady mary in she white gown weep and agitate stumble over the threshold of a darkened room into the arm of john crewy you say you wish it say sarah she

-- be to be happy at last he have no thought to spare for sarah or any other as she linger he say absently be that all she look at he and be inspire to leave the remorseful and sympathetic word that rush to she lip unsay that be all say sarah gently for the present then she leave he alone and take she way down to the ferry chapter xxi the very last of the rose say lady mary she look round the banqueting hall the wax candle shed a radiance upon they immediate surroundings which accentuate the shadow of each unlighted corner bowl of rose red and white and golden bloom delicately in every recess against the black oak of the panel the flame be leap on the hearth about a fresh log throw into the red-hot wood-ash the two old sister sit almost in the chimney corner side by side where they could exchange they confidence unheard lady belstone still mourn she admiral in black silk and _ crêpe _ whilst miss georgina 's respect for she brother 's memory be make manifest in plum-coloured satin lady mary too wear black to-night since the day of peter 's return she have not venture to don she favorite white she gown be of velvet she fair neck and arm shone through the yellowing fold of a old lace scarf which veil the bosom a string of pearl be twist in she soft brown hair lend a dim crown to she exquisite and gracious beauty in the tender light of the wax candle candlelight be kind to the victim of relentless time disdain to notice the little line and shadow care have paint on tired face restore delicacy to fade complexion and brightness to sad eye the faint illumination be less kind to sarah in she white gown and blue ribbon the beautiful color which could face the morning sunbeam triumphantly in its young transparency be almost too high in the warmth of the shadowy hall where she golden-red hair make a glory of its own the October evening seem chilly to the aged sister and even lady mary feel the comfort of she velvet gown but sarah be impatient of the heat of the log fire and long for the open air she envy peter and john who be report to be smoking outside on the terrace the very last of the rose say lady mary there will be a sharp frost to-night they will not stand that say sarah shake she head the poor rose of autumn say lady mary rather dreamily they be never so sweet as the rose of June but they be much rarer and more precious say sarah lady mary look at she and smile how quickly sarah always understand sarah catch she hand and kiss it impulsively she back be turn to the old sister in the chimney corner lady mary she say oh never mind if i be indiscreet you know i be always that a little sob escape she but i _ must _ ask you this one thing -- you -- you do not really think _ that _ of I do you think what dear child say lady mary bewildered sarah look round at the two old lady the head of miss crewy be inclined towards the crochet she hold in she lap she slumber peacefully lady belstone be absently gaze into the heart of the great fire the heat do not appear to cause she inconvenience she be nod they will hear nothing say lady mary softly tell I sarah what you mean i would ask you she say with a little smile and flush to tell I something else only i -- too -- be afraid of be indiscreet there be nothing i would not tell you murmur sarah though i believe i would rather tell you -- out in the dark -- than here she laugh nervously the drawing-room be not light except by the moon say lady mary also a little excited by the thought of what sarah might perhaps be go to say but there be no fire there i be afraid the aunt do not like sit there in the evening but if you would not be too cold in that thin white gown -- i be never cold say sarah i take too much exercise i suppose to feel the cold then come say lady mary they steal past the sleep sister into the drawing-room and close the communicate door as noiselessly as possible here only the moonlight reign pour in through the uncurtained window and render the gay rose-coloured room with its pretty contents perfectly weird and unfamiliar sarah fling she warm young arm about she earliest and most beloved friend and rest she bright head against the gentle bosom you never think i mean all the horrid cruel thing i make peter say to you you never believe it of I do you that i would not marry he unless _ you _ go away you whom i love best in the world and always have she say defiantly or that i would ever alter a single corner of this dear old house which use to be so hideous and which you have make so beautiful sarah my -- my darling say lady mary in frightened tremble tone you need not blame peter for say any of it say sarah for it be i who put the word into he mouth it make he miserable to say they but he could not help himself he be not really quite responsible for he action he be not now when people be -- be in love i have often notice they be not responsible but why -- i only want to show he what a goose he really be murmured sarah hang she head he come back so pompous and superior talk about he father 's place and be the only man in the house and oblige to look after you all and it be all so ridiculous and so out of date i do not mean to hurt _ you _ except just for a moment because it could not be help say sarah she hide she face in lady mary 's neck half laughing and half cry i be so afraid you -- you be take he seriously and -- and he be so selfish want to keep you all to himself oh sarah hush lady mary cry she divine it all in a flash in the twinkling of a eye it be to sarah that she owe the pain and mortification not to she boy sarah have say peter be not responsible be he only a puppet in the hand of the girl he love could john ever have be thus blindly lead and influence she wounded heart say quickly that john be of a different nobler stronger nature but the mother 's instinct leap to defend she son and cry also that john be a man and peter but a boy in love ready to sacrifice the whole world to she he worship he father would never have do that lady mary be even capable of a unreasoning pride in peter 's power of loving though it be not she -- alas it never have be she -- for whom she boy be willing to make the smallest sacrifice but he have honestly mean to devote himself to he mother accord to he light have sarah 's influence not come in the way sarah who must have divine she secret all the while and who with the dauntlessness of youth have not hesitate to force open the door into a world so bright that lady mary almost fear to enter it but tremble as it be upon the threshold of she own happiness -- and peter 's they be silent hold each other in a close embrace both conscious of the passing and repassing footstep upon the gravel path without sarah be the first to recover herself she put lady mary into she favorite chair and come and kneel by she side that be over and i be forgive she say softly you will make my boy -- happy whisper lady mary i can not tell whether he will be happy or not if -- if he marry I say sarah she appear to smother a laugh but aunt elizabeth seem reconcile to the idea i think you bewitch she this afternoon she be in love with you and with this house and with mr john but more particularly with you when i say i have refuse peter over and over again she say i be a fool but she say that whatever i do i -- i suppose i let she think say sarah lean she head against lady mary 's knee that _ some day _ -- if he be still idiotic enough to wish it -- and if _ you _ do not mind -- my pretty sarah -- my darling i be sure it be only because he be you son say sarah vehemently i have always want to be you child what be the use of pretend i have not think what a time poor mamma use to give I and what a angel of goodness you be to the poor little black sheep who love you so sarah 's white dress shine in the moonlight catch the attention of john crewy through the open window he pause in he walk outside peter 's voice utter something and the two dark figure pass slowly on they will not interrupt we say sarah serenely i tell peter at dinner that i want to talk to you and that he be to go and smoke with mr john and behave as if nothing have happen he say he have not speak to he since this morning he be all agog to know what lady tintern come for but he will not dare to come and interrupt what have you do to my boy say lady mary half laughing and half indignant that you lightest word be to be he law and oh sarah -- she tone grow wistful -- it be strange -- even though he love you that you should understand he better than i who would lay down my life for he it be very easy to see why say sarah calmly the deep contralto music of she voice contrast oddly with she matter-of-fact manner and word it be just that peter and i be make of common clay and that you be not so of course we understand each other i do not mean to say that we do not quarrel pretty often i dare say we always shall i be good-tempered but i like my own way and besides -- she speak quite cheerfully -- anybody would quarrel with peter but you and he be a little like aunt elizabeth and I _ she _ want I to behave like a _ grande dame _ and to know exactly who everybody be and treat they accordingly and be never too much interested in anything but never bore and always look beautiful and above all _ appropriate _ and _ i _ -- would rather be take the dog for a run on the moor in a short skirt and big boot or up at four in the morning otter-hunting or out with the hound or -- or -- digging in the garden for that matter -- than be the prettiest girl in london and go to a state ball or the opera you see i have try both kind of life now and i know which i like best and -- and flirt with people be pleasant enough in its way but it give you a kind of sick feeling afterwards which hunting never do i do not think i be really much of a hand at sentiment say sarah with great truth and peter ask lady mary gently you want peter to be a -- a noble kind of person a great statesman or something of that sort do not you she soft lip caress lady mary 's hand apologetically to be fond of reading and poetry and all sort of thing and _ he _ want to shoot rabbit and go fishing but of course he could not help _ know _ you want he to be something he be not and never could be and do not want to be oh sarah say poor lady mary but -- yes it be true what you be say it be true though i say it so badly and i know it because as i tell you peter and i be just the same sort at heart i have be tease he pretend to be a worldling but foreign travel and entertaining in london be just about as unsuited to I as to peter i -- i be glad -- she utter a quick little sob -- that i -- i play my part well while it all last but you know it be not so much I as my look that do it and because i do not care i be blunt and natural and they think it _ chic _ but it be not _ chic _ it be that i _ really _ do not care and i do not think i have ever quite succeed in take peter in either for he _ could not _ believe i could really think any sort of life worth living but the dear old life down here which he and i love best in the world in we heart of heart the twinkling frosty blue point of starlight glitter in the cloudless vault of heaven above the moonlit stillness of the valley the clear-cut shadow of the balcony and the stone urn fall across the cold path and whitened grass of the terrace ghostlike sarah 's white form emerge from the darkness of the room and stand on the threshold of the window john throw away the end of he cigar and smile i presume the interview we be not to interrupt be over he say good-humouredly surely it be not very prudent of miss sarah to venture out-of-door in that thin gown or have she a cloak of some kind -- but peter be not listen to he sarah wrap in she white cloak and hood have already flit across the moonlit terrace into the deep shadow of the ilex grove and the boy be by she side before john could reach the window she have just quit oh be it you peter say miss sarah look over she shoulder i be look for you i have put on my thing it be get late and i think you would see I home must you go already cry peter have they send to fetch you i dare say i could stay a few moment say sarah but of course my maid come age ago as usual but if there be anything you particularly want to say -- you know how tiresome she be keep as close as she can to listen to every word -- why it would be better to say it now i be not in such a hurry as all that you know very well i want to say a thousand thing say peter vehemently i have be walk up and down till i think i should go mad make conversation with john crewys peter be honestly unaware that it be john who have make the conversation have lady tintern come to take you away sarah and why do she call on my mother this afternoon the very moment she arrive you mother would be the proper person to tell you that how should i know say sarah reprovingly have you ask she how can i ask she say peter he voice tremble i have not speak to she once -- except before other people -- since john crewys tell I -- what i tell you this afternoon i have scarcely see any one since i leave you i wander off for a beastly walk in the wood by myself as miserable as any fellow would be after all you say to I do you think i -- i have get no feeling he voice sound very forlorn and sarah feel remorseful after all peter be she comrade and she oldest friend as well as she lover at the very bottom of she heart there lurk a remnant of she childish admiration for he which would perhaps never quite be extinguish the boy who get into scrape and be thrash by he father and who do not mind the boy who vault over fence she have to climb or creep through who go fishing and throw a fly with so light and sure a hand and fill he basket whilst she wind she line about she skirt and catch she hook and whip the stream in vain he have climb a tall fir-tree once and bring down in safety a weep shame-stricken little girl with a red pigtail whose daring have suddenly fail she and he have go up the tree himself like a squirrel afterwards and fetch she the nest she covet nor do he ever taunt she with she cowardice nor revert to he own exploit but this be because peter forget the whole adventure in a hour though sarah remember it to the end of she life he climb so many tree and go bird ' - nesting every spring to he mother 's despair sarah thought of he wander all the afternoon in he own wood lonely and mortified listen to the pop of the gun on the opposite side of the hill which echo through the valley she know what those sound mean to peter -- the boy who have shoot so straight and true and who would never shoulder a gun any more i do not see why you should be so miserable she say as lightly as she could but there be tear in she eye she be so sorry for peter i dare say you do not say peter bitterly nobody have ever make a fool of you no doubt a wretched self-confident fool who give you he whole heart to trample in the dust i suppose i ought to have know you be only -- play with I -- as you say -- a wretched object as i be now but -- a object cry sarah so anxious to stem the tide of he reproach that she scarce know what she be say which appeal to the soft side of every woman 's heart high or low rich or poor civilized or savage -- a wounded soldier do you think i want to be pity say peter glowering pity say sarah softly do you call this pity she lean forward and kiss he empty sleeve peter tremble at she touch it be -- because you be sorry for I he say hoarsely sorry say sarah scornfully i glory in it then she suddenly begin to cry i be a wicked girl she sob and you _ be a _ fool if you ever think i could be happy anywhere but in this stupid old valley or with -- with any one but you and i be rightly punish if my -- my behavior have make you change you mind because i _ do _ mean just at first to throw you over and to -- to go away from you peter but -- but the arm that be not there -- hold I fast sarah she hide she face against he shoulder \* \* \* \* \* john crewy be play softly on the little oak piano in the banqueting hall and lady mary stand before the open hearth absently watch the spark fly upward from the burning log and listen the old sister have go to bed sarah 's bright face frame in she white hood fresh and rosy from the cold breath of the October night appear in the doorway peter be in there -- wait for you she whisper blush john crewy rise from the piano and come forward and hold out he hand to sarah with a smile lady mary hurry past they into the unlighted drawing-room she eye dazzle by the sudden change could distinguish nothing for a moment but peter be there wait and perhaps lady mary be thankful for the darkness which hide she face from she son peter mother she cling to she boy and a kiss pass between they which say all that be in they heart that night -- of appeal -- of understanding -- of forgiveness -- of the love of mother and son and no foolish word of explanation be ever utter to mar the gracious memory of that sacred reconciliation the end end of
