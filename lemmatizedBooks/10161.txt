produce by charle aldarondo keren vergon jayam subramanian and pg distribute proofreader english poet of the eighteenth century select and edit with a introduction by ernest bernbaum professor of english at the university of illinois 1918 preface the text of this collection of poetry be authentic and not bowdlerize the general reader will i hope be gratify to find that its page display no pedantic or scholastic trait he pleasure in the poetry itself will not be distract by a marginal numbering of the line by index-figure and footnote or by antiquated peculiarity of spelling capitalization and elision except where literal convention be essential to the poet 's purpose -- as in _ the castle of indolence the schoolmistress _ or chatterton 's poem -- i have follow modern usage dialect word be explain in the glossary and the student who may wish to consult the context of any passage will find the necessary reference in the unusually full table of contents whenever the title of a poem give too vague a notion of its substance or whenever its substance be miscellaneous i have supply -lrb- bracket -rrb- caption for the extract except for these there be nothing on the page of the text besides the poet ' own word originality be not the proper characteristic of a anthologist and in the choice of extract i have rarely indulge my personal liking when they conflict with time-honored preference yet this anthology -- the first publish in a project series of four or five volume comprise the english poet from elizabethan to victorian time -- have certain minor feature that may be deem objectionably novel much the greater portion of the volume have of course as usual be give to those poem -lrb- by pope thomson collin gray goldsmith crabbe cowper and burn -rrb- which have be love or admire from they day to we own but i have venture to admit also a few which though forget to-day either be popular in the eighteenth century or possess marked historical significance in other word i present not solely what the twentieth century consider enduringly great in the poetry of the eighteenth but also a little -- proportionately very little -- of what the eighteenth century itself -lrb- perhaps mistakenly -rrb- consider interesting this secondary purpose account for my inclusion of passage from such neglect author as mandeville brooke day and darwin the passage of this sort be too infrequent to annoy he who read for aesthetic pleasure only and to the student they will illustrate movement in the spirit of the age which would otherwise be unrepresented and which as the historical introduction point out be a integral part of its thought and feel the inclusion of passage from ossian though almost unprecedented require i think no defense against the literal-minded protest that they be write in prose student of poetical history will find it illuminating to read the passage in chronological order -lrb- irrespective of authorship -rrb- and in order to facilitate this method i have give in the table of contents the date of each poem e b contents john pomfret the choice -lrb- 1700 -rrb- daniel defoe the true-born englishman -lrb- 1701 -rrb- ll

form be the heroic couplet its content be a wish for a peaceful and civilized mode of existence and what be believe to satisfy that longing a life of leisure the necessaries of comfort plentifully provide but use temperately a country-house upon a hillside not too distant from the city a little garden border by a rivulet a quiet-study furnished with the classical roman poet the society of a few friend man who know the world as well as book who be loyal to they nation and they church and whose conversation be intellectually vigorous but always polite the occasional companionship of a woman of virtue wit and poise of manner and above all the avoidance of public or private contention culture and peace -- and the greater of these be peace the sentiment characterize the first quarter of the eighteenth century the poet of that period have receive a abundant heritage from the elizabethan the cavalier dryden and milton it be a poetry of passionate love chivalric honor indignant satire and sublime faith much of it they admire but they admiration be temper with fear they hear therein the tone of violent generation -- of man whose intensity though yield extraordinary beauty and grandeur yield also obscurity and extravagance man whom the love of woman too often impel to utter fantastic hyperbole and the love of honor to glorify preposterous adventure quarrelsome man who assail they opponent with rancorous personality doctrinaire who employ they fiery energy of mind in the creation of rigid system of religion and government uncompromising man who devote to the support of those system they fortune and live drench the land in the blood of a civil war execute a king presently restore he dynasty and finally exile it again thus maintain during half a century a general insecurity of life and property which check the finer growth of civilization they successor trust that the compromise of 1688 have reduce political and sectarian affair to a state of calm equilibrium and they desire to cultivate the fruit of serenity by foster in all thing the spirit of moderation in poetry as in life they tend more and more to discountenance manifestation of vehemence even the poetry of dryden with its reflection of the stormy day through which he have struggle seem to they though gloriously lead the way toward perfection to fall short of equability of temper and smoothness of form to work like defoe 's _ true-born englishman _ -lrb- 1701 -rrb- and _ hymn to the pillory _ -lrb- 1703 -rrb- combative in spirit and free in style they give only guard and temporary approval inevitably the change of mood entail loss sir henry wotton 's _ character of a happy life _ -lrb- c 1614 -rrb- treat the same theme as pomfret 's _ choice _ but pomfret 's contemporary be rarely if ever visit by such gleam as shine in wotton 's line describe the happy man as one who never understand how deepest wound be give by praise and as one who god doth late and early pray more of he grace than gift to lend such touch of penetrative wisdom and piety like many other precious quality be of a age that have pass in the poetry of 1700-1725 religion forgo mysticism and exaltation the intellectual life daring and subtlety the imagination exuberance and splendor enthusiasm for moral ideal decline into steadfast approval of ethical principle yet these be change in tone and manner rather than in fundamental view the poet of the period be conservative they be shock by the radicalism of mandeville the nietzsche of he day who deride the generally accept morality as shallow delusion and who by means of a clever fable support a materialistic theory which imply that in the struggle for existence nothing but egotism could succeed : fool only strive to make a great and honest hive obloquy bury he he be a sensational exception to the rule as a body the poet of he time retain the orthodox tradition concern god man and nature they theology be evidence by addison watt and parnell it be a christianity that have not cease to be stern and majestic in addison 's _ divine ode _ the planet of the firmament proclaim a creator whose power know no bound in the hymn of isaac watt god be as of old a jealous god obedience to whose eternal will may require the painful sacrifice of temporal earthly affection even the sacrifice of we love for we fellow-creature a just god who by the law of he own nature can not save unrepentant sin from eternal retribution yet a adore god whose providence protect the faithful amid stormy vicissitude -- under the shadow of whose throne the saint have dwell secure spirit as gentle and kindly as parnell insist that the only approach to happiness lie through a religious discipline of the feeling and protest that death be not to be fear but welcome -- as the passage from a troublous existence to everlasting peace in most of the poetry of the time religion if at all noticeable be a mere undercurrent but whenever it rise to the surface it reflect the ancient creed traditional too be the general conception of human character man be still think of as a complex of lofty and mean quality widely variable in they proportion yet in no instance quite dissevered to interpret -- not god or nature -- but this self-contradictory be in both he higher and he lower manifestation and possibility remain the chief vocation of the poet they have not cease the endeavor to lend dignity to life by portray its nobler feature addison in _ the campaign _ glorify the national hero whose brilliant victory thwart the great monarch of france on he seemingly invincible career toward the hegemony of europe the warrior marlborough serene of soul amid the horror and confusion of battle tickell in he noble elegy on addison not only while voice he

the art of virtuous life pope in the most ambitious literary effort of the day he translation of the _ iliad _ labor to enrich the treasury of english poetry with a epic that shed radiance upon the ideal and manners of a heroic age in such attempt to exalt the grander phase of human existence the poet be however owe to they fear of enthusiasm never quite successful it be significant that though most critic consider pope 's homer no better than a mediocre performance none deny that he _ rape of the lock _ be in its kind perfection here as in the _ ver de société _ of matthew prior and ambrose philip the age be illuminate with the grace of poetry something it really understand and delighted in -- the life of leisure and fashion and here accordingly be its most original and masterly work _ the rape of the lock _ be the product of a society which have the good sense and good breeding to try to laugh away incipient quarrel and which greet with airy banter the indiscreet act of a enamoured young gallant -- the kind of act which vulgarity meet with angry lampoon or rude violence the poem be a idyll quite as much as a satire the folly of fashionable life be treat with nothing severer than light raillery and its actually distasteful feature -- its lapse into stupidity its vacuous restlessness its ennui -- be cunningly suppress but all that make it seem the height of human felicity be preserve and enhance in charm launch on the bosom of the silver thame one glide to hampton court amid youth and gayety and melting music and for the nonce this realm of air flounce and furbelow of merry chit-chat and of pleasurable excitement seem as important as it be to those exquisite creature of fancy that hover about the heroine assiduous guardian of she graceful ease and sweetness void of pride of that admire world likewise be the lover that matthew prior create who woo neither with stormy passion nor with mawkish whining but in a courtly manner lover who deem a epigram a finer tribute than a sigh so the tender fondness of a middle-aged man for a infant be elevated above the commonplace by assume the tone of playful gallantry the ignobler aspect of life -- nutriment of the comic sense -- be not ignore the new school of poet however deficient in the higher vision be keen observer of actuality and among they the satiric spirit though not militant as in the day of dryden be still active the value which they attach to social culture be again show in the persistence of the sentiment that as man grow in civility he become less ridiculous the peccadillo of the upper class they treat with comparatively gentle humor and aim they stroke of satire chiefly against the lower rarely do they idealize humble folk : gay 's _ sweet william 's farewett to black-eyed susan _ be in this respect exceptional they typical attitude be see in he _ shepherd 's week _ with its ludicrous picture of rustic superstition and naive amorousness and in allan ramsay 's _ gentle shepherd _ where the pastoral once remote from life assume the manners and dialect of the countryside in order to arouse laughter the obvious fact that these poet center they attention upon man particularly in he social life and that they most memorable production be upon that theme lead posterity to complain that they wholly lack interest in nature be incapable of delineate it and do not feel its sacred influence the last point in the indictment -- and the last only -- be quite true no one who understand and believe as they do the doctrine of orthodoxy could consistently ascribe divinity to nature to they nature exhibit the power of god but not he will and the soul of man gain its clearest moral light directly from a _ super_natural source this do not however imply that nature be negligible the celebrated essay of addison on the pleasure of the imagination -lrb- _ spectator _ no 411-414 -rrb- base those pleasure upon the grandeur of nature upon its variety and freshness as of grove field and meadow in the opening of the spring and upon its beauty of form and color the work of nature declare addison surpass those of art and accordingly we always find the poet in love with a country life such be the theory the practice be not out of accord therewith passage appreciative of the lovelier aspect of nature and not despite the current preference for general rather than specific term inaccurate as description be write between 1700 and 1726 by addison himself pope lady winchilsea gay parnell dyer and many other nature worshipper they be not nature lover they can be justly style -- if such love may discriminate between the beautiful and the ugly aspect of the natural it be characteristic that berkeley in he _ prospect of plant art and learn in america _ do not indulge the fancy that the wilderness be of itself uplift it require he assume the aid of human culture and wisdom -- the rise of empire and of art -- to develop its potentiality a generation which placidly adhere to the orthodox sentiment of its predecessor be of course not move to revolutionize poetical theory or form its theory be authoritatively state in pope 's _ essay on criticism _ they embrace principle of good sense and mature taste which be easier to condemn than to confute or supersede in poetical diction the age cultivate clearness propriety and dignity : it reject word so minutely particular as to suggest pedantry or specialization and it refuse to sacrifice simple appropriateness to inaccurate vigor of utterance or meaningless beauty of sound its favorite measure the decasyllabic couplet mould by jonson sandy waller denham and dryden it accept reverently as a heirloom not to be essentially altered but to be polish until it shine more brightly than ever pope perfect this form make it at once more artistic and more natural he discountenance on the one hand run-on line alexandrine hiatus and sequence of monosyllable on the other the resort to expletive and the mechanical placing of caesura if he verse do not move with the long resounding pace of dryden at he best it have a movement better suit to the drawing-room : it be what oliver wendell holme term the straight-backed measure with the stately stride thus in form as in substance the poetry of the period voice the mood not of carefree youth nor yet of vehement early manhood but of still vigorous middle age -- a phase of existence perhaps less ingratiating than other but one which have its rightful hour in the life of the race as of the individual the sincere and artistic expression of its feeling will be deny poetical validity only by those whose capacity for appreciate the variety of poetry be limit by they lack of experience or by narrowness of sympathetic imagination ii orthodoxy and classicism assail -lrb- 1726-1750 -rrb- during the second quarter of the century pope and he group remain dominant in the realm of poetry but they mood be no longer pacific they work show a grow seriousness and acerbity partly the change be owe to disappointment : life have not become so highly culture literature have not prosper so much nor display so broad a diffusion of intelligence and taste as have be expect pope 's _ dunciad epistle to dr arbuthnot _ and ironic satire on the state of literature under augustus -lrb- george ii the snuffy old drone from the german hive -rrb- brilliantly express this indignation with the intellectual and literary shortcoming of the time a cause of the change of mood which be to be of more lasting consequence than the failure of the age to put the traditional ideal more generally into practice be the appearance of a distinctly new ideal -- one which undermine the very foundation of the old this new spirit may be term sentimentalism in prose literature it have already be stir for about twenty-five year change the tone of comedy enter into some of the periodical essay and assume a philosophic character in the work of lord shaftesbury its chief doctrine rhapsodically promulgate by this amiable and original enthusiast be that the universe and all its creature constitute a perfect harmony and that man owe to he innate moral and aesthetic sense need no supernatural revelation of religious or ethical truth because if he will discard the prejudice of tradition he will instinctively when face to face with nature recognize the spirit which dwell therein -- and correspondingly when in the presence of a good deed he will recognize its morality in other word god and nature be one and man be instinctively good he cardinal virtue be the love of humanity he true religion the love of nature be therefore of good cheer : evil merely appear to exist sin be a figment of false psychology lead mankind to return to the natural and they will find happiness the poetical possibility of sentimentalism be not grasp by any noteworthy poet before thomson _ the season _ be a innovation and its novelty lay not so much in the choice of the subject as in the interpretation didactic as well as descriptive it be design not merely to present realistic picture but to arouse certain explicitly state thought and feeling thomson have absorb some of shaftesbury 's idea such sketch as that of the hardship which country folk suffer in winter contrast with the thoughtless gayety of city reveler and inculcate the lesson of sympathy be precisely in the vein that sentimentalism encourage so too the tendency of shaftesbury to deify nature appear in several ardent passage the choice of blank verse as the medium of this liberal and expansive train of thought be appropriate it should not be suppose however that thomson accept sentimentalism in its entirety or fully understand its ultimate bearing the author of _ rule britannium _ praise many thing -- like commerce and industry and imperial power -- that be not favor by the thorough sentimentalist often he be inconsistent : he _ hymn to nature _ be in part a pantheistic rhapsody in part a monotheistic hebrew psalm essentially a indolent though receptive mind he make no effort to trace the new idea to they consequence he vaguely consider they not irreconcilable with the old a keener mind fall into the same error pope in the _ essay on man _ try to harmonize the orthodox conception of human character with sentimental optimism as a collection of those memorable half-truth call aphorism the poem be admirable as a attempt to unite new half-truth with old into a consistent scheme of life it be fallacious no creature compose of such war element as pope describe in the superb antithesis that open epistle ii can ever become in this world as good and at the same time as happy as epistle iv vainly assert pope charge with heresy do not repeat this endeavor to console mankind he return to he proper element satire but he effort to unite the new philosophy with the old psychology be striking evidence of the attractiveness and grow vogue of shaftesbury 's theory it be minor poet who first express sentimental idea without inconsistency as early as 1732 anonymous line in the _ gentleman 's magazine _ advance what must have seem the outrageously paradoxical thought that the savage in the wilderness be happier than civilized man two year later soame jenyn openly assail in verse the orthodox doctrine of sin and retribution these have long be assail in prose and under the influence of the attack within the pale of the church itself some minister have suppress or modify the sterner aspect of the creed -- a movement which young 's satire have ridicule in the person of a lady of fashion who gladly entertain the notion that the deity be too well-bred to call a lady to account for she offens jenyn versify this effeminization of christianity charge orthodoxy with attribute cruelty to god and assert that faith in divine and human kindness would banish all wrong and discord from the world in 1735 a far more important poet of sentimentalism arise in henry brooke a undeservedly neglect pioneer who likewise draw he inspiration from shaftesbury develop its theory with unusual consistency and fullness he _ universal beauty _ voice he sense of the divine immanence in every part of the cosmos and emphasize the doctrine that animal because they unhesitatingly follow the prompting of nature be more lovely happy and moral than man who should learn from they the individual and social virtue abandon artificial civilization and follow instinct brooke in the prologue of he _ gustavus vas _ show that he foresee the political bearing of this theory it be in he opinion peculiarly a people guiltless of court untainted and unread that illumine by nature understand and uphold freedom : but this be a think too advance to be general at this time even among brooke 's fellow-sentimentalist though sentimental literature bear the seed of revolution its earliest effect upon its devotee be to create through flattery of human character a feeling of good-natured complacency against this optimism the traditional school react in two way -- derisive and hortatory pope young and swift satirize with masterful skill the inherent weakness and folly of mankind the vigor of they stroke draw from the sentimentalist whitehead the feeble but significant protest _ on ridicule _ deprecate satire as discourage to benevolence on the other hand wesley 's hymn fervently summon to repentance and piety while young 's _ night thought _ yield to the new influence only in its form -lrb- blank verse -rrb- reassert the hollowness of earthly existence the justice of god 's stern will and the need of faith in heavenly immortality as the only adequate satisfaction of the spiritual element in man the literary power of pope swift and young be far superior to those of the opposed school which might have be overborne have not a second generation of sentimentalist arise to voice its claim in a more poetical manner these newcomer -- akenside jg cooper the warton and collin -- all of they very young appear between 1744 and 1747 and each render distinct service to they common cause the least original of the group john gilbert cooper versify in _ the power of harmony _ shaftesbury 's cosmogony more independently mark akenside develop out of the same doctrine of universal harmony the theory of aesthetics that be to guide the school -- the theory that the true poet be create not by culture and discipline at all but owe to the impress of nature -- that beauty which be goodness -- he imagination he taste and he moral vision though comparatively ardent and free in manner akenside pursue the customary didactic method less abstract more nearly a utterance of personal feeling be joseph warton 's _ enthusiast or the lover of nature _ historically a remarkable poem which through its expression of the author 's taste and preference indicate briefly some of the most important touchstone of the sentimentalism -lrb- _ videlicet _ romanticism -rrb- of the future warton find odious such thing as artificial garden commercial interest social and legal convention and a formal addisonian style he yearn for mountainous wild unspoiled savage solitude where the voice of wisdom be hear above the storm and poetry that be wildly warble he younger brother thoma who write _ the pleasure of melancholy _ and sonnet show a interest in non-classical antiquity likewise feel the need of new literary god to sanction the practice of they school : pope and dryden be accordingly dethrone spenser shakespeare and the young milton all of whom be believe to warble wildly be invoke william collin be the most gifted of this band of enthusiast he general view be theirs : poetry be in he mind associate with wonder and ecstacy and it find its true theme as the _ ode on popular superstition _ show in the weird legend the pathetic mischance and the blameless manners of a simple-minded folk remote from city unlike he fellow collin have moment of great lyric power and give posterity a few treasured poem he further distinction be that he desire really to create that poetical world about which akenside theorize and for which the warton yearn unhappily however he too often people it with allegorical figure who move in a hazy atmosphere and he melody be then more apparent than he mean the hopeful spirit of these enthusiast find little encouragement in the poem with which the period close -- gray 's _ ode on eton _ and _ hymn to adversity _ and johnson 's _ vanity of human wish _ some bold adventurer disdain the limit of they little reign write gray add with the wisdom of disillusion gay hope be theirs by fancy fed less please when possess he be speak of schoolboy whose ignorance be bliss but the general tenor of he mind allow we to surmise that he also smile pityingly upon some of the aspiration of the youthful sentimentalist dr johnson 's hostility to they be of course outspoken he laugh uproariously at they ecstatic manner and ridicule the cant of sensibility and in solemn mood he strike in _ the vanity of human wish _ another blow at the heresy of optimism in style the contrast between these poem and those of the warton and collin be marked heir of the augustan johnson and gray have perfect control over they respective diction and metre : here be no obscurity or false note johnson sustain with superb dignity the tone of moral grandeur gray be ever felicitous up to the mid-century then despite assailant the classical school hold its supremacy for its literary art be incomparably more skillful than that of its enemy iii the progress of sentimentalism -lrb- 1751-1775 -rrb- during the 1750 's sentimental poetry do not fulfill the expectation which the outburst of 1744 have seem to promise it sink to lower level and its production be noteworthy only as sign of the time and presage of the future richard jago write some bald verse intend to foster opposition to hunting and love for the lower animal -- accord to the sentimental view really the little brother of man john dalton 's crude _ descriptive poem _ apostrophize what be regard as the savage grandeur of the lake country it be interesting only because it mention keswick borrowdale lodore and skiddaw half a century later to become sacred ground the practical dilemma of the sentimentalist -- draw toward solitude by he worship of nature and toward society by he love for man -- be describe by whitehead in _ the enthusiast _ the humanitarian impulse be finally give the preference though the last of these piece be not contemptible in style none of these writer have sufficient ardor to compel attention and if sentimentalism have not be steadily disseminate through other literary form especially the novel it might well have be regard as a lose cause the great poet of this decade be gray whose _ elegy write in a country churchyard _ by many hold the noblest english lyric appear in 1751 he classical ideal of style accord to which poetry should have in he word extreme conciseness of expression yet be pure perspicuous and musical be realize both in the _ elegy _ and in the otherwise very different _ pindaric ode _ the ethical and religious implication of the _ elegy _ its piety its sense of the frailty as well as the merit of mankind be conservative nor be there in the _ pindaric ode _ any violation of classical principle gray never deviate into a pantheistic faith a belief in human perfection a conception of poetry as instinctive imagination unrestrained or any other essential tenet of sentimentalism yet the influence of the new spirit upon he may be discern it modify he choice of subject and slightly color they interpretation without cause he to abandon the classical attitude the _ elegy _ treat with reverence what the augustan have neglect -- the tragic dignity of obscure life _ the progress of poesy _ emphasize quality -lrb- emotion and sublimity -rrb- which the _ essay on criticism _ have not stressed and _ the bard _ present a wildly picturesque figure of ancient day gray feel that classicism might quicken its spirit and widen its interest without surrender its principle that a classical poem might be a popular poem and the admiration of posterity support he belief a astounding and epochal event be the publication -lrb- 1760 ff -rrb- of the poem attribute to ossian they editor and translator jame macpherson author of a forget sentimental epic allege that ossian be a gaelic poet of the third century ad who sing the love and war of the hero of he people brave warrior fight the imperial legion of rome and that he poem have be orally transmit until now fifteen century later they have be take down from the lip of scotch peasant it be a fabrication as ingenious as brazen as a matter of fact macpherson have find only a insignificant portion of he extensive work in popular ballad and what little he have find he have expand and change out of all semblance to genuine ancient legend both the guide motive of he prose-poem -lrb- it be he as truly as _ king lear _ be shakespeare 's -rrb- and the furore of welcome which greet it may be understand by recall the position of the sentimental school on the eve of its appearance the sentimentalist be maintain that civilization have corrupt taste moral and poetry that it have pervert man from he instinctive goodness and that only by a return to communion with nature could humanity and poetry be redeem but all this be base merely on philosophic theory and could find no confirmation in history or literature : history know of no innocent savage and even as unsophisticated literature as homer be then suppose to be disclose no hero perfect in the sentimental virtue _ ossian _ appear and the truth of sentimentalism seem historically establish for here be poetry of the loftiest tone compose in the unlearned dark age and answer the highest expectation concern poetry inspire by nature only -lrb- be not a distinguished professor of rhetoric say ossian 's poetry more perhaps than that of any other writer deserve to be style the poetry of the heart -rrb- and here be the record of a nature-people whose conduct stand reveal as flawless fingal macpherson himself accommodatingly point out exercise every manly virtue in caledonium while heliogabalus disgraced human nature in rome more than fifty year afterwards byron compare homer 's hector greatly to he disadvantage with ossian 's fingal : the latter 's conduct be in he admirer 's word uniformly illustrious and great without one mean or inhuman action to tarnish the splendor of he fame the benevolent magnanimity of the hero the sweet sensibility of the heroine they harmony with nature 's mood -lrb- trait which macpherson have supply from he own imagination -rrb- be the very trait that win the enthusiasm of the public the poem in its turn stimulate the sentimentalism which have produce it and henceforth the new school contend on even term with the old one of the effect of the progress of sentimentalism be the decline of satire peculiarly the weapon of the classical school it have fall into unskillful hand : churchill though keen and bold lack the grace of pope and the power of johnson goldsmith might have prove a worthier successor but though he genius for style be large he capacity for sustained indignation be limit even he _ retaliation _ be humorous in spirit rather than satiric he be a being of conflict impulse and in he case at least the style be not precisely the man he temperament be emotional and affectionate by nature he be a sentimentalist but he inclination be restrain partly by the personal influence of dr johnson partly by he own admiration for the artistic tradition of the classicist he despise looseness of style consider blank verse unfinished and cultivate what seem to he the more polished elegance of the heroic couplet the vacillation of he view appear in the difference between the sentiment of _ the traveller _ and those of _ the desert village _ the former be a survey of the nation of europe the object be to discover a people wholly admirable merit be find in italian swiss french dutch and english -- but never perfection even the free and happy swiss be disgust in the vulgar sensuality of they pleasure happiness be nowhere one be not surprise to learn that dr johnson contribute at least a few line to a poem with so orthodox a message in _ the desert village _ on the other hand goldsmith employ the classical grace to point a moral which from the classical point of view be false he sympathetic feeling have now be captivate by the notion of rural innocence the trait of character which he attribute to the village inhabitant -- notably to the immortal preacher who entertain the vagrant quite forget they vice in they woe -- be those exalt in the literature of sentimentalism as for example in he contemporary langhorne 's _ country justice _ _ the desert village _ be in point of fact a imaginative idyll -- the supreme idyll of english poetry but goldsmith insist that it be a realistic record of actual condition yet he could never have observe such a english village either in its depopulate and decay state -lrb- as macaulay have remark -rrb- or in its rosy prosperity and unsullied virtue he economic history and theory be mislead like macpherson but through self-delusion rather than intent he be engage in a effort to deceive by give sentimental doctrine a basis of apparent actuality but the world have forget or forgive he pious fraud in its gratitude for the loveliness of he art iv the triumph of sentimentalism -lrb- 1776-1800 -rrb- goldsmith 's application of sentimental idea to contemporary affair foreshadow what be to be one of the marked tendency of the movement in the last quarter of the century thus in 1777 thoma day interpret the american revolution as a conflict between the pitiless tyranny of a corrupt civilization and the appealing virtue of a people who have find in sequestered forest and prairie the abide place of freedom and the only remain opportunity to save the ruin of the human name at the same time the justification of sentimentalism on historical grounds be strengthen by the young antiquarian and poet thoma chatterton like macpherson he answer to pope 's description of archaize author -- ancient in word mere modern in they sense he fabricate in what he think to be middle english a body of song and interlude which he attribute to a monk name thoma rowleie and which show that in the supposedly unsophisticated simplicity of medieval time charity to man and love for nature have flourish as beautifully as lyric utterance even more lamentable than chatterton 's early death be the fact that he fanciful and musical genius be shroud in so grotesque a style in 1781 appear a new poet of real distinction george crabbe now the hope of the conservative edmund burke who early in he great career have assail the radical in he ironic _ vindication of natural society _ and who to the end of he life contend against they in the arena of politics on read some of crabbe 's manuscript rescue this culture and ingenuous man from obscurity and distress and dr johnson presently aid he in he literary labor in _ the library _ crabbe express the reverence of a scholarly soul for the garner wisdom of the past and satirize some of the popular writings of the day include sentimental fiction he would not have deny the world those consolation which flow from the literature that mirror we hope and dream but he honest spirit revolt when such literature profess to be true to life he acquaintance with actual condition in humble circle and with hardship be as personal as goldsmith 's but he be not the kind of poet who soothe the misery of mankind by ignore they in _ the village _ he arise with all the vigor and intensity of insult common sense to refute the dreamer who offer a rose-colored picture of country life as a genuine portrayal of truth and nature so evident be he mastery of he subject he clearness of perception and he earnestness of feeling that he attract immediate attention and he might well have lead a new advance under the ancient standard but silence fall upon crabbe for many year and this prove to be the last occasion in the poetical history of the century that a powerful voice be raise in behalf of the old cause the poet who become the favorite of moderate sentimentalist in what be call genteel circle be william cowper he present little or nothing that could affright the gentle emotion and much that pleasurably stimulate they he enrich the poetry of the domestic affection and have a vein of sadness which occasionally as in _ to mary _ deepen into the most touching pathos in _ the task _ a discursive familiar essay in smooth-flowing blank verse he dwell fondly upon those satisfaction which he life of uneventful retirement offer intimate that truth and wisdom be less surely find by pore upon book than by meditate among beloved rural scene and turn he sad gaze toward the distant world of action deplore that mankind strain the natural bond of brotherhood by tolerate cruel imprisonment slavery and warfare such humanitarian view when they seek the aid of religious ethic ought normally to find support in that sentimentalize christianity which profess the entire goodness of the human heart but the discordant element in cowper 's mind be he inclination towards calvinism which go to the opposite extreme by insist on total depravity personally he believe that he have commit the unpardonable sin -lrb- against the holy spirit -rrb- -- a dreadful thought which underlie he tragic poem _ the castaway _ and probably unwholesome though well-intentioned be the influence upon he of he spiritual adviser john newton whose gloomy theology may be see in the hymn _ the vision of life in death _ cowper 's sense of the reality of evil not only distract he mind to madness but also prevent he from carry he sentimental principle to they logical goal what the hour demand be poet who discountenance any mistrust of the natural emotion should give they free rein they be find at last in burn and in blake the sentimentalist have long yearn for the advent of the ideal poet macpherson have present he -- but as of a era far remote latterly beattie in _ the minstrel _ have set forth he growth under the inspiration of nature -- but in a purely imaginary tale suddenly burn appear : and the ideal seem incarnate in the living present the scottish bard be introduce to the world by he first admirer as a heaven-taught ploughman of humble unlettered station whose simple strain artless and unadorned seem to flow without effort from the native feeling of the heart and as a signal instance of true and uncultivated genius the real burn though indeed a genius of song be far better read than the expectant world wish to believe particularly in those whom he call he bosom favorite the sentimentalist mackenzie and sterne and he sense of rhythm and melody have be train by he emulation of earlier scotch lyricist whose lilting cadence flow towards he as highland rill to the gathering torrent sing to the note of he native tune and infuse with the local color of scotch life the sentimental theme assume the freshness of novelty give a new ardor to revolutionary tendency -- burn revolt against the orthodoxy of the auld licht depict its representative as ludicrously hypocritical he protest against distinction found on birth or rank as in _ a man 's a man for a ' that _ and on the other hand he idealized the homely feeling and manners of the virtuous populace in he immortal _ cotter 's Saturday night _ he scorn academic learning and protest that true inspiration be rather to be find in ae spark o ' nature 's fire -- or at the nearest tavern : leese I on drink it gie we mair than either school or college like sterne who boast that he pen govern he burn praise and affect the impromptu : but how the subject theme may gang let time or chance determine perhaps it may turn out a sing perhaps turn out a sermon he muse be to be the mood of the moment herein he bring to fulfillment the sentimental desire for the liberation of the emotion but he work take as a whole can scarcely be say to vindicate the faith that the emotion once free would manifest instinctive purity at he almost unrivalled best he can sing in the sweetest strain the rapture or pathos of innocent youthful love as in _ sweet afton _ or _ to mary in heaven _ but straightway sinking from that elevation of feel to the depths of vulgarity or grossness he will chant with equal zest and skill the indulgence of the animal appetite -lrb- 1 -rrb- he hail the joy of life but without discriminate between the higher and the lower yet these exuberant animal spirit which unrestrained by conscience or taste drive he too often into scurrility give he work that passion -- warm throb and personal -- which have be painfully want in earlier poet of sensibility it be he emotional intensity as well as he lyric genius that make he the most popular poet of he time in burn sentimentalism be largely temperamental unreflective and concrete in william blake the singularity of whose work long retard its due appreciation sentimentalism be likewise temperamental but unconfined to actuality become far broader in scope more spiritual and more consistently philosophic indeed blake be the ultimate sentimentalist of the century a visionary and symbolist he pass beyond shaftesbury in he thought and beyond any poet of the school in he endeavor to create a new and appropriate style he contemporary erasmus darwin author of _ the botanic garden _ be try to give sentimentalism a novel interpretation by describe the life of plant in term of human life but darwin be destitute of artistic sense the result be grotesque blake by training and vocation a engraver be primarily a artist but partly under swedenborgian influence he have grasp the innermost character of sentimentalism perceive all its implication and carry they fearlessly to they utmost bound to he every atom of the cosmos be literally spiritual and holy the divine and the human the soul and the flesh be absolutely one god and man be only two aspect of pervasive mercy pity peace and love nothing else have genuine reality the child its vision be as yet unclouded by false teaching see the universe thus truly and blake therefore in _ song of innocence _ give glimpse of the world as the child see it -- a guileless existence amid the peace that pass all understand he hymn the sanctity of animal life : even the tiger conventionally a incarnation of cruelty be a glorious creature of divine mould to slay or cage a beast be the _ augury of innocence _ protest to incur anathema the _ book of thel _ allegorically show the mutual interdependence of all creation and reprehend the maiden shyness that shrink from merge its life in the sacrificial union which sustain the whole to blake the great enemy of truth be the cold logical reason a truncate part of man 's spirit which be incapable of attain wisdom and which have fabricate those false notion that govern the practical world and constrain the natural feeling instance of the unhappiness cause by such constraint he give in _ song of experience _ where _ the garden of love _ describe the blight curse which church law have lay upon free love to overthrow intellectualism and discipline man must liberate he most precious faculty the imagination which alone can reveal the spiritual character of the universe and the beauty that life will wear when the feeling cease to be unnaturally confine temporarily blake rejoice when the french revolution seem to usher in the millennium of freedom and peace and he interpretation of its earlier incident in he poem on that theme -lrb- 2 -rrb- illustrate in style and spirit the highly original nature of he mind more than any predecessor he understand how the peculiarly poetical possibility of sentimentalism might be elicit namely by emphasize its mystical quality thus under he guidance mysticism which in the early seventeenth century have sublimate the religious poetry of the orthodox return to sublimate the poetry of the radical and with that achievement the sentimental movement reach its climax burn die in 1796 blake lose in a realm of symbolism become unintelligible and temporarily sentimentalism suffer a reaction the french revolution with its reign of terror and the rise of a military autocrat though support even after great britain have take up arm against napoleon by some friend of humanity who place universal brotherhood above patriotism seem to the general public to demonstrate that the sentimental theory and hope be untrue to life and lead to result directly contrary to those predict once again in canning 's caustic satire of _ the anti-jacobin _ conservatism raise its voice but by this time sentimentalism be too fully develop and widely spread to be more than check under the new leadership of wordsworth coleridge and southey the movement chasten and modify by experience resume
