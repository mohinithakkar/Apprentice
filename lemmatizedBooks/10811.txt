the object of the christian brother in issue a new series of reader be to place in the hand of the teacher and pupil of we catholic school a set of book embody the matter and method best suit to they need the matter have be write or choose with a view to interest and instruct to cultivate a taste for the best literature to build up a strong moral character and to imbue we child with a intelligent love of faith and country the method be those approve by the most experienced and progressive teacher of reading in europe and america these reader have also be specially design to elicit thought and facilitate literary composition in furtherance of this idea class talk word study the structure of sentence drill on certain correct form of expression the proper arrangement of idea explanation of phrase and literary expression oral and written reproduction of narration and description and exercise in original composition all receive the attention which they importance demand thus will the pupil while learn to read and from they earliest year acquire that readiness in grasp the thought of other and that fluency in express they own which be so essential to a good english education in teach the art of reading as well as that of composition the principle of order should in a great measure determine the value of the method to be employ in the acquisition of knowledge the child instinctively follow the order of nature this order be first _ observation _ second _ think _ third _ expression _ it become the duty of the teacher consequently to lead the child to observe _ accurately _ to think _ clearly _ and to express he thought _ correctly _ and text-book be useful only in so far as they supply the teacher with the material and the system best calculate to accomplish such result it be therefore hope that the present new series of reader have be plan in accordance with the principle just enunciate will prove a valuable adjunct in we catholic school \* \* \* \* \* _ 3 _ introduction in this fifth reader of the de la salle series the plan of the precede number have be continue the pupil have now master the mechanical difficulty of learn to read and have acquire a fairly good work vocabulary hence he be prepare to read intelligently and with some degree of fluency and pleasure now be the time to lead he to acquire a taste for good read the selection have be draw mainly from author whose writings be distinguish for they moral and literary value and whose style be sure to excite a lasting interest in addition to give the pupil practice in reading and form a basis for oral and written composition work these selection will raise he idea of right living will quicken he imagination will give he he first knowledge of many thing stimulate he power of observation enlarge he vocabulary and correct and refine he mode of expression a wholesome reading habit so important to-day will thus be easily pleasantly and unconsciously form the follow be some of the feature of the book : guide to pronunciation -- this guide be to be refer to again and again and the diacritical mark carefully teach instruction in the vowel sound be a excellent drill in articulation while a knowledge of the diacritical mark enable the pupil to master these sound for himself when consult the dictionary variety of matter -- in the volume will be find the best sentiment of the best writer the pupil will find fable nature study tale of travel and adventure brave deed from history and fiction story of loyalty and heroism example of sublime christian self-sacrifice and selection that teach industry contentment respect for authority reverence for all thing sacred attachment to home and fidelity to faith and country language study -- if reading be to hold its proper place in the class room the teaching of it must not be confine to the mere reading of the text in its truest sense reading be far more comprehensive the teacher will question the pupil on what he have read point out to he the beauty of thought and language find out what hold the reading have take upon he memory how it have arouse he imagination assist he judgment direct he will and contribute to he fund of general information to assist in this most important work be the object aim at in the matter give for language study such study will also give fuller power of interpretation and corresponding appreciation of the selection consider simply as literature recitation -- there be some selection mark for recitation the public recitation of these extract will banish awkwardness of manner beget self-confidence and lay the foundation for subsequent elocutionary work besides experience teach that a single poem or address base upon some heroic or historic event recite before a class or a school will often do more to build up a noble character and foster a love of history than a full term of instruction by question and answer poetry -- the numerous poetic selection some of which be partly analyze by way of suggestion will create a love for the highest and purest form of literature will broaden the field of knowledge and emphasize the teaching of some of the prose selection many of they have be write by american author every american boy and girl should be acquaint with the work of poet who have do so much for the development of american literature and nationality memory gem -- the memorize of choice bit of prose and poetry enrich the vocabulary of the pupil adorn they memory suggest delicate and noble thought and put they in possession of sentence of the best construction the recitation of these expressive text accustom the child to speak with ease grace and elegance -lrb- element of practical pedagogy -rrb- biography -- young child enjoy literature for its own sake and take little interest in the personality of the writer but as they grow older pleasure in the work of a author arouse a interest in the writer himself brief biographical sketch be give at the close of the volume as help in the study of the author from whom selection be draw and to induce the pupil to read further \* \* \* \* \* _ 4 _ suggestion word study -- the pupil should know how to spell and pronounce correctly all the word of the selection he be prepare to read he should know they ordinary meaning and the special meaning they may have in the text he should be able to write they correctly from dictation and to use they in sentence of he own he should examine if they be primitive derivative or compound he should be able to name the prefix and suffix and show how the meaning of the original word be modify by they use he should cultivate the habit of word mastery what be read will not otherwise be understand without it there can be no good reading speaking or write expressive reading -- there should be constant drill to secure correct pronunciation distinct articulation proper emphasis and a agreeable tone of voice without which there can be no expressive reading this be a difficult task and will take much time trouble and practice but it have far-reaching result it enlarge the sympathy of the pupil and lay the foundation for a genuine love of literature do not then let the reading lesson drift into a dull and monotonous calling of word on the contrary let it be intelligent spirited enthusiastic emotion come largely from the imagination the pupil himself must be teach not only to feel what he read but to make its meaning clear to other it be important that child be teach to acquire think through the ear concert reading -- reading in concert be generally of little value and the time give to it ill-spent it do not aid the child in get thought or in express it fluently as a exercise in teaching reading it be ineffective and often positively harmful a concert recitation to which special training have be give partake of the nature of a hymn or a song and then become a element of value if occasionally there must be concert reading in the class room it should always be precede by individual mastery of the selection poem -- in the first lesson a poem like a picture should be present as a whole and never dissect the teacher should first read it through not stop for note or comment he should then read it again part by part stop for question explanation and discussion lastly the whole poem should be read with suitable emotion so that the final impression may be make by the author 's own word it be important that the pupil get the message which the author intend to give in teach a descriptive poem make the picture as vivid as possible and thus awaken the imagination in deal with a narrative poem the sequence of event must first be make clear when this be do the aim should be to give fuller meaning to the story by bring out clearly the cause motive and result of act all this will take time be it so one poem well read well study be worth more than a volume carelessly read over in read poetry be careful that the pupil while give the rhythm of the line do not fall into the singsong tone so common and so disagreeable explanation -- explanation should accompany every reading lesson without which there can be no serious teaching of the vernacular by they means the teacher enter into communication with he pupil he get they to speak he correct they error train they reason and form they taste it have be say that a teacher able to explain selection in prose and poetry hold he class in the hollow of he hand the teacher should insist that the pupil express himself clearly and correctly not only during the reading lesson but on every subject he have occasion to deal with either orally or in write throughout the day 's recitation review -- as the memory of child though prompt be weak frequent review should be hold they be necessary for the backward pupil and advantageous for the other have a informal talk with the child on what they have read what they have learn what they have like and what have interest they some important part of the prose and poetry previously study might during this exercise be re-read with profit composition -- continue oral and written composition the correct use of write language be best teach by select for composition subject-matter that deeply interest the child if persevere in this will secure a good strong idiomatic use of english if the word of a selection that have be study appear now and then in the child 's conversation or write it should be a matter for praise for this mean that new word have be add to they vocabulary and that the child have a new conception of beauty of thought and speech see that all write work be do neatly and legibly slovenly or careless habit should never be allow in any written work memory gem -- do not lose sight of the memory gem familiarize the pupil with they they value to the child lie more in future good result from they than in present good these treasure of thought will live in the memory and influence the daily life of the child who learn they by heart the dictionary -- the use of the dictionary be a necessary part of education it be a powerful aid in self-education its use will double the value of study in connection with reading and language every grammar school high school and college should be supply with several copy of a good unabridged dictionary and every pupil teach how to consult it and encourage to do so the dictionary should be the book of first and last and constant resort use of the library -- the teacher should endeavor to create a interest in those book from which the selection in the reader be take and in other of equal grade and quality encourage the child to take book from the library direct they in they choice encourage home read the reading of good book should be a part of regular school work otherwise little or no true progress can be make in speaking and write the best way to learn to speak and write good english be to read good english for additional suggestion as

divide among you arthur and winnie if i cut off a very thin slice for you and divide what be leave between you brother and sister will that be fair no that would not be at all fair grandpa why not do i not divide the cake accord to you advice do i not cut it into three part but one be larger than the other and they ought to have be exactly the same size then you think that if i have divide the cake into three equal part it would have be quite fair yes if you have do so i should have no cause to complain now norman let we suppose that i have three basket to send to a distance by three person shall i act fairly if i give each a basket to carry stop a minute grandpa i must think a little no it might not be fair for one of the basket might be a great deal larger than the other come norman i see that you be really begin to think but we will take care that the basket be all of the same size then it would be quite fair for each one to take a basket what if one be full of lead and the other

to the strength of those who have to bear they yes i see that clearly now put one more question to I grandpa and i will try to answer it properly this time well then my next question be this : if i want a man to dig for I and three person apply for the situation will it not be fair if i set they to work to try they and choose the one who do he task in the quickest time be they all to begin they work at the same time a very proper question norman : yes they shall all start together have one just as much ground to dig as another exactly the same and will each man have a good spade yes they

daffy-down-dilly be yet a little boy he mother send he away from he pleasant home and put he under the care of a very strict schoolmaster who go by the name of mr toil those who know he best affirm that this mr toil be a very worthy character and that he have do more good both to child and grown people than anybody else in the world nevertheless mr toil have a severe countenance he voice too be harsh and all he way seem very disagreeable to we friend daffy-down-dilly the whole day long this terrible old schoolmaster sit at he desk overlook the pupil or stalk about the room with a certain awful birch rod in he hand now come a rap over the shoulder of a boy whom mr toil have catch at play now he punish a whole class who be behindhand with they lesson and in short unless a lad choose to attend constantly to he book he have no chance of enjoy a quiet moment in the schoolroom of mr toil i can not bear it any longer say daffy-down-dilly to himself when he have be at school about a week i 'll run away and try to find my dear mother at any rate i shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as this old mr toil so the very next morning off start poor daffy-down-dilly and begin he ramble about the world with only some bread and cheese for he breakfast and very little pocket money to pay he expense but he have go only a short distance when he overtake a man of grave and sedate appearance who be trudge along the road at a moderate pace good-morning my fine little lad say the stranger whence do you come so early and whither be you go daffy-down-dilly hesitate a moment or two but finally confess that he have run away from school on account of he great dislike to mr toil and that he be resolve to find some place in the world where he should never see nor hear of the old schoolmaster again very well my little friend answer the stranger we will go together for i also have have a great deal to do with mr toil and should be glad to find some place where he name be never hear they have not go far when they pass a field where some haymaker be at work mow down the tall grass and spread it out in the sun to dry daffy-down-dilly be delighted with the sweet smell of the new-mown grass and think how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine under the blue sky and with the bird singing sweetly in the neighbor tree and bush than to be shut up in a dismal schoolroom learn lesson all day long and continually scold by mr toil but in the midst of these thought while he be stop to peep over the stone wall he start back catch hold of he companion 's hand and cry quick quick let we run away or he will catch we who will catch we ask the stranger mr toil the old schoolmaster answer daffy-down-dilly do not you see he among the haymaker do not be afraid say the stranger this be not mr toil the schoolmaster but a brother of he who be breed a farmer and people say he be the more disagreeable man of the two however he will not trouble you unless you become a laborer on the farm they go on a little farther and soon hear the sound of a drum and fife daffy-down-dilly besought he companion to hurry forward that they might not miss see the soldier quick step forward march shout a gruff voice little daffy-down-dilly start in great dismay and turn he eye to the captain of the company what should he see but the very image of old mr toil himself with a smart cap and feather on he head a pair of gold epaulet on he shoulder a lace coat on he back a purple sash round he waist and a long sword instead of a birch rod in he hand though he hold he head high and strut like a rooster still he look quite as ugly and disagreeable as when he be hear lesson in the schoolroom this be certainly old mr toil say daffy-down-dilly in a tremble voice let we run away for fear he will make we enlist in he company you be mistaken again my little friend reply the stranger very composedly this be not mr toil the schoolmaster but a brother of he who have serve in the army all he life people say he be a very severe fellow but you and i need not be afraid of he well well say daffy-down-dilly but if you please sir i do not want to see the soldier any more so the child and the stranger resume they journey and by and by they come to a house by the roadside where some people be make merry young man and rosy-cheeked girl with smile on they face be dance to the sound of a fiddle let we stop here cry daffy-down-dilly to he companion for mr toil will never dare to show he face where there be a fiddler and where people be dance and make merry we shall be quite safe here but these last word die away upon daffy-down-dilly 's tongue for happen to cast he eye on the fiddler whom should he behold again but the likeness of mr toil hold a fiddle bow instead of a birch rod oh dear whisper he turn pale it seem as if there be nobody but mr toil in the world who could have think of he play on a fiddle this be not you old schoolmaster say the stranger but another brother of he who be breed in france where he learn the profession of a fiddler he be ashamed of he family and generally call himself mr pleasure but he real name be toil and those who have know he best think he still more disagreeable than he brother pray let we go a little farther say daffy-down-dilly i do not like the look of this fiddler thus the stranger and little daffy-down-dilly go wander along the highway and in shady lane and through pleasant village and whithersoever they go behold there be the image of old mr toil he stand like a scarecrow in the cornfield if they enter a house he sit in the parlor if they peep into the kitchen he be there he make himself at home in every cottage and under one disguise or another steal into the most splendid mansion oh take I back -- take I back say poor little daffy-down-dilly bursting into tear if there be nothing but toil all the world over i may just as well go back to the schoolhouse yonder it be -- there be the schoolhouse say the stranger for though he and little daffy-down-dilly have take a great many step they have travel in a circle instead of a straight line come we will go back to school together there be something in he companion 's voice that little daffy-down-dilly now remembered and it be strange that he have not remember it sooner look up into he face behold there again be the likeness of old mr toil so the poor child have be in company with toil all day even while he be do he best to run away from he when daffy-down-dilly become better acquaint with mr toil he begin to think that he way be

sit in the shade of a large tree i have hear and read many wonderful story i will try to recall one say frank let I see well -- perhaps -- i think that the most wonderful story i have ever read be that of the solar system or the sun 's family solar system repeat philip that certainly sound hard enough to puzzle even a fairy please tell I all about it that i should find much too hard answer frank but i 'll try to tell you what little i know you see the sun there do not you -- the great shine sun do you think the sun move of course it move say philip i always see it in the morning when i be in the garden it rise first above the bush then over the tree and house by evening it have travel across the sky when it sink below the house and tree out of sight on the other side of the town now that be quite a mistake say frank you think that the sun be travel all that way along the sky whereas it be really we -- we on this big ball of earth -- who be move we be whirling around on the outer surface rush on at the rate -- let I think -- at the rate of more than one thousand mile a minute frank what do you mean cry philip i mean that the earth be move many time faster than a ball move when shoot from the mouth of a cannon do you expect I to believe that frank i can hardly believe that this big solid earth move at all but to think of it with all the city town and people whirling round and round faster than a ball from the mouth of a cannon while we never feel that it stir one inch -- this be much harder to believe than all that the fairy have ever tell we yes but it be quite true for all that reply frank i have learn much about the motion of the planet and view the star one night through a telescope as i look through this instrument the star appear to I much larger than ever before the earth be a planet and there be besides we earth seven large planet and many small one which also whirl around the sun some of these planet be larger than we world some of they also move much faster the sun be in the middle with the planet move around he the one nearest to the sun be mercury it must be hot there cry philip i dare say that if we be in mercury we should be scorch to ash but if creature live on that planet god have give they a different nature from ours so that they may enjoy what would be dreadful to we the next planet to mercury be venus venus be sometimes see shine so bright after sunset then she be call the evening star some of the time a little before sunrise she may be see in the east she be then call the morning star venus can never be a evening star and a morning star at the same time of the year if you be watch she this evening before or after sundown there be no use get up early to-morrow to look for she again for several week venus remain a evening star then gradually disappear two month later you may see she in the east -- a bright morning star we earth be the third planet and mar be the fourth from the sun now let we make a drawing of what we have be talk about first open the compass one inch describe a circle and make a dot on its circumference name it mercury write on this circle eighty-eight day this show the time it take mercury to travel around the sun make another circle three and one-half inch in diameter and make a dot on it this represent venus it take venus two hundred twenty-five day to journey around the sun the next circle we have to draw be a very interesting one to we the compass must be open two and one-half inch the path make represent the journey we take in three hundred sixty-five day one more circle must be draw to complete we little plan this circle must be eight inch in diameter you see mar be much farther from the sun than we earth be it take he six hundred eighty-seven day to make the trip around the sun the other planet be too far away to be put in this plan o frank you have miss the biggest of all -- the moon say philip o no no exclaimed frank the moon be quite a little ball it be less than seven thousand mile around she while we earth be twenty-five thousand mile around be that a little ball frank yes compare with the sun and the planet the moon be what be call a satellite -- that be a servant or a attendant she be a satellite of we earth she keep circle round and round we earth while we go circle round and round the sun how fast the moon must travel if i be to go rush round a field and a bird should keep fly around my head you see that the movement of the bird would be much quicker than mine i can not understand it frank say philip the moon always look so quiet in the sky if she be dart about like lightning why be it that she scarcely seem to move more than a inch in ten minute i suppose say frank after a thoughtful silence that what to we seem a inch in the sky be really many mile you know how very fast the steam car seem to go when one be quite near they yet i have see a train of car far off which seem to go so slowly that i could fancy it be paint on the sky yes that must be the reason but how do people find out these curious thing about the sun and the star -- to know how large they be and how fast they go ask philip that be something we shall understand when we be older say frank we must gain a little knowledge every day be the earth the only planet that have a moon ask philip mercury and venus have no moon mar have two and jupiter have four but we can see they only when we look through a telescope reply frank be all the twinkling star which one see on a fine clear night planet inquire philip those that twinkle be not planet they be fix star say frank a planet do not twinkle it have no light of its own it shine just as the moon shine because the sun give it light but we earth do not shine say philip indeed it do explain frank we earth appear to venus and mar as a shine planet there must be many more fixed star than planet then for almost every star that i can see twinkle and sparkle like a diamond do these fix star all go around the sun ask philip o philip have not you notice that they be call fixed star to show that they do not move like planet the word _ planet _ mean to _ wander _ these fix star be sun themselves which may have planet of they own they be so very far away that we can not know much about they except that they shine of themselves just as we sun do we know that we sun give light and heat to the planet and satellite with which he be surround we know that without he warm ray there would not be any flower or bird or any live thing on the earth so we can easily imagine that all other sun be shine in the

come from england but he father be dead now he mother be very poor but there be still a few beautiful picture on the wall of she house the little boy like to copy these picture but as he be not fond of work he often throw he drawing away before they be half do he say that he wish that some good fairy would finish they for he child say he mother i do not believe that there be any fairy i never see

do you keep look at they child but the boy could only say i do not know mother you do not know nor i neither why child you look at the dumb thing as if you love they put on you cap and run out to play so the boy wander off into the forest till he come to the brink of a little sheet of water it be too small to be call a lake but it be deep and clear and be overhang with tall tree it be evening and the sun be get low the boy stand still beside the water and think how beautiful it be to see the sun red and glorious between the black trunk of the pine tree then he look up at the great blue sky and think how beautiful it be to see the little cloud folding over one another like a belt of rose-colored wave then he look at the lake and see the cloud and the sky and the tree all reflect there down among the lily and he wish that he be a painter for he say to himself i be sure there be no tree in the world with such beautiful leaf as these pine i be sure there be no cloud in the world so lovely as these i know this be the prettiest little lake in the world and if i could paint it every one else would know it too but he have nothing to paint with so he pick a lily and sit down with it in he hand and try very hard to make a correct drawing of it but he could not make a very good picture at last he throw down he draw and say to the lily : you be too beautiful to draw with a pencil how i wish i be a painter as he say these word he feel the flower move he look and the cluster of stamen at the bottom of the lily-cup glitter like a crown of gold the dewdrop which hang upon the stamen change to diamond before he eye the white petal flow together and the next moment a beautiful little fairy stand on he hand she be no taller than the lily from which she come and she be dress in a robe of the purest white child be you happy she ask no say the boy in a low voice because i want to paint and i can not how do you know that you can not ask the fairy oh i have try a great many time it be of no use to try any more but i will help you oh say the boy then i might succeed i hear you wish and i be willing to help you say the fairy i know a charm which will give you success but you must do exactly as i tell you do you promise to obey spirit of a water lily say the boy i promise with all my heart go home then say the fairy and you will find a little key on the doorstep take it up and carry it to the nearest pine tree strike the trunk with it and a keyhole will appear do not be afraid to unlock the door slip in you hand and you will bring out a magic palette you must be very careful to paint with color from that palette every day on this depend the success of the charm you will find that it will make you picture beautiful and full of grace if you do not break the spell i promise you that in a few year you shall be able to paint this lily so well that you will be satisfied and that you shall become a truly great painter can it be possible say the boy and the hand on which the fairy stand tremble for joy it shall be so if only you do not break the charm say the fairy but lest you forget what you owe to I and as you grow older even begin to doubt that you have ever see I the lily you gather to-day will never fade till my promise be fulfil the boy raise he eye and when he look again there be nothing in he hand but the flower he arise with the lily in he hand and go home at once there on the doorstep be the little key and in the pine tree he find the magic palette he be so delighted with it and so afraid that he might break the spell that he begin to work that very night after that he spend nearly all he time work with the magic palette he often pass whole day beside the sheet of water in the forest he paint it when the sun shone on it and it be spot all over with the reflection of fleeting white cloud he paint it cover with water lily rock on the ripple he paint it by moonlight when but two or three star in the empty sky shine down upon it and at sunset when it lay tremble like liquid gold so the year pass and the boy grow to be a man he have never break the charm the lily have never fade and he still work every day with he magic palette but no one care for he picture even he mother do not like they he forest and misty hill and common cloud be too much like the real one she say she could see as good any day by look out of she window all this make the young man very unhappy he begin to doubt whether he should ever be a painter and one day he throw down he palette he think the fairy have desert he he throw himself on he bed it grow dark and he soon fall asleep but in the middle of the night he awake with a start he chamber be full of light and he fairy friend stand near shall i take back my gift she ask oh no no no he cry he be

find that my feeling have nearly betray I in the warmth of my recitation the word ` christian ' escape my lip instead of ` philosopher ' and ` faith ' instead of ` truth ' at the first mistake i see cassianus start at the second i see a tear glisten in he eye as bend affectionately towards I he say in a whisper ` beware my child there be sharp ear listen ' what then interrupt the mother be cassianus a christian i choose he school because it be in the highest repute for learning and morality and now indeed i thank god that i do so but in these day of danger we be oblige to live as

wherefore he be the strongest but unfortunately the dullest boy in the school but this you know be not he fault only i know not why he seem ever to have have a grudge against I the cause of which i can not understand do he say aught to you or do yes and be the cause of my delay for when we go forth from school into the field by the river he address I insultingly in the presence of we companion

older and better than yourself i see you supercilious look at I as you spout you high-flown declamation to-day ay and i catch expression in it which you may live to rue and that very soon before you leave we i must have my revenge if you be worthy of you name let we fairly contend in more manly strife than that of the style and table wrestle with I or try the cestus against I i burn to humble you as you deserve before these witness of you insolent triumph ' the anxious mother bent eagerly forward as she listen and scarcely breathe and what she exclaim do you answer my dear son i tell he gently that he be quite mistaken for never have i consciously do anything that could give pain to he or any of my school-fellow nor do i ever dream of claim superiority over they ` and as to what you propose ' i add ` you know corvinus that i have always refuse to indulge in personal combat which begin in a cool trial of skill end in a angry strife hatred and wish for revenge how much less could i think of enter on they now when you avow that you be anxious to begin they with those evil feeling which be usually they bad end ' we school-mate have now form a circle round we and i clearly see that they be all against I for they have hope to enjoy some of the delight of they cruel game i therefore cheerfully add ` and now my comrade good-by and may all happiness attend you i part from you as i have live with you in peace ' ` not so ' reply corvinus now purple in the face with fury ` but -- ' the boy 's countenance become crimsoned he voice quiver he body tremble and half-choke he sob out i can not go on i dare not tell the rest i entreat you for god 's sake and for the love you bear you father 's memory say the mother place she hand upon she son 's head conceal nothing from I i shall never again have rest if you tell I not all what further say or do corvinus the boy recover himself by a moment 's pause and a silent prayer and then proceed : ` not so ' exclaim corvinus ` not so do you depart you have conceal you abode from we but i will find you out till then bear this token of my determine purpose to be revenge ' so say he deal I a furious blow upon the face which make I reel and stagger while a shout of savage delight break forth from the boy around we he burst into tear which relieve he and then go on : oh how i feel my blood boil at that moment how my heart seem burst within I and a voice appear to whisper in my ear the name of ` coward ' it surely be a evil spirit i feel that i be strong enough -- my rise anger make I so -- to seize my unjust assailant by the throat and cast he gasp on the ground i hear already the shout of applause that would have hail my victory and turn the table against he it be the hardest struggle of my life never be flesh and blood so strong within I o god may they never be again so tremendously powerful and what do you do then my darling boy gasp forth the tremble matron he reply my good angel conquer the demon at my side i stretch forth my hand to corvinus and say ` may god forgive you as i freely and fully do and may he bless you abundantly ' cassianus come up at that moment have see all from a distance and the youthful crowd quickly disperse i entreated he by we common faith now acknowledge between we not to pursue corvinus for what he have do and i obtain he promise and now sweet mother murmur the boy in
