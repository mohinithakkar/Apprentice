last breath of the atmosphere in which he have spend he midnight in fleet street the air be fresh almost to sweetness and the first gray of the come dawn be break faintly around the high silence of st

fleet street he come to know several face especially amongst the police he form the habit of exchange greeting with various officer whom he encounter at regular point as he go slowly homewards smoke he pipe and on this morning as he draw near to middle temple lane he see a policeman whom he know one driscoll standing at the entrance look about he further away another policeman appear saunter driscoll raise a arm and signal then turn he see spargo he move a step or two towards he spargo saw news in he face what be it ask spargo driscoll jerk a thumb over he shoulder towards the partly open door of the lane within spargo see a man hastily don a waistcoat and jacket he say answer driscoll he there -- the porter -- that there be a man lie in one of they entry down the lane and he think he be dead likewise he think he be murder spargo echo the word but what make he think that he ask peep with curiosity beyond driscoll 's burly form why he say there be blood about he answer driscoll he turn and glance at the oncoming constable and then turn again to spargo you be a newspaper man sir he suggest i be reply spargo you would better walk down with we say driscoll with a grin there 'll be something to write piece in the paper about at least there may be spargo make no answer he continue to look down the lane wonder what secret it hold until the other policeman come up at the same moment the porter now fully clothe come out come on he say shortly i 'll show you driscoll murmur a word or two to the newly-arrived constable and then turn to the porter how come you to find he then he ask the porter jerk he head at the door which they be leave i hear that door slam he reply irritably as if the fact which he mention cause he offence i know i do so i get up to look around then -- well i see that he raise a hand point down the lane the three man follow he outstretched finger and spargo then see a man 's foot boot grey-socked protrude from a entry on the left hand stick out there just as you see it now say the porter i be not touch it and so -- he pause and make a grimace as if at the memory of some unpleasant thing driscoll nod comprehendingly and so you go along and look he suggest just so -- just to see who it belong to as it might be just to see -- what there be to see agree the porter then i see there be blood and then -- well i make up the lane to tell one of you chap best thing you could have do say driscoll well now then -- the little procession come to a halt at the entry the entry be a cold and formal thing of itself not a nice place to lie dead in have glaze white tile for its wall and concrete for its flooring something about its appearance in that gray morning air suggest to spargo the idea of a mortuary and that the man whose foot project over the step be dead he have no doubt : the limpness of he pose certify to it for a moment none of the four man move or speak the two policeman unconsciously stick they thumb in they belt and make play with they finger the porter rub he chin thoughtfully -- spargo remember afterwards the rasp sound of this action he himself put he hand in he pocket and begin to jingle he money and he key each man have he own thought as he contemplate the piece of human wreckage which lay before he you 'll notice suddenly observe driscoll speaking in a hushed voice you 'll notice that he be lie there in a queer way -- same as if -- as if he would be put there sort of prop up against that wall at first and have slide down like spargo be take in all the detail with a professional eye he see at he foot the body of a elderly man the face be turn away from he crush in against the glaze of the wall but he judge the man to be elderly because of gray hair and whitening whisker it be clothe in a good well-made suit of gray check cloth -- tweed -- and the boot be good : so too be the linen cuff which project from the sleeve that hang so limply one leg be half double under the body the other be stretch straight out across the threshold the trunk be twist to the wall over the white glaze of the tile against which it and the shoulder towards which it have sink be crush there be gout and stain of blood and driscoll take a hand out of he belt point a finger at they seem to I he say slowly seem to I as how he be be strike down from behind as he come out of here that blood 's from he nose -- gush out as he fall what do you say jim the other policeman cough better get the inspector here he say and the doctor and the ambulance dead -- be not he driscoll bent down and put a thumb on the hand which lay on the pavement as ever they make 'em he remark laconically and stiff too well hurry up jim spargo wait until the inspector arrive wait until the hand-ambulance come more policeman come with it they move the body for transference to the mortuary and spargo then see the dead man 's face he look long and steadily at it while the police arrange the limb wonder all the time who it be that he gaze at how he come to that end what be the object of he murderer and many other thing there be some professionalism in spargo 's curiosity but there be also a natural dislike that a fellow-being should have be so unceremoniously smite out of the world there be nothing very remarkable about the dead man 's face it be that of a man of apparently sixty to sixty-five year of age plain even homely of feature clean-shaven except for a fringe of white whisker trim after a old-fashioned pattern between the ear and the point of the jaw the only remarkable thing about it be that it be much line and seam the wrinkle be many and deep around the corner of the lip and the angle of the eye this man you would have say to yourself have lead a hard life and weathered storm mental as well as physical driscoll nudge spargo with a turn of he elbow he give he a wink better come down to the dead-house he mutter confidentially why ask spargo they 'll go through he whisper driscoll search he d'ye see then you 'll get to know all about he and so on help to write that piece in the paper eh spargo hesitate he have have a stiff night 's work and until he encounter with driscoll he have cherish warm anticipation of the meal which would be lay out for he at he room and of the bed into which he would subsequently tumble besides a telephone message would send a man from the _ watchman _ to the mortuary this sort of thing be not in he line now now -- you 'll be for get one o ' they big play-card out with something about a mystery on it suggest driscoll you never know what lie at the bottom o ' these affair no more you do not that last observation decide spargo moreover the old instinct for get news begin to assert itself all right he say i 'll go along with you and re-lighting he pipe he follow the little cortège through the street still desert and quiet and as he walk behind he reflect on the unobtrusive fashion in which murder could stalk about here be the work of murder no doubt and it be be quietly carry along a principal london thoroughfare without fuss or noise by official to whom the deal with it be all a matter of routine surely -- my opinion say a voice at spargo 's elbow my opinion be that it be do elsewhere not there he be put there that be what i say spargo turn and see that the porter be at he side he too be accompany the body oh say spargo you think -- i think he be strike down elsewhere and carry there say the porter in somebody 's chamber maybe i have know of some queer game in we bit of london well -- he never come in at my lodge last night -- i 'll stand to that and who be he i should like to know from what i see of he not the sort to be about we place that be what we shall hear presently say spargo they be go to search he but spargo be presently make aware that the searcher have find nothing the police-surgeon say that the dead man have without doubt be strike down from behind by a terrible blow which have fracture the skull and cause death almost instantaneously in driscoll 's opinion the murder have be commit for the sake of plunder for there be nothing whatever on the body it be reasonable to suppose that a man who be well dress would possess a watch and chain and have money in he pocket and possibly ring on he finger but there be nothing valuable to be find in fact there be nothing at all to be find that could lead to identification -- no letter no papers nothing it be plain that whoever have strike the dead man down have subsequently strip he of whatever be on he the only clue to possible identity lay in the fact that a soft cap of gray cloth appear to have be newly purchase at a fashionable shop in the west end spargo go home there seem to be nothing to stop for he eat he food and he go to bed only to do poor thing in the way of sleep he be not the sort to be impress by horror but he recognize at last that the morning 's event have destroy he chance of rest he accordingly rise take a cold bath drink a cup of coffee and go out he be not sure of any particular idea when he stroll away from bloomsbury but it do not surprise he when half a hour later he find that he have walk down to the police station near which the unknown man 's body lay in the mortuary and there he meet driscoll just go off duty driscoll grin at sight of he you be in luck he say ` tis not five minute since they find a bit of gray write paper crumple up in the poor man 's waistcoat pocket -- it have slip into a crack come in and you 'll see it spargo go into the inspector 's office in another minute he find himself stare at the scrap of paper there be nothing on it but a address scrawl in pencil : -- ronald breton barrister king 's bench walk temple london chapter two he first brief spargo look up at the inspector with a quick jerk of he head i know this man he say the inspector show new interest what mr breton he ask yes i be on the _ watchman _ you know sub-editor i take a article from he the other day -- article on ` ideal site for campers-out ' he come to the office about it so this be in the dead man 's pocket find in a hole in he pocket i understand : i be not present myself it be not much but it may afford some clue to identity spargo pick up the scrap of gray paper and look closely at it it seem to he to be the sort of paper that be find in hotel and in club it have be tear roughly from the sheet what he ask meditatively what will you do about get this man identify the inspector shrug he shoulder oh usual thing i suppose there 'll be publicity you know i suppose you 'll be do a special account yourself for you paper eh then there 'll be the other and we shall put out the usual notice somebody will come forward to identify -- sure to and -- a man come into the office -- a stolid-faced quiet-mannered soberly attire person who might have be a respectable tradesman out for a stroll and who give the inspector a sidelong nod as he approach he desk at the same time extend he hand towards the scrap of paper which spargo have just lay down i 'll go along to king 's bench walk and see mr breton he observe look at he watch it be just about ten -- i daresay he 'll be there now

door of ronald breton 's chamber stand throw wide the inner one be well ajar through the opening thus make spargo and the detective obtain a full view of the interior of mr ronald breton 's room there against a background of law book bundle of papers tie up with pink tape and black-framed picture of famous legal notability they see a pretty vivacious-eyed girl who perch on a chair wig and gown and flourish a mass of crisp paper be harangue a imaginary judge and jury to the amusement of a young man who have he back to the door and of another girl who lean confidentially against he shoulder i put it to you gentleman of the jury -- i put it to you with confidence feeling that you must be must necessarily be some perhaps brother perhaps husband and father can you on you conscience do my client

arise from the fact that at this point of the proceedings the detective rap at the inner door and then put he head round its edge whereupon the young lady who be orate from the chair jump hastily down the other young lady withdraw from the young man 's protect arm there be a feminine giggle and a feminine swishing of skirt and a hasty bolt into a inner room and mr ronald breton come forward blush a little to greet the interrupter come in come in he exclaim hastily i -- then he pause catch sight of spargo and hold out he hand with a look of surprise oh -- mr spargo he say how do you do -- we -- i

one to the other the detective on he part be look at the young barrister he see a tall slimly-built youth of handsome feature and engage presence perfectly groomed and immaculately garb and have upon he a general air of well-to-do-ness and he form the impression from these matter that mr breton be one of those fortunate young man who may take up a profession but be certainly not dependent upon it he turn and glance at the journalist how do you do say spargo slowly i -- the fact be i come here with mr rathbury he -- want to see you detective-sergeant rathbury -- of new scotland yard spargo pronounce this formal introduction as if he be repeat a lesson but he be watch the young barrister 's face and breton turn to the detective with a look of surprise oh he say you wish -- rathbury have

the next room and come back a moment later in all the glory of a new silk hat spargo a young man who be never very particular about he dress begin to contrast he own attire with the butterfly appearance of this youngster he have be quick to notice that the two girl who have whisk into the inner room have be similarly garb in fine raiment more characteristic of mayfair than of fleet street already he feel a strange curiosity about breton and about the young lady whom he hear talk behind the inner door well come on say breton let 's go straight there the mortuary to which rathbury lead the way be cold drab repellent to the general gay sense of the summer morning spargo shiver involuntarily as he enter it and take a first glance around but the young barrister show no sign of feeling or concern he look quickly about he and step alertly to the side of the dead man from whose face the detective be turn back a cloth he look steadily and earnestly at the fix feature then he draw back shake he head no he say with decision do not know he -- do not know he from adam never set eye on he in my life that i know of rathbury replace the cloth i do not suppose you would he remark well i

or other he foot lead he up fleet street and before he quite realize what he be do he find himself turn into the law court chapter three the clue of the cap have no clear conception of what have lead he to these scene of litigation spargo go wander aimlessly about in the great hall and the adjacent corridor until a official who take he to be lose ask he if there be any particular part of the building he want for a moment spargo stare at the man as if he do not comprehend he question then he mental power reassert themselves be not mr justice borrow sit in one of the court this morning he suddenly ask number seven reply the official what be you case -- when 's it down i have not get a case say spargo i be a pressman -- reporter you know the official stick out a finger round the corner

perambulation of the dreary depressing corridor upon my honor he mutter upon my honor i really do not know what i have come up here for i have no business here just then he turn a corner and come face to face with ronald breton the young barrister be now in he wig and gown and carry a bundle of papers tie up with pink tape he be escort two young lady who be laugh and chatter as they trip along at he side and spargo glancing at they meditatively instinctively tell himself which of they it be that he and rathbury have overhear as she make she burlesque speech : it be not the elder one who walk by ronald breton with something of a air of proprietorship but the younger the girl with the laughing eye and the vivacious smile and it suddenly dawn upon he that somewhere deep within he there have be a notion a hope of see this girl again -- why he could not then think spargo thus come face to face with these three mechanically lift he hat breton stop half inquisitive he eye seem to ask a question yes say spargo i -- the fact be i remember that you say you be come up here and i come after you i want -- when you have time -- to have a talk to ask you a few question about -- this affair

instant he gown whisk round a corner and spargo find himself stare at two smile girl he see then that both be pretty and attractive and that one seem to be the elder by some three or four year that be very cool of ronald observe the elder young lady perhaps he scheme do not fit in with yours mr spargo pray do not -- oh it be all right say spargo feeling himself uncommonly stupid i have nothing to do but -- where do mr breton say you wish to be take into the gallery of number seven court say the younger girl promptly round this corner -- i think i know the way spargo still marvel at the rapidity with which affair be move that morning bestir himself to act as cicerone and presently lead the two young lady to the very front of one of those public gallery from which idler and specially-interested spectator may see and hear the proceedings which obtain in the badly-ventilated ill-lighted tank wherein justice be dispense at the law court there be no one else in that gallery the attendant in the corridor outside seem to be vastly amaze that any one should wish to enter it and he presently open the door beckon to spargo and come half-way down the stair to meet he nothing much go on here this morning he whisper behind a raise hand but there be a nice breach case in number five -- get you three good seat there if you like spargo decline this tempting offer and go back to he charge he have decide by that time that miss aylmore be about twenty-three and she sister about eighteen he also think that young breton be a lucky dog to be in possession of such a charming future wife and a equally charming sister-in-law and he drop into a seat at miss jessie aylmore 's side and look around he as if he be much awed by he surroundings i suppose one can talk until the judge enter he whisper be this really mr breton 's first case he very first -- all on he own responsibility any way reply spargo 's companion smile and he be very nervous -- and so 's my sister be not you now evelyn evelyn aylmore look at spargo and smile quietly i suppose one 's always nervous about first appearance she say however i think ronald 's get plenty of confidence and as he say it be not much of a case : it be not even a jury case i be afraid you 'll find it dull mr spargo -- it be only something about a promissory note oh i be all right thank you reply spargo unconsciously fall back on a favorite formulum i always like to hear lawyer -- they manage to say such a lot about -- about -- about nothing say jessie aylmore but there -- so do gentleman who write for the papers do not they spargo be about to admit that there be a good deal to be say on that point when miss aylmore suddenly draw she sister 's attention to a man who have just enter the well of the court look jessie she observe there be mr elphick spargo look down at the person indicate : a elderly large-faced smooth-shaven man a little inclined to stoutness who wig and gown be slowly make he way to a corner seat just outside that charm inner sanctum wherein only king 's counsel be permit to sit he drop into this in a fashion which show that he be one of those man who love personal comfort he bestow he plump person at the most convenient angle and fitting a monocle in he right eye glance around he there be a few of he professional brethren in he vicinity there be half a dozen solicitor and they clerk in conversation with one or other of they there be court official but the gentleman of the monocle sweep all these with a indifferent look and cast he eye upward until he catch sight of the two girl thereupon he make a most gracious bow in they direction he broad face beam in a genial smile and he wave a white hand do you know mr elphick mr spargo enquire the younger miss aylmore i rather think i have see he somewhere about the temple answer spargo in fact i be sure i have he chamber be in paper building say jessie sometimes he give tea-party in they he be ronald 's guardian and preceptor and mentor and all that and i suppose he be drop into this court to hear how he pupil go on here be ronald whisper miss aylmore and here say she sister be he lordship look very cross now mr spargo you be in for it spargo to tell the truth pay little attention to what go on beneath he the case which young breton presently open be a commercial one involve certain rights and property in a promissory note it seem to the journalist that breton deal with it very well show himself master of the financial detail and speak with readiness and assurance he be much more interested in he companion and especially in the younger one and he be meditate on how he could improve he further acquaintance when he awake to the fact that the defense realize that it stand no chance have agree to withdraw and that mr justice borrow be already give judgment in ronald breton 's favor in another minute he be walk out of the gallery in rear of the two sister very good -- very good indeed he say absent-mindedly i think he put he fact very clearly and concisely downstairs in the corridor ronald breton be talk to mr elphick he point a finger at spargo as the latter come up with the girl : spargo gather that breton be speak of the murder and of he spargo 's connection with it and directly they approach he speak this be mr spargo sub-editor of the _ watchman _ breton say mr elphick -- mr spargo i be just

musingly i know a man who live in that house in fact i visit he last night and do not leave until nearly midnight and this unfortunate man have mr ronald breton 's name and address in he pocket spargo nod he look at breton and pull out he watch just then he have no idea of play the part of informant to mr elphick yes that be so he answer shortly then look at breton significantly he add if you can

in the quieter shades of the temple before spargo speak about what i want to say to you he say at last it be -- this i -- well i have always want as a journalist to have a real big murder case i think this be one i want to go right into it -- thoroughly first and last and -- i think you can help I how do you know that it be a murder case ask breton quietly it be a murder case answer spargo stolidly i feel it instinct perhaps i be go to ferret out the truth and it seem to I -- he pause and give he companion a sharp glance it seem to I he presently continue that the clue lie in that scrap of paper that paper and that man be connect link between you and -- somebody else possibly agree breton you want to find the somebody else i want you to help I to find the somebody else answer spargo i believe this be a big very big affair : i want to do it i do not believe in police method -- much by the by i be just go to meet rathbury he may have hear of something would you like to come breton run into he chamber in king 's bench walk leave he gown and wig and walk round with spargo to the police office rathbury come out as they be step in oh he say ah -- i have get what may be helpful mr spargo i tell you i would send a man to fiskie 's the hatter well he be just return the cap which the dead man be wear be buy at fiskie 's yesterday afternoon and it be send to mr marbury room 20 at the

not in the way say breton rathbury laugh well we may find out something about this scrap of paper he observe and he wave a signal to the nearest taxi-cab driver chapter four the anglo-orient hotel the house at which spargo and he companion presently draw up be a old-fashioned place in the immediate vicinity of waterloo railway station -- a plain-fronted four-square erection essentially mid-victorian in appearance and suggestive somehow of the very early day of railway travel anything more in contrast with the modern idea of a hotel it would have be difficult to find in london and ronald breton say so as he and the other cross the pavement and yet a good many people use to favor this place on they way to and from southampton in the old day remark rathbury and i daresay that old traveller come back from the east after a good many year ' absence still rush in here you see it be close to the station and traveller have a knack of walk into the nearest place when they have a few thousand mile of steamboat and railway train behind they look there now they have cross the threshold as the detective speak and as they enter a square heavily-furnished hall he make a sidelong motion of he head towards a bar on the left wherein stand or lounge a number of man who from they general appearance they slouch hat and they bronzed face appear to be colonial or at any rate to have spend a good part of they time beneath oriental sky there be a murmur of tongue that have a colonial accent in it a aroma of tobacco that suggest sumatra and trichinopoly and rathbury wag he head sagely lay you anything the dead man be a colonial mr spargo he remark well now i suppose that be the landlord and landlady there be a office face they at the rear of the hall and a man and woman be regard they from a box window which open above a ledge on which lay a register book they be middle-aged folk : the man a fleshy round-faced somewhat pompous-looking individual who might at some time have be a butler the woman a tall spare-figured thin-featured sharp-eyed person who examine the newcomer with a enquire gaze rathbury go up to they with easy confidence you the landlord of this house sir he ask mr walter just so -- and mr walter i presume the landlord make a stiff bow and look sharply at he questioner what can i do for you sir he enquire a little matter of business mr walter reply rathbury

description point to a side door and sign rathbury and he companion to pass through obey she pointed finger they find themselves in a small private parlor walter close the two door which lead into it and look at he principal visitor what be it mr rathbury he enquire anything wrong we want a bit of information answer rathbury almost with indifference do anybody of the name of marbury put up here yesterday -- elderly man gray hair fresh complexion mr walter start glance at she husband there she exclaim i know some enquiry would be make yes -- a mr marbury take a room here yesterday morning just after the noon train get in from southampton number 20 he take but -- he do not use it last night he go out -- very late -- and he never come back rathbury nod answer a sign from the landlord he take a chair and sit down look at mr walter what make you think some enquiry would be make ma'am he ask have you notice anything mr walter seem a little confused by this direct question she husband give vent to a species of growl nothing to notice he mutter she way of speaking -- that be all well -- why i say that be this say the landlady he happen to tell we do mr marbury that he have not be in london for over twenty year and could not remember anything about it he he say never have know much about london at any time and of course when he go out so late and never come back why naturally i think something have happen to he and that there would be enquiry make just so -- just so say rathbury so you would ma'am -- so you would well something have happen to he he be dead what be more there be strong reason to think he be murder mr and mr walter receive this announcement with proper surprise and horror and the landlord suggest a little refreshment to he visitor spargo and breton decline on the ground that they have work to do during the afternoon rathbury accept it evidently as a matter of course my respects he say lift he glass well now perhaps you 'll just tell I what you know of this man i may as well tell you mr and mr walter that he be find dead in middle temple lane this morning at a quarter to three that there be not anything on he but he clothes and a scrap of paper which bear this gentleman 's name and address that this gentleman know nothing whatever of he and that i trace he here because he buy a cap at a west end hatter 's yesterday and have it send to you hotel yes say mr walter quickly that be so and he go out in that cap last night well -- we do not know much about he as i say he come in here about a quarter past twelve yesterday morning and book number 20 he have a porter with he that bring a trunk and a bag -- they be in 20 now of course he tell I that he have stay at this house over twenty year ago on he way to australia -- that of course be long before we take it and he sign he name in the book as john marbury we 'll look at that if you please say rathbury walter fetch in the register and turn the leaf to the previous day 's entry they all bent over the dead man 's write ` john marbury coolumbidgee new south wale ' say rathbury ah -- now i be wonder if that write would be the same as that on the scrap of paper mr breton but you see it be not -- it be quite different quite different say breton he too be regard the handwriting with great interest and rathbury notice he keen inspection of it and ask another question ever see that write before he suggest never answer breton and yet -- there be something very familiar about it then the probability be that you have see it before remark rathbury well -- now we 'll hear a little more about marbury 's doings here just tell I all you know mr and mr walter my wife know most say walter i scarcely see the man -- i do not remember speak with he no say mr walter you do not -- you be not much in he way well she continue i show he up to he room he talk a bit -- say he would just land at southampton from melbourne do he mention he ship ask rathbury but if he do not it do not matter for we can find out i believe the name 's on he thing answer the landlady there be some label of that sort well he ask for a chop to be cook for he at once as he be go out he have he chop and he go out at exactly one o'clock say to I that he expect he would get lose as he do not know london well at any time and should not know it at all now he go outside there -- i see he -- look about he and walk off towards blackfriar way during the afternoon the cap you speak of come for he -- from fiskie 's so of course i judge he would be piccadilly way but he himself never come in until ten o'clock and then he bring a gentleman with he aye say rathbury a gentleman now do you see he just reply the landlady they go straight up to 20 and i just catch a mere glimpse of the gentleman as they turn up the stair a tall well-built gentleman with a gray beard very well dress as far as i could see with a top hat and a white silk muffler round he throat and carry a umbrella and they go to marbury 's room say rathbury what then well then mr marbury ring for some whiskey and soda continue mr walter he be particular to have a decanter of whiskey : that and a syphon of soda be take up there i hear nothing more until nearly midnight then the hall-porter tell I that the gentleman in 20 have go out and have ask he if there be a night-porter -- as of course there be he go out at half-past eleven and the other gentleman ask rathbury the other gentleman answer the landlady go out with he the hall-porter say they turn towards the station and that be the last anybody in this house saw of mr marbury he certainly never come back that observe rathbury with a quiet smile that be quite certain ma'am well -- i suppose we would better see this number 20 room and have a look at what he leave there everything say mr walter be just as he leave it nothing 's be touch it seem to two of the visitor that there be little to touch on the dressing-table lay a few ordinary article of toilet -- none of they of any quality or value : the dead man have evidently be satisfy with the plain necessity of life a overcoat hang from a peg : rathbury without ceremony go through its pocket just as unceremoniously he proceed to examine trunk and bag and finding both unlock he lay out on the bed every article they contain and examine each separately and carefully and he find nothing whereby he could gather any clue to the dead owner 's identity there you be he say make a end of he task you see it be just the same with these thing as with the clothes he have on he there be no papers -- there be nothing to tell who he be what he be after where he would come from -- though that we may find out in other way but it be not often that a man travel without some clue to he identity beyond the fact that some of this linen be you see buy in melbourne we know nothing of he yet he must have have papers and money on he do you see anything of he money now ma'am he ask suddenly turn to mr walter do he pull out he purse in you presence now yes answer the landlady with promptitude he come into the bar for a drink after he would be up to he room he pull out a handful of gold when he pay for it -- a whole handful there must have be some thirty to forty sovereign and half-sovereign and he have not a penny piece on he -- when find muttered rathbury i notice another thing too remark the landlady he be wear a very fine gold watch and chain and have a splendid ring on he left hand -- little finger -- gold with a big diamond in it yes say the detective thoughtfully i notice that he would wear a ring and that it have be a bit tight for he well -- now there be only one thing to ask about do you chambermaid notice if he leave any tear paper around -- tear any letter up or anything like that but the chambermaid produce have not notice anything of the sort on the contrary the gentleman of number 20 have leave he room very tidy indeed so rathbury intimate that he have no more to ask and nothing further to say just then and he bid the landlord and landlady of the anglo-orient hotel good morning and go away follow by the two young man what next ask spargo as they gain the street the next thing answer rathbury be to find the man with whom marbury leave this hotel last night and how 's that to be do ask spargo at present reply rathbury i do not know and with a careless nod he walk off apparently desirous of be alone chapter five spargo wish to specialize the barrister and the journalist leave thus unceremoniously on a crowded pavement look at each other breton laugh we do not seem to have gain much information he remark i be about as wise as ever no -- wiser say spargo at any rate i be i know now that this dead man call himself john marbury that he come from australium that he only land at southampton yesterday morning and that he be in the company last night of a man whom we have have describe to we -- a tall grey-bearded well-dressed man presumably a gentleman breton shrug he shoulder i should say that description would fit a hundred thousand man in london he remark exactly -- so it would answer spargo but we know that it be one of the hundred thousand or half-million if you like the thing be to find that one -- the one and you think you can do it i think i be go to have a big try at it breton shrug he shoulder again what -- by go up to every man who answer the description and say ` sir be you the man who accompany john marbury to the aglo -- spargo suddenly interrupt he look here he say do not you say that you know a man who live in that block in the entry of which marbury be find no i do not answer breton it be mr elphick who say that all the same i do know that man -- he be mr cardlestone another barrister he and mr elphick be friend -- they be both enthusiastic philatelist -- stamp collector you know -- and i dare say mr elphick be round there last night examine something new cardlestone 's get hold of why i would like to go round there and make some enquiry reply spargo if you would be kind enough to -- oh i 'll go with you respond breton with alacrity i be just as keen about this business as you be spargo i want to know who this man marbury be and how he come to have my name and address on he now if i have be a well-known man in my profession you know why -- yes say spargo as they get into a cab yes that would have explain a lot it seem to I that we 'll get at the murderer through that scrap of paper a lot quicker than through rathbury 's line yes that be what i think breton look at he companion with interest but -- you do not know what rathbury 's line be he remark yes i do say spargo rathbury 's go off to discover who the man be with whom marbury leave the anglo-orient hotel last night that be he line and you want -- i want to find out the full significance of that bit of paper and who write it answer spargo i want to know why that old man be come to you when he be murder breton start by jove he exclaim i -- i never think of that you -- you really think he be come to I when he be strike down certain have not he get a address in the temple be not he in the temple of course he be try to find you but -- the late hour no matter how else can you explain he presence in the temple i think he be ask he way that be why i want to make some enquiry in this block it appear to spargo that a considerable number of people chiefly of the office-boy variety be desirous of make enquiry about the dead man be luncheon-hour that bit of middle temple lane where the body be find be thick with the inquisitive and the sensation-seeker for the news of the murder have spread and though there be nothing to see but the bare stone on which the body have lie there be more open mouth and stare eye around the entry than spargo have see for many a day and the nuisance have become so great that the occupant of the adjacent chamber have send for a policeman to move the curious away and when spargo and he companion present themselves at the entry this policeman be be lecture as to he duty by a little weazen-faced gentleman in very snuffy and old-fashioned garment and a ancient silk hat who be obviously greatly exercise by the unwonted commotion drive they all out into the street exclaim this personage drive they all away constable -- into fleet street or upon the embankment -- anywhere so long as you rid this place of they this be a disgrace and a inconvenience a nuisance a -- that be old cardlestone whisper breton he be always irascible and i do not suppose we 'll get anything out of he mr cardlestone he continue make he way up to the old gentleman who be now retreat up the stone step brandish a umbrella as ancient as himself i be just come to see you sir this be mr spargo a journalist who be much interested in this murder he -- i know nothing about the murder my dear sir exclaimed mr cardlestone and i never talk to journalist -- a pack of busybody sir save you presence i be not aware that any murder have be commit and i object to my doorway be fill by a pack of office boy and street lounger murder indeed i suppose the man fall down these step and break he neck -- drunk most likely he open he outer door as he speak and breton with a reassuring smile and a nod at spargo follow he into he chamber on the first landing motion the journalist to keep at they heel mr elphick tell I that he be with you until a late hour last evening mr cardlestone he say of course neither of you hear anything suspicious what should we hear that be suspicious in the temple sir demand mr cardlestone angrily i hope the temple be free from that sort of thing young mr breton you respect guardian and myself have a quiet evening on we usual peaceful pursuit and when he go away all be as quiet as the grave sir what may have go on in the chamber above and around I i know not fortunately we wall be thick sir -- substantial i say sir the man probably fall down and break he neck what he be do here i do not presume to say well it be guess you know mr cardlestone remark breton again wink at spargo but all that be find on this man be a scrap of paper on which my name and address be write that be practically all that be know of he except that he would just arrive from australium mr cardlestone suddenly turn on the young barrister with a sharp acute glance eh he exclaim what be this you say this man have you name and address on he young breton -- yours and that he come from -- australium that be so answer breton that be all that be known mr cardlestone put aside he umbrella produce a bandanna handkerchief of strong color and blow he nose in a reflective fashion that be a mysterious thing he observe um -- do elphick know all that breton

curiosity about a mystery which occur at my very door he say also i have know more than one man who go to australia this might -- i say might young gentleman -- might be a man i have once know show I where this body be breton look helplessly at spargo : it be plain that he do not understand the turn that thing be take but spargo be quick to seize a opportunity in another minute he be conduct mr cardlestone through the in and out of the temple towards blackfriar and as they turn into tudor street they encounter mr elphick i be go to the mortuary he remark so i suppose be you cardlestone have anything more be discover young man spargo try a chance shot -- at what he do not know the man 's name be marbury he say he be from australium he be keep a keen eye on mr elphick but he fail to see

ask indifferently the way you have write this thing up say breton it be a hundred thousand time better than the usual cut-and-dried account of a murder it be -- it be like a -- a romance merely a new method of give news say spargo he pick up a copy of the _ watchman _ and glance at he two column which have somehow manage to make themselves into three view the display letter the photograph of the dead man the line drawing of the entry in middle temple lane and the facsimile of the scrap of gray paper with a critical eye yes -- merely a new method he continue the question be -- will it achieve its object what be the object ask breton spargo fish out a box of cigarette from a untidy drawer push it over to he visitor help himself and tilt back he chair put he foot on he desk the object he say drily oh well the object be the ultimate detection of the murderer you be after that i be after that -- just that and not -- not simply out to make effective news i be out to find the murderer of john marbury say spargo deliberately slow in he speech and i 'll find he well there do not seem to be much in the way of clue so far remark breton i see -- nothing do you spargo send a spiral of scented smoke into the air i want to know a awful lot he say i be hunger for news i want to know who john marbury be i want to know what he do with himself between the time when he walk out of the anglo-orient hotel alive and well and the time when he be find in middle temple lane with he skull beat in and dead i want to know where he get that scrap of paper above everything breton i want to know what he would get to do with you he give the young barrister a keen look and breton nod yes he say i confess that be a corker but i think -- well say spargo i think he may have be a man who have

solicitor somebody who want to do I a good turn may have give this man my address possible say spargo but he would not have come to consult you at midnight breton -- the more i think of it the more i be certain there be a tremendous mystery in this affair that be why i get the chief to let I write it up as i have do -- here i be hope that this photograph -- though to be sure it be of a dead face -- and this facsimile of the scrap of paper will lead to somebody come forward who can -- just then one of the uniformed youth who hang about the marble pillare vestibule of the _ watchman _ office

enquiry -- you be a friend of he be not you she ask i suppose you know as much as he do -- about this he and i reply spargo with easy confidence be work this case together you can tell I anything you would tell he the landlady rummage in she pocket and produce a old purse from a inner compartment of which she bring out a small object wrap in tissue paper well she say unwrap the paper we find this in number 20 this morning -- it be lie under the dressing-table the girl that find it bring it to I and i think it be a bit of glass but walter he say as how he should not be surprise if it be a diamond and since we find it the waiter who take the whisky up to 20 after mr marbury come in with the other gentleman have tell I that when he go into the room the two gentleman be look at a paper full of thing like this so there spargo finger the shine bit of stone that be a diamond -- right enough he say put it away mr walter -- i shall see rathbury presently and i 'll tell he about it now that other gentleman you tell we you see he could you recognize he -- i mean a photograph of he be this the man spargo know from the expression of mr walter ' face that she have no more doubt than webster have oh yes she say that be the gentleman who come in with mr marbury -- i should have know he in a thousand anybody would recognize he from that -- perhaps you would let we hall-porter and the waiter i mention just now look at it i 'll see they separately and see if they have ever see a man who resemble this reply spargo the two man recognize the photograph at once without any prompt and spargo after a word or two with the landlady ride off to the atlantic and pacific club and find ronald breton await he on the step he make no reference to he recent doings and together they go into the house and ask for mr aylmore spargo look with more than uncommon interest at the man who presently come to they in the visitor ' room he be already familiar with mr aylmore 's photograph but he never remember see he in real life the member for brookminster be one of that rapidly diminish body of legislator whose member be dispose to work quietly and unobtrusively do yeoman service on committee obey every behest of the party whip without force themselves into the limelight or seize every opportunity to air they opinion now that spargo meet he in the flesh he prove to be pretty much what the journalist have expect -- a rather cold-mannered self-contained man who look as if he have be bring up in a school of rigid repression and teach not to waste word he show no more than the merest of languid interest in spargo when breton introduce he and he face be quite expressionless when spargo bring to a end he brief explanation -- purposely shorten -- of he object in call upon he yes he say indifferently yes it be quite true that i meet marbury and spend a little time with he on the evening you informant speak of i meet he as he tell you in the lobby of the house i be much surprised to meet he i have not see he for -- i really do not know how many year he pause and look at spargo as if he be wonder what he ought or not to say to a newspaper man spargo remain silent wait and presently mr aylmore go on i read you account in the _ watchman _ this morning he say i be wonder when you call just now if i would communicate with you or with the police the fact be -- i suppose you want this for you paper eh he continue after a sudden breaking off i shall not print anything that you wish I not to print answer spargo if you care to give I any information -- oh well say mr aylmore i do not mind the fact be i know next to nothing marbury be a man with whom i have some -- well business relation of a sort a great many year ago it must be twenty year -- perhaps more -- since i lose sight of he when he come up to I in the lobby the other night i have to make a effort of memory to recall he he wish I have once meet I to give he some advice and as there be little do in the house that night and as he have once be -- almost a friend -- i walk to he hotel with he chat he tell I that he have only land from australium that morning and what he want my advice about principally be -- diamond australian diamond i be unaware remark spargo that diamond be ever find in australium mr aylmore smile -- a little cynically perhaps so he say but diamond have be find in australium from time to time ever since australium be know to european and in the opinion of expert they will eventually be find there in quantity anyhow marbury have get hold of some australian diamond and he show they to I at he hotel -- a number of they we examine they in he room what do he do with they -- afterwards ask spargo he put they in he waistcoat pocket -- in a very small wash-leather bag from which he have take they there be in all sixteen or twenty stone -- not more and they be all small i advise he to see some expert -- i mention streeter 's to he now i can tell you how he get hold of mr breton 's address the two young man prick up they ear spargo unconsciously tighten he hold on the pencil with which he be make note he get it from I continue mr aylmore the handwriting on the scrap of paper be mine hurriedly scrawl he want legal advice as i know very little about lawyer i tell he that if he call on mr breton mr breton would be able to tell he of a first-class sharp solicitor i write down mr breton 's address for he on a scrap of paper which he tear off a letter that he take from he pocket by the by i observe that when he body be find there be nothing on it in the shape of papers or money i be quite sure that when i leave he he have a lot of gold on he those diamond and a breast-pocket full of letter where do you leave he sir ask spargo you leave the hotel together i believe yes we stroll along when we leave it have once meet we have much to talk of and it be a fine night we walk across waterloo bridge and very shortly afterwards he leave I and that be really all i know my own impression -- he pause for a moment and spargo wait silently my own impression -- though i confess it may seem to have no very solid grounds -- be that marbury be decoy to where he be find and be rob and murder by some person who know he have valuable on he there be the fact that he be rob at any rate i have have a notion say breton diffidently may not be worth much but i have have it all the same some fellow-passenger of marbury 's may have track he all day -- middle temple lane 's pretty lonely at night you know no one make any comment upon this suggestion and on spargo look at mr aylmore the member of parliament rise and glance at the door well that be all i can tell you mr spargo he say you see it be not much after all of course there 'll be a inquest on marbury and i shall have to re-tell it but you be welcome to print what i have tell you spargo left breton with he future father-in-law and go away towards new scotland yard he and rathbury have promise to share news -- now he have some to communicate chapter eight the man from the safe deposit spargo find rathbury sit alone in a small somewhat dismal apartment which be chiefly remarkable for the business-like paucity of its furnishings and its indefinable air of secrecy there be a plain writing-table and a hard chair or two a map of london much discolor on the wall a few fade photograph of eminent band in the world of crime and a similar number of well-thumbed book of reference the detective himself when spargo be show in to he be seat at the table chew a unlighted cigar and engage in the apparently aimless task of draw hieroglyphic on scrap of paper he look up as the journalist enter and hold out he hand well i congratulate you on what you stick in the _ watchman _ this morning he say make extra good reading i think they do right to let you tackle that job go straight through with it now i suppose mr spargo spargo drop into the chair nearest to rathbury 's right hand he light a cigarette and have blow out a whiff of smoke nod he head in a fashion which indicate that the detective might consider he question answer in the affirmative look here he say we settle yesterday do not we that you and i be to consider ourselves partner as it be in this job that be all right he continue as rathbury nod very quietly very well -- have you make any further progress rathbury put he thumb in the armhole of he waistcoat and lean back in he chair shake he head frankly i have not he reply of course there be a lot be do in the usual official-routine way we have man out make various enquiry we be enquire about marbury 's voyage to england all that we know up to now be that he be certainly a passenger on a liner which land at southampton in accordance with what he tell those people at the anglo-orient that he leave the ship in the usual way and be understand to take the train to town -- as he do that be all there be nothing in that we have cable to melbourne for any news of he from there but i expect little from that all right say spargo and -- what be you do -- you yourself because if we be to share fact i must know what my partner 's after just now you seem to be -- draw rathbury laugh well to tell you the truth he say when i want to work thing out i come into this room -- it be quiet as you see -- and i scribble anything on paper while i think i be figure on my next step and -- do you see it ask spargo quickly well -- i want to find the man who go with marbury to that hotel reply rathbury it seem to I -- spargo wag he finger at he fellow-contriver i have find he he say that be what i write that article for -- to find he i know it would find he i have never have any training in you sort of work but i know that article would get he and it have get he rathbury accord the journalist a look of admiration good he say and -- who be he i 'll tell you the story answer spargo and in a summary this morning a man name webster a farmer a visitor to london come to I at the office and say that be at the house of common last night he witness a meeting between marbury and a man who be evidently a member of parliament and see they go away together i show he a album of photograph of the present member and he immediately recognize the portrait of one of they as the man in question i thereupon take the portrait to the anglo-orient hotel -- mr walter also at once recognize it as that of the man who come to the hotel with marbury stop with he a while in he room and leave with he the man be mr stephen aylmore the member for brookminster rathbury express he feeling in a sharp whistle i know he he say of course -- i remember mr walter 's description now but he be a familiar type -- tall grey-bearded well-dressed um -- well we 'll have to see mr aylmore at once i have see he say spargo naturally for you see mr walter give I a bit more evidence this morning they find a loose diamond on the floor of number 20 and after it be find the waiter who take the drink up to marbury and he guest that night remember that when he enter the room the two gentleman be look at a paper full of similar object so then i go on to see mr aylmore you know young breton the barrister -- you meet he with I you remember the young fellow whose name and address be find on marbury reply rathbury i remember breton be engage to aylmore 's daughter continue spargo breton take I to aylmore 's club and aylmore give a plain straightforward account of the matter which he be grant I leave to print it clear up a lot of thing aylmore know marbury over twenty year ago he lose sight of he they meet accidentally in the lobby of the house on the evening precede the murder marbury tell he that he want he advice about those rare thing australian diamond he go back with he to he hotel and spend a while with he then they walk out together as far as waterloo bridge where aylmore leave he and go home further the scrap of gray paper be account for marbury want the address of a smart solicitor aylmore do not know of one but tell marbury that if he call on young breton he would know and would put he in the way to find one marbury write breton 's address down that be aylmore 's story but it be get a important addition aylmore say that when he leave marbury marbury have on he a quantity of those diamond in a wash-leather bag a lot of gold and a breast-pocket full of letter and papers now -- there be nothing on he when he be find dead in middle temple lane spargo stop and light a fresh cigarette that be all i know he say what do you make of it rathbury lean back in he chair in he apparently favorite attitude and stare hard at the dusty ceiling above he do not know he say it bring thing up to a point certainly aylmore and marbury part at waterloo bridge -- very late waterloo bridge be pretty well next door to the temple but -- how do marbury get into the temple unobserved we have make every enquiry and we can not trace he in any way as regard that movement there be a clue for he go there in the scrap of paper bearing breton 's address but even a colonial would know that no business be do in the temple at midnight eh well say spargo i have think of one or two thing he may have be one of those man who like to wander around at night he may have see -- he would see -- plenty of light in the temple at that hour he may have slip in unobserved -- it be possible it be quite possible i once have a moonlight saunter in the temple myself after midnight and have no difficulty about walk in and out either but -- if marbury be murder for the sake of what he have on he -- how do he meet with he murderer or murderer in there criminal do not hang about middle temple lane the detective shake he head he pick up he pencil and begin make more hieroglyphic what be you theory mr spargo he ask suddenly i suppose you have get one have you ask spargo bluntly well return rathbury hesitatingly i have not up to now but now -- now after what you have tell I i think i can make one it seem to I that after marbury leave aylmore he probably moon about by himself that he be decoy into the temple and be there murder and rob there be a lot of queer in and out nook and corner in that old spot mr spargo and the murderer if he know he ground well could easily hide himself until he could get away in the morning he might be a man who have access to chamber or office -- think how easy it would be for such a man have once kill and rob he victim to lie hide for hour afterwards for aught we know the man who murder marbury may have be within twenty foot of you when you first see he dead body that morning eh before spargo could reply to this suggestion a official enter the room and whisper a few word in the detective 's ear show he in at once say rathbury he turn to spargo as the man quit the room and smile significantly here 's somebody want to tell something about the marbury case he remark let 's hope it 'll be news worth hearing spargo smile in he queer fashion it strike I that you have only get to interest a inquisitive public in order to get news he say the principal thing be to investigate it when you have get it who be this now the official have return with a dapper-looking gentleman in a frock-coat and silk hat bearing upon he the unmistakable stamp of the city man who inspect rathbury with deliberation and spargo with a glance and be seat turn to the detective as undoubtedly the person he desire to converse with i understand that you be the officer in charge of the marbury murder case he observe i believe i can give you some valuable information in respect to that i read the account of the affair in the _ watchman _ newspaper this morning and see the portrait of the murder man there and i be at first inclined to go to the _ watchman _ office with my information but i finally decide to approach the police instead of the press regard the police as be more -- more responsible much oblige to you sir say rathbury with a glance at spargo whom have i the pleasure of -- my name reply the visitor draw out and lay down a card be myerst -- mr ep myerst secretary of the london and universal safe deposit company i may i suppose speak with confidence continue mr myerst with a side-glance at spargo my information be -- confidential rathbury inclined he head and put he finger together you may speak with every confidence mr myerst he answer if what you have to tell have any real bearing on the marbury case it will probably have to be repeat in public you know sir but at present it will be treat as private it have a very real bearing on the case i should say reply mr myerst yes i should decidedly say so the fact be that on June 21st at about -- to be precise -- three o'clock in the afternoon a stranger who give the name of john marbury and he present address as the anglo-orient hotel waterloo call at we establishment and ask if he could rent a small safe he explain to I that he desire to deposit in such a safe a small leather box -- which by the by be of remarkably ancient appearance -- that he have bring with he i show he a safe such as he want inform he of the rent and of the rule of the place and he engage the safe pay the rent for one year in advance and deposit he leather box -- a affair of about a foot square -- there and then after that have exchange a remark or two about the altered condition of london which i understand he to say he have not see for a great many year he take he key and he departure i think there can be no doubt about this be the mr marbury who be find murder none at all i should say mr myerst say rathbury and i be much oblige to you for come here now you might tell I a little more sir do marbury tell you anything about the contents of the box no he merely remark that he wish the greatest care to be take of it reply the secretary do not give you any hint as to what be in it ask rathbury none but he be very particular to assure himself that it could not be burn nor burgle nor otherwise molest reply mr myerst he appear to be greatly relieve when he find that it be impossible for anyone but himself to take he property from he safe ah say rathbury wink at spargo so he would no doubt and marbury himself sir now how do he strike you mr myerst gravely consider this question mr marbury strike I he answer at last as a man who have probably see strange place and before leave he make what i will term a remarkable remark about -- in fact about he leather box he leather box say rathbury and what be it sir this reply the secretary ` that box ' he say ` be safe now but it be be safer it be be bury -- and deep-down too -- for many and many a year ' chapter nine the dealer in rare stamp bury -- and deep-down too -- for many and many a year repeat mr myerst eye he companion with keen glance i consider that gentleman a very remarkable remark -- very remarkable rathbury stick he thumb in the armhole of he waistcoat again and begin sway backwards and forwards in he chair he look at spargo and with he knowledge of man he know that all spargo 's journalistic instinct have be arouse and that he be keen as mustard to be off on a new scent remarkable -- remarkable mr myerst he assent what do you say mr spargo spargo turn slowly and for the first time since myerst have enter make a careful inspection of he the inspection last several seconds then spargo speak and what do you say to that he ask quietly myerst look from he questioner to rathbury and rathbury think it time to enlighten the caller i may as well tell you mr myerst he say smilingly that this be mr spargo of the _ watchman _ mr spargo write the article about the marbury case of which you speak when you come in mr spargo you 'll gather be deeply interested in this matter -- and he and i in we different capacity be work together so -- you understand myerst regard spargo in a new light and while he be so look at he spargo repeat the question he have just put i say -- what do you say to that myerst hesitate well -- er -- i do not think i say anything he reply nothing that one might call material you know do not ask he what he mean suggest spargo oh no -- not at all reply myerst spargo get up abruptly from he chair then you miss one of the finest opportunity i ever hear of he say half-sneeringly you might have hear such a story -- he pause as if it be not worth while to continue and turn to rathbury who be regard he with amusement look here rathbury he say be it possible to get that box open it 'll have to be open answer rathbury rise it be get to be open it probably contain the clue we want i be go to ask mr myerst here to go with I just now to take the first step about have it open i shall have to get a order we may get the matter through today but at any rate we 'll have it do tomorrow morning can you arrange for I to be present when that come off ask spargo you can -- certain that be all right rathbury now i be off and you 'll ring I up or come round if you hear anything and i 'll do the same by you and without further word spargo go quickly away and just as quickly return to the _ watchman _ office there the assistant who have be tell off to wait upon he order during this new crusade meet he with a business card this gentleman come in to see you about a hour ago mr spargo he say he think he can tell you something about the marbury affair and he say that as he could not wait perhaps you would step round to he place when you come in spargo take the card and read : mr jame criedir dealer in philatelic rarity 2021 strand spargo put the card in he waistcoat pocket and go out again wonder why mr jame criedir could not would not or do not call himself a dealer in rare postage stamp and so use plain english he go up fleet street and soon find the shop indicate on the card and he first glance at its exterior show that whatever business might have be do by mr criedir in the past at

murder man 's photograph in you column that i can give you a bit of information material ask spargo tersely mr criedir cock one of he bright eye at he visitor he cough drily that be for you to decide -- when you have hear it he say i should say consider everything that it be material well it be this -- i keep open until yesterday -- everything as usual you know -- stock in the window and so on -- so that anybody who be pass would naturally have think that the business be go on though as a matter of fact i be retire -- retire add mr criedir with a laugh last night now -- but will not you take

-- rare stamp ' he say ' i be ' i reply ` i have something here i would like to show you ' he say unlock the box ` it be -- ' stop a bit say spargo where do he take the key from with which he unlock the box it be one of several which he carry on a split ring and he take the bunch out of he left-hand trousers pocket reply mr criedir oh i keep my eye open young gentleman well -- he open he box it seem to I to be full of papers -- at any rate there be a lot of legal-looking document on the top tie up with red tape to show you how i notice thing i see that the papers be stain with age and that the red tape be fade to a mere washed-out pink good -- good murmured spargo excellent proceed sir '' he put he hand under the topmost papers and draw out a envelope continue mr criedir from the envelope he produce a exceedingly rare exceedingly valuable set of colonial stamp -- the very-first ever issue ` i have just come from australium ' he say ' i promise a young friend of mine out there to sell these stamp for he in london and as i be pass this way i catch sight of you shop will you buy 'em and how much will you give for 'em ' prompt muttered spargo he seem to I the sort of man who do not waste word agree mr criedir well there be no doubt about the stamp nor about they great value but i have to explain to he that i be retire from business that very day and do not wish to enter into even a single deal and that therefore i could not do anything ` no matter ' he say ' i daresay there be lot of man in you line of trade -- perhaps you can recommend I to a good firm ' ' i could recommend you to a dozen extra-good firm ' i answer ` but i can do better for you i 'll give you the name and address of a private buyer who i have not the least doubt will be very glad to buy that set from you and will give you a big price ' ` write it down ' he say ` and thank you for you trouble ' so i give he a bit of advice as to the price he ought to get and i write the name and address of the man i refer to on the back of one of my card whose name and address ask spargo mr nicholas cardlestone 2 pilcox building middle temple lane reply mr criedir mr cardlestone be one of the most enthusiastic and accomplished philatelist in europe and i know he do not possess that set of stamp i know mr cardlestone remark spargo it be at the foot of he stair that marbury be find murder just so say mr criedir which make I think that he be go to see mr cardlestone when he be set upon murder and rob spargo look fixedly at the retired stamp-dealer what go to see a elderly gentleman in he room in the temple to offer to sell he philatelic rarity at -- past midnight he say i think -- not much all right reply mr criedir you think and argue on modern line -- which be of course highly superior but -- how do you account for my have give marbury mr cardlestone 's address and for he have be find dead -- murder -- at the foot of cardlestone 's stair a few hour later i do not account for it say spargo i be try to mr criedir make no comment on this he look he visitor up and down for a moment gather some idea of he capability and suddenly offer he a cigarette spargo accept it with a laconic word of thanks and smoke half-way through it before he speak again yes he say i be try to account and i shall account and i be much oblige to you mr criedir for what you have tell I now then may i ask you a question or two a thousand respond mr criedir with great geniality very well do marbury say he would call on cardlestone he do say he would call as soon as he could -- that day have you tell cardlestone what you have just tell I i have but not until a hour ago -- on my way back from you office in fact i meet he in fleet street and tell he have he receive a call from marbury no never hear of or see the man at least never hear of he until he hear of the murder he tell I he and he friend mr elphick another philatelist go to see the body wonder if they could recognize it as any man they would ever know but they could not i know they do say spargo i see 'em at the mortuary um well -- one more question when marbury leave you do he put those stamp in he box again as before no reply mr criedir he put they in he right-hand breast pocket and he lock up he old box and go off swing it in he left hand spargo go away down fleet street see nobody he mutter to himself and he be still mutter when he get into he room at the office and what he mutter be the same thing repeat over and over again : six hour -- six hour -- six hour those six hour next morning the _ watchman _ come out with four lead column of up-to-date news about the marbury case and right across the top of the four run a heavy double line of great capital black and stare : -- who see john marbury between 315 pm and 915 pm on the day precede he murder chapter ten the leather box whether spargo be sanguine enough to expect that he stare headline would bring he information of the sort he want be a secret which he keep to himself that a good many thousand of human being must have set eye on john marbury between the hour which spargo set forth in that headline be certain the problem be -- what particular owner or owner of a pair or of many pair of those eye would remember he why should they remember he walter and he wife have reason to remember he criedir have reason to remember he so have myerst so have william webster but between a quarter past three when he leave the london and universal safe deposit and a quarter past nine when he sit down by webster 's side in the lobby of the house of common nobody seem to have any recollection of he except mr fiskie the hatter and he only remember he faintly and because marbury have buy a fashionable cloth cap at he shop at any rate by noon of that day nobody have come forward with any recollection of he he must have go west from see myerst because he buy he cap at fiskie 's he must eventually have go south-west because he turn up at westminster but where else do he go what do he do to whom do he speak no answer come to these question that show observe young mr ronald breton laze a hour away in spargo 's room at the _ watchman _ at that particular hour which be neither noon nor afternoon wherein even busy man do nothing that show how a chap can go about london as if he be merely a ant that have stray into another ant-heap than he own nobody notice you would better go and read up a little elementary entomology breton say spargo i do not know much about it myself but i have a pretty good idea that when a ant walk into the highway and byway of a colony to which he do not belong he do not survive he intrusion by many seconds well you know what i mean say breton london 's a ant-heap be not it one human ant more or less do not count this man marbury must have go about a pretty tidy lot during those six hour he would ride on a ` bus -- almost certain he would get into a taxi-cab -- i think that be much more certain because it would be a novelty to he he would want some tea -- anyway he would be sure to want a drink and he would turn in somewhere to get one or the other he would buy thing in shop -- these colonial always do he would go somewhere to get he dinner he would -- but what be the use of enumeration in this case a mere pile up of platitude answer spargo what i mean be continue breton that pile of people must have see he and yet it be now hour and hour since you paper come out this morning and nobody 's come forward to tell anything and when you come to think of it why should they who would remember a ordinary man in a gray tweed suit ` a ordinary man in a gray tweed suit ' repeat spargo good line you have not any copyright in it remember it would make a good cross-heading breton laugh you be a queer chap spargo he say seriously do you think you be get any nearer anything i be get nearer something with everything that be do spargo answer you can not start on a business like this without evolve something out of it you know well say breton to I there be not so much mystery in it mr aylmore 's explain the reason why my address be find on the body criedir the stamp-man have explain -- spargo suddenly look up what he say sharply why the reason of marbury 's be find where he be find reply breton of course i see it all marbury be moon around fleet street he slip into middle temple lane late as it be just to see where old cardlestone hang out and he be set upon and do for the thing 's plain to I the only thing now be to find who do it yes that be it agree spargo that be it he turn over the leaf of the diary which lay on he desk by the by he say look up with some interest the adjourn inquest be at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning be you go i shall certainly go answer breton what be more i be go to take miss aylmore and she sister as the gruesome detail be over at the first sit and as there 'll he nothing but this new evidence tomorrow and as they have never be in a coroner 's court -- mr aylmore 'll be the principal witness tomorrow interrupted spargo i suppose he 'll be able to tell a lot more than he tell -- I breton shrug he shoulder i do not see that there be much more to tell he say but he add with a sly laugh i suppose you want some more good copy eh spargo glance at he watch rise and pick up he hat i 'll tell you what i want he say i want to know who john marbury be that would make good copy who he be -- twenty -- twenty-five -- forty year ago eh and you think mr aylmore can tell asked breton mr aylmore answer spargo as they walk towards the door be the only person i have meet so far who have admit that he know john marbury in the -- past but he do not tell I -- much perhaps he 'll tell the coroner and he jury -- more now i be off breton -- i have a appointment and leave breton to find he own way out spargo hurry away jump into a taxi-cab and speed to the london and universal safe deposit at the corner of its building he find rathbury await he well say spargo as he spring out : how be it it be all right answer rathbury you can be present : i get the necessary permission as there be no relation know there 'll only be one or two official and you and the safe deposit people and myself come on -- it be about time it sound observe spargo like a exhumation rathbury laugh well we be certainly go to dig up a dead man 's secret he say at least we may be go to do so in my opinion mr spargo we 'll find some clue in this leather box spargo make no answer they enter the office to be show into a room where be already assemble mr myerst a gentleman who turn out to be the chairman of the company and the official of whom rathbury have speak and in another moment spargo hear the chairman explain that the company possess duplicate key to all safe and that the proper authorization have be receive from the proper authority those present would now proceed to the safe recently tenant by the late mr john marbury and take from it the property which he himself have deposit there a small leather box which they would afterwards bring to that room and cause to be open in each other 's presence it seem to spargo that there be a unending unlocking of bolt and bar before he and he fellow-processionist come to the safe so recently rent by the late mr john marbury now undoubtedly deceased and at first sight of it he see that it be so small a affair that it seem ludicrous to imagine that it could contain anything of any importance in fact it look to be no more than a plain wooden locker one amongst many in a small strong room : it remind spargo irresistibly of the locker in which in he school day he have keep he personal belongings and the jam tart sausage roll and hardbake smuggle in from the tuck-shop marbury 's name have be newly paint upon it the paint be scarcely dry but when the wooden door -- the front door as it be of this temple of mystery have be solemnly open by the chairman a formidable door of steel be reveal and expectation still leap in the bosom of the beholder the duplicate key mr myerst if you please command the chairman the duplicate key myerst who be fully as solemn as he principal produce a curious-looking key : the chairman lift he hand as if he be about to christen a battleship : the steel door swing slowly back and there in a two-foot square cavity lay the leather box it strike spargo as they file back to the secretary 's room that the procession become more funereal-like than ever first walk the chairman abreast with the high official who have bring the necessary authorization from the all-powerful quarter then come myerst carry the box : follow two other gentleman both legal light charge with watch official and police interest rathbury and spargo bring up the rear he whisper something of he notion to the detective rathbury nod a comprehensive understanding let 's hope we be go to see -- something he say in the secretary 's room a man wait who touch he forelock respectfully as the head of the procession enter myerst set the box on the table : the man make a musical jingle of key : the other member of the procession gather round as we naturally possess no key to this box announce the chairman in grave tone it become we duty to employ professional assistance in open it jobson he wave a hand and the man of the key step forward with alacrity he examine the lock of the box with a know eye it be easy to see that he be anxious to fall upon it while he consider matter spargo look at the box it be pretty much what it have be describe to he as be a small square box of old cow-hide very strongly make much worn and tarnished fit with a handle project from the lid and have the appearance of have be hide away somewhere for many a long day there be a click a spring : jobson step back that be it if you please sir he say the chairman motion to the high official if you would be good enough to open the box sir he say we duty be now conclude as the high official lay he hand on the lid the other man gather round with crane neck and expectant eye the lid be lift : somebody sigh deeply and spargo push he own head and eye nearer the box be empty empty as anything that can be empty be empty thought spargo : there be literally nothing in it they be all stare into the interior of a plain time-worn little receptacle line out with old-fashioned chintz stuff such as we mid-victorian fore-father be familiar with and contain -- nothing god bless my soul exclaim the chairman this be -- dear I -- why there be nothing in the box that remark the high official drily appear to be obvious the chairman look at the secretary i understand the box be valuable mr myerst he say with the half-injured air of a man who consider himself to have be rob of a exceptionally fine treat valuable myerst cough i can only repeat what i have already say sir benjamin he answer the -- er late mr marbury speak of the deposit as be of great value to he he never permit it out of he hand until he place it in the safe he appear to regard it as of the greatest value but we understand from the evidence of mr criedir give to the _ watchman _ newspaper that it be full of papers and -- and other article say the chairman criedir see papers in it about a hour before it be bring here myerst spread out he hand i can only repeat what i have say sir benjamin he answer i know nothing more but why should a man deposit a empty box begin the chairman i -- the high official interpose that the box be empty be certain he observe do you ever handle it yourself mr myerst myerst smile in a superior fashion i have already observe sir that from the time the deceased enter this room until the moment he place the box in the safe which he rent the box be never out of he hand he reply then there be silence at last the high official turn to the chairman very well he say we have make the enquiry rathbury take the box away with you and lock it up at the yard so spargo go out with rathbury and the box and see excellent if mystifying material for the article which have already become the daily feature of he paper chapter eleven mr aylmore be question it seem to spargo as he sit listen to the proceedings at the adjourn inquest next day that the whole story of what be now world-famous as the middle temple murder case be be reiterate before he for the thousandth time there be not a detail of the story with which he have not become familiar to fulness the first proceeding before the coroner have be of a merely formal nature these be thorough and exhaustive the representative of the crown and twelve good man and true of the city of london be there to hear and to find out and to arrive at a conclusion as to how the man know as john marbury come by he death and although he know all about it spargo find himself tabulate the evidence in a professional manner and note how each successive witness contribute as it be a chapter to the story the story itself run quite easily naturally consecutively -- you could make it in section and spargo sit merely to listen make they : 1 the temple porter and constable driscoll prove the finding of the body 2 the police surgeon testify as to the cause of death -- the man have be strike down from behind by a blow a terrible blow -- from some heavy instrument and have die immediately 3 the police and the mortuary official prove that when the body be examine nothing be find in the clothing but the now famous scrap of gray paper 4 rathbury prove that by means of the dead man 's new fashionable cloth cap buy at fiskie 's well-known shop in the west-end he trace marbury to the anglo-orient hotel in the waterloo district 5 mr and mr walter give evidence of the arrival of marbury at the anglo-orient hotel and of he doings while he be in and about there 6 the purser of the ss _ wambarino _ prove that marbury sail from melbourne to southampton on that ship excite no remark behave himself like any other well-regulated passenger and leave the _ wambarino _ at southampton early in the morning of what be to be the last day of he life in just the ordinary manner 7 mr criedir give evidence of he rencontre with marbury in the matter of the stamp 8 mr myerst tell of marbury 's visit to the safe deposit and further prove that the box which he place there prove on official examination to be empty 9 william webster re-tell the story of he encounter with marbury in one of the vestibule of the house of common and of he witness the meeting between he and the gentleman whom he -lrb- webster -rrb- now know to be mr aylmore a member of parliament all this lead up to the appearance of mr aylmore mp in the witness-box and spargo know and feel that it be that appearance for which the crowded court be wait thanks to he own vivid and realistic special in the _ watchman _ everybody there have already become well and thoroughly acquaint with the mass of evidence represent by the nine witness who have be in the box before mr aylmore enter it they be familiar too with the fact which mr aylmore have permit spargo to print after the interview at the club which ronald breton arrange why then the extraordinary interest which the member of parliament 's appearance arouse for everybody be extraordinarily interested from the coroner downward to the last man who have manage to squeeze himself into the last available inch of the public gallery all who be there want to hear and see the man who meet marbury under such dramatic circumstance and who go to he hotel with he hobnob with he give he advice walk out of the hotel with he for a stroll from which marbury never return spargo know well why the interest be so keen -- everybody know that aylmore be the only man who could tell the court anything really pertinent about marbury who he be what he be after what he life have be he look round the court as the member of parliament enter the witness-box -- a tall handsome perfectly-groomed man whose beard be only slightly tinge with gray whose figure be as erect as a well-drilled soldier 's who carry about he a air of conscious power aylmore 's two daughter sit at a little distance away opposite spargo with ronald breton in attendance upon they spargo have encounter they glance as they enter the court and they have give he a friendly nod and smile he have watch they from time to time it be plain to he that they regard the whole affair as a novel sort of entertainment they might have be idler in some eastern bazaar listen to the unfold of many tale from the professional tale-teller now as they father enter the box spargo look at they again he see nothing more than a little heightening of color in they cheek a little brighten of they eye all that they feel he think be a bit of extra excitement at the idea that they father be mix up in this delightful mystery um well -- now how much be he mix up and he turn to the witness-box and from that moment never take he eye off the man who now stand in it for spargo have idea about the witness which he be anxious to develop the folk who expect something immediately sensational in mr aylmore 's evidence be disappointed aylmore have be swear and ask a question or two by the coroner request permission to tell in he own way what he know of the dead man and of this sad affair and have receive that permission he go on in a calm unimpassioned manner to repeat precisely what he have tell spargo it sound a very plain ordinary story he have know marbury many year ago he have lose sight of he for -- oh quite twenty year he have meet he accidentally in one of the vestibule of the house of common on the evening precede the murder marbury have ask he advice have no particular duty and willing to do a old acquaintance a good

they have stroll across waterloo bridge shortly afterwards they have part that be all he know the court the public spargo everybody there know all this already it have be in print under a big headline in the _ watchman _ aylmore have now tell it again have tell it he seem to consider that he next step be to leave the box and the court and after a perfunctory question or two from the coroner and the foreman of the jury he make a motion as if to step down but spargo who have be aware since the beginning of the enquiry of the presence of a certain eminent counsel who represent the treasury cock he eye in that gentleman 's direction and be not surprise to see he rise in he well-known apparently indifferent fashion fix he monocle in he right eye and glance at the tall figure in the witness-box the fun be go to begin muttered spargo the treasury representative look from aylmore to the coroner and make a jerky bow from the coroner to aylmore and straighten himself he look like a man who be go to ask indifferent question about the state of the weather or how smith 's wife be last time you hear of she or if stock be likely to rise or fall but spargo have hear this man before and he know many sign of he in voice and manner and glance i want to ask you a few question mr aylmore about you acquaintanceship with the dead man it be a acquaintanceship of some time ago begin the suave seemingly careless voice a considerable time ago answer aylmore how long -- roughly speak i should say from twenty to twenty-two or three year never see he during that time until you meet accidentally in the way you have describe to we never ever hear from he no ever hear of he no but when you meet you know each other at once well -- almost at once almost at once then i take it you be very well know to

of marbury and of what happen when i meet he the other evening but i resent be question on my private affair of twenty year ago -- i very much resent it any question that be really pertinent i will answer but i will not answer question that seem to I wholly foreign to the scope of this enquiry the treasury counsel rise again he manner have become of the quietest and spargo again become keenly attentive perhaps i can put a question or two to mr aylmore which will not yield he offence he remark drily he turn once more to the witness regard he as if with interest can you tell we of any person

the counsel look again at the witness one more question you tell the court a little time since that you part with marbury on the evening precede he death at the end of waterloo bridge -- at i think you say a quarter to twelve about that time and at that place yes that be all i want to ask you mr aylmore -- just now say the counsel he turn to the coroner i be go to ask you sir at this point to call a witness who have volunteer certain evidence to the police authority this morning that evidence be of a very important nature and i think that this be the stage at which it ought to be give to

come into view usher by the clerk a smart-looking alert self-confident young man evidently a scotsman who on the name of david lyell be call step jauntily and readily into the place which the member of parliament just vacate he take the oath -- scotch fashion -- with the same readiness and turn easily to the treasury counsel and spargo glancing quickly round saw that the court be breathless with

i do i could swear no other sir can you tell we as near as possible what time that would be yes it be to a minute or so about five minute past twelve the treasury counsel nod to the coroner and the

and that he be not then at all ready to give explanation or even to answer question he say and before you allow he to make any explanation now i ask you to hear another witness whom i wish to interpose at this stage that witness be -- mr aylmore turn almost angrily to the coroner after the evidence of the last witness i think i have a right to be hear at once he say with emphasis as matter

the witness i have refer to be hear say the treasury counsel sternly there be weighty reason i be afraid you must wait a little mr aylmore if you wish to give a explanation say the coroner he turn to the counsel who be this other witness he ask aylmore step back and spargo notice that the younger of he two daughter be stare at he with a anxious expression there be no distrust of she father in she face she be anxious she too slowly turn to the next witness this man be the porter of the embankment lodge of middle temple lane the treasury counsel put a straight question to he at once you see that gentleman he say point to aylmore do you know he as a inmate of the temple the man stare at aylmore evidently confuse why certainly sir he answer quite well sir very good and now -- what name do you know he by the man grow evidently more bewildered name sir why mr anderson sir he reply mr anderson chapter thirteen under suspicion a distinct uncontrollable murmur of surprise run round the packed court as this man in the witness-box give this answer it signify many thing -- that there be people present who have expect some such dramatic development that there be other present who have not that the answer itself be only a prelude to further development and spargo look narrowly about he see that the answer have arouse different feeling in aylmore 's two daughter the elder one have drop she face until it be quite hide the younger be sit bolt upright stare at she father in utter and genuine bewilderment and for the first time aylmore make no response to she but the course of thing be go steadily forward there be no stop the treasury counsel now he be go to get at some truth in he own merciless fashion he have exchange one glance with the coroner have whisper a word to the solicitor who sit close by he and now he turn again to the witness so you know that gentleman -- make sure now -- as mr anderson a inmate of the temple yes sir you do not know he by any other name no sir i do not how long have you know he by that name i should say two or three year sir see he go in and out regularly no sir -- not regularly how often then now and then sir -- perhaps once a week tell we what

what i have tell you sir that be that the other gentleman wear a gray suit where do mr anderson and this gentleman in the gray suit go when they would pass through straight up the lane sir do you know where mr anderson 's room in the temple be not exactly sir but i understand in fountain court now on that night in question do mr anderson leave again by you lodge no sir you hear of the discovery of the body of a dead man in middle temple lane next morning i do sir do you connect that man with the gentleman in the gray suit no sir i do not it never occur to I a lot of the gentleman who live in

never know the gentleman standing there as anybody but mr anderson no sir never hear any other name but anderson the coroner glance at the counsel i think this may be a convenient opportunity for mr aylmore to give the explanation he offer a few minute ago he say do you suggest anything i suggest sir that if mr aylmore desire to give any explanation he should return to the witness-box and submit himself to examination again on he oath reply the counsel the matter be in you hand the coroner turn to aylmore do you object to that he ask aylmore step boldly forward and into the box i object to nothing he say in clear tone except to be ask to reply to question about matter of the past which have not and can not have anything to do with this case ask I what question you like arise out of the evidence of the last two witness and i will answer they so far as i see myself justified in do so ask I question about matter of twenty year ago and i shall answer they or not as i see fit and i may as well say that i will take all the consequence of my silence or my speech the treasury counsel rise again very well mr aylmore he say i will put certain question to you you hear the evidence of david lyell i do be that quite true as regard yourself quite true -- absolutely true and you hear that of the last witness be that also true equally true then you admit that the evidence you give this morning before these witness come on the scene be not true no i do not most emphatically i do not it be true true you tell I on oath that you part from john marbury on waterloo bridge pardon I i say nothing of the sort i say that from the anglo-orient hotel we stroll across waterloo bridge and that shortly afterwards we part -- i do not say where we part i see there be a shorthand writer here who be take everything down -- ask he if that be not exactly what i say a reference to the stenographer prove aylmore to be right and the treasury counsel show plain annoyance well at any rate you so phrased you answer that nine person out of ten would have understand that you part from marbury in the open street after cross waterloo bridge he say now -- aylmore smile i be not responsible for the understanding of nine people out of ten any more than i be for you understanding he say with a sneer i say what i now repeat -- marbury and i walk across waterloo bridge and shortly afterwards we part i tell you the truth indeed perhaps you will continue to tell we the truth since you have admit that the evidence of the last two witness be absolutely correct perhaps you will tell we exactly where you and marbury do part i will -- willingly we part at the door of my chamber in fountain court then -- to reiterate -- it be you who take marbury into the temple that night it be certainly i who take marbury into the temple that night there be another murmur amongst the crowded bench here at any rate be fact -- solid substantial fact and spargo begin to see a possible course of event which he have not anticipate that be a candid admission mr aylmore i suppose you see a certain danger to yourself in make it i need not say whether i do or i do not i have make it very good why do you not make it before for my own reason i tell you as much as i consider necessary for the purpose of this enquiry i have virtually altered nothing now i ask to be allow to make a statement to give a explanation as soon as mr lyell have leave this box : i be not allow to do so i be willing to make it now make it then it be simply this say aylmore turn to the coroner i have find it convenient during the past three year to rent a simple set of chamber in the temple where i could occasionally -- very occasionally as a rule -- go late at night i also find it convenient for my own reason -- with which i think no one have anything to do -- to rent those chamber under the name of mr anderson it be to my chamber that marbury accompany I for a few moment on the midnight with which we be deal he be not in they more than five minute at the very outside : i part from he at my outer door and i understand that he would leave the temple by the way we have enter and would drive or walk straight back to he hotel that be the whole truth i wish to add that i ought perhaps to have tell all this at first i have reason for not do so i tell what i consider necessary that i parted from marbury leave he well and alive soon after midnight what reason be or be they which prevent you from tell all this at first ask the treasury counsel reason which be private to I will you tell they to the court no then will you tell we why marbury go with you to the chamber in fountain court which you tenant under the name of anderson yes to fetch a document which i have in my keep and have keep for he for twenty year or more a document of importance of very great importance he would have it on he when he be -- as we believe he be -- murder and rob he have it on he when he leave I will you tell we what it be certainly not in fact you will not tell we any more than you choose to tell i have tell you all i can tell of the event of that night then i be go to ask you a very pertinent question be it not a fact that you know a great deal more about john marbury than you have tell this court that i shall not answer be it not a fact that you could if you would tell this court more about john marbury and you acquaintanceship with he twenty year ago i also decline to answer that the treasury counsel make a little movement of he shoulder and turn to the coroner i should suggest sir that you adjourn this enquiry he say quietly for a week assent the coroner turn to the jury the crowd surge out of the court chatter murmur exclaim -- spectator witness jurymen reporter legal folk police folk all mix up together and spargo elbow he own way out and busily reckon up the value of the new complexion put on everything by the day 's work suddenly feel a hand lay on he arm turn he find himself gaze at

for the extraordinary space of ten minute and after that spargo go home and fall into bed but next morning bright and early he be on the departure platform at paddington suit-case in hand and ticket in pocket for market milcaster and in the course of that afternoon he find himself in a old-fashioned bedroom look out on market milcaster high street and there right opposite he he see a ancient house old brick ivy-covered with a office at its side over the door of which be the name _ benjamin quarterpage _ chapter sixteen the yellow dragon spargo change he clothes wash away the dust of he journey in that old-fashioned lavender-scented bedroom busy he mind in further speculation on he plan of campaign in market milcaster he have no particularly clear plan the one thing he be certain of be that in the old leather box which the man whom he know as john marbury have deposit with the london and universal safe deposit company he and rathbury have discover one of the old silver ticket of market milcaster racecourse and that he spargo have come to market milcaster with the full approval of he editor in a endeavor to trace it how be he go to set about this difficult task the first thing say spargo to himself as he tie a new tie be to have a look round that 'll be no long job for he have already see as he approach the town and as he drive from the station to the yellow dragon hotel that market milcaster be a very small place it chiefly consist of one long wide thoroughfare -- the high street -- with smaller street lead from it on either side in the high street seem to be everything that the town could show -- the ancient parish church the town hall the market cross the principal house and shop the bridge beneath which run the river whereon ship have once come up to the town before its mouth four mile away become impassably silt up it be a bright clean little town but there be few sign of trade in it and spargo have be quick to notice that in the yellow dragon a big rambling old hostelry reminiscent of the old coaching day there seem to be little do he have eat a bit of lunch in the coffee-room immediately on he arrival the coffee-room be big enough to accommodate a hundred and fifty people but beyond himself a old gentleman and he daughter evidently tourist two young man talk golf a man who look like a artist and a unmistakable honeymoon couple there be no one in it there be little traffic in the wide street beneath spargo 's window little passage of people to and fro on the sidewalk here a countryman drive a lazy cow as lazily along there a farmer in he light cart sit idly chat with a aproned tradesman who have come out of he shop to talk to he over everything lay the quiet of the sunlight of the summer afternoon and through the open window steal a faint sweet scent of the new-mown hay lie in the meadow outside the old house a veritable sleepy hollow mused spargo let 's go down and see if there be anybody to talk to great scott -- to think that i be in the poisonous atmosphere of the octoneumenous only sixteen hour ago spargo after lose himself in various corridor and passage finally land in the wide stone-paved hall of the old hotel and with a sure instinct turn into the bar-parlour which he have notice when he enter the place this be a roomy comfortable bow-windowed apartment look out upon the high street and be furnished and ornamented with the usual appurtenance of country-town hotel there be old chair and table and sideboard and cupboard which have certainly be make a century before and seem likely to endure for a century or two longer there be old print of the road and the chase and a old oil-painting or two of red-faced gentleman in pink coat there be fox ' mask on the wall and a monster pike in a glass case on a side-table there be ancient candlestick on the mantelpiece and a antique snuff-box set between they also there be a small old-fashioned bar in a corner of the room and a new-fashioned young woman seat behind it who be yawn over a piece of fancy needlework and look at spargo when he enter as andromeda may have look at perseus when he make arrival at she rock and spargo treat himself to a suitable drink and choose a cigar to accompany it note the look and drop into the nearest chair this he remark eye the damsel with enquiry appear to I to be a very quiet place quiet exclaim the lady quiet that continue spargo be precisely what i observe quiet i see that you agree with I you express you agreement with two shades of emphasis the surprised and the scornful we may conclude thus far that the place be undoubtedly quiet the damsel look at spargo as if she consider he in the light of a new specimen and pick up she needlework she quit the bar and come out into the room take a chair near he own it make you thankful to see a funeral go by here she remark it be about all that one ever do see be there many ask spargo do the inhabitant die much of inanition the damsel give spargo another critical inspection oh you be joke she say it be well you can nothing ever happen here this place be a back number even the back number make pleasant reading at time murmur spargo and the backwater of life be refreshing nothing do in this town then he add in a louder voice nothing reply he companion it be fast asleep i come here from birmingham and i do not know what i be come to in birmingham you see as many people in ten minute as you see here in ten month ah say spargo what you be suffer from be dulness you must have a antidote dulness exclaim the damsel that be the right word for market milcaster there be just a few regular old customer drop in here of a morning between eleven and one a stray caller look in -- perhaps -- during the afternoon then at night a lot of old fogy sit round that end of the room and talk about old time old time indeed -- what they want in market milcaster be new time spargo prick up he ear well but it be rather interesting to hear old fogy talk about old time he say i love it then you can get as much of it as ever you want here remark the barmaid look in tonight any time after eight o'clock and if you do not know more about the history of market milcaster by ten than you do when you sit down you must be deaf there be some old gentleman drop in here every night regular as clockwork who seem to feel that they could not go to bed unless they have tell each other story about old day which i should think they have hear a thousand time already very old man ask spargo methuselah reply the lady there be old mr quarterpage across the way

eighty-one and mr skene and mr kaye -- they be regular patriarch i have sit here and listen to they till i believe i could write a history of market milcaster since the year one i can conceive of that as a pleasant and profitable occupation say spargo he chat a while longer in a fashion calculate to cheer the barmaid 's spirit after which he go out and stroll around the town until seven o'clock the dragon 's hour for dinner there be no more people in the big coffee-room than there have be at lunch and spargo be glad when he solitary meal be over to escape to the bar-parlour where he take he coffee in a corner near to that sacred part in which the old townsman have be report to he to sit and mind you do not sit in one of they chair say the barmaid warningly they all have they own special chair and they special pipe there on that rack and i suppose the ceiling would fall in if anybody touch pipe or chair but you be all right there and you 'll hear all they have get to say to spargo who have never see anything of the sort before and who twenty-four hour previously would have believe the thing impossible the proceedings of that evening in the bar-parlour of the yellow dragon at market milcaster be like a sudden transference to the eighteenth century precisely as the clock strike eight and a bell begin to toll somewhere in the recess of the high street a old gentleman walk in and the barmaid catch spargo 's eye give he a glance which show that the play be about to begin good evening mr kaye say the barmaid you be first tonight evening say mr kaye and take a seat scowl around he and become silent he be a tall lank old gentleman clothe in rusty black clothes with a pointed collar stick up on both side of he fringe of gray whisker and a voluminous black neckcloth fold several time round he neck and by the expression of he countenance be incline to look on life severely nobody be in yet ask mr kaye no but here 's mr lummi and mr skene reply the barmaid two more old gentleman enter the bar-parlour of these one be a little dapper-figured man clothe in clothes of a eminently sport cut and of very loud pattern he sport a bright blue necktie a flower in he lapel and a tall white hat which he wear at a rakish angle the other be a big portly bearded man with a falstaffian swagger and a rakish eye who chaff the barmaid as he enter and give she a good-humoured chuck under the chin as he pass she these two also sink into chair which seem to have be specially design to meet they and the stout man slap the arm of he as familiarly as he have greet the barmaid he look at he two crony well he say here 's three of we and there be a symposium wait a bit wait a bit say the dapper little man grandpa 'll be here in a minute we 'll start fair the barmaid glance out of the window there be mr quarterpage come across the street now she announce shall i put the thing on the table aye put they on my dear put they on command the fat man have all in readiness the barmaid thereupon place a round table before the sacred chair set out upon it a fine old punch-bowl and the various ingredient for make punch a box of cigar and a old leaden tobacco-box and she have just complete this interesting prelude to the evening 's discourse when the door open again and in walk one of the most remarkable old man spargo have ever see and by this time know that this be the venerable mr benjamin quarterpage of whom crowfoot have tell he he take good stock of the newcomer as he take he place amongst he friend who on they part receive he with ebullition of delight which be positively boyish mr quarterpage be a youthful buck of ninety -- a middle-sized sturdily-built man straight as a dart still active of limb clear-eyed and strong of voice he clean-shaven old countenance be ruddy as a sun-warmed pippin he hair be still only silver he hand be steady as a rock he clothes of buff-coloured whipcord be smart and jaunty he neckerchief as gay as if he have be go

take a cigar and the tongue begin to wag other folk come and go the old gentleman be oblivious of anything but they own talk now and then a young gentleman of the town drop in to take he modest half-pint of bitter beer and to dally in the presence of the barmaid such look with awe at the patriarch : as for the patriarch themselves they be lose in the past spargo begin to understand what the damsel behind the bar mean when she say that she believe she could write a history of market milcaster since the year one after discuss the weather the local event of the day and various personal matter the old fellow get to reminiscence of the past tell tale after tale recall incident upon incident of long year before at last they turn to memory of racing day at market milcaster and at that spargo determine on a bold stroke now be the time to get some information take the silver ticket from he purse he lay it the heraldic device uppermost on the palm of he hand and approach the group with a polite bow say quietly : gentleman can any of you tell I anything about that chapter seventeen mr quarterpage hark back if spargo have upset the old gentleman 's bowl of punch -- the second of

walk encyclopedia my memory be good say mr quarterpage it be the greatest blessing i have in my decline year yes i be sure i could do that with a little thought and what be more nearly every one of those fifty family be still in the town or if not in the town close by it or if not close by it i know where they be therefore i can not make out how this young gentleman -- from london do you say sir from london answer spargo this young gentleman from london come to be in possession of one of we ticket continue mr quarterpage it be -- wonderful but i tell you what young gentleman from london if you will do I the honor to breakfast with I in the morning sir i will show you my racing book and papers and we will speedily discover who the original holder of that ticket be my name sir be quarterpage -- benjamin quarterpage -- and i reside at the ivy-covered house exactly opposite this inn and my breakfast hour be nine o'clock sharp and i shall bid you heartily welcome spargo make he best bow sir he say i be greatly oblige by you kind invitation and i shall consider it a honor to wait upon you to the moment accordingly at five minute to nine next morning spargo find himself in a old-fashioned parlor look out upon a delightful garden gay with summer flower and be introduce by mr quarterpage senior to mr quarterpage junior -- a pleasant gentleman of sixty always refer to by he father as something quite juvenile -- and to miss quarterpage a young-old lady of something a little less elderly than she brother and to a breakfast table bounteously spread with all the choice fare of the season mr quarterpage senior be as fresh and rosy as a cherub it be a revelation to spargo to encounter so old a man who be still in possession of such life and spirit and of such a vigorous and healthy appetite naturally the talk over the breakfast table run on spargo 's possession of the old silver ticket upon which subject it be evident mr quarterpage be still exercise he intellect and spargo who have judge it well to enlighten he host as to who he be and have exhibit a letter with which the editor of the _ watchman _ have furnish he tell how in the exercise of he journalistic duty he have discover the ticket in the lining of a old box but he make no mention of the marbury matter be anxious to see first whither mr quarterpage 's revelation would lead he you have no idea mr spargo say the old gentleman when breakfast over he and spargo be closet together in a little library in which be abundant evidence of the host 's taste in sport matter you have no idea of the value which be attach to the possession of one of those silver ticket there be mine as you see securely frame and just as securely fasten to the wall those fifty silver ticket my dear sir be make when we old race-meeting be initiate in the year 1781 they be make in the town by a local silversmith whose great-great-grandson still carry on the business the fifty be distribute amongst the fifty lead burgess of the town to be keep in they family for ever -- nobody ever anticipate in those day that we race-meeting would ever be discontinue the ticket carry great privilege it make its holder and all member of he family male and female free of the stand ring and paddock it give the holder himself and he eldest son if of age the right to a seat at we grand race banquet -- at which i may tell you mr spargo royalty itself have be present in the good old day consequently as you see to be the holder of a silver ticket be to be somebody and when the race-meeting fall through ask spargo what then then of course the family who hold the ticket look upon they as heirloom to be take great care of reply mr quarterpage they be deal with as i deal with mine -- frame on velvet and hang up -- or lock away : i be sure that anybody who have one take the greatest care of it now i say last night over there at the ` dragon ' that i could repeat the name of all the family who hold these ticket so i can but here -- the old gentleman draw out a drawer and produce from it a parchment-bound book which he handle with great reverence -- here be a little volume of my own handwriting -- memorandum relate to market milcaster race -- in which be a list of the original holder together with another list show who hold the ticket when the race be give up i make bold to say mr spargo that by go through the second list i could trace every ticket -- except the one you have in you purse every one say spargo in some surprise every one for as i tell you continue mr quarterpage the family be either in the town -lrb- we be a conservative people here in market milcaster and we do not move far afield -rrb- or they be just outside the town or they be not far away i can not conceive how the ticket you have -- and it be genuine enough -- could ever get out of possession of one of these family and -- perhaps suggest spargo it never have be out of possession i tell you it be find in the lining of a box -- that box belong to a dead man a dead man exclaim mr quarterpage a dead man who could -- ah perhaps -- perhaps i have a idea yes -- a idea i remember something now that i have never think of the old gentleman unfasten the clasp of he parchment-bound book and turn over its page until he come to one whereon be a list of name he point this out to spargo there be the list of holder of the silver ticket at the time the race-meetings come to a end he say if you be acquaint with this town you would know that those be the name of we best-known inhabitant -- all of course burgess there be mine you see -- quarterpage there be lummi there be kaye there be skene there be templeby -- the gentleman you see last night all good old town name they all be -- on this list i know every family mention the holder of that time be many of they dead but they successor have the ticket yes -- and now that i think of it there be only one man who hold a ticket when this list be make about whom i do not know anything -- at least anything recent the ticket mr spargo which you have find must have be he but i think -- i think somebody else have it and this man sir who be he ask spargo intuitively conscious that he be come to news be he name there the old man run the tip of he finger down the list of name there it be he say john maitland spargo bent over the fine writing yes john maitland he observe and who be john maitland mr quarterpage shake he head he turn to another of the many drawer in a ancient bureau and begin to search amongst a mass of old newspaper carefully sort into small bundle and tie up if you have live in market milcaster one-and-twenty year ago mr spargo he say you would have know who john maitland be for some time sir he be the best-known man in the place -- aye and in this corner of the world but -- aye here it be -- the newspaper of October 5th 1891 now mr spargo you 'll find in this old newspaper who john maitland be and all about he now i 'll tell you what to do i have just get to go into my office for a hour to talk the day 's business over with my son -- you take this newspaper out into the garden there with one of these cigar and read what 'll you find in it and when you have read that we 'll have some more talk spargo carry the old newspaper into the sunlit garden chapter eighteen a old newspaper as soon as spargo unfold the paper he see what he want on the middle page head in two line of big capital he light a cigar and settle down to read market milcaster quarter session trial of john maitland the quarter session for the borough of market milcaster be hold on Wednesday last October 3rd 1891 in the town hall before the recorder henry john campernowne esq kc who be accompany on the bench by the worshipful the mayor of market milcaster -lrb- alderman pettiford -rrb- the vicar of market milcaster -lrb- the rev pb clabberton ma rd -rrb- alderman bank jp alderman peter jp sir gervai racton jp colonel fludgate jp captain murrill jp and other magistrate and gentleman there be a crowd attendance of the public in anticipation of the trial of john maitland ex-manager of the market milcaster bank and the reserved portion of the court be fill with the _ élite _ of the town and neighborhood include a considerable number of lady who manifest the greatest interest in the proceedings the recorder in charge the grand jury say he regret that the very pleasant and gratifying experience which have be he upon the occasion of he last two official visit to market milcaster -- he refer to the fact that on both those occasion he friend the worshipful mayor have be able to present he with a pair of white glove -- be not to be repeat on the present occasion it would be they sad and regrettable lot to have before they a fellow-townsman whose family have for generation occupy a foremost position in the life of the borough that fellow-townsman be charge with one of the most serious offence know to a commercial nation like ours : the offence of embezzle the money of the bank of which he have for many year be the trust manager and with which he have be connect all he life since he school day he understand that the prisoner who would shortly be put before the court on he trial be about to plead guilty and there would accordingly be no need for he to direct the gentleman of the grand jury on this matter -- what he have to say respect the gravity and even enormity of the offence he would reserve the recorder then address himself to the grand jury on the merit of two minor case which come before the court at a later period of the morning after which they retire and have formally return a true bill against the prisoner and a petty jury choose from well-known burgess of the town have be duly swear john maitland aged 42 bank manager of the bank house high street market milcaster be formally charge with embezzle on April 23rd 1891 the sum of # 4875 10_s _ 6_d _ the money of he employer the market milcaster banking company ltd and convert the same to he own use the prisoner who appear to feel he position most acutely and who look very pale and much worn be represent by mr charle doolittle the well-known barrister of kingshaven mr stephen kc appear on behalf of the prosecution maitland upon be charge plead guilty mr stephen kc address the recorder say that without any desire to unduly press upon the prisoner who he venture to think have take a very wise course in plead guilty to that particular count in the indictment with which he stand charge he feel bind in the interest of justice to set forth to the court some particulars of the defalcation which have arise through the prisoner 's much lament dishonesty he propose to offer a clear and succinct account of the matter the prisoner john maitland be the last of a old market milcaster family -- he be in fact he believe with the exception of he own infant son the very last of the race he father have be manager of the bank before he maitland himself have enter the service of the bank at the age of eighteen when he leave the local grammar school he succeed he father as manager at the age of thirty-two he have therefore occupy this highest position of trust for ten year he director have the fullest confidence in he they rely on he honesty and he honor they give he discretionary power such as no bank-manager probably ever enjoy or hold before in fact he be so trust that he be to all intent and purpose the market milcaster banking company in other word he be allow full control over everything and give full licence to do what he like whether the director be wise in extend such liberty to even the most trust servant it be not for he -lrb- mr stephen -rrb- to say it be some consolation under the circumstance to know that the loss would fall upon the director inasmuch as they themselves hold nearly the whole of the share but he have to speak of the loss -- of the serious defalcation which maitland have commit the prisoner have wisely plead guilty to the first count of the indictment but there be no less than seventeen count in the indictment he have plead guilty to embezzle a sum of # 4875 odd but the total amount of the defalcation comprise in the seventeen count be no less -- it seem a most amazing sum -- than # 221573 8_s _ 6_d _ there be the fact -- the banking company have be rob of over two hundred thousand pound by the prisoner in the dock before a mere accident the most trifling chance have reveal to the astounded director that he be rob they at all and the most serious feature of the whole case be that not one penny of this money have be or ever could be recover he believe that the prisoner 's learn counsel be about to urge upon the court that the prisoner himself have be trick and deceive by another man unfortunately not before the court -- a man he understand also well know in market milcaster who be now dead and therefore could not be call but whether he be so trick or deceive be no excuse for he clever and wholesale rob of he employer he have think it necessary to put these fact -- which would not be deny -- before the court in order that it might be know how heavy the defalcation really have be and that they should be consider in deal with the prisoner the recorder ask if there be no possibility of recover any part of the vast sum concerned mr stephen reply that they be inform that there be not the remotest chance -- the money it be say by prisoner and those act on he behalf have utterly vanish with the death of the man to whom he have just make reference mr doolittle on behalf of the prisoner crave to address a few word to the court in mitigation of sentence he thank mr stephen for the considerate and eminently dispassionate manner in which he have outline the main fact of the case he have no desire to minimize the prisoner 's guilt but on prisoner 's behalf he desire to tell the true story as to how these thing come to be until as recently as three year previously the prisoner have never make the slightest deviation from the straight path of integrity unfortunately for he and he believe for some other in market milcaster there come to the town three year before the present proceedings a man name chamberlayne who commence business in the high street as a stock-and-share broker a man of good address and the most plausible manners chamberlayne attract a good many people -- amongst they he unfortunate client it be matter of common knowledge that chamberlayne have induce numerous person in market milcaster to enter into financial transaction with he it be matter of common repute that those transaction have not always turn out well for chamberlayne 's client unhappily for himself maitland have great faith in chamberlayne he have begin to have transaction with he in a large way they have go on and on in a large way until he be involve to vast amount believe thoroughly in chamberlayne and he method he have entrust he with very large sum of money the recorder interrupted mr doolittle at this point to ask if he be to understand that mr doolittle be refer to the prisoner 's own money mr doolittle reply that he be afraid the large sum he refer to be the property of the bank but the prisoner have such belief in chamberlayne that he firmly anticipate that all would be well and that these sum would be repay and that a vast profit would result from they use the recorder remark that he suppose the prisoner intend to put the profit into he own pocket mr doolittle say at any rate the prisoner assure he that of the two hundred and twenty thousand pound which be in question chamberlayne have have the immediate handling of at least two hundred thousand and he the prisoner have not the ghost of a notion as to what chamberlayne have do with it unfortunately for everybody for the bank for some other people and especially for he unhappy client chamberlayne die very suddenly just as these proceedings be institute and so far it have be absolutely impossible to trace anything of the money concern he have die under mysterious circumstance and there be just as much mystery about he affair the recorder observe that he be still wait to hear what mr doolittle have to urge in mitigation of any sentence he the recorder might think fit to pass mr doolittle say that he would trouble the court with as few remark as possible all that he could urge on behalf of the unfortunate man in the dock be that until three year ago he have bear a most exemplary character and have never commit a dishonest action it have be he misfortune he folly to allow a plausible man to persuade he to these act of dishonesty that man have be call to another account and the prisoner be leave to bear the consequence of he association with he it seem as if chamberlayne have make away with the money for he own purpose and it might be that it would yet be recover he would only ask the court to remember the prisoner 's antecedent and he previous good conduct and to bear in mind that whatever he near future might be he be in a commercial sense ruin for life the recorder in pass sentence say that he have not hear a single word of valid excuse for maitland 's conduct such dishonesty must be punish in the most severe fashion and the prisoner must go to penal servitude for ten year maitland who hear the sentence unmoved be remove from the town later in the day to the county jail at saxchester spargo read all this swiftly then go over it again note certain point in it at last he fold up the newspaper and turn to the house -- to see old quarterpage beckon to he from the library window chapter nineteen the chamberlayne story i perceive sir say mr quarterpage as spargo enter the library that you have read the account of the maitland trial twice reply spargo and you have come to the conclusion that -- but what conclusion have you come to asked mr quarterpage that the silver ticket in my purse be maitland 's property say spargo who be not go to give all he conclusion at once just so agree the old gentleman i think so -- i can not think anything else but i be under the impression that i could have account for that ticket just as i be sure i can account for the other forty-nine yes -- and how asked spargo mr quarterpage turn to a corner cupboard and in silence produce a decanter and two curiously-shaped old wine-glass he carefully polish the glass with a cloth which he take from a drawer and set glass and decanter on a table in the window motion spargo to take a chair in proximity thereto he himself pull up he own elbow-chair we 'll take a glass of my old brown sherry he say though i say it as should not as the say go i do not think you could find better brown sherry than that from land 's end to berwick-upon-tweed mr spargo -- no nor further north either where they use to have good taste in liquor in my young day well here 's you good health sir and i 'll tell you about maitland i be curious say spargo and about more than maitland i want to know about a lot of thing arise out of that newspaper report i want to know something about the man refer to so much -- the stockbroker chamberlayne just so observe mr quarterpage smile i think that would touch you sense of the inquisitive but maitland first now when maitland go to prison he leave behind he a child a boy just then about two year old the child 's mother be dead she sister a miss bayli appear on the scene -- maitland have marry he wife from a distance -- and take possession of the child and of maitland 's personal effect he have be make bankrupt while he be await he trial and all he household goods be sell but this miss bayli take some small personal thing and i always believe that she take the silver ticket and she may have do for anything i know to the contrary anyway she take the child away and there be a end of the maitland family in market milcaster maitland of course be in due procedure of thing remove to dartmoor and there he serve he term there be people who be very anxious to get hold of he when he come out -- the bank people for they believe that he know more about the disposition of that money than he would ever tell and they want to induce he to tell what they hope he know -- between ourselves mr spargo they be go to make it worth he while to tell spargo tap the newspaper which he have retain while the old gentleman talk then they do not believe what he counsel say -- that chamberlayne get all the money he ask mr quarterpage laugh no -- nor anybody else he answer there be a strong idea in the town -- you 'll see why afterwards -- that it be all a put-up job and that maitland cheerfully undergo he punishment know that there be a nice fortune wait for he when he come out and as i say the bank people mean to get hold of he but though they send a special agent to meet he on he release they never do get hold of he some mistake arise -- when maitland be release he get clear away nobody 's ever hear a word of he from that day to this unless miss bayli have where do this miss bayli live ask spargo well i do not know reply mr quarterpage she do live in brighton when she take the child away and she address be know and i have it somewhere but when the bank people seek she out after maitland 's release she too have clean disappear and all effort to trace she fail in fact accord to the folk who live near she in brighton she have completely disappear with the child five year before so there be not a clue to maitland he serve he time -- make a model prisoner -- they do find that much out -- earn the maximum remission be release and vanish and for that very reason there be a theory about he in this very town to this very day what ask spargo this that he be now live comfortably luxuriously abroad on what he get from the bank reply mr quarterpage they say that the sister-in-law be in at the game that when she disappear with the child she go abroad somewhere and make a home ready for maitland and that he go off to they as soon as he come out do you see i suppose that be possible say spargo quite possible sir but now continue the old gentleman replenish the glass now we come on to the chamberlayne story it be a good deal more to do with the maitland story than appear at first sight i 'll tell it to you and you can form you own conclusion chamberlayne be a man who come to market milcaster -- i do not know from where -- in 1886 -- five year before the maitland smash-up he be then about maitland 's age -- a man of thirty-seven or eight he come as clerk to old mr valla the rope and twine manufacturer : valla 's place be still there at the bottom of the high street near the river though old valla be dead he be a smart cute push chap this chamberlayne he make himself indispensable to old valla and old valla pay he a rare good salary he settle down in the town and he marry a town girl one of the corkindale the saddler when he would be here three year unfortunately she die in childbirth within a year of they marriage it be very soon after that that chamberlayne throw up he post at valla 's and start business as a stock-and - share broker he have be a saving man he would get a nice bit of money with he wife he always let it be know that he have money of he own and he start in a good way he be a man of the most plausible manners : he would have coax butter out of a dog 's throat if he would want to the moneyed man of the town believe in he -- i believe in he myself mr spargo -- i would many a transaction with he and i never lose aught by he -- on the contrary he do very well for I he do well for most of he client -- there be of course up and downs but on the whole he satisfy he client uncommonly well but naturally nobody ever know what be go on between he and maitland i gather from this report say spargo that everything come out suddenly -- unexpectedly that be so sir reply mr quarterpage sudden unexpected aye as a crack of thunder on a fine winter 's day nobody have the ghost of a notion that anything be wrong john maitland be much respect in the town much thought of by everybody well know to everybody i can assure you mr spargo that it be no pleasant thing to have to sit on that grand jury as i do -- i be its foreman sir -- and hear a man sentence that you would regard as a bosom friend but there it be how be the thing discover ask spargo anxious to get at fact in this way reply mr quarterpage the market milcaster bank be in reality almost entirely the property of two old family in the town the gutchby and the hostable owe to the death of he father a young hostable fresh from college come into the business he be a shrewd keen young fellow he get some suspicion somehow about maitland and he insist on the other partner consent to a special investigation and on they make it suddenly and maitland be catch before he have a chance but we be talk about chamberlayne yes about chamberlayne agree spargo well now maitland be arrest one evening continue mr quarterpage of course the news of he arrest run through the town like wild-fire everybody be astonished he be at that time -- aye and have be for year -- a churchwarden at the parish church and i do not think there could have be more surprise if we would hear that the vicar have be arrest for bigamy in a little town like this news be all over the place in a few minute of course chamberlayne would hear that news like everybody else but it be remembered and often remark upon afterwards that from the moment of maitland 's arrest nobody in market milcaster ever have speech with chamberlayne again after he wife 's death he have take to spend a hour or so of a evening across there at the ` dragon ' where you see I and my friend last night but on that night he do not go to the ` dragon ' and next morning he catch the eight o'clock train to london he happen to remark to the stationmaster as he get into the train that he expect to be back late that night and that he should have a tiring day of it but chamberlayne do not come back that night mr spargo he do not come back to market milcaster for four day and when he do come back it be in a coffin dead exclaimed spargo that be sudden very sudden agree mr quarterpage yes sir he come back in he coffin do chamberlayne on the very evening on which he would speak of be back there come a telegram here to say that he would die very suddenly at the cosmopolitan hotel that telegram come to he brother-in-law corkindale the saddler -- you 'll find he down the street opposite the town hall it be send to corkindale by a nephew of chamberlayne 's another chamberlayne stephen who live in london and be understand to be on the stock exchange there i see that telegram mr spargo and it be a long one it say that chamberlayne have have a sudden seizure and though a doctor have be get to he he would die shortly afterwards now as chamberlayne have he nephew and friend in london he brother-in-law tom corkindale do not feel that there be any necessity for he to go up to town so he just send off a wire to stephen chamberlayne ask if there be aught he could do and next morning come another wire from stephen say that no inquest would be necessary as the doctor have be present and able to certify the cause of death and would corkindale make all arrangement for the funeral two day later you see chamberlayne have buy a vault in we cemetery when he bury he wife so naturally they wish to bury he in it with she spargo nod he be begin to imagine all sort of thing and theory he be take everything in well continue mr quarterpage on the second day after that they bring chamberlayne 's body down three of 'em come with it -- stephen chamberlayne the doctor who have be call in and a solicitor everything be do accord to proper form and usage as chamberlayne have be well know in the town a good number of townsfolk meet the body at the station and follow it to the cemetery of course many of we who have be client of chamberlayne 's be anxious to know how he have come to such a sudden end accord to stephen chamberlayne 's account we chamberlayne have wire to he and to he solicitor to meet he at the cosmopolitan to do some business they be await he there when he arrive and they have lunch together after that they get to they business in a private room towards the end of the afternoon chamberlayne be take suddenly ill and though they get a doctor to he at once he die before evening the doctor say he have a diseased heart anyhow he be able to certify the cause of he death so there be no inquest and they bury he as i have tell you the old gentleman pause and take a sip at he sherry smile at some reminiscence which occur to he well he say presently go on of course on that come all the maitland revelation and maitland vow and declare that chamberlayne have not only have nearly all the money but that he be absolutely certain that most of it be in he hand in hard cash but chamberlayne mr spargo have leave practically nothing all that could be trace be about three or four thousand pound he would leave everything to he nephew stephen there be not a trace a clue to the vast sum with which maitland have entrust he and then people begin to talk and they say what some of they say to this very day what be that ask spargo mr quarterpage lean forward and tap he guest on the arm that chamberlayne never do die and that that coffin be weight with lead he answer chapter twenty maitland _ alia _ marbury this remarkable declaration awake such a new conception of matter in spargo 's mind arouse such infinitely new possibility in he imagination that for a full moment he sit silently stare at he informant who chuckle with quiet enjoyment at he visitor 's surprise do you mean to tell I say spargo at last that there be people in this town who still believe that the coffin in you cemetery which be say to contain chamberlayne 's body contain -- lead lot of 'em my dear sir reply mr quarterpage lot of 'em go out in the street and ask the first six man you meet and i 'll go bail that four out of the six believe it then why in the sacred name of common sense do no one ever take step to make certain ask spargo why do not they get a order for exhumation because it be nobody 's particular business to do so answer mr quarterpage you do not know country-town life my dear sir in town like market milcaster folk talk and gossip a great deal but they be always slow to do anything it be a case of who 'll start first -- of initiative and if they see it be go to cost anything -- then they 'll have nothing to do with it but -- the bank people suggest spargo mr quarterpage shake he head they be amongst the lot who believe that chamberlayne do die he say they be very old-fashioned conservative-minded people the gutchby and the hostable and they accept the version of the nephew and the doctor and the solicitor but now i 'll tell you something about those three there be a man here in the town a gentleman of you own profession who come to edit that paper you have get on you knee he get interested in this chamberlayne case and he begin to make enquiry with the idea of get hold of some good -- what do you call it i suppose he would call it ` copy ' say spargo ` copy ' -- that be he term agree mr quarterpage well he take the trouble to go to london to ask some quiet question of the nephew stephen that be just twelve month after chamberlayne have be bury but he find that stephen chamberlayne have leave england -- month before go they say to one of the colony but they do not know which and the solicitor have also go and the doctor -- could not be trace no sir not even through the medical register what do you think of all that mr spargo i think answer spargo that market milcaster folk be considerably slow i should have have that death and burial enquire into the whole thing look to I like a conspiracy well sir it be as i say nobody 's business say mr quarterpage the newspaper gentleman try to stir up interest in it but it be no good and very soon afterwards he leave and there it be mr quarterpage say spargo what be you own honest opinion the old gentleman smile ah he say i have often wonder mr spargo if i really have a opinion on that point i think that what i probably feel about the whole affair be that there be a good deal of mystery attach to it but we seem sir to have go a long way from the question of that old silver ticket which you have get in you purse now -- no say spargo interrupt he host with a accompany wag of he forefinger no i think we be come nearer to it now you have give I a great deal of you time mr quarterpage and tell I a lot and first of all before i tell you a lot i be go to show you something and spargo take out of he pocket-book a carefully-mounted photograph of john marbury -- the original of the process-picture which he have have make for the _ watchman _ he hand it over do you recognize that photograph as that of anybody you know he ask look at it well and closely mr quarterpage put on a special pair of spectacles and study the photograph from several point of view no sir he say at last with a shake of the head i do not recognize it at all can not see in it any resemblance to any man you have ever know ask spargo no sir none reply mr quarterpage none whatever very well say spargo lay the photograph on the table between they now then i want you to tell I what john maitland be like when you know he also i want you to describe chamberlayne as he be when he die or be suppose to die you remember they of course quite well mr quarterpage get up and move to the door i can do better than that he say i can show you photograph of both man as they be just before maitland 's trial i have a photograph of a small group of market milcaster notability which be take at a municipal garden-party maitland and chamberlayne be both in it it be be put away in a cabinet in my drawing-room for many a long year and i have no doubt it be as fresh as when it be take he leave the room and presently return with a large mount photograph which he lay on the table before he visitor there you be sir he say quite fresh you see -- it must be get on to twenty year since that be take out of the drawer that it be be keep in now that be maitland and that be chamberlayne spargo find himself look at a group of man who stand against a ivy-covered wall in the stiff attitude in which photographer arrange mass of sitter he fix he attention on the two figure indicate by mr quarterpage and see two medium-heighted rather sturdily-built man about whom there be nothing very specially noticeable um he say musingly both beard yes they both wear beard -- full beard assent mr quarterpage and you see they be not so much alike but maitland be a much darker man than chamberlayne and he have brown eye while chamberlayne 's be rather a bright blue the removal of a beard make a great difference remark spargo he look at the photograph of maitland in the group compare it with that of marbury which he have take from he pocket and twenty year make a difference too he add musingly to some people twenty year make a vast difference sir say the old gentleman to other it make none -- i have not change much they tell I during the past twenty year but i have know man change -- age almost beyond recognition -- in five year it depend sir on what they go through spargo suddenly lay aside the photograph put he hand in he pocket and look steadfastly at mr quarterpage look here he say i be go to tell you what i be after mr quarterpage i be sure you have hear all about what be know as the middle temple murder -- the marbury case yes i have read of it reply mr quarterpage have you read the account of it in my paper the _ watchman _ ask spargo mr quarterpage shake he head i have only read one newspaper sir since i be a young man he reply i take the _ time _ sir -- we always take it aye even in the day when newspaper be tax very good say spargo but perhaps i can tell you a little more than you have read for i have be work up that case ever since the body of the man know as john marbury be find now if you 'll just give I you attention i 'll tell you the whole story from that moment until -- now and spargo briefly succinctly re-tell the story of the marbury case from the first instant of he own connection with it until the discovery of the silver ticket and mr quarterpage listen in rapt attention nod he head from time to time as the younger man make he point and now mr quarterpage conclude spargo this be the point i have come to i believe that the man who come to the anglo-orient hotel as john marbury and who be undoubtedly murder in middle temple lane that night be john maitland -- i have not a doubt about it after learn what you tell I about the silver ticket i have find out a great deal that be valuable here and i think i be get nearer to a solution of the mystery that be of course to find out who murder john maitland or marbury what you have tell I about the chamberlayne affair have lead I to think this -- there may have be people or a person in london who be anxious to get marbury as we 'll call he out of the way and who somehow encounter he that night -- anxious to silence he i mean because of the chamberlayne affair and i wonder as there be so much mystery about he and as he will not give any account of himself if this man aylmore be really chamberlayne yes i wonder that but aylmore 's a tall finely-built man quite six foot in height and he beard though it be now get grizzled have be very dark and chamberlayne you say be a medium-sized fair man with blue eye that be so sir assent mr quarterpage yes a middling-sized man and fair -- very fair deary I mr spargo -- this be a revelation and you really think sir that john maitland and john marbury be one and the same person i be sure of it now say spargo i see it in this way maitland on he release go out to australium and there he stop at last he come back evidently well-to-do he be murder the very day of he arrival aylmore be the only man who know anything of he -- aylmore will not tell all he know that be flat but aylmore 's admit that he know he at some vague date say from twenty-one to twenty-two or three year ago now where do aylmore know he he say in london that be a vague term he will not say where -- he will not say anything definite -- he will not even say what he aylmore himself be in those day do you recollect anything of anybody like aylmore come here to see maitland mr quarterpage i do not answer mr quarterpage maitland be a very quiet retire fellow sir : he be about the quietest man in the town i never remember that he have visitor certainly i have no recollection of such a friend of he as this aylmore from you description of he would be at that time do maitland go up to london much in those day ask spargo mr quarterpage laugh well now to show you what a good memory i have he say i 'll tell you of something that occur across there at the ` dragon ' only a few month before the maitland affair come out there be some of we in there one evening and for a rare thing maitland come in with chamberlayne chamberlayne happen to remark that he be go up to town next day -- he be always to and fro -- and we get talk about london and maitland say in course of conversation that he believe he be about the only man of he age in england -- and of course he mean of he class and mean -- who have never even see london and i do not think he ever go there between that time and he trial : in fact i be sure he do not for if he have i should have hear of it well that be queer remark spargo it be very queer for i be certain maitland and marbury be one and the same person my theory about that old leather box be that maitland have that carefully plant before he arrest that he dig it up when he come put of dartmoor that he take it off to australia with he that he bring it back with he and that of course the silver ticket and the photograph have be in it all these year now -- at that moment the door of the library be open and a parlourmaid look in at she master there be the boot from the ` dragon ' at the front door sir she say he be bring two telegram across from there for mr spargo think he might like to have they at once chapter twenty-one arrest spargo hurry out to the hall take the two telegram from the boot of the dragon and tear open the envelope read the message hastily he go back to mr quarterpage here be important news he say as he close the library door and resume he seat i 'll read these telegram to you sir and then we can discuss they in the light of what we have be talk about this morning the first be from we office i tell you we send over to australia for a full report about marbury at the place he say he hail from -- coolumbidgee that report 's just reach the _ watchman _ and they have wire it on to I it be from the chief of police at coolumbidgee to the editor of the _ watchman _ london : -- john marbury come to coolumbidgee in the winter of 1898-9 he be unaccompanied he appear to be in possession of fairly considerable means and buy a share in a small sheep-farm from its proprietor andrew robertson who be still here and who say that marbury never tell he anything about himself except that he have emigrate for health reason and be a widower he mention that he have have a son who be dead and be now without relation he live a very quiet steady life on the sheep-farm never leave it for many year about six month ago however he pay a visit to melbourne and on return tell robertson that he have decide to return to england in consequence of some news he have receive and must therefore sell he share in the farm robertson buy it from he for three thousand pound and marbury shortly afterwards leave for melbourne from what we could gather robertson think marbury be probably in command of five or six thousand when he leave coolumbidgee he tell robertson that he have meet a man in melbourne who have give he news that surprise he but do not say what news he have in he possession when he leave robertson exactly the luggage he bring with he when he come -- a stout portmanteau and a small square leather box there be no effect of he left behind at coolumbidgee that be all say spargo lay the first of the telegram on the table and it seem to I to signify a good deal but now here be more startling news this be from rathbury the scotland yard detective that i tell you of mr quarterpage -- he promise you know to keep I post in what go on in my absence here be what he say : fresh evidence tend to incriminate aylmore have come to hand authority have decide to arrest he on suspicion you would better hurry back if you want material for to-morrow 's paper spargo throw that telegram down too wait while the old gentleman glance at both of they with evident curiosity and then jump up well i shall have to go mr quarterpage he say i look the train out this morning so as to be in readiness i can catch the 120 to paddington -- that 'll get I in before half-past four i have a hour yet now there be another man i want to see in market milcaster that be the photographer -- or a photographer you remember i tell you of the photograph find with the silver ticket well i be calculate that that photograph be take here and i want to see the man who take it -- if he be alive and i can find he mr quarterpage rise and put on he hat there be

he want he put a direct question to mr cooper -- a elderly man do you remember take a photograph of the child of john maitland the bank manager some twenty or twenty-one year ago he ask after mr quarterpage have introduce he as a gentleman from london who want to ask a few question quite well sir reply mr cooper as well as if it have be yesterday do you still happen to have a copy of it ask

during he journey to town he eat a hearty lunch in the train and talk with he neighbor it be a relief to let he mind and attention turn to something else than the theme which have occupy it unceasingly for so many day but at read the newspaper boy be shout the news of the arrest of a member of parliament and spargo glance out of the window catch sight of a newspaper placard : the marbury

i be sorry to hear the news about you father that be what be bring you here of course but -- i be afraid i can not do much i tell you that we have no right to trouble mr spargo jessie say evelyn aylmore what can he do to help we jessie shake she head impatiently the _ watchman 's _ about the most powerful paper in london be not it she say and be not mr spargo write all these article about the marbury case mr spargo you must help we spargo sit down at he desk and begin turn over the letter and papers which have accumulate during he absence to be absolutely frank with you he say presently i do not see how anybody 's go to help so long as you father keep up that mystery about the past that say evelyn quietly be exactly what ronald say jessie but we can not make we father speak mr spargo that he be as innocent as we be of this terrible crime we be certain and we do not know why he would not answer the question put to he at the inquest and -- we know no more than you know or anyone know and though i have beg my father to speak he will not say a word we see he danger : ronald -- mr breton -- tell we and we implore he to tell everything he know about mr marbury but so far he have simply laugh at the idea that he have anything to do with the murder or could be arrest for it and now -- and now he be lock up say spargo in he usual matter-of-fact fashion well there be people who have to be save from themselves you know perhaps you 'll have to save you father from the consequence of he own -- shall we say obstinacy now look here between ourselves how much do you know about you father 's -- past the two sister look at each other and then at spargo nothing say the elder absolutely nothing say the younger answer a few plain question say spargo i be not go to print you reply nor make use of they in any way : i be only ask the question with a desire to help you have you any relation in england none that we know of reply evelyn nobody you could go to for information about the past ask spargo no -- nobody spargo drum he finger on he blotting-pad he be think hard how old be you father he ask suddenly he be fifty-nine a few week ago answer evelyn and how old be you and how old be you sister demand spargo i be twenty and jessie be nearly nineteen where be you bear both of we at san gregorio which be in the san josé province of argentina north of monte video you father be in business there he be in business in the export trade mr spargo there be no secret about that he export all sort of thing to england and to france -- skin hide wool dry salt fruit that be how he make he money you do not know how long he would be there when you be bear no be he marry when he go out there no he be not we do know that he be tell we the circumstance of he marriage because they be romantic when he sail from england to bueno ayre he meet on the steamer a young lady who he say be like himself relationless and nearly friendless she be go out to argentina as a governess she and my father fall in love with each other and they be marry in bueno ayre soon after the steamer arrive and you mother be dead my mother die before we come to england i be eight year old and jessie six then and you come to england -- how long after that two year so that you have be in england ten year and you know nothing whatever of you father 's past beyond what you have tell I nothing -- absolutely nothing never hear he talk of -- you see accord to you account you father be a man of get on to forty when he go out to argentina he must have have a career of some sort in this country have you never hear he speak of he boyhood do he never talk of old time or that sort of thing i never remember hear my father speak of any period antecedent to he marriage reply evelyn i once ask he a question about he childhood say jessie he answer that he early day have not be very happy one and that he have do he best to forget they so i never ask he anything again so that it really come to this remark spargo you know nothing whatever about you father he family he fortune he life beyond what you yourselve have observe since you be able to observe that be about it be not it i should say that that be exactly it answer evelyn just so say spargo and therefore as i tell you sister the other day the public will say that you father have some dark secret behind he and that marbury have possession of it and that you father kill he in order to silence he that be not my view i not only believe you father to be absolutely innocent but i believe that he know no more than a child unborn of marbury 's murder and i be do my best to find out who that murderer be by the by since you 'll see all about it in tomorrow morning 's _ watchman _ i may as well tell you that i have find out who marbury really be he -- at this moment spargo 's door be open and in walk ronald breton he shake he head at sight of the two sister i think i should find you here he say jessie say she be come to see you spargo i do not know what good you can do -- i do not see what good the most powerful newspaper in the world can do my god -- everything 's about as black as ever it can be mr aylmore -- i have just come away from he he solicitor stratton and i have be with he for a hour -- be obstinate as ever -- he will not tell more than he have tell whatever good can you do spargo when he will not speak about that knowledge of marbury which he must have oh well say spargo perhaps we can give he some information about marbury mr aylmore have forget that it be not such a difficult thing to rake up the past as he seem to think it be for example as i be just tell these young lady i myself have discover who marbury really be breton start you have without doubt he exclaim without reasonable doubt marbury be a ex-convict spargo watch the effect of this sudden announcement the two girl show no sign of astonishment or of unusual curiosity they receive the news with as much unconcern as if spargo have tell they that marbury be a famous musician but ronald breton start and it seem to spargo that he see a sense of suspicion dawn in he eye marbury -- a ex-convict he exclaim you mean that read you _ watchman _ in the morning say spargo you 'll find the whole story there -- i be go to write it tonight when you people have go it 'll make good reading evelyn and jessie aylmore take spargo 's hint and go away spargo see they to the door with another assurance of he belief in they father 's innocence and he determination to hunt down the real criminal ronald breton go down with they to the street and see they into a cab but in another minute he be back in spargo 's room as spargo have expect he shut the door carefully behind he and turn to spargo with a eager face i say spargo be that really so he ask about marbury be a ex-convict that be so breton i have no more doubt about it than i have that i see you marbury be in reality one john maitland a bank manager of market milcaster who get ten year ' penal servitude in 1891 for embezzlement in 1891 why -- that be just about the time that aylmore say he know he exactly and -- it just strike I say spargo sit down at he desk and make a hurry note it just strike I -- do not aylmore say he know marbury in london certainly reply breton in london um muse spargo that be queer because maitland have never be in london up to the time of he go to dartmoor whatever he may have do when he come out of dartmoor and of course aylmore have go to south america long before that look here breton he continue aloud have you access to aylmore will you can you see he before he be bring up at bow street tomorrow yes answer breton i can see he with he solicitor then listen say spargo tomorrow morning you 'll find the whole story of how i prove marbury 's identity with maitland in the _ watchman _ read it as early as you can get a interview with aylmore as early as you can make he read it every word before he be bring up beg he if he value he own safety and he daughter ' peace of mind to throw away all that foolish reserve and to tell all he know about maitland twenty year ago he should have do that at first why i be ask he daughter some question before you come in -- they know absolutely nothing of they father 's history previous to the time when they begin to understand thing do not you see that aylmore 's career previous to he return to england be a blank past i know -- i know say breton yes -- although i have go there a great deal i never hear aylmore speak of anything earlier than he argentine experience and yet he must have be get on when he go out there thirty-seven or eight at least remark spargo well aylmore 's more or less of a public man and no public man can keep he life hide nowadays by the by how do you get to know the aylmore my guardian mr elphick and i meet they in switzerland answer breton we keep up the acquaintance after we return mr elphick still interesting himself in the marbury case ask spargo very much so and so be old cardlestone at the foot of whose stair the thing come off i dine with they last night and they talk of little else say breton and they theory -- oh still the murder for the sake of robbery reply breton old cardlestone be furious that such a thing could have happen at he very door he say that there ought to be a thorough enquiry into every tenant of the temple longish business that observe spargo well run away now breton -- i must write shall you be at bow street tomorrow morning ask breton as he move to the door it be to be at ten-thirty no i sha not reply spargo it 'll only be a remand and i know already just as much as i should hear there i have get something much more important to do but you 'll remember what i ask of you -- get aylmore to read my story in the _ watchman _ and beg he to speak out and tell all he know -- all and when breton have go spargo again murmur those last word : all he know -- all chapter twenty-three miss bayli next day a little before noon spargo find himself in one of those pretentious yet dismal bayswater square which be almost entirely give up to the trade call or occupation of the lodging and boarding-house keeper they be very pretentious those square with they many-storied house they stuccoed frontage and they pilaster and balconied doorway innocent country folk come into they from the neighbouring station of paddington take they to be the residence of the duke and earl who of course live nowhere else but in london they be further encourage in this belief by the fact that young male person in evening dress be often see at the doorway in more or less elegant attitude these of course be take by the country folk to be young lord enjoy the air of bayswater but other more know be aware that they be swiss or german waiter whose linen might be cleaner spargo gauge the character of the house at which he call as soon as the door be open to he there be the usual smell of egg and bacon of fish and chop the usual mixed and ancient collection of overcoat wrap and stick in the hall the usual sort of parlourmaid to answer the bell and presently in answer to he enquiry there be the usual type of landlady confront he a more than middle-aged person who desire to look younger and make attempt in the way of false hair tooth and a little rouge and who wear that somewhat air and smile which in its wearer -- under these circumstance -- always mean that she be consider whether you will be able to cheat she or whether she will be able to see you you wish to see miss bayli say this person examine spargo closely miss bayli do not often see anybody i hope say spargo politely that miss bayli be not a invalid no she be not a invalid reply the landlady but she be not as young as she be and she be a objection to stranger be it anything i can tell she no say spargo but you can if you please take she a message from I will you kindly give she my card and tell she that i wish to ask she a question about john maitland of market milcaster and that i should be much oblige if she would give I a few minute perhaps you will sit down say the landlady she lead spargo into a room which open out upon a garden in it two or three old lady evidently inmate be sit the landlady leave spargo to sit with they and to amuse himself by watch they knit or sew or read the papers and he wonder if they always do these thing every day and if they would go on do they until a day would come when they would do they no more and he be begin to feel very dreary when the door open and a woman enter whom spargo after one sharp glance at she decide to be a person who be undoubtedly out of the common and as she slowly walk across the room towards he he let he first glance lengthen into a look of steady inspection the woman whom spargo thus narrowly inspect be of very remarkable appearance she be almost masculine she stand nearly six foot in height she be of a masculine gait and tread and spare muscular and athletic what at once strike spargo about she face be the strange contrast between she dark eye and she white hair the hair worn in abundant coil round a well-shaped head be of the most snowy whiteness the eye of a real coal-blackness as be also the eyebrow above they the feature be well-cut and of a striking firmness the jaw square and determine and spargo 's first thought on take all this in be that miss bayli seem to have be fit by nature to be a prison wardress or the matron of a hospital or the governess of a unruly girl and he begin to wonder if he would ever manage to extract anything out of those firmly-locked lip miss bayli on she part look spargo over as if she be half-minded to order he to instant execution and spargo be so impressed by she that he make a profound bow and find a difficulty in find he tongue mr spargo she say in a deep voice which seem peculiarly suit to she of i see the _ watchman _ you wish to speak to I spargo again bow in silence she sign he to the window near which they be stand open the casement if you please she command he we will walk in the garden this be not private spargo obediently obey she order she sweep through the open window and he follow she it be not until they have reach the bottom of the garden that she speak again i understand that you desire to ask I some question about john maitland of market milcaster she say before you put it i must ask you a question do you wish any reply i may give you for publication not without you permission reply spargo i should not think of publishing anything you may tell I except with you express permission she look at he gloomily seem to gather a impression of he good faith and nod she head in that case she say what do you want to ask i have lately have reason for make certain enquiry about john maitland answer spargo i suppose you read the newspaper and possibly the _ watchman _ miss bayli but miss bayli shake she head i read no newspaper she say i have no interest in the affair of the world i have work which occupy all my time : i give my whole devotion to it then you have not recently hear of what be know as the marbury case -- a case of a man who be find murder ask spargo i have not she answer i be not likely to hear such thing spargo suddenly realize that the power of the press be not quite as great nor as far-reaching as very young journalist hold it to be and that there actually be even in london people who can live quite cheerfully without a newspaper he conceal he astonishment and go on well he say i believe that the murder man know to the police as john marbury be in reality you brother-in-law john maitland in fact miss bayli i be absolutely certain of it he make this declaration with some emphasis and look at he stern companion to see how she be impressed but miss bayli show no sign of be impressed i can quite believe that mr spargo she say coldly it be no surprise to I that john maitland should come to such a end he be a thoroughly bad and unprincipled man who bring the most terrible disgrace on those who be unfortunately connect with he he be likely to die a bad man 's death i may ask you a few question about he suggest spargo in he most insinuate manner you may so long as you do not drag my name into the papers she reply but pray how do you know that i have the sad shame of be john maitland 's sister-in-law i find that out at market milcaster say spargo the photographer tell I -- cooper ah she exclaim the question i want to ask be very simple say spargo but you answer may materially help I you remember maitland go to prison of course miss bayli laugh -- a laugh of scorn could i ever forget it she exclaim do you ever visit he in prison ask spargo visit he in prison she say indignantly visit in prison be to be pay to those who deserve they who be repentant not to scoundrel who be harden in they sin all right do you ever see he after he leave prison i see he for he force himself upon I -- i could not help myself he be in my presence before i be aware that he have even be release what do he come for ask spargo to ask for he son -- who have be in my charge she reply that be a thing i want to know about say spargo do you know what a certain lot of people in market milcaster say to this day miss bayli -- they say that you be in at the game with maitland that you have a lot of the money place in you charge that when maitland go to prison you take the child away first to brighton then abroad -- disappear with he -- and that you make a home ready for maitland when he come out that be what be say by some people in market milcaster miss bayli 's stern lip curl people in market milcaster she exclaim all the people i ever know in market milcaster have about as many brain between they as that cat on the wall there as for make a home for john maitland i would have see he die in the gutter of absolute want before i would have give he a crust of dry bread you appear to have a terrible dislike of this man observe spargo astonish at she vehemence i have -- and i have she answer he trick my sister into a marriage with he when he know that she would rather have marry a honest man who worship she he treat she with quiet infernal cruelty he rob she and I of the small fortune we father leave we ah say spargo well so you say maitland come to you when he come out of prison to ask for he boy do he take the boy no -- the boy be dead dead eh then i suppose maitland do not stop long with you miss bayli laugh she scornful laugh i show he the door she say well do he tell you that he be go to australia enquired spargo i should not have listen to anything that he tell I mr spargo she answer then in short say spargo you never hear of he again i never hear of he again she declare passionately and i only hope that what you tell I be true and that marbury really be maitland chapter twenty-four mother gutch spargo have exhaust the list of question which he have think out on he way to bayswater be about to take he leave of miss bayli when a new idea suddenly occur to he and he turn back to that formidable lady i have just think of something else he say i tell you that i be certain marbury be maitland and that he come to a sad end -- murder and i have tell you she reply scornfully that in my opinion no end could be too bad for he just so -- i understand you say spargo but i do not tell you that he be not only murder but rob -- rob of probably a good deal there be good reason to believe that he have security bank note loose diamond and other thing on he to the value of a large amount he have several thousand pound when he leave coolumbidgee in new south wale where he would live quietly for some year miss bayli smile sourly what be all this to I she ask possibly nothing but you see that money those security may be recover and as the boy you speak of be dead there surely must be somebody who be entitle to the lot it be worth have miss bayli and there be strong belief on the part of the police that it will turn up this be a bit of ingenious bluff on the part of spargo he watch its effect with keen eye but miss bayli be adamant and she look as scornful as ever i say again what be all that to I she exclaim well but have not the dead boy any relative on he father 's side ask spargo i know you be he aunt on the mother 's side and as you be indifferent perhaps i can find some on the other side it be very easy to find all these thing out you know miss bayli who have begin to stalk back to the house in gloomy and majestic fashion and have let spargo see plainly that this part of the interview be distasteful to she suddenly pause in she stride and glare at the young journalist easy to find all these thing out she repeat spargo catch or fancy he

find the register of he birth at market milcaster and you of course will tell I where he die by the by when do he die miss bayli but miss bayli be go on again to the house i shall tell you nothing more she say angrily i have tell you too much already and i believe all you be here for be to get some news for you paper but i will at any rate tell you this -- when maitland go to prison he child would have be defenceless but for I he would have have to go to the workhouse but for I he have not a single relation in the world but I on either father 's or mother 's side and even at my age old woman as i be i would rather beg my bread in the street i would rather starve and die than touch a penny piece that have come from john maitland that be all then without further word without offer to show spargo the way out she march in at the open window and disappear and spargo know no other way be about to follow she when he hear a sudden rustling sound in the shadow by which they have stand and the next moment a queer crack horrible voice suggest all sort of thing say distinctly and yet in a whisper : young man spargo turn and stare at the privet hedge behind he it be thick and bushy and in its full summer green but it seem to he that he see a nondescript shape behind who be there he demand somebody listen there be a curious cackle of laughter from behind the hedge then the crack husky voice speak again young man do not you move or look as if you be talk to anybody do you know where the ` king of madagascar ' public-house be in this quarter of the town young man no answer spargo certainly not well anybody 'll tell you when you get outside young man continue the queer voice of the unseen person go there and wait at the corner by the ` king of madagascar ' and i 'll come there to you at the end of half a hour then i 'll tell you something young man -- i 'll tell you something now run away young man run away to the ` king of madagascar ' -- i be come the voice end in low horrible cachinnation which make spargo feel queer but he be young enough to be in love with adventure and he immediately turn on he heel without so much as a glance at the privet hedge and go across the garden and through the house and let himself out at the door and at the next corner of the square he meet a policeman and ask he if he know where the king of madagascar be first to the right second to the left answer the policeman tersely you can not miss it anywhere round there -- it be a landmark and spargo find the landmark -- a great square-built tavern -- easily and he wait at a corner of it wonder what he be go to see and intensely curious about the owner of the queer voice with all its suggestion of he know not what and suddenly there come up to he a old woman and leer at he in a fashion that make he suddenly realize how dreadful old age may be spargo have never see such a old woman as this in he life she be dress respectably better than respectably she gown be good she bonnet be smart she smaller fitting be good but she face be evil it show unmistakable sign of a long devotion to the bottle the old eye leer and ogle the old lip be wicked spargo feel a sense of

of gin sweeten and warm and spargo watch she curiously as with shake hand she push up the veil which hide little of she wicked old face and lift the glass to she mouth with a zest which be not thirst but pure greed of liquor almost instantly he see a new light steal into she eye and she laugh in a voice that grow clearer with every sound she make ah young man she say with a confidential nudge of the elbow that make spargo long to get up and fly i want that it be do I good when i have finish that you 'll pay for another for I -- and perhaps another they 'll do I still more good and you 'll

appreciative pull at she glass and smile knowingly what then she chuckle all lie young man the boy be not dead -- any more than i be and my secret be -- well demand spargo impatiently what be it this answer mother gutch digging she companion in the rib i know what she do with he chapter twenty-five revelation spargo turn on he disreputable and dissolute companion with all he journalistic energy and instinct rouse he have not be sure since enter the king of madagascar that he be go to hear anything material to the middle temple murder he have more than once fear that this old gin-drinking harridan be deceive he for the purpose of extract drink and money from he but now at the mere prospect of get important information from she he forget all about mother gutch 's unfortunate propensity evil eye and sodden face he only see in she somebody who could tell he something he turn on she eagerly you say that john maitland 's son do not die he exclaim the boy do not die reply mother gutch and that you know where he be ask spargo mother gutch shake she head i do not say that i know where he be young man she reply i say i know what she do with he what then demand spargo mother gutch draw herself up in a vast assumption of dignity and favor spargo with a look that be the secret young man she say i be willing to sell that secret but not for two half-sovereign and two or three drop of cold gin if maitland leave all that money you tell jane bayli of when i be listen to you from behind the hedge my secret 's worth something spargo suddenly remember he bit of bluff to miss bayli here be a unexpected result of it nobody but I can help you to trace maitland 's boy continue mother gutch and i shall expect to be pay accordingly that be plain language young man spargo consider the situation in silence for a minute or two could this wretched bibulous old woman really be in possession of a secret which would lead to the solve of the mystery of the middle temple murder well it would be a fine thing for the _ watchman _ if the clearing up of everything come through one of its man and the _ watchman _ be note for be generous even to extravagance in lay out money on all sort of object : it have spend money like water on much less serious matter than this how much do you want for you secret he suddenly ask turn to he companion mother gutch begin to smooth out a pleat in she gown it be really wonderful to spargo to find how very sober and normal this old harridan have become he do not understand that she nerve have be all a-quiver and on edge when he first meet she and that a resort to she favorite form of alcohol in liberal quantity have calm and quicken they secretly he be regard she with astonishment as the most extraordinary old person he have ever meet and he be almost afraid of she as he wait for she decision at last mother gutch speak well young man she say have consider matter and have a right to look well to myself i think that what i should prefer to have would be one of those annuity a nice comfortable annuity pay weekly -- none of you monthly or quarterly but regular and punctual every Saturday morning or Monday morning as be convenient to the party concern -- but punctual and regular i know a good many lady in my sphere of life as enjoy annuity and it be a great comfort to have 'em pay weekly it occur to spargo that mr gutch would probably get rid of she weekly dole on the day it be pay whether that day happen to be Monday or Saturday but that after all be no concern of he so he come back to first principle even now you have not say how much he remark three pound a week reply mother gutch and cheap too spargo thought hard for two minute the secret might -- might -- lead to something big this wretched old woman would probably drink herself to death within a year or two anyhow a few hundred of pound be nothing to the _ watchman _ he glance at he watch at that hour -- for the next hour -- the great man of the _ watchman _ would be at the office he jump to he foot suddenly resolve and alert here i 'll take you to see my principal he say we 'll run along in a taxi-cab with all the pleasure in the world young man reply mother gutch when you have give I that other half-sovereign as for principal i would far rather talk business with master than with man -- though i mean no disrespect to you spargo feel that he be in for it hand over the second half-sovereign and busy himself in order a taxi-cab but when that come round he have to wait while mr gutch consume a third glass of gin and purchase a flask of the same beverage to put in she pocket at last he get she off and in due course to the _ watchman _ office where the hall-porter and the messenger boy stare at she in amazement well use as they be to see strange folk and he get she to he own room and lock she in and then he seek the presence of the mighty what spargo say to he editor and to the great man who control the fortune and workings of the _ watchman _ he never know it be probably fortunate for he that they be both thoroughly conversant with the fact of the middle temple murder and see that there might be a advantage in secure the revelation of which spargo have get the conditional promise at any rate they accompany spargo to he room intent on see hearing and bargaining with the lady he have lock up there spargo 's room smell heavily of unsweetened gin but mother gutch be soberer than ever she insist upon be introduce to proprietor and editor in due and proper form and in discuss term with they before go into any further particulars the editor be all for temporize with she until something could be do to find out what likelihood of truth there be in she but the proprietor after size she up in he own shrewd fashion take he two companion out of the room we 'll hear what the old woman have to say on she own term he say she may have something to tell that be really of the greatest importance in this case : she certainly have something to tell and as spargo say she 'll probably drink herself to death in about as short a time as possible come back -- let 's hear she story so they return to the gin-scented atmosphere and a formal document be draw out by which the proprietor of the _ watchman _ bind himself to pay mr gutch the sum of three pound a week for life -lrb- mr gutch insist on the insertion of the word every Saturday morning punctual and regular -rrb- and then mr gutch be invite to tell she tale and mr gutch settle herself to do so and spargo prepare to take it down word for word which the story as that young man call it be not so long as a monkey 's tail nor so short as a manx cat 's gentleman say mr gutch but full of meat as a egg now you see when that maitland affair at market milcaster come off i be housekeeper to miss jane bayli at brighton she keep a boarding-house there in kemp town and close to the sea-front and a very good thing she make out of it and have save a nice bit and have like she sister mr maitland have a little fortune leave she by she father as be at one time a publican here in london she have a good lump of money and all that money be in this here maitland 's hand every penny i very well remember the day when the news come about that affair of maitland rob the bank miss bayli she be like a mad thing when she see it in the paper and before she would see it a hour she be off to market milcaster i go up to the station with she and she tell I then before she get in the train that maitland have all she fortune and she savings and she sister 's he wife 's too and that she fear all would be lose mr maitland be then dead observe spargo without look up from he writing-block she be young man and a good thing too continue mr gutch well away go miss bayli and no more do i hear or see for nearly a week and then back she come and bring a little boy with she -- which be maitland 's and she tell I that night that she would lose every penny she have in the world and that she sister 's money what ought to have be the child 's be go too and she say she say about maitland however she see well to that child nobody could have see better and very soon after when maitland be send to prison for ten year she and I talk about thing ` what be the use ' say i to she ` of you let yourself get so fond of that child and look after it as you do and educate it and so on ' i say ` why not ' say she ` tis not yours ' i say ` you have not no right to it ' i say ` as soon as ever its father come out ' say i ' he 'll come and claim it and you can not do nothing to stop he ' well gentleman if you 'll believe I never do i see a woman look as she do when i say all that and she up and swear that maitland should never see or touch the child again -- not under no circumstance whatever mrs gutch pause to take a little refreshment from she pocket-flask with a apologetic remark as to the state of she heart she resume presently apparently refresh well gentleman that notion about maitland 's take the child away from she seem to get on she mind and she use to talk to I at time about it always say the same thing -- that maitland should never have he and one day she tell I she be go to london to see lawyer about it and she go and she come back seem more satisfied and a day or two afterwards there come a gentleman who look like a lawyer and he stop a day or two and he come again and again until one day she come to I and she say ` you do not know who that gentleman be that be come so much lately ' she say ` not i ' i say ` unless he be after you ' ` after I ' she say toss she head : ` that be the gentleman that ought to have marry my poor sister if that scoundrel maitland have not trick she into throw he over ' ` you do not say so ' i say ` then by rights he ought to have be the child 's pa ' ` he be go to be a father to the boy ' she say ` he be go to take he and educate he in the highest fashion and make a gentleman of he ' she say ` for he mother 's sake ' ` mercy on we ' say i ` what 'll maitland say when he come for he ' ` maitland 'll never come for he ' she say ` for i be go to leave here and the boy 'll be go before then this be all be do ' she say ` so that the child 'll never know he father 's shame -- he 'll never know who he father be ' and true enough the boy be take away but maitland come before she would go and she tell he the child be dead and i never see a man so cut up however it be not no concern of mine and so there be so much of the secret gentleman and i would like to know if i be not give good value very good say the proprietor go on but spargo intervene do you ever hear the name of the gentleman who take the boy away he ask yes i do reply mr gutch of course i do which it be elphick chapter twenty-six still silent spargo drop he pen on the desk before he with a sharp clatter that make mr gutch jump a steady devotion to the bottle have make she nerve to be none of the strongest and she look at the startler of they with angry malevolence do not do that again young man she exclaim sharply i can not a-bear to be jump out of my skin and it be bad manners i observe that the gentleman 's name be elphick spargo contrived to get in a glance at he proprietor and he editor -- a glance which come near to be a wink just so -- elphick he say a law gentleman i think you say mr gutch i say answer mr gutch as how he look like a lawyer gentleman and since you be so particular young man though i be not address you but you principal he be a lawyer gentleman one of the sort that wear wig and gown -- be not i see he picture in jane bayli 's room at the boarding-house where you see she this morning elderly man ask spargo elderly he will be now reply the informant but when he take the boy away he be a middle-aged man about he age she add point to the editor in a fashion which make that worthy man wince and the proprietor desire to laugh unconsumedly and not so very unlike he neither be one as have no hair on he face ah say spargo and where do this mr elphick take the boy mr gutch but mr gutch shake she head be not no idea she say he take he then as i tell you maitland come and jane bayli tell he that the boy be dead and after that she never even tell I anything about the boy she keep a tight tongue once or twice i ask she and she say ` never you mind ' she say ` he be all right for life if he live to be as old as methusalem ' and she never say more and i never say more but continue mr gutch whose pocket-flask be empty and who begin to wipe tear away she be treat I hard have jane bayli never allow I a little comfort such as a lady of my age should have and when i hear the two of you a-talking this morning the other side of that privet hedge think i ` now be the time to have my knife into you my fine madam ' and i hope i do it spargo look at the editor and the proprietor nod he head slightly he mean they to understand that he have get all he want from mother gutch what be you go to do mr gutch when you leave here he ask you shall be drive straight back to bayswater if you like which i shall be oblige for young man say mr gutch and likewise for the first week of the annuity and will call every Saturday for the same at eleven punctual or can be post to I on a Friday whichever be agreeable to you gentleman and have my first week in my purse and be drive to bayswater i shall take my box and go to a friend of mine where i shall be hearty welcome shake the dust of my foot off against jane bayli and where i have be live with she yes but mr gutch say spargo with some anxiety if you go back there tonight you 'll be very careful not to tell miss bayli that you have be here and tell we all this mr gutch rise dignified and compose young man she say you mean well but you be not use to deal with lady i can keep my tongue as still as anybody when i like i would not tell jane bayli my affair -- my new affair gentleman thanks to you -- not for two annuity pay twice a week take mr gutch downstairs spargo and see she all right and then come to my room say the editor and do not you forget mr gutch -- keep a quiet tongue in you head -- no more talk -- or there 'll be no annuity on Saturday morning so spargo take mother gutch to the cashier 's department and pay she she first week 's money and he get she a taxi-cab and pay for it and see she depart and then he go to the editor 's room strangely thoughtful the editor and the proprietor be talk but they stop when spargo enter and look at he eagerly i think we have do it say spargo quietly what precisely have we find out ask the editor a great deal more than i would anticipate answer spargo and i do not know what field it do not open out if you look back you 'll remember that the only thing find on marbury 's body be a scrap of gray paper on which be a name and address -- ronald breton king 's bench walk well breton be a young barrister also he write a bit -- i have accept two or three article of he for we literary page well further he be engage to miss aylmore the eldest daughter of aylmore the member of parliament who have be charge at bow street today with the murder of marbury i know well what then spargo but the most important matter continue spargo speak very deliberately be this -- that be take that old woman 's statement to be true as i personally believe it be -- that breton as he have tell I himself -lrb- i have see a good deal of he -rrb- be bring up by a guardian that guardian be mr septimus elphick the barrister the proprietor and the editor look at each other they face wear the expression of man think on the same line and arrive at the same conclusion and the proprietor suddenly turn on spargo with a sharp interrogation : you think then -- spargo nod i think that mr septimus elphick be the elphick and that breton be the young maitland of whom mr gutch have be talk he answer the editor get up thrust he hand in he pocket and begin to pace the room if that be so he say if that be so the mystery deepen what do you propose to do spargo i think say spargo slowly i think that without tell he anything of what we have learn i should like to see young breton and get a introduction from he to mr elphick i can make a good excuse for want a interview with he if you will leave it in my hand -- yes yes say the proprietor wave a hand leave it entirely in spargo 's hand keep I inform say the editor do what you think it strike I you be on the track spargo leave they presence and go back to he own room still faintly redolent of the personality of mr gutch get hold of the reporter who have be present at bow street when aylmore be bring up that morning there be nothing new the authority have merely ask for another remand so far as the reporter know aylmore have say nothing fresh to anybody spargo go round to the temple and up to ronald breton 's chamber he find the young barrister just prepare to leave and look unusually grave and thoughtful at sight of spargo he turn back from he outer door beckon the journalist to follow he and lead he into a inner room i say spargo he say as he motion he visitor to take a chair this be become something more than serious you know what you tell I to do yesterday as regard aylmore to get he to tell all -- yes say spargo breton shake he head stratton -- he solicitor you know -- and i see he this morning before the police-court proceedings he continue i tell he of my talk with you i even go as far as to tell he that he daughter have be to the _ watchman _ office stratton and i both begged he to take you advice and tell all everything no matter at what cost to he private feeling we point out to he the serious nature of the evidence against he how he have damage himself by not tell the whole truth at once how he have certainly do a great deal to excite suspicion against himself how as the evidence stand at present any jury could scarcely do less than convict he and it be all no good spargo he will not say anything he 'll say no more he be adamant ' i tell the entire truth in respect to my dealings with marbury on the night he meet he death at the inquest ' he say over and over again ` and i shall say nothing further on any consideration if the law like to hang a innocent man on such evidence as that let it ' and he persist in that until we leave he spargo i do not know what be to be do and nothing happen at the police-court nothing -- another remand stratton and i see aylmore again before he be remove he leave we with a sort of sardonic remark -- ` if you all want to prove I innocent ' he say ` find the guilty man ' well there be a tremendous lot of common sense in that say spargo yes of course but how how how be it go to be do exclaimed breton be you any nearer -- be rathbury any nearer be there the slightest clue that will fasten the guilt on anybody else spargo give no answer to these question he remain silent a while apparently think be rathbury in court he suddenly ask he be reply breton he be there with two or three other man who i suppose be detective and seem to be greatly interested in aylmore if i do not see rathbury tonight i 'll see he in the morning say spargo he rise as if to go but after linger a moment sit down again look here he continue i do not know how this thing stand in law but would it be a very weak case against aylmore if the prosecution could not show some motive for he kill marbury breton smile there be no necessity to prove motive in murder he say but i 'll tell you what spargo -- if the prosecution can show that aylmore have a motive for get rid of marbury if they could prove that it be to aylmore 's advantage to silence he -- why then i do not think he be a chance i see but so far no motive no reason for he kill marbury have be show i know of none spargo rise and move to the door well i be off he say then as if he suddenly recollect something he turn back oh by the by he say be not you guardian mr elphick a big authority on philately one of the biggest awful enthusiast do you think he would tell I a bit about those australian stamp which marbury show to criedir the dealer certain he would -- delighted here -- and breton scribble a few word on a card -- there be he address and a word from I i 'll tell you when you can always find he in five night out of seven -- at nine o'clock after he be dine i would go with you tonight but i must go to aylmore 's the two girl be in terrible trouble give they a message from I say spargo as they go out together tell they to keep up they heart and they courage chapter twenty-seven mr elphick 's chamber spargo go round again to the temple that night at nine o'clock ask himself over and over again two question -- the first how much do elphick know the second how much shall i tell he the old house in the temple to which he repair and in which many a generation of old fogy have live since the day of queen anne be full of stair and passage and as spargo have forget to get the exact number of the set of chamber he want he be oblige to wander about in what be a desert building so wander he suddenly hear step firm decisive step come up a staircase which he himself have just climb he look over the banister down into the hollow beneath and there march up resolutely be the figure of a tall veil woman and spargo suddenly realize with a sharp quickening of he pulse that for the second time that day he be beneath one roof with miss bayli spargo 's mind act quickly know what he now know from he extraordinary dealings with mother gutch he have no doubt whatever that miss bayli have come to see mr elphick -- come of course to tell mr elphick that he spargo have visit she that morning and that he be on the track of the maitland secret history he have never think of it before for he have be busily engage since the departure of mother gutch but naturally miss bayli and mr elphick would keep in communication with each other at any rate here she be and she destination be surely elphick 's chamber and the question for he spargo be -- what to do what spargo do be to remain in absolute silence motionless tense where he be on the stair and to trust to the chance that the woman do not look up but miss bayli neither look up nor down : she reach a landing turn along a corridor with decision and march forward a moment later spargo hear a sharp double knock on a door : a moment after that he hear a door heavily shut he know then that miss bayli have seek and gain admittance -- somewhere to find out precisely where that somewhere be draw spargo down to the landing which miss bayli have just leave there be no one about -- he have not in fact see a soul since he enter the building accordingly he go along the corridor into which he have see miss bayli turn he know that all the door in that house be double one and that the outer oak in each be solid and substantial enough to be sound proof yet as man will under such circumstance he walk softly he say to himself smile at the thought that he would be sure to start if somebody suddenly open a door on he but no hand open any door and at last he come to the end of the corridor and find himself confront a small board on which be paint in white letter on a black ground mr elphick 's chamber have satisfy himself as to he exact whereabouts spargo draw back as quietly as he have come there be a window half-way along the corridor from which he have notice as he come along one could catch a glimpse of the embankment and the thame to this he withdraw and lean on the sill look out and consider matter should he go and -- if he could gain admittance -- beard these two conspirator should he wait until the woman come out and let she see that he be on the track should he hide again until she go and then see elphick alone in the end spargo do none of these thing immediately he let thing slide for the moment he light a cigarette and stare at the river and the brown sail and the building across on the surrey side ten minute go by -- twenty minute -- nothing happen then as half-past nine strike from all the neighbouring clock spargo fling away a second cigarette march straight down the corridor and knock boldly at mr elphick 's door greatly to spargo 's surprise the door be open before there be any necessity to knock again and there calmly confront he a benevolent yet somewhat deprecating expression on he spectacled and placid face stand mr elphick a smoking cap on he head a tasseled smoking jacket over he dress shirt and a short pipe in he hand spargo be take aback : mr elphick apparently be not he hold the door well open and motion the journalist to enter come in mr spargo he say i be expect you walk forward into my sitting-room spargo much astonished at this reception pass through a ante-room into a handsomely furnished apartment full of book and picture in spite of the fact that it be still very little past midsummer there be a cheery fire in the grate and on a table set near a roomy arm-chair be set such creature comfort as a spirit-case a syphon a tumbler and a novel -- from which thing spargo argue that mr elphick have be take he ease since he dinner but in another armchair on the opposite side of the hearth be the forbid figure of miss bayli blacker gloomier more mysterious than ever she neither speak nor move when spargo enter : she do not even look at he and spargo stand stare at she until mr elphick have close he door touch he on the elbow and motion he courteously to a seat yes i be expect you mr spargo he say as he resume he own chair i have be expect you at any time ever since you take up you investigation of the marbury affair in some of the earlier stage of which you see I you will remember at the mortuary but since miss bayli tell I twenty minute ago that you have be to she this morning i feel sure that it would not be more than a few hour before you would come to I why mr elphick should you suppose that i should come to you at all ask spargo now in full possession of he wit because i feel sure that you would leave no stone unturn no corner unexplored reply mr elphick the curiosity of the modern

a more ample one than that offer to he by the old barrister 's reception of this news mr elphick 's face not only fall but change he expression of almost sneering contempt be transform to one clearly

evening newspaper be rathbury unconcerned and outwardly as imperturbable as ever he greet spargo with a careless nod and a smile well he say how 's thing spargo half-breathless drop into he desk-chair you do not come here to tell I that he say rathbury laugh no he say throw the newspaper aside i do not i come to tell you my latest you be at full liberty to stick it into you paper tonight : it may just as well be know well say spargo rathbury take he cigar out of he lip and yawn aylmore 's identify he say lazily spargo sit up sharply identify identify my son beyond doubt but as whom -- as what exclaim spargo rathbury laugh he be a old lag -- a ex-convict serve he time partly at dartmoor that of course be where he meet maitland or marbury d'ye see clear as noontide now spargo spargo sit drum he finger on the desk before he he eye be fix on a map of london that hang on the opposite wall he ear hear the throbbing of the printing-machine far below but what he really see be the face of the two girl what he really hear be the voice of two girl clear as noontide -- as noontide repeat rathbury with great cheerfulness spargo come back to the earth of plain and brutal fact what be clear as noontide he ask sharply what why the whole thing motive -- everything answer rathbury do not you see maitland and aylmore -lrb- he real name be ainsworth by the by -rrb- meet at dartmoor probably or rather certainly just before aylmore 's release aylmore go abroad make money in time come back start new career get into parliament become big man in time maitland who after he time have also go abroad also come back the two meet maitland probably try to blackmail aylmore or threaten to let folk know that the flourish mr aylmore mp be a ex-convict result -- aylmore lure he to the temple and quiet he pooh -- the whole thing 's clear as noontide as i say as -- noontide spargo drum he finger again how he ask quietly how come aylmore to be identify my work say rathbury proudly my work my son you see i think a lot and especially after we would find out that marbury be maitland you mean after i would find out remark spargo rathbury wave he cigar well well it be all the same he say you help I and i help you eh well as i say i think a considerable lot i think -- now where do maitland or marbury know or meet aylmore twenty or twenty-two year ago not in london because we know maitland never be in london -- at any rate before he trial and we have not the least proof that he be in london after and why will not aylmore tell clearly because it must have be in some undesirable place and then all of a sudden it flash on I in a moment of -- what do you write fellow call those moment spargo inspiration i should think say spargo direct inspiration that be it in a moment of direct inspiration it flash on I -- why twenty year ago maitland be in dartmoor -- they must have meet there and so we get some old warder who have be there at that time to come to town and we give 'em opportunity to see aylmore and to study he of course he be twenty year older and he be grow a beard but they begin to recall he and then one man remember that if he be the man they think he have a certain birth-mark and -- he have do aylmore know that he be be identify ask spargo rathbury pitch he cigar into the fireplace and laugh know he say scornfully know he be admit it what be the use of stand out against proof like that he admit it tonight in my presence oh he know all right and what do he say rathbury laugh contemptuously say oh not much pretty much what he say about this affair -- that when he be convict the time before he be a innocent man he be certainly a good hand at play the innocent game and of what be he convict oh of course we know all about it -- now as soon as we find out who he really be we have all the particulars turn up aylmore or ainsworth -lrb- stephen ainsworth he name really be -rrb- be a man who run a sort of what they call a mutual benefit society in a town right away up in the north -- cloudhampton -- some thirty year ago he be nominally secretary but it be really he own affair it be patronize by the work class -- cloudhampton 's a purely artisan population -- and they stick a lot of they brass as they call it in it then suddenly it come to smash and there be nothing he -- ainsworth or aylmore -- plead that he be rob and dupe by another man but the court do not believe he and he get seven year plain story you see spargo when it all come out eh all story be quite plain -- when they come out observe spargo and he keep silence now i suppose because he do not want he daughter to know about he past just so agree rathbury and i do not know that i blame he he think of course that he would go scot-free over this marbury affair but he make he mistake in the initial stage my boy -- oh yes spargo get up from he desk and walk around he room for a few minute rathbury meanwhile find and light another cigar at last spargo come back and clap a hand on the detective 's shoulder look here rathbury he say it be very evident that you be now go on the line that aylmore do murder marbury eh rathbury look up he face show astonishment after evidence like that he exclaim why of course there be the motive my son the motive spargo laugh rathbury he say aylmore no more murder marbury than you do the detective get up and put on he hat oh he say perhaps you know who do then i shall know in a few day answer spargo rathbury stare wonderingly at he then he suddenly walk to the door good-night he say gruffly good-night rathbury reply spargo and sit down at he desk but that night spargo write nothing for the _ watchman _ all he write be a short telegram address to aylmore 's daughter there be only three word on it -- _ have no fear _ chapter twenty-nine the closed door alone of all the london morning newspaper the _ watchman _ appear next day destitute of sensationalism in respect to the middle temple murder the other daily journal publish more or less vivid account of the identification of mr stephen aylmore mp for the brookminster division as the _ ci-devant _ stephen ainsworth ex-convict once upon a time founder and secretary of the hearth and home mutual benefit society the headquarters of which have be at cloudhampton in daleshire the fall of which have involve thousand of honest work folk in terrible distress if not in absolute ruin most of they have rake up ainsworth 's past to considerable journalistic purpose : it have be a easy matter to turn up old file to recount the fall of the hearth and home to tell anew the story of the privation of the humble investor whose small hoard have go in the crash it have be easy too to set out again the history of ainsworth 's arrest trial and fate there be plenty of romance in the story : it be that of a man who by he financial ability have build up a great industrial insurance society have -- as be allege -- convert the large sum entrust to he to he own purpose have be detect and punish have disappear after he punishment so effectually that no one know where he have go have come back comparatively a few year later under another name a very rich man and have enter parliament and be in a modest way a public character without any of those who know he in he new career suspect that he have once wear a dress liberally ornament with the broad arrow fine copy excellent copy : some of the morning newspaper make a couple of column of it but the _ watchman _ up to then easily ahead of all its contemporary in keep the public inform of all the latest news in connection with the marbury affair contented itself with a brief announcement for after rathbury have leave he spargo have seek he proprietor and he editor and have sit long in consultation with they and the result of they talk have be that all the _ watchman _ think fit to tell its reader next morning be contain in a curt paragraph : we understand that mr stephen aylmore mp who be charge with the murder of john marbury or maitland in the temple on June 21st last be yesterday afternoon identify by certain official as stephen ainsworth who be sentence to a term of penal servitude in connection with the hearth and home mutual benefit society fund nearly thirty year ago come down to fleet street that morning spargo stroll jauntily along the front of the law court encounter a fellow-journalist a man on a opposition newspaper who grin at he in a fashion which indicate derision leave behind a bit that rag of yours this morning spargo my boy he remark elegantly why you have miss one of the finest opportunity i ever hear of in connection with that aylmore affair a miserable paragraph -- why i work off a column and a half in ours what be you do last night old man sleep say spargo and go by with a nod sleep he leave the other stare at he and cross the road to middle temple lane it be just on the stroke of eleven as he walk up the stair to mr elphick 's chamber precisely eleven as he knock at the outer door it be seldom that outer door be close in the temple at that hour but elphick 's door be close fast enough the night before it have be promptly open but there be no response to spargo 's first knock nor to he second nor to he third and half-unconsciously he murmur aloud : elphick 's door be close it never occur to spargo to knock again : instinct tell he that elphick 's door be close because elphick be not there close because elphick be not go to keep the appointment he turn and walk slowly back along the corridor and just as he reach the head of the stair ronald breton pale and anxious come run up they and at sight of spargo pause stare questioningly at he as if with a mutual sympathy the two young man shake hand i be glad you do not print more than those two or three line in the _ watchman _ this morning say breton it be -- considerate as for the other papers -- aylmore assure I last night spargo that though he do serve that term at dartmoor he be innocent enough he be scapegoat for another man who disappear then as spargo merely nod he add awkwardly : and i be oblige to you too old chap for send that wire to the two girl last night -- it be good of you they want all the comfort they can get poor thing but -- what be you do here spargo spargo lean against the head of the stair and fold he hand i come here he say to keep a appointment with mr elphick -- a appointment which he make when i call on he as you suggest at nine o'clock the appointment -- a most important one -- be for eleven o'clock breton glance at he watch come on then he say it be well past that now and my guardian 's a very martinet in the matter of punctuality but spargo do not move instead he shake he head regard breton with troubled eye so be i he answer i be train to it you guardian be not there breton not there if he make a appointment for eleven nonsense -- i never know he miss a appointment i knock three time -- three separate time answer spargo you should have knock half a dozen time -- he may have oversleep himself he sit up late -- he and old cardlestone often sit up half the night talk stamp or play piquet say breton come on -- you 'll see spargo shake he head again he be not there breton he say he be go breton stare at the journalist as if he have just announce that he have see mr septimus elphick ride down fleet street on a dromedary he seize spargo 's elbow come on he say i have a key to mr elphick 's door so that i can go in and out as i like i 'll soon show you whether he be go or not spargo follow the young barrister down the corridor all the same he say meditatively as breton fit a key to the latch he be not there breton he be -- off good heaven man i do not know what you be talk about exclaimed breton open the door and walk into the lobby off where on earth should he be off to when he be make a appointment with you for eleven and -- hullo he have open the door of the room in which spargo have meet elphick and miss baylis the night before and be walk in when he pull himself up on the threshold with a sharp exclamation good god he cry what -- what be all this spargo quietly look over breton 's shoulder it need but one quick glance to show he that much have happen in that quiet room since he have quit it the night before there stand the easy-chair in which he have leave elphick there close by it but push aside as if by a hurry hand be the little table with its spirit case its syphon its glass in which stale liquid still stand there be the novel turn face downwards there upon the novel be elphick 's pipe but the rest of the room be in dire confusion the drawer of a bureau have be pull open and never put back papers of all description old legal-looking document old letter litter the centre-table and the floor in one corner of the room a black japanned box have be open its contents strew about and the lid leave yawn and in the grate and all over the fender there be mass of burn and char paper it be only too evident that the occupant of the chamber wherever he might have disappear to have spend some time before he disappearance in destroy a considerable heap of document and papers and in such haste that he have not trouble to put matter straight before he go breton stare at this scene for a moment in utter consternation then he make one step towards a inner door and spargo follow he together they enter a inner room -- a sleep apartment there be no one in it but there be evidence that elphick have just as hastily pack a bag as he have destroy he papers the clothes which spargo have see he wear the previous evening be fling here there everywhere : the gorgeous smoking-jacket be toss unceremoniously in one corner a dress-shirt in the bosom of which valuable stud still glisten in another one or two suitcase lay about as if they have be examine and discard in favor of something more portable here too drawer reveal stock of linen and underclothing have be tear open and leave open open too swing the door of a wardrobe reveal a quantity of expensive clothing and spargo look around he seem to see all that have happen -- the hasty almost frantic search for and tear up and burning of papers the hurry change of clothing of packing necessaries into a bag that could be carry and then the flight the get away the -- what on earth do all this mean exclaimed breton what be it spargo i mean exactly what i tell you answer spargo he be off off off but why off what -- my guardian -- as quiet a old gentleman as there be in the temple -- off cry breton for what reason eh it be not -- good god spargo it be not because of anything you say to he last night i should say it be precisely because of something that i say to he last night reply spargo i be a fool ever to let he out of my sight breton turn on he companion and gasp out -- of -- you -- sight he exclaim why -- why -- you do not mean to say that mr elphick have anything to do with this marbury affair for god 's sake spargo -- spargo lay a hand on the young barrister 's shoulder i be afraid you 'll have to hear a good deal breton he say i be go to talk to you today in any case you see -- before spargo could say more a woman bear the implement which denote the charwoman 's profession enter the room and immediately cry out at what she see breton turn on she almost savagely here you he say have you see anything of mr elphick this morning the charwoman roll she eye and lift she hand I sir not a sign of he sir which i never come here much before half-past eleven sir mr elphick be then go out to he breakfast i see he yesterday morning sir which he be then in he usual state of good health sir if any thing 's the matter with he now no sir i be not see nothing of he breton let out another exclamation of impatience you would better leave all this he say mr elphick 's evidently go away in a hurry and you must not touch anything here until he come back i be go to lock up the chamber : if you have a key of they give it to I the charwoman handed over a key give another astonished look at the room and vanish mutter and breton turn to spargo what do you say he demand i must hear -- a good deal out with it then man for heaven 's sake but spargo shake he head not now breton he answer presently i tell you for miss aylmore 's sake and you own the first thing to do be to get on you guardian 's track we must -- must i say -- and at once breton stand stare at spargo for a moment as if he could not credit he own sens then he suddenly motion spargo out of the room come on he say i know who 'll know where he be if anybody do who then ask spargo as they hurry out cardlestone answer breton grimly cardlestone chapter thirty revelation there be as much bright sunshine that morning in middle temple lane as ever manage to get into it and some of it be shine in the entry into which spargo and breton presently hurry full of haste as he be breton pause at the foot of the stair he look down at the floor and at the wall at its side be not it there he say in a low voice point at the place he look at be not it there spargo just there that marbury or rather maitland be find it be just there answer spargo you see he i see he soon -- afterwards immediately after he be find you know all that breton why do you ask now breton who be still stare at the place on which he have fix he eye on walk into the entry

have be bad that in cardlestone 's chamber be worse here again all the feature of the previous scene be repeat -- drawer have be tear open papers throw about the hearth be choke with light ash everything be at six and seven a open door lead into a inner room show that cardlestone like elphick have hastily pack a bag like elphick have change he clothes and have throw he discard garment anywhere into any corner spargo begin to realize what have take place -- elphick have make he own preparation for flight have come to cardlestone and have expedite he and they have flee together but -- why the charwoman sit down in the nearest chair and begin to moan and sob breton stride forward across the heap of papers and miscellaneous object toss aside in that hurry search and clear up into the inner room and spargo look about he suddenly catch sight of something lie on the floor at which he make a sharp clutch he have just secure it and hurry it into he pocket when breton come back i do not know what all this mean spargo he say almost wearily i suppose you do look here he go on turn to the charwoman stop that row -- that 'll do no good you know i suppose mr cardlestone 's go away in a hurry you would better -- what have she better do spargo leave thing exactly as they be lock up the chamber and as you be a friend of mr cardlestone 's give you the key answer spargo with a significant glance do that now and let 's go -- i have something to do once outside with the startled charwoman go away spargo turn to breton i 'll tell you all i know presently breton he say in the meantime i want to find out if the lodge porter see mr elphick or mr cardlestone leave i must know where they have go -- if i can only find out i do not suppose they go on foot all right respond breton gloomily we 'll go and ask but this be all beyond I you do not mean to say -- wait a while answer spargo one thing at once he continue as they walk up middle temple lane this be the first thing you ask the porter if he be see anything of either of they -- he know you the porter duly interrogate respond with alacrity anything of mr elphick this morning mr breton he answer certainly sir i get a taxi for mr elphick and mr cardlestone early this morning -- soon after seven mr elphick say they be go to paris and they would breakfast at chare cross before the train leave say when they would be

such as they would put a day or two 's thing in sir all right say breton he turn away towards spargo who have already move off what next he ask chare cross i suppose spargo smile and shake he head no he answer i have no use for chare cross they have not go to pari that be all a blind for the present let 's go back to you chamber then i 'll talk to you once within breton 's inner room with the door close upon they spargo drop into a easy-chair and look at the young barrister with earnest attention breton he say i believe we be come in sight of land you want to save you prospective father-in-law do not you of course growl breton that go without say but -- but you may have to make some sacrifice in order to do it say spargo you see -- sacrifice exclaim breton what -- you may have to sacrifice some idea -- you may find that you 'll not be able to think as well of some people in the future as you have think of they in the past for instance -- mr elphick breton 's face grow dark speak plainly spargo he say it be best with I very well reply spargo mr elphick then be in some way connect with this affair you mean the -- murder i mean the murder so be cardlestone of that i be now dead certain and that be why they be off i startled elphick last night it be evident that he immediately communicate with cardlestone and that they make a rapid exit why why that be what i be ask you why why why because they be afraid of something come out and be afraid they first instinct be to -- run they have run at the first alarm foolish -- but instinctive breton who have fling himself into the elbow-chair at he desk jump to he foot and thump he blotting-pad spargo he exclaim be you tell I that you accuse my guardian and he friend mr cardlestone of be -- murderer nothing of the sort i be accuse mr elphick and mr cardlestone of know more about the murder than they care to tell or want to tell i be also accuse they and especially you guardian of know all about maitland alias marbury i make he confess last night that he know this dead man to be john maitland you do i do and now breton since it be get to come out well have the truth pull yourself together -- get you nerve ready for you 'll have to stand a shock or two but i know what i be talk about -- i can prove every word i be go to say to you and first let I ask you a few question do you know anything about you parentage nothing -- beyond what mr elphick have tell I and what be that that my parent be old friend of he who die young leave I unprovided for and that he take I up and look after I and he be never give you any documentary evidence of any sort to prove the truth of that story never i never question he statement why should i you never remember anything of you childhood -- i mean of any person who be particularly near you in you childhood i remember the people who bring I up from the time i be three year old and i have just a faint shadowy recollection of some woman a tall dark woman i think before that miss bayli say spargo to himself all right breton he go on aloud i be go to tell you the truth i 'll tell it to you straight out and give you all the explanation afterwards you real name be not breton at all you real name be maitland and you be the only child of the man who be find murder at the foot of cardlestone 's staircase spargo have be wonder how breton would take this and he gaze at he with some anxiety as he get out the last word what would he do -- what would he say -- what -- breton sit down quietly at he desk and look spargo hard between the eye prove that to I spargo he say in hard matter-of-fact tone prove it to I every word every word spargo spargo nod i will -- every word he answer it be the right thing listen then it be a quarter to twelve spargo notice throw a glance at the clock outside as he begin he story it be past one when he bring it to a end and all that time breton listen with the keenest attention only ask a question now and then now and then make a brief note on a sheet of paper which he have draw to he that be all say spargo at last it be plenty observe breton laconically he sit stare at he note for a moment then he look up at spargo what do you really think he ask about -- what say spargo this flight of elphick 's and cardlestone 's i think as i say that they know something which they think may be force upon they i never see a man in a greater fright than that i see elphick in last night and it be evident that cardlestone share in that fright or they would not have go off in this way together do you think they know anything of the actual murder spargo shake he head i do not know probably they know something and -- look here spargo put he hand in he breast pocket and draw something out which he hand to breton who gaze at it curiously what be this he demand stamp that from the description of criedir the stamp-dealer be a sheet of those rare australian stamp which maitland have on he -- carry on he i pick it up just now in cardlestone 's room when you be look into he bedroom but that after all prove nothing those may not be the identical stamp and whether they be or not -- what be the probability interrupted spargo sharply i believe that those be the stamp which maitland -- you father -- have on he and i want to know how they come to be in cardlestone 's room and i will know breton hand the stamp back but the general thing spargo he say if they do not murder -- i can not realize the thing yet -- my father -- if they do not murder you father they know who do exclaimed spargo now then it be time for more

by himself he halt on the threshold look round the comfortably-furnished room and at the two well-dressed young man which it frame as if he fear to enter on a scene of such grandeur come in come in say spargo rise and point to a easy-chair at the side of he desk take a seat you have call about that reward of course the man in the chair eye the two of they cautiously and not without suspicion he

-- if that grave 's empty say breton i 'll tell you -- a good deal chapter thirty-two the contents of the coffin there travel down together to market milcaster late that afternoon spargo breton the official from the home office entrust with the order for the opening of the chamberlayne grave and a solicitor act on behalf of the proprietor of the _ watchman _ it be late in the evening when they reach the little town but spargo have look in at the parlor of the yellow dragon and ascertain that mr quarterpage have only just go home take breton across the street to the old gentleman 's house mr quarterpage himself come to the door and recognize spargo immediately nothing would satisfy he but that the two should go in he family he say have just retire but he himself be go to take a final nightcap and a cigar and they must share it for a few minute only then mr quarterpage say spargo as they follow the old man into he dining-room we have to be up at daybreak and -- possibly -- you too would like to be up just as early mr quarterpage look a enquiry over the top of a decanter which he be handle at daybreak he exclaim the fact be say spargo that grave of chamberlayne 's be go to be open at daybreak we have manage to get a order from the home secretary for the exhumation of chamberlayne 's body : the official in charge of it have come down in the same train with we we be all stay across there at the ` dragon ' the official have go to make the proper arrangement with you authority it will be at daybreak or as near it as can conveniently be manage and i suppose now that you know of it you 'll be there god bless I exclaim mr quarterpage you have really do that well well so we shall know the truth at last after all these year you be a very wonderful young man mr spargo upon my word and this other young gentleman spargo look at breton who have already give he permission to speak mr quarterpage he say this young gentleman be without doubt john maitland 's son he be the young barrister mr ronald breton that i tell you of but there be no doubt about he parentage and i be sure you 'll shake hand with he and wish he well mr quarterpage set down decanter and glass and hasten to give breton he hand my dear young sir he exclaim that i will indeed and as to wish you well -- ah i never wish anything but well to you poor father he be lead away sir lead away by chamberlayne god bless I what a night of surprise why mr spargo suppose that coffin be find empty -- what then then answer spargo then i think we shall be able to put we hand on the man who be suppose to be in it you think my father be work upon by this man chamberlayne sir observe breton a few minute later when they have all sit down round mr quarterpage 's hospitable hearth you think he be unduly influence by he mr quarterpage shake he head sadly chamberlayne my dear young sir he answer chamberlayne be a plausible and a clever fellow nobody know anything about he until he come to this town and yet before he have be here very long he have contrived to ingratiate himself with everybody -- of course to he own advantage i firmly believe that he twist you father round he little finger as i tell mr spargo there when he be make he enquiry of I a short while back it would never have be any surprise to I to hear -- definitely i mean young gentleman -- that all this money that be in question go into chamberlayne 's pocket dear I -- dear I -- and you really believe that chamberlayne be actually alive mr spargo spargo pull out he watch we shall all know whether he be bury in that grave before another six hour be over mr quarterpage he say he might well have speak of four hour instead of six for it be then nearly midnight and before three o'clock spargo and breton with the other man who have accompany they from london be out of the yellow dragon and on they way to the cemetery just outside the little town over the hill to the eastward the gray dawn be slowly break : the long stretch of marshland which lie between market milcaster and the sea be white with fog : on the cypress and acacia of the cemetery hang veil and web of gossamer : everything around they be quiet as the dead folk who lay beneath they foot and the people actively concerned go quietly to work and those who could do nothing but watch stand around in silence in all my long life of over ninety year whisper old quarterpage who have meet they at the cemetery gate look fresh and brisk in spite of he shorten rest i have never see this do before it seem a strange strange thing to interfere with a dead man 's last resting-place -- a dreadful thing if there be a dead man there say spargo he himself be mainly curious about the detail of this exhumation he have no scruples sentimental or otherwise about the breaking in upon the dead he watch all that be do the man employ by the local authority instruct over-night have fence in the grave with canvas the proceedings be accordingly conduct in strict privacy a man be post to keep away any very early passersby who might be attract by the unusual proceedings at first there be nothing to do but wait and spargo occupied himself by reflect that every spadeful of earth throw out of that grave be bring he nearer to the truth he have a unconquerable intuition that the truth of at any rate one phase of the marbury case be go to be reveal to they if the coffin to which they be digging down contain a body and that the body of the stockbroker chamberlayne then a good deal of he spargo 's latest theory would be dissolve to nothingness but if that coffin contain no body at all then -- they be down to it whisper breton presently they all go and look down into the grave the workman have uncover the coffin preparatory to lift it to the surface one of they be brushing the earth away from the name-plate and in the now strong light they could all read the letter on it jame cartwright chamberlayne bear 1852 die 1891 spargo turn away as the man begin to lift the coffin out of the grave we shall know now he whisper to breton and yet -- what be it we shall know if -- if what say breton if -- what but spargo shake he head this be one of the great moment he have lately be work for and the issue be tremendous now for it say the _ watchman 's _ solicitor in a undertone come mr spargo now we shall see they all gather round the coffin set on low trestle at the graveside as the workman silently go to work on the screw the screw be rust in they socket they grate as the man slowly work they out it seem to spargo that each man grow slower and slower in he movement he feel that he himself be get fidgety then he hear a voice of authority lift the lid off a man at the head of the coffin a man at the foot suddenly and swiftly raise the lid : the man gather round crane they neck with a quick movement sawdust the coffin be pack to the brim with sawdust tightly press down the surface lay smooth undisturbed level as some hand have level it long year before they be not in the presence of death but of deceit somebody laugh faintly the sound of the laughter break the spell the chief official present look round he with a smile it be evident that there be good grounds for suspicion he remark here be no dead body gentleman see if anything lie beneath the sawdust he add turn to the workman turn it out the workman begin to scoop out the sawdust with they hand one of they evidently desirous of make sure that no body be in the coffin thrust down he finger at various place along its length he too laugh the coffin 's weighted with lead he remark see and tear the sawdust aside he show those around he that at three interval bar of lead have be tightly wedge into the coffin where the head the middle and the foot of a corpse would have rest do it cleverly he remark look round you see how these weight have be adjust when a body 's lay out in a coffin you know all the weight 's in the end where the head and trunk rest here you see the heaviest bar of lead be in the middle the lightest at the foot clever clear out all the sawdust say some one let 's see if there be anything else there be something else at the bottom of the coffin two bundle of papers tie up with pink tape the legal gentleman present immediately manifest great interest in these so do spargo who pull breton along with he force he way to where the official from the home office and the solicitor send by the _ watchman _ be hastily examine they discovery the first bundle of papers open evidently related to transaction at market milcaster : spargo catch glimpse of name that be familiar to he mr quarterpage 's amongst they he be not at all astonished to see these thing but he be something more than astonish when on the second parcel be open a quantity of papers relate to cloudhampton and the hearth and home mutual benefit society be reveal he give a hasty glance at these and draw breton aside it strike I we have find a good deal more than we ever bargain for he exclaim do not aylmore say that the real culprit at cloudhampton be another man -- he clerk or something of that sort he do agree breton he insist on it then this fellow chamberlayne must have be the man say spargo he come to market milcaster from the north what 'll be do with those papers he ask turn to the official we be go to seal they up at once and take they to london reply the principal person in authority they will be quite safe mr spargo have no fear we do not know what they may reveal you do not indeed say spargo but i may as well tell you that i have a strong belief that they 'll reveal a good deal that nobody dream of so take the greatest care of they then without wait for further talk with any one spargo hurry breton out of the cemetery at the gate he seize he by the arm now then breton he command out with it with what you promise to tell I something -- a great deal you say -- if we find that coffin empty it be empty come on -- quick all right i believe i know where elphick and cardlestone can be find that be all all it be enough where then in heaven 's name elphick have a queer little place where he and cardlestone sometimes go fishing -- right away up in one of the wildest part of the yorkshire moor i expect they have go there nobody know even they name there -- they could go and lie quiet there for -- age do you know the way to it i do -- i have be there spargo motion he to hurry come on then he say we be go there by the very first train out of this i know the train too -- we have just time to snatch a mouthful of breakfast and to send a wire to the _ watchman _ and then we 'll be off yorkshire -- gad breton that be over three hundred mile away chapter thirty-three forestall travel all that long summer day first from the south-west of england to the midland then from the midland to the north spargo and breton come late at night to hawe ' junction on the border of yorkshire and westmoreland and see rise all around they in the half-darkness the mighty bulk of the great fell which rise amongst that wild and lonely stretch of land at that hour of the night and amidst that weird silence break only by the murmur of some adjacent waterfall the scene be impressive and suggestive it seem to spargo as if london be a million mile away and the rush and bustle of human life a thing of another planet here and there in the valley he see a light but such light be few and far between even as he look some of they twinkle and go out it be evident that he and breton be presently to be alone with the night how far he ask breton as they walk away from the station we would better discuss matter answer breton the place be in a narrow valley call fossdale some six or seven mile away across these fell and as wild a walk as any lover of such thing could wish for it be half-past nine now spargo : i reckon it will take we a good two and a half hour if not more to do it now the question be -- do we go straight there or do we put up for the night there be a inn here at this junction : there be the moor cock inn a mile or so along the road which we must take before we turn off to the moorland and the fell it be go to be a black night -- look at those mass of black cloud gathering there -- and possibly a wet one and we have no waterproof but it be for you to say -- i be game for whatever you like do you know the way ask spargo i have be the way in the daytime i could go straight ahead i remember all the landmark even in the darkness i believe i can find my way but it be rough walk we 'll go straight there say spargo every minute 's precious but -- can we get a mouthful of bread and cheese and a glass of ale first good idea we 'll call in at the ` moor cock ' now then while we be on this firm road step it out lively the moor cock be almost desert at that hour : there be scarcely a soul in it when the two traveller turn in to its dimly-lighted parlor the landlord bring the desire refreshment look hard at breton come we way again then sir he remark with a sudden grin of recognition ah you remember I say breton i call in mind when you come here with the two old gent last year reply the landlord i hear they be here again -- tom summer be come across that way this morning and say he would see 'em at the little cottage go to join 'em i reckon sir breton kick spargo under the table yes we be go to have a day or two with they he answer just to get a breath of you moorland air well you 'll have a roughish walk over there tonight gentleman say the landlord there be go to be a storm and it be a stiffish way to make out at this time o'night oh we 'll manage say breton nonchalantly i know the way and we be not afraid of a wet skin the landlord laugh and sit down on he long settle fold he arm and scratch he elbow there be a gentleman -- london gentleman by he tongue -- come in here this afternoon and ask the way to fossdale he observe he 'll be there long since -- he would have daylight for he walk happen he be one of you party -- he ask where the old gentleman 's little cottage be again spargo feel he shin kick and make no sign one of they friend perhaps answer breton what be he like the landlord ruminate he be not good at description and be conscious of the fact well a darkish serious-faced gentleman he say stranger hereabouts at all event wear a gray suit -- something like you friend 's there yes -- he take some bread and cheese with he when he hear what a long way it be wise man remark breton he hastily finish he own bread and cheese and drink off the rest of he pint of ale come on he say let 's be step outside in the almost tangible darkness breton clutch spargo 's arm who be the man he say can you think spargo can not answer spargo i be try to while that chap be talk but -- it be somebody that be get in before we not rathbury anyhow -- he be not serious-faced heaven breton however be you go to find you way in this darkness you 'll see presently we follow the road a little then we turn up the fell side there on the top if the night clear a bit we ought to see great shunnor fall and lovely seat -- they be both well over two thousand foot and they stand up well we want to make for a point clear between they but i warn you spargo it be stiff go go ahead say spargo it be the first time in my life i ever do anything of this sort but we be go on if it take we all night i could not sleep in any bed now that i have hear there be somebody ahead of we go first old chap and i 'll follow breton go steadily forward along the road that be easy work but when he turn off and begin to thread he way up the fell-side by what be obviously no more than a sheep-track spargo 's trouble begin it seem to he that he be walk as in a nightmare all that he see be magnify and heighten the darken sky above the faint outline of the towering hill the gaunt spectre of fir and pine the figure of breton forge stolidly and surely ahead now the ground be soft and spongy under he foot now it be stony and rugged more than once he catch a ankle in the wire-like heather and trip bruise he knee and in the end he resign himself to keep he eye on breton outline against the sky and follow doggedly in he footstep be there no other way than this he ask after a long interval of silence do you mean to say those two -- elphick and cardlestone -- would take this way there be another way -- down the valley by thwaite bridge and hardraw answer breton but it be mile and mile round this be a straight cut across country and in daylight it be a delightful walk but at night -- gad -- here be the rain spargo the rain come down as it do in that part of the world with a suddenness that be as fierce as it be heavy the whole of the gray night be blot out spargo be only conscious that he stand in a vast solitude and be be gradually drown but breton whose sight be keener and who have more knowledge of the situation drag he companion into the shelter of a group of rock he laugh a little as they huddle closely together this be a different sort of thing to pursue detective work in fleet street spargo he say you would come on you know i be go on if we go through cataract and flood answer spargo i might have be induce to stop at the ` moor cock ' overnight if we have not hear of that chap in front if he be after those two he be somebody who know something what i can not make out be -- who he can be nor i say breton i can not think of anybody who know of this retreat but -- have it ever strike you spargo that somebody beside yourself may have be investigate possible reply spargo one never know i only wish we have be a few hour earlier for i want to have the first word with those two the rain cease as suddenly as it have come just as suddenly the heaven clear and go forward to the top of the ridge which they be then cross breton point a arm to something shine far away below they you see that he say that be a sheet of water lie between we and cotterdale we leave that on we right hand climb the fell beyond it drop down into cotterdale cross two more range of fell and come down into fossdale under lovely seat there be a good two hour and a half stiff pull yet spargo think you can stick it spargo set he tooth go on he say up hill down dale now up to he ankle in peaty ground now tear he shin now bruise he knee spargo yearning for the london light the well-paved london street the convenient taxi-cab even the humble omnibus plod forward after he guide it seem to he that they have walk for age and have traverse a whole continent of mountain and valley when at last breton halt on the summit of a wind-swept ridge lay one hand on he companion 's shoulder and point downward with the other there he say there spargo look ahead into the night far away at what seem to he to be a considerable distance he see the faint very faint glimmer of a light -- a mere spark of a light that be the cottage say breton late as it be you see they be up and here be the roughest bit of the journey it 'll take I all my time to find the track across this moor spargo so step carefully after I -- there be bog and hole hereabouts another hour have go by ere the two come to the cottage sometimes the guide light have vanish blot out by intervene rise in the ground always when they see it again they be slowly draw nearer to it and now when they be at last close to it spargo realize that he find himself in one of the loneliest place he have ever be capable of imagine -- so lonely and desolate a spot he have certainly never see in the dim light he could see a narrow crawl stream make its way down over rock and stone from the high ground of great shunnor fall opposite to the place at which they stand on the edge of the moorland a horseshoe like formation of ground be back by a ring of fir and pine beneath this protect fringe of tree stand a small building of gray stone which look as if it have be originally build by some shepherd as a pen for the moorland sheep it be of no more than one storey in height but of some length a considerable part of it be hide by shrub and brushwood and from one uncurtained blindless window the light of a lamp shone boldly into the fading darkness without breton pull up on the edge of the crawl stream we have get to get across there spargo he say but as we be already soak to the knee it do not matter about get another wet have you any idea how long we have be walk hour -- day -- year reply spargo i should say quite four hour say breton in that case it be well past two o'clock and the light will be break in another hour or so now once across this stream what shall we do what have we come to do go to the cottage of course wait a bit no need to startle they by the fact they have get a light i take it that they be up look there as he speak a figure cross the window pass between it and the light that be not elphick nor yet cardlestone say spargo they be medium-heighted man that be a tallish man then it be the man the landlord of the ` moor cock ' tell we about say breton now look here -- i know every inch of this place when we be across let I go up to the cottage and i 'll take a observation through that window and see who be inside come on he lead spargo across the stream at a place where a succession of boulder make a natural bridge and bidding he keep quiet go up the bank to the cottage spargo watch he see he make he way past the shrub and undergrowth until he come to a great bush which stand between the light window and the project porch of the cottage he linger in the shadow of this bush but for a short moment then come swiftly and noiselessly back to he companion he hand fall on spargo 's arm with a clutch of nervous excitement spargo he whisper who on earth do you think the other man be chapter thirty-four the whip hand spargo almost irritable from desire to get at close grip with the object of he long journey shake off breton 's hand with a growl of resentment and how on earth can i waste time guess he exclaim who be he breton laugh softly steady spargo steady he say it be myerst -- the safe deposit man myerst spargo start as if something have bite he myerst he almost shout myerst good lord -- why do i never think of he myerst then -- i do not know why you should have think of he say breton but -- he be there spargo take a step towards the cottage : breton pull he back wait he say we have get to discuss this i would better tell you what they be do what be they do then demand spargo impatiently well answer breton they be go through a quantity of papers the two old gentleman look very ill and very miserable myerst be evidently lay down the law to they in some fashion or other i have form a notion spargo what notion myerst be in possession of whatever secret they have and he be follow they down here to blackmail they that be my notion spargo think awhile pacing up and down the river bank i daresay you be right he say now what be to be do breton too consider matter i wish he say at last i wish we could get in there and overhear what be go on but that be impossible -- i know that cottage the only thing we can do be this -- we must catch myerst unaware he be here for no good look here and reach round to he hip-pocket breton draw out a browning revolver and wag it in he hand with a smile that be a useful thing to have spargo he remark i slip it into my pocket the other day wonder why on earth i do it now it 'll come in handy for anything we know myerst may be arm well say spargo come up to the cottage if thing turn out as i think they will myerst when he be get what he want will be off now you shall get where i do just now behind that bush and i 'll station myself in the doorway you can report to I and when myerst come out i 'll cover he come on spargo it be begin to get light already breton cautiously lead the way along the river bank make use of such cover as the willow and alder afford together he and spargo make they way to the front of the cottage arrive at the door breton post himself in the porch motion to spargo to creep in behind the bush and to look through the window and spargo noiselessly follow he direction and slightly parting the branch which conceal he look in through the uncurtained glass the interior into which he look be rough and comfortless in the extreme there be the bare accessory of a moorland cottage rough chair and table plaster wall a fishing rod or two pile in a corner some food set out on a side table at the table in the middle of the floor the three man sit cardlestone 's face be in the shadow myerst have he back to the window old elphick bend over the table be laboriously write with shake finger and spargo twist he head round to he companion elphick he say be write a cheque myerst have another cheque in he hand be ready -- when he get that second cheque i guess he 'll be off breton smile grimly and nod a moment later spargo whisper again look out breton he be come breton draw back into the angle of the porch spargo quit he protect bush and take the other angle the door open and they hear myerst 's voice threaten command in tone now remember all i have say and do not you forget -- i have the whip hand of both of you -- the whip hand then myerst turn and step out into the gray light -- to find himself confront by a athletic young man who hold the muzzle of a ugly revolver within two inch of the bridge of he nose and in a remarkably firm and steady grip another glance show he the figure of a second business-like look young man at he side whose attitude show a desire to grapple with he good-morning mr myerst say breton with cold and ironic politeness we be glad to meet you so unexpectedly and -- i must trouble you to put up you

sailor he leave myerst literally unable to move either hand or foot and myerst curse he from crown to heel for he pain that 'll do say breton at last he drop he revolver into he pocket and turn to the two old man elphick avert he eye and sink into a chair in the darkest corner of the room : old cardlestone shake as with palsy and mutter word which the two young man could not catch guardian continue breton do not be frightened and do not you be frighten either mr cardlestone there be nothing to be afraid of just yet whatever there may be later on it seem to I that mr spargo and i come just in

that amount breton examine all these matter as spargo hand they out he turn to old elphick guardian he say why have you or mr cardlestone give this man these cheque and security what hold have he on you old cardlestone begin to whimper afresh elphick turn a troubled face on he ward he -- he threaten to accuse we of the murder of marbury he falter we -- we do not see that we have a chance what do

lane you know in the top-floor room above cardlestone 's and -- and he say he be the fullest evidence against cardlestone -- and against I as a accessory after the fact and -- it be a lie ask breton a lie answer elphick of course it be a lie but -- he be so clever that -- that -- that you do not know how you could prove it otherwise say breton ah and so this fellow life over mr cardlestone there do he that may account for a good many thing now we must have the police here he sit down at the table and draw the write material to he look here spargo he continue i be go to write a note to the superintendent of police at hawe -- there be a farm half a mile from here where i can get a man to ride down to hawe with the note now if you want to send a wire to the _ watchman _ draft it out and he 'll take it with he elphick begin to move in he corner must the police come he say must -- the police must come answer breton firmly go ahead with you wire spargo while i write this note three quarter of a hour later when breton come back from the farm he sit down at elphick 's side and lay he hand on the old man 's now guardian he say quietly you have get to tell we the truth chapter thirty-five myerst explain it have be apparent to spargo from the moment of he enter the cottage that the two old man be suffer badly from shock and fright : cardlestone still sit in he corner shiver and tremble he look incapable of explain anything elphick be scarcely more fit to speak and when breton issue he peremptory invitation to he guardian to tell the truth spargo intervene far better leave he alone breton he say in a low voice do not you see the old chap 's do up they be both do up we do not know what they have go through with this fellow before we come and it be certain they have have no sleep leave it all till later -- after all we have find they and we have find he he jerk he thumb over he shoulder in myerst 's direction and breton involuntarily follow the movement he catch the prisoner 's eye and myerst laugh i daresay you two young man think yourselve very clever he say sneeringly do not you now we have be clever enough to catch you anyway retort breton and now we have get you we 'll keep you till the police can relieve we of you oh say myerst with another sneer laugh and on what charge do you propose to hand I over to the police it strike I you 'll have some difficulty in formulate one mr breton well see about that later say breton you have extort money by menace from these gentleman at any rate have i how do you know they do not entrust I with these cheque as they agent exclaim myerst answer I that or rather let they answer if they dare here you cardlestone you elphick -- do not you give I these cheque as you agent speak up now and quick spargo watch the two old man see they both quiver at the sound of myerst 's voice cardlestone indeed begin to whimper softly look here breton he say whispering this scoundrel 's get some hold on these two old chap -- they be frighten to death of he leave they alone : it would be best for they if they could get some rest hold you tongue you he add aloud turn to myerst when we want you to speak we 'll tell you but myerst laugh again all very high and mighty mr spargo of the _ watchman _ he sneer you be another of the cock-sure lot and you be very clever but not clever enough now look here suppose -- spargo turn he back on he he go over to old cardlestone and feel he hand and he turn to breton with a look of concern i say he exclaim he be more than frighten -- he be ill what be to be do i ask the police to bring a doctor along with they answer breton in the meantime let 's put he to bed -- there be bed in that inner room we 'll get he to bed and give he something hot to drink -- that be all i can think of for the present between they they manage to get cardlestone to he bed and spargo with a happy thought boil water on the rusty stove and put hot bottle to he foot when that be do they persuade elphick to lie down in the inner room presently both old man fall asleep and then breton and spargo suddenly realize that they themselves be hungry and wet and weary there ought to be food in the cupboard say breton begin to rummage they have generally have a good stock of tinned thing here we be spargo -- these be tongue and sardine make some hot coffee while i open one of these tin the prisoner watch the preparation for a rough and ready breakfast with eye that eventually begin to glisten i may remind you that i be hungry too he say as spargo set the coffee on the table and you have no right to starve I even if you have the physical ability to keep I tie up give I something to eat if you please you sha not starve say breton carelessly he cut a ample supply of bread and meat fill a cup with coffee and place cup and plate before myerst untie he right arm spargo he continue i think we can give he that liberty we have get he revolver anyhow for a while the three man eat and drink in silence at last myerst push he plate away he look scrutinizingly at he two captor look here he say you think you know a lot about all this affair spargo but there be only one person who know all about it that be I we be take that for grant say spargo we guess as much when we find you here you 'll have ample opportunity for explanation you know later on i 'll explain now if you care to hear say myerst with another of he cynical laugh and if i do i 'll tell you the truth i know you have get a idea in you head that be not favourable to I but you be utterly wrong whatever you may think look here -- i 'll make you a fair offer there be some cigar in my case there -- give I one and mix I a drink of that whisky -- a good ` un -- and i 'll tell you what i know about this matter come on -- anything 's better than sit here do nothing the two young man look at each other then breton nod let he talk if he like he say we be not bind to believe he and we may hear something that be true give he he cigar and he drink myerst take a stiff pull at the contents of the tumbler which spargo presently set before he he laugh as he inhale the first fume of he cigar as it happen you 'll hear nothing but the truth he observe now that thing be as they be there be no reason why i should not tell the truth the fact be i have nothing to fear you can not give I in charge for it so happen that i have get a power of attorney from these two old chap inside there to act for they in regard to the money they entrust I with it be in a inside pocket of that letter-case and if you look at it breton you 'll see it be in order i be not even go to dare you to interfere with or destroy it -- you be a barrister and you 'll respect the law but that be a fact -- and if anybody 's get a case against anybody i have against you two for assault and illegal detention but i be not a vindictive man and -- breton take up myerst 's letter-case and examine its contents and presently he turn to spargo he be right he whisper this be quite in order he turn to myerst all the same he say address he we sha not release you because we believe you be concern in the murder of john marbury we be justified in hold you on that account all right my young friend say myerst have you own stupid way but i say i would tell you the plain truth well the plain truth be that i know no more of the absolute murder of you father than i know of what be go on in timbuctoo at this moment i do not know who kill john maitland that be a fact it may have be the old man in there who be already at he own last gasp or it may not i tell you i do not know -- though like you spargo i have try hard to find out that be the truth -- i do not know you expect we to believe that exclaimed breton incredulously believe it or not as you like -- it be the truth answer myerst now look here -- i say nobody know as much of this affair as i know and that be true also and here be the truth of what i know the old man in that room whom you know as nichola cardlestone be in reality chamberlayne the stockbroker of market milcaster whose name be so freely mention when you father be try there that be another fact how ask breton sternly can you prove it how do you know it because reply myerst with a cunning grin i help to carry out he mock death and burial -- i be a solicitor in those day and my name be -- something else there be three of we at it : chamberlayne 's nephew a doctor of no reputation and myself we carry it out very cleverly and chamberlayne give we five thousand pound apiece for we trouble it be not the first time that i have help he and be well pay for my help the first time be in connection with the cloudhampton hearth and home mutual benefit society affair -- aylmore or ainsworth be as innocent as a child in that -- chamberlayne be the man at the back but unfortunately chamberlayne do not profit -- he lose all he get by it pretty quick that be why be transfer he ability to market milcaster you can prove all this i suppose remark spargo every word -- every letter but about the market milcaster affair : you father breton be right in what he say about chamberlayne have all the money that be get from the bank he have -- and he engineer that mock death and funeral so that he could disappear and he pay we who help he generously as i have tell you the thing could not have be better do when it be do the nephew disappear the doctor disappear chamberlayne disappear i have bad luck -- to tell you the truth i be strike off the roll for a technical offence so i change my name and become mr myerst and eventually what i be now and it be not until three year ago that i find chamberlayne i find he in this way : after i become secretary to the safe deposit company i take chamber in the temple above cardlestone 's and i speedily find out who he be instead of go abroad the old fox -- though he be a comparatively young ` un then -- have shave off he beard settle down in the temple and give himself up to he two hobby collect curiosity and stamp there he would live quietly all these year and nobody have ever recognize or suspect he indeed i do not see how they could he live such a quiet secluded life with he collection he old port and he little whim and fad but -- i know he and you doubtless profit by you recognition suggest breton i certainly do he be glad to pay I a nice sum every quarter to hold my tongue reply myerst and i be glad to take it and naturally i gain a considerable knowledge of he he have only one friend -- mr elphick in there now i 'll you about he only if you be go to speak respectfully of he say breton sternly i have no reason to do otherwise elphick be the man who ought to have marry you mother when thing turn out as they do elphick take you and bring you up as he have do so that you should never know of you father 's disgrace elphick never know until last night that cardlestone be chamberlayne even the biggest scoundrel have friend -- elphick 's very fond of cardlestone he -- spargo turn sharply on myerst you say elphick do not know until last night he exclaim why then this run away what be they run from i have no more notion than you have spargo reply myerst i tell you one or other of they know something that i do not elphick i gather take fright from you and go to cardlestone -- then they both vanish it may be that cardlestone do kill maitland -- i do not know but i 'll tell you what i know about the actual murder -- for i do know a good deal about it though as i say i do not know who kill maitland now first you know all that about maitland 's have papers and valuable and gold on he very well -- i have get all that the whole lot be lock up -- safely -- and i be willing to hand it over to you breton when we go back to town and the necessary proof be give -- as it will be -- that you be maitland 's son myerst pause to see the effect of this announcement and laugh when he see the blank astonishment which steal over he hearer ' face and still more he continue i have get all the contents of that leather box which maitland deposit with I -- that be safely lock up too and at you disposal i take possession of that the day after the murder then for purpose of my own i go to scotland yard as spargo there be aware you see i be play a game -- and it require some ingenuity a game exclaim breton good heaven -- what game i never know until i have possession of all these thing that marbury be maitland of market milcaster answer myerst when i do know then i begin to put thing together and to pursue my own line independent of everybody i tell you i have all maitland 's papers and possession by that time -- except one thing that packet of australian stamp and -- i find out that those stamp be in the hand of -- cardlestone chapter thirty-six the final telegram myerst pause to take a pull at he glass and to look at the two amaze listener with a smile of conscious triumph in the hand of cardlestone he repeat now what do i argue from that why of course that maitland have be to cardlestone 's room that night be not he find lie dead at the foot of cardlestone 's stair aye -- but who find he not the porter -- not the police -- not you master spargo with all you cleverness the man who find maitland lie dead there that night be -- i in the silence that follow spargo who have be make note of what myerst say suddenly drop he pencil and thrust he hand in he pocket sit bolt upright with a look which breton who be watch he seriously could not make out it be the look of a man whose idea and conception be be rudely upset and myerst too see it and he laugh more sneeringly than ever that be one for you spargo he say that surprise you -- that make you think now what do you think -- if one may ask i think say spargo that you be either a consummate liar or that this mystery be bigger than before i can lie when it be necessary retorted myerst just now it be not necessary i be tell you the plain truth : there be no reason why i should not as i have say before although you two young bully have tie I up in this fashion you can not do anything against I i have a power of attorney from those two old man in there and that be enough to satisfy anybody as to my possession of they cheque and security i have the whip hand of you my son in all way and that be why i be tell you the truth -- to amuse myself during this period of wait the plain truth my son in pursuance of which observe breton drily i think you mention that you be the first person to find my father lie dead i be that be -- as far as i can gather i 'll tell you all about it as i say i live over cardlestone that night i come home very late -- it be well past one o'clock there be nobody about -- as a matter of fact no one have residential chamber in that building but cardlestone and myself i find the body of a man lie in the entry i strike a match and immediately recognize my visitor of the afternoon -- john marbury now although i be so late in go home i be as sober as a man can be and i think pretty quickly at all time i think at double extra speed just then and the first thing i do be to strip the body of every article it have on it -- money papers everything all these thing be safely lock up -- they have never be track next day use my facility as secretary to the safe deposit company i secure the thing in that box then i find out who the dead man really be and then i deliberately set to work to throw dust in the eye of the police and of the newspaper and particularly in the eye of young master spargo there i have a object what ask breton what know all i do i firmly believe that marbury or rather maitland have be murder by either cardlestone or elphick i put it to myself in this way and my opinion be strengthen as you spargo insert news in you paper -- maitland finding himself in the vicinity of cardlestone after leave aylmore 's room that night turn into we building perhaps just to see where cardlestone live he meet cardlestone accidentally or he perhaps meet cardlestone and elphick together -- they recognize each other maitland probably threaten to expose cardlestone or rather chamberlayne -- nobody of course could know what happen but my theory be that chamberlayne kill he there at any rate be the fact that maitland be find murder at chamberlayne 's very threshold and in the course of a few day i prove to my own positive satisfaction by get access to chamberlayne 's room in he absence that maitland have be there have be in those room for i find there in chamberlayne 's desk the rare australian stamp of which criedir tell at the inquest that be proof positive spargo look at breton they know what myerst do not know -- that the stamp of which he speak be lie in spargo 's breast pocket where they have lie since he have pick they up from the litter and confusion of chamberlayne 's floor why ask breton after a pause why do you never accuse cardlestone or chamberlayne of the murder i do i have accuse he a score of time -- and elphick too reply myerst with emphasis not at first mind you -- i never let chamberlayne know that i ever suspect he for some time i have my own game to play but at last -- not so many day ago -- i do i accuse they both that be how i get the whip hand of they they begin to be afraid -- by that time elphick have get to know all about cardlestone 's past as chamberlayne and as i tell you elphick 's fond of cardlestone it be queer but he be he -- want to shield he what do they say when you accuse they ask breton let 's keep to that point -- never mind they feeling for one another just so but that feeling 's a lot more to do with this mystery than you think my young friend say myerst what do they say you ask why they strenuously deny it cardlestone swear solemnly to I that he have no part or lot in the murder of maitland so do elphick but -- they know something about the murder if those two old man can not tell you definitely who actually strike john maitland down i be certain that they have a very clear idea in they mind as to who really do they -- a sudden sharp cry from the inner room interrupted myerst breton and spargo start to they foot and make for the door but before they could reach it elphick come out white and shake he be go he exclaim in quaver accent my old friend 's go -- he be dead i be -- asleep i wake suddenly and look at he he -- spargo force the old man into a chair and give he some whisky breton pass quickly into the inner room only to come back shake he head he be dead he say he evidently die in he sleep then he secret 's go with he remark myerst calmly and now we shall never know if he do kill john maitland or if he do not so that be do with old elphick suddenly sit up in he chair push spargo fiercely away from he side he do not kill john maitland he cry angrily attempt to shake he fist at myerst whoever say he kill maitland lie he be as innocent as i be you have tortured and torment he to he death with that charge as you be torture I -- among you i tell you he would nothing to do with john maitland 's death -- nothing myerst laugh who have then he say hold you tongue command breton turn angrily on he he sit down by elphick 's side and lay he hand soothingly on the old man 's arm guardian he say why do not you tell what you know do not be afraid of that fellow there -- he be safe enough tell spargo and I what you know of the matter remember nothing can hurt cardlestone or chamberlayne or whoever he be or be now elphick sit for a moment shake he head he allow spargo to give he another drink he lift he head and look at the two young man with something of a appeal i be badly shake he say i have suffer much lately -- i have learn thing that i do not know perhaps i ought to have speak before but i be afraid for -- for he he be a good friend cardlestone whatever else he may have be -- a good friend and -- i do not know any more than what happen that night tell we what happen that night say breton well that night i go round as i often do to play piquet with cardlestone that be about ten o'clock about eleven jane bayli come to cardlestone 's -- she would be to my room to find I -- want to see I particularly -- and she would come on there know where i should be cardlestone would make she have a glass of wine and a biscuit she sit down and we all talk then about i should think a quarter to twelve a knock come at cardlestone 's door -- he outer door be open and of course anybody outside could see light within cardlestone go to the door : we hear a man 's voice enquire for he by name then the voice add that criedir the stamp dealer have advise he to call on mr cardlestone to show he some rare australian stamp and that see a light under he door he have knock cardlestone ask he in -- he come in that be the man we see next day at the mortuary upon my honor we do not know he either that night or next day what happen when he come in ask breton cardlestone ask he to sit down : he offer and give he a drink the man say criedir have give he cardlestone 's address and that he would be with a friend at some room in fountain court and as he be pass we building he have just look to make sure where cardlestone live and as he would notice a light he would make bold to knock he and cardlestone begin to examine the stamp jane bayli say good-night and she and i leave cardlestone and the man together no one have recognize he say breton no one remember i only once or twice see maitland in all my life the other certainly do not recognize he at least i never know that they do -- if they do tell we say spargo join in for the first time tell we what you and miss bayli do at the foot of the stair jane bayli suddenly say she would forget something in cardlestone 's lobby as she be go out in to fleet street and i be go down middle temple lane to turn off to my own room we say good-night she go back upstairs and i go home and upon my soul and honor that be all i know spargo suddenly leap to he foot he snatch at he cap -- a sodden and bedraggled headgear which he have throw down when they enter the cottage that be enough he almost shout i have get it -- at last breton -- where 's the nearest telegraph office hawe straight down this valley then here be for it look after thing till i be back or when the police come join I there i shall catch the first train to town anyhow after wiring but -- what be you after spargo exclaim breton stop what on earth -- but spargo have close the door and be run for all he be worth down the valley three quarter of a hour later he startle a quiet and peaceful telegraphist by dart breathless and dirty into a sleepy country post office snatch a telegraph form and scribble down a message in shaky handwriting : -- _ rathbury new scotland yard london arrest jane bayli at once for murder of john maitland come straight to town with full evidence frank spargo _ then spargo drop on the office bench and while the wonder operator set the wire tick strove to get he breath utterly spend in he mad race across the heather and when it be get he set out again -- to find the station some day later spargo have see stephen aylmore walk out of the bow street dock clear of the charge against he and in a fair way of be clear of the affair of twenty year before find himself in a very quiet corner of the court hold the hand of jessie aylmore who he discover be say thing to he which he scarcely comprehend there be nobody near they and the girl speak freely and warmly but you will come -- you will come today -- and be properly thank she say you will -- will not you spargo allow himself to retain possession of the hand also he take a straight look into jessie aylmore 's eye i do not want thanks he say it be all a lot of luck and if i come -- today -- it will be to see -- just you jessie aylmore look down at the two hand i think she whisper i think that be what i really mean the end end of project gutenberg 's the middle temple murder by j fletcher
