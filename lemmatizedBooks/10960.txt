produce by ted garvin bradley norton and pg distribute proofreader vergil _ a biography _ by tenney frank _ professor of latin in the john hopkin university _ 1922 _ to _ the memory of w warde fowler preface modern literary criticism have accustom we to interpret we masterpiece in the light of the author 's daily experience and the condition of the society in which he live the personality of very few ancient poet however can be realize and this be perhaps the chief reason why they work seem to the average man so cold and remote vergil 's age with its terribly intense struggle lie hide behind the opaque mist of twenty century : by he very theory of art the poet have conscientiously draw a veil between himself and he reader and the scrap of information about he give we by the fourth century grammarian donatus be inconsistent at best unauthenticated and generally irrelevant indeed criticism have deal hard with donatus ' life of vergil it have show that the meager _ vita _ be a conglomeration of a few chance fact set into a mass of later conjecture derive from a literal-minded interpretation of the _ eclogue _ to which there gather during the credulous and neurotic decade of the second and third century a accretion of irresponsible gossip however though we have have to reject many of the statement of donatus criticism have procure for we more than a fair compensation from another source a series of detailed study of the numerous minor poem attribute to vergil by ancient author and mediaeval manuscript -- till recently pronounce unauthentic by modern scholar -- have compel most of we to accept the _ appendix vergiliana _ at face value these poem write in vergil 's formative year before he have adopt the reserved manner of the classical style be full of personal reminiscence they reveal many important fact about he daily life he occupation he ambition and he ideal and best of all they disclose the process by which the poet during a apprenticeship of ten year develop the mature art of the _ georgic _ and the _ aeneid _ they have make it possible for we to visualize he with a vividness that be grant we in the case of no other latin poet the reason for attempt a new biography of vergil at the present time be therefore obvious this essay conceive with the purpose of center attention upon the poet 's actual life have eschew the larger task of literary criticism and have also avoid the subject of vergil 's literary source -- a theme to which scholar have generally devote too much acumen the book be therefore of brief compass but it have be keep to its single theme in the conviction that the reader who will study vergil 's work as in some measure a outgrowth of the poet 's own experience will find a new meaning in not a few of they line tf

fifteenth of October 70 bc that the mantuan still hold in pious memory : in 1930 they will doubtless invite italy and the devout of all nation to celebrate the twentieth centenary of the poet 's birth ancient biographer little concerned with mendelian speculation have not report from what stock he family spring scientific curiosity and nationalistic egotism have compel modern biographer to become anthropologist vergil have accordingly be refer by some critic or other to each of the several people that settle the po valley in ancient time : the umbrian the etruscan the celt the latin the evidence can not be muster into a compelling conclusion but it may be worth while to reject the improbable supposition the name tell little _ vergilius _ be a good italic _ noman _ find in all part of the peninsula -lrb- 1 -rrb- but latin name come as a matter of course with the gift of citizenship or of the latin status and mantua with the rest of cisalpine gaul have receive the latin status nineteen year before vergil 's birth the cognomen _ maro _ be in origin a magistrate 's title use by etruscan and umbrian but _ cognomina _ be a recent fashion in the first century bc and be select by parent of the middle class largely by accident -lrb- footnote 1 : braunholz _ the nationality of vergil _ _ classical review _ 1915 104 ff -rrb- vergil himself a good antiquarian assure we that in the _ heroic _ age mantua be chiefly etruscan with enclave of two other people -lrb- presumably umbrian and venetian -rrb- in this he be doubtless follow a fairly reliable tradition accept all the more willingly because of he intimacy with maecena who be of course etruscan : -lrb- 2 -rrb- mantua dive avis sed non genus omnibus unum gen illis triplex populus sub gente quaterni ipsa caput populis tusco de sanguine vire -lrb- footnote 2 : aeneid x 201-3 -rrb- pliny seem to have suppose this passage a description of mantua in vergil 's own day : mantua tuscorum trans padum solum reliqua -lrb- iii 130 -rrb- that could hardly have be vergil 's meaning however for the celt who flood the po valley four century before drive all before they except in the venetian marsh and the ligurian hill they could not have leave a etruscan stronghold in the center of they path vergil be probably not etruscan the case for a celtic origin be equally improbable from the time when the senone burn rome in 390 bc till caesar conquer gaul the fear of invasion from this dread race never slumber during the weary year of the punic war when hannibal draw he fresh recruit from the po valley the determination grow ever stronger that the alp should become rome 's barrier line on the north accordingly the pacification of the transpadane region continue with little intermission until polybius -lrb- 3 -rrb- could say two generation before vergil 's birth that the gaul have practically be drive out of the po valley and that they then hold but a few village in the foothill of the alp if this be true the open country of mantua must have have but few survivor and the few that remain be not often likely to have the privilege of intermarry with the roman settler who fill the vacuum roman be too proud of they citizenship to intermarry with _ peregrinus _ and raise child who must by roman law forego the dignity of citizenship -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : polybius ii 35 4 -lrb- write about 140 bc -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : ulpian _ dig _ v 8 ex peregrino et cive romano peregrinus nascitur -rrb- a celtic strain of romance have be from time to time claim for vergil 's poetry though those who employ such term seldom agree in they definition of they he romanticism may be more easily explain by he early devotion to the catullan group of poet and the celtic trait -- whatever they may be -- by the close racial affiliation between celt and italian vouch for by anthropologist but the difficulty of apply the test of the celtic temperament lie in the fact that there be apparently now no true representative of the celtic race from whom to establish a criterion the people that have longest preserved dialect of the celtic language appear from anthropometric research to contain a dominant strain of a different race perhaps that of the pre-indo-european inhabitant of western europe it may be therefore that what arnoldian now refer to the celt be after all not celtic at best it be unsafe to search for racial trait in the work of genius in this instance it would but betray loose think the assumption of celtic origin be therefore hazardous -lrb- 5 -rrb- there be however a strong likelihood that vergil 's forbear be among the roman and latin colonist who go north in search of new home during the second century bc vergil 's father be certainly a roman citizen for none but a citizen could have send he son to rome to prepare for a political career mantua indeed a latin town after 89 bc do not become a roman municipality until after vergil have leave it but vergil 's father accord to the eighth _ catalepton _ have earlier in he life live in cremona that city be colonize by roman citizen in 218 bc and recolonize in 190 and though the colonist be reduce to the latin status the magistrate of the town and they descendant secure citizenship from the beginning and finally in 89 bc the whole colony receive full citizenship but quite apart from this all of cisalpine gaul as the region be call be receive immigrant from all part of italy throughout the second century when the field farther south be be exhaust by long tilling and be fall into the hand of capitalistic landlord and grazer since roman citizenship be a personal rather than a territorial right such immigrant could preserve they political status despite they change of habitation the probability be therefore that in any case vergil though bear in the province be of the old latin stock -lrb- footnote 5 : vergil we know be tall and dark the gaul be as a rule fair with light hair the etruscan on the other hand while dark be generally short of stature such datum be however not of great importance -rrb- about the child appropriate story gather in time but what the biographer choose to repeat in the credulous day of donatus when rome be almost a oriental city need not detain we long to donatus no doubt _ magia _ seem a suitable name for the mother of a poet who know the mystery of the lower world that she dream prophetically of the come greatness of she son we may grant as a matter of course sober judgment however can hardly accept the miraculous poplar tree which shoot up at the place of nativity or the birth-story derive vergilus from _ virga _ contrary to early latin nomenclature and phonology it be well to mention these thing merely so that we may keep in mind how little faith the late biographer really deserve donatus be also incline to accept the tradition that vergil 's father be a potter and a man of very humble circumstance that vergil 's father make pottery may be true a father 's occupation be apt to be record in augustan biography -- but it require some knowledge of roman society to comprehend what these word mean at the end of the republic in donatus ' day a potter be a day-laborer in loin-cloth and leather apron earn about twenty cent for a long day of fourteen hour needless to say vergil 's leisured competence during many year do not draw from such a trickle source donatus have forget that in vergil 's day the economic system of rome be entirely different at the end of the republic the potter of northern italy conduct factory of enormous output for they have with they artistic red-figured ware capture the market of the whole mediterranean basin the actual workman be not roman citizen by any means but slave and we should add that while industrial producer like trader be in general hold in low esteem because most of they be foreigner and freedman the producer of earthenware have by accident escape from the general odium the reason be simply that earthenware production begin as a legitimate extension of agriculture -- it be one form of turn the product of the villa-soil to the best use -- and agriculture as we remember -lrb- include horticulture and stock-raising -rrb- continue into cicero 's day the only respectable income-bringing occupation in which a roman senator could engage without apology that be the reason why even the name of cicero asinius pollio and marcus aurelius be to be find on brick stamp when it would have be socially impossible for such man to own shall we say hardware or clothing factory donatus be already so far away from that day that he have no feeling for its social tabus the property of vergil 's father -- possibly a farm with a pottery on some part of it -- could hardly have be small when it support the young student for many year in he leisured existence at rome and naple under the master that attract the aristocracy of the capital the story of probus otherwise not very reliable may therefore be true -- that sixty soldier receive they allotment from the estate take from vergil 's father of no little significance be the fact that vergil first prepared himself for public life -lrb- 6 -rrb- and progress so far as to accept one case in court in order to enter public life in those day it be customary to train one 's self as widely as possible in literature history rhetoric dialectic and court procedure and to attract public notice for election purpose by take a few case it be not every citizen who dare enter such a career this be the one occupation that the nobility guard most jealously while any foreigner or freedman might become a doctor banker architect or merchant prince he could not presume to stand up before a praetor to discuss the rights and wrong of roman citizen and since the advocate 's work be furthermore consider the legitimate preliminary to magisterial office it must the more carefully be protect it would have be quite useless for vergil to prepare for this career have it be obviously close we have no sure record in cicero 's epoch of any young man rise successfully from the business or industrial class to a career in public life except through the abnormal accident provide by the civil war presumably therefore vergil 's father belong to a landholding family with some honor of municipal service to he credit -lrb- footnote 6 : donatus 15 _ ciri _ l2 _ catal _ v seneca _ controv _ iii praef 8 -rrb- of the poet 's physical trait we have no very satisfactory description or likeness he be tall dark and rawboned retain through life the appearance of a countryman accord to donatus he also suffer say the same writer the symptom that accompany tuberculosis the reliability of this rather inadequate description be support by a second-century portrait of the poet do in a crude pavement mosaic which have be find in northern africa -lrb- 7 -rrb- to be sure the technique be so faulty that we can not possibly consider this a faithful likeness but we may at least say that the person represent -- a man of perhaps forty-five -- be tall and loose-jointed and that he countenance with its broad brow penetrate eye firm nose and generous mouth and chin be distinctly represent as draw and emaciate -lrb- footnote 7 : see _ monument piot _ 1897 pl xx _ atene e roma _ 1913 opp p 191 -rrb- there be also a unidentified portrait in a half dozen mediocre replica represent a man of twenty-five or thirty year which some archaeologist be incline to consider a possible representation of vergil -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be the so-called brutus the argument for its attribution deserve serious consideration the bust while it show a far younger man than the african mosaic reveal the same contour of countenance of brow nose cheek and chin furthermore it be difficult to think of any other roman in private life who attain to such fame that six marble replica of he portrait should have survive the omnivorous lime-kiln of the dark age the barrocco museum of rome have a very lifelike replica -lrb- 9 -rrb- of this type in half-relief though its firm dry workmanship seem to be of a few decade later than vergil 's youth it may well be a fairly faithful copy of one of the first bust of vergil make at the time when the _ eclogue _ have spread he fame through rome -lrb- footnote 8 : see british school _ cat of the mu capitolino _ p 355

be question -rrb- a land of sound constitution mentally and physically be the frontier region in which vergil grow to manhood and have it not later be drain of its sturdy citizenry by the civil war and recolonize by the wreckage of those war it would have become italy 's mainstay through the empire the earlier roman and latin who have first accept colonial allotment or have migrate severally there for over a century be of sterner stuff than the indolent remnant that have drift to the city 's corn crib these frontiersman have come while the italic stock be still sound not yet contaminate by the freedman of eastern extraction city like cremona and mantua be truer guardian of the puritanic ideal of cato 's day than rome itself the clear expressive diction of catullus ' lyric full of old-fashioned turn the sound social ideal of vergil 's _ georgic _ the buoyant idealism of the _ aeneid _ and of livy 's annals speak the true language of these people it be not surprising then that in vergil 's youth it be a group of fellow-provincial -- return son of rome 's former emigrant -- that take the lead in the new literary movement they be vigorous clever young man excellently educate free from the city 's binding traditionalism well provide also many of they with worldly goods acquire in the new rich country such be catullus of verona varius rufus quintilius varus furius and alfenus of cremona caecilius of comum helvius cinna apparently of brescium and valerius cato who somehow manage to inspire in so many of they a love for poetry ii school and war to cremona vergil be send to school caesar the governor of the province be now conquer gaul and as cremona be the foremost provincial colony from which caesar could recruit legionary the school boy must have see many a maniple march off to the battle-field of belgium those boy read they _ bellum gallicum _ in the first edition serial publication when we remember the devotion of caesar 's soldier to they leader we can hardly be surprise at the poet 's lasting reverence for the great _ imperator _ he must have see the man himself also for cremona be the principal point in the court circuit that caesar travel during the winter between he campaign -- whenever the gaul give he respite the _ toga virili _ vergil assume at fifteen the year that pompey and crassus enter upon they second consulship -- a notice to all the world that the triumvirate have be continue upon term that make julius the arbiter of rome 's destiny that same year the boy leave cremona to finish he literary study in milan a city which be now threaten to outstrip cremona in importance and size the continuation of he study in the province instead of at rome seem to have be fortunate : the spirit of the school of the north be healthier at rome the undue insistence upon a practical education despite cicero 's protest be hurry boy into classroom of rhetorician who be suppose to turn they into finish public man at a early age it be assume that a political career be every gentleman 's business and that every young man of any pretension must acquire the art of speak effectively and of think on he foot the claim of pure literature of philosophy and of history be accord too little attention and the chief drill center about the technique of declamatory prose not that the rhetorical study be itself make absolutely practical the teacher unfortunately would spin the technical detail thin and long to hold profitable student over several year but they claim that they attain practical end impose on the parent and the system of education suffer in the northern province on the other hand there be less demand for study lead directly to the forum moreover some of the best teacher be active there -lrb- 1 -rrb- they be man of catholic taste who in they lecture on literature range widely over the century of greek master from homer to the latest popular poet of the hellenistic period and over the latin poet from livius to lucilius indeed the young man train at cremona and milan between the day of sullum and caesar be those who in due time pass on the torch of literary art at rome while the roman youth be be entice away into rhetoric vergil 's remarkable catholicity of taste and he aversion to the cramping technique of the rhetorical course be probably to be explain in large measure therefore by he contact with the teacher of the province vergil do not scorn apollonius because homer be revere as the supreme master and though the easy charm of catullus teach he early to love the new poetry he appreciate none the less the rugged force of ennius have he early training be receive at rome where pedant be pit against pedant where every teacher be force by rivalry into a partizan attitude and all be compel by material demand to provide a practical education even vergil 's poetic spirit might have be dull -lrb- footnote 1 : suetonius _ de gram _ 3 -rrb- how long vergil remain at milan we be not tell donatus ' _ paulo post _ be a relative term that might mean a few month or a few year however at the age of sixteen vergil be doubtless ready for the rhetorical course and it be possible that he go to the great city as early as 54 bc the very year of catullus ' death and of the publication of lucretius ' _ de rerum natura _ the brief biography of vergil contain in the berne m -- a document of doubtful value -- mention epidius as vergil 's teacher in rhetoric and add that octavius the future emperor be a fellow pupil this be by no means unreasonable despite a difference of seven year in the age of the two pupil vergil come from the province enter rhetoric rather late in year whereas octavius must have require the aid of a master of declamation early since at the age of twelve he prepare to deliver the _ laudatio funebri _ at the grave of he grandmother thus the two may have meet in epidius ' lecture room in the year 50 bc vergil could doubtless have afford tuition under such a master since he presently engage the no less distinguished siro we have the independent testimony of suetonius that epidius be octavius ' and mark antony 's teacher if antony 's style be a criterion this new master of vergil 's be a rhetorician of the elaborate asianistic style -lrb- 2 -rrb- then still orthodox at rome this school -- except in so far as cicero have criticize it for go to extreme -- have not yet be effectively challenge by the rise generation of the chaster atticist hortensius be still alive and highly revered and cicero have recently write he elaborate _ de oratore _ in which with the apparent calmness of a still unquestioned authority he lay down the program of the writer of ornate prose who conceive it as he chief duty to heed the claim of art while not a out and out asianist he advocate the claim of the grand-style so please to senatorial audience with its well-balanced period carefully modulate nobly phrase precisely cadenced and pronounced with dignity to be sure calvus have already raise the banner of atticism and have in several bite attack show what a simple frugal and direct style could accomplish calidius one of the first roman pupil of the great apollodorus have already begin make campaign speech in he neatly polish oration which painfully eschew all show of ornament or passion and caesar himself efficiency personify have demonstrate that the leader of a democratic rabble must be a master of blunt phrase but calvus do not threaten to become a political force calidius be too even-tempered and caesar be now in the north fighting with other weapon cicero 's prestige still seem unbroken it be not till caesar cross the rubicon in 49 after hortensius have die and cicero have be push aside as a futile statesman that atticism gain predominance in the school later in 46 cicero in several remarkable essay again take up the cudgel for a elaborate prose but then he cause be already lose caesar 's victory have demonstrate that rome desire deed not word -lrb- footnote 2 : octavius be draw to the atticistic principle by the great master apollodorus -rrb- when virgil therefore turn to rhetoric probably under epidius he receive the training which be still consider orthodox he farewell -lrb- 3 -rrb- to rhetoric -- write probably in 48 -- show unmistakably the nature of the stuff on which he have be feed it be the bombast and the futile rule of the asianic creed against which he fling he unsparing scazon -lrb- footnote 3 : _ catalepton _ v -lrb- edition vollmer -rrb- birt _ jugendverse und heimatpoesie vergil _ 1910 have provide a useful commentary on the _ catalepton _ -rrb- begone ye useless paint-pot of the school you phrase reek but not with attic scent tarquitius ' and selius ' and varro 's drool : a witless crew with learn temulent and ye begone ye tinkle cymbal vain that call the youth to driveling insane epidius to be sure be not mention but we happen to know that varro -- if this be the erudite friend of cicero -- be devote to the asianic principle and epidius the teacher of the flowery mark antony may well be conceal in vergil 's list of name even if mention of he be omit for reason of propriety this poem reveal the fact that vergil do not like the young man of cicero 's youth enjoy the privilege of study law court procedure and oratory by enter the law office as it be of some distinguished senator and thus acquire he craft through observation guide practice and personal instruction that method so charmingly describe by cicero as in vogue in he youth have almost pass away the school have take its place with its mock court contest in oratory set theme in fictitious controversy the analytical rule of rhetoric be grow ever more intricate and time-wasting and how pedantic they be even before vergil 's childhood may be see by a glance into the anonymous _ auctor ad herennium _ the student have to know the difference between the various kind of case demonstrativum deliberativum and judiciale he must know the proportionate value to the orator of inventio dispositio elocutio memorium and pronuntiatio and how to manage each he must know how to apply inventio in each of the six division of the speech : exordium narratio divisio confirmatio confutatio conclusio on the subject of adornment of style a relatively small task lay in memorize illustration of some sixty figure of speech -- and so on ad infinitum _ inane cymbalon juventuti _ be indeed a fitting commentary on such memory task the end of the poem cite betray the fact that the poet have not be able to keep he attention upon he task he have be write verse who would not quite apart however from the unattractive content of the course the gradual change in political life must have disclose to the observant that the free exercise of talent in a public career could not continue long the triumvirate be rapidly suppress the free republic even in 52 when pompey become sole consul the trial of milo be conduct under military guard and no advocate dare speak freely during the next two year every one see that caesar and pompey must come to blow and that the result war could only lead to autocracy the crisis come in January of 49 bc when vergil be twenty year old pompey with the consul and most of the senator flee southward in dismay and in sixty day hotly pursue by caesar be force to evacuate italy caesar eager to make short work of the war to attack spain and africa while hold the alpine pass and press in pursuit of pompey begin to levy new recruit throughout italy -lrb- 4 -rrb- vergil also seem to have be draw in this draft since this be apparently the circumstance mention in he thirteenth _ catalepton _ draft however may not be the right word for we do not know whether caesar at this time claim the right to enforce the rule of conscription in any case it be clear from all of vergil 's reference to caesar that the great general always retain a strong hold upon he imagination like most youth who have behold caesar 's work in the province close at hand he be probably ready to respond to a general appeal for troops and labienus ' word to pompey on the battlefield of pharsalium make it clear that caesar 's army be largely compose of cisalpine the accounting they give of themselves at that battle be evidence enough of the spirit which pervade vergil 's fellow provincial nor be it unlikely that vergil himself take part for one of the most poignant passage in all he work be the picture of the dead who lay strew over the battlefield of pharsalium -lrb- footnote 4 : cic _ ad att _ ix 19 in march -rrb- it be also probable that vergil have have some share in the cruise on the adriatic conduct by antony the summer and winter before pharsalium not only do this poem speak of service on the sea but he poem throughout reveal a remarkable acquaintance with adriatic geography if he take part in the work of that stormy winter 's campaign when more than one fleet be wreck we can comprehend the intimate touch in the description of aenea ' encounter with the storm the thirteenth _ catalepton _ which mention the poet 's military service be not pleasant reading write perhaps in 48 or 47 bc direct against some hate martinet of a officer it bear various disagreeable trace of camp life which be then not well-guarded by charitable organization of every kind as now we need quote only the first few line : -lrb- 5 -rrb- you call I caitiff say i can not sail the sea again and that i seem to quail before the storm and summer 's heat nor dare the speeding victor 's arm again to bear we know how frail vergil 's health be in later year he constitution may well have be wreck during the winter of 49 which caesar himself inure though he be to the storm of the north find unusually severe vergil it would seem from these line be give sick-leave and permit to go back to he study though apparently taunt for not later return to the army -lrb- footnote 5 : jacere I quod alta non possim puta ut ante vectarus freta nec ferre durum frigus aut aestum patus neque arma victoris sequi the verse be write before 46 bc when the _ collegium compitalicium _ be disband birt _ rhein mu _ 1910 348 -rrb- there be another brief epigram which -- if we be right in think pompey the subject of the line -- seem to date from vergil 's soldier day the third _ catalepton _ : aspice quem valido subnixum glorium regno altius et caeli sedibus extulerat terrarum hic bello magnum concusserat orbem hic rege asiae fregerat hic populo hic grave servitium tibus iam tibus roma ferebat

have he break grievous slavery be he bring even to thee o rome -- for all else have fall before that man 's sword -- when suddenly in the midst of he struggle for mastery headlong he fall drive from fatherland into exile such be the will of nemesis at a mere nod in a moment of time the faithless hour trick mortal endeavor -rrb- whether or not pompey aspire to become autocrat at rome many of he supporter not only believe but desire that he should cicero who do not desire it do despite he devotion to he friend fear that pompey would if victorious establish practically or virtually a monarchy -lrb- 7 -rrb- vergil therefore if he write this when pompey flee to greece in 49 or after the rout at pharsalium be only give expression to a conviction generally hold among caesar 's officer quite vergilian be the repression of the shout of victory the poem recall the word of anchise on behold the spirit of julius and pompey : tuque prior tu parce genus qui ducis olympo proice tela manu sanguis meus -lrb- footnote 7 : cic _ ad att _ viii 11 4 x 4 8 -rrb- this be the poet 's final conviction regard the civil war in which he serve he first have not differ widely from this vergil 's one experience as advocate in the court room should perhaps be place after he retirement from the army egit say donatus et causam apud judices unam omnino nec amplius quam semel the reason for he lack of success donatus give in the word of melissus a critic who ought to know : in sermone tardissimum ac paene indocto similem the poet himself seem to allude to he disappointing failure in the _ ciri _ : expertum fallacis premia volgi how could he but fail he never learn to cram he conviction into mere phrase and he judgment into all-inclusive syllogism when he have do he best with human behavior and the sentence be pronounced he spoil the whole with a rebellious di aliter visum a successful advocate must know what not to see and feel and he must have ready conviction at he tongue 's end in the _ aeneid _ there be several fluent orator but they be never vergil 's congenial character iii the culex it be apparently in the year 48 -- vergil be then twenty-one -- that the poet attempt he first extended composition the _ culex _ a poem that hardly deserve the honor of a versified translation at the hand of spenser this be indeed one of the strangest poem of latin literature a overwhelming burden of mythological and literary reference saddle on the feeblest of fable a shepherd go out one morning with he flock to the woodland glade whose charm the poet describe at length in a rather imitative rhapsody the shepherd then fall asleep a serpent approach and be about to strike he when a gnat see the danger sting he in time to save he but -- such be the fatalism of cynical fable-lore -- the shepherd still in a stupor crush the gnat that have save he life at night the gnat 's ghost return to rebuke the shepherd for he innocent ingratitude and rather inappropriately remain to rehearse at great length the tale of what shades of old hero he have see in the lower region the poem contain 414 line the _ culex _ have be one of the standing puzzle of literary criticism and would be interesting if only to illustrate the inadequacy of stylistic criterion though it be accept as vergilian by renaissance reader simply because the manuscript of the poem and ancient writer from lucan and statius to martial and suetonius all attribute the work to he recent critic have usually be skeptical or downright recusant some insist that it be a forgery or supposititious work other that it be a liberally pad re-working of vergil 's original only a few have accept it as a very youthful failure of vergil 's or as a attempt of the poet to parody the then popular romance recent objection have not center about metrical technique diction or detail of style : these be now admit to be vergilian enough or rather what might well have be vergilian at the outset of he career the chief criticism be direct against a want of proportion and a apparent lack of artistic sense betray in choose so strange a character for the ponderous title-role these be fault that vergil later do not betray nevertheless vergil seem to have write the poem its ascription to vergil by so many author of the early empire as well as the concensus of the manuscript must be take very seriously but the internal evidence be even stronger octavius to whom the poem be dedicate be address _ octavus venerande _ and _ sancte puer _ a clear reference to the remarkable honor that caesar secure for he by election to the office of pontiff -lrb- 1 -rrb- when he be approach he fifteenth birthday and before he assume the _ toga virili _ vergil be then twenty-one year of age -- near he twenty-second

obscurity and awkwardness of expression and the imitative phraseology betray a young unformed style to analyze the art however would be to take the poem more seriously than vergil intend it to be when he write currente calamo yet we may say that on the whole the modulation of the verse the treatment of the caesural pause -lrb- 7 -rrb- and the phrasing compare rather favorably with the catullan

406-9 -rrb- the _ ciri _ with all its flaw be one of we best example of the romantic verse tale make popular by the alexandrian poet of callimachus ' school the old legend have of course be tell in epic or dramatic form but change society now care less for the stir action and bloodshed that have entertain the early greek the time be ripe for a retelling from a different point of view with a more patient analysis of the emotion of the inner impulse of the moment before the blow the battle of passion that precede the final act we notice also in these new poem a preponderance of feminine character these the masculine democracy of classical athen have tend to disregard but in the capital of the new hellenistic monarchy many influential and brilliant woman rise to position of power in the society of the court a poet would have be dull not to respond to this influence this new note be of course one that would immediately appeal to the roman for the ancient aristocracy which have always accord woman a high place in society and the home have never die out at rome indeed such early dramatist as ennius and accius have already feel the need of develop the interest of feminine role when they paraphrase classical greek play for they audience thus both at alexandrium and at rome the new poet naturally choose the more romantic myth of the old regal period as fit for they retelling but the search for a different interpretation and a deeper content induce a new method of narration indeed the story themselves be too well know to need a full rehearsal of the plot action might frequently be assume as know and relegate to a significant line or two here and there the scenic set the individual trait of the hero and heroine they mental struggle they silent doubt and hesitation become the chief concern of the new poet horace call this the purple-patch method of write the narrative device however vary somewhat some poet discard all idea of form they roam through the wood by any path that might appear this be the way that tibullus like to treat a theme whatever semi-apposite topic happen to suggest itself provide only it contain please fancy invite he to tarry a while he may or may not bring you back to the start point other poet still adhere to form though the pattern must be elaborate enough to hide its scheme from the casual reader and sufficiently elastic to provide space for sentiment and pathos in he sixty-eighth poem catullus employ what might be call a geometrical pattern in fact a pyramid of unequal step he mount to the central theme by a series of verse and descend on the other side by a corresponding series in the sixty-fourth poem however the _ epyllion _ which the author of the _ ciri _ clearly have in mind catullus use a intricate but by no means balanced form the poem open with the sea voyage of peleus on which he meet the sea-nymph theti then the poet leap over the interval to the marriage feast only to dwell upon the sorrow of ariadne depict on the coverlet of the marriage couch thence he take we back to the cause of ariadne 's woe thence forward to the vengeance upon ariadne 's faithless lover then back to the second scene embroider on the tapestry and now finally to the wedding itself which end with the fate ' wedding song celebrate the future glory of peleus ' promised son the _ ciri _ to be sure be not quite so intricate but here again we have only allusion to the essential part of the story : how scyllum offend juno how she meet mino how she cut the lock and how the city be take we be not even tell why mino fail to keep he pledge to the maiden in the midst of the tale carme suspend the action by a long reference to mino ' earlier passion for she own daughter britomarti which cause the girl 's destruction but the lament in which this story be disclose merely allude to but do not tell the detail of the story the whole plot of the _ ciri _ be in fact unravel by means of a series of allusion and suggestion exclamation and soliloquy parenthesis and aposiopese interrogation and apostrophe in verse-technique -lrb- 2 -rrb- the _ ciri _ be as near catullus ' _ peleus _ and _ theti _ as it be the _ aeneid _ : indeed it be as reminiscent of the former as it be prophetic of the latter the spondaic end which make the line linger usually over some word of emotional content -lrb- l 158 -rrb- : at levi ille deus cui semper ad ulciscendum be to cicero the earmark of this style the _ ciri _ have it less often than catullus be somewhat unjustly criticize as a artifice it be usually avoid in the _ aeneid _ there be more harsh elision in the _ ciri _ than in the poet 's later work remind one again of catullan technique in he use of caesuras vergil in the _ ciri _ resemble catullus : both to a certain extent distrust the trochaic pause its yielding quality however bring it back into more favor in various emotional passage of the _ aeneid _ but there it be carefully modify by the introduction of masculine stop before and after a nuance which be hardly seek after in the _ ciri _ or in catullus finally the sentence structure have not yet attain the malleability of a later day while the _ ciri _ like the _ peleus and theti _ be over-free with involved and parenthetical sentence it have on the whole fewer run-over line so that indeed the frequent coincidence of sense pause and verse ending almost border on monotony -lrb- footnote 2 : see especially skutsch _ aus vergil frühzeit _ p 74 drachmann _ herme _ 1908 p 412 ff lg eldridge _ num culex et ciris _ etc giessen 1914

cornificius who employ the same method it be from this group not from homer or ennius that vergil learn he verse-technique the exquisite finish of the _ aeneid _ be the product of this technique meticulously rework to the demand of a exacting poetic taste the _ ciri _ give vergil he first lesson in serious poetic composition and no task could have be set of more immediate value for the training of rome 's epic poet in a national epic classical objectivity could not suffice for a people that have grow so self-conscious epic poetry must become more subjective at rome or perish to be sure the vice of the episodic style must be prune away and they be mercilessly the _ aeneid _ have none of the meretricious involution of plot none of the puzzling half-uttered allusion to essential fact none of the tease interruption of the neoteric story book the poet also learn to avoid the danger of stress trivial and impertinent pathos and he reject the elegancy of style that threaten to lead to preciosity what he keep however be of permanent value the new poetry which have emerge from a society that be deeply interested in science have teach vergil to observe the detail of nature with accuracy and a appreciation of they beauty it have also teach he that in a age of sophistication the poet should not hide he personality wholly behind the veil there be a please self-consciousness in the poet 's reflection -- never too obtrusive -- that remind one of catullus it imply that poetry be recognize in its great role of a criticism of life but most of all there be reveal in the _ ciri _ a epic poet 's first timid probe into the depths of human emotion a strive to understand the riddle behind the impulsive body one see why dido be not like apollonius ' medea simply drive to passion by cupid 's arrow -- the naive greek equivalent of the medieval love-philter -- why palla ' body be not merely lay on the funeral pyre with the traditional wail why turnus do not meet he foe with a homeric boast that vergil have penetrate a richer vein of sentiment that he have learn to regard passion as something more than a accident to sacrifice mere logic of form for fragment of vital emotion and flash of new scenery and finally that he enrich the latin vocabulary with fecund word be in no small measure the effect of he early intensive work on the _ ciri _ under the tutelage of catullus vergil apparently never publish the _ ciri _ for he re-use its line indeed whole block of its line with a freedom that can not be parallel the much discuss line of the fourth _ eclogue _ : cara deum subole magnum jovi incrementum be from the _ ciri _ -lrb- i 398 -rrb- so be the familiar verse of _ eclogue _ viii -lrb- i 41 -rrb- : ut vidi ut perius ut I malus abstulit error and _ aeneid _ ii 405 : ad caelum tenden ardentia lumina frustra and the strange spondaic unelided line -lrb- _ aen _ iii 74 -rrb- : nereidum matrus et neptuno aegaeo and a score of other the only reasonable explanation -lrb- 3 -rrb- of this strange fact be that the _ ciri _ have not be circulate that its line be still at the poet 's disposal and that he do not suppose the original would ever be publish the fact that the process of re-using begin even in the _ eclogue _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- show that he have decide to reject the poem as early as 41 bc a reasonable explanation be near at hand messallum to whom the poem be dedicate join he lot with that of mark antony and egypt after the battle of philippus and for antony vergil have no love the poem lay neglect till he lose interest in a style of work that be pass out of fashion find a more congenial form in the pastoral he sacrifice the _ ciri _ -lrb- footnote 3 : drachmann _ herme _ 1908 p 405 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : especially in 8 10 and 4 this method of re-working old line reveal a extraordinary gift of memory in the poet who so vividly retain in mind every line he have write that each might readily fall into the pattern of he new composition without leave a trace of the join critic who have try the task have be compel to confess that the criterion of contextual appropriateness can not alone determine whether or not these line first occur in the _ ciri _ -rrb- v a student of philosophy at naple the _ culex _ seem to have be complete in September 48 bc and the main part of the _ ciri _ be write not much later now come a crisis in vergil 's affair perhaps he own experience in the law court or the conviction that public life could contain no interest under a autocracy or disgust at rhetorical futility or perhaps a copy of lucretius bring he to a stop lucretius he certainly have be read of that the _ ciri _ provide unmistakable evidence and the spell of that poet he never escape he farewell to rome and rhetoric have be quote in part above the end of the poem bid -- though more reluctantly -- farewell to the muse also : ite hinc camenae vos quoque ite jam sane dulce camenae -lrb- nam fatebimur verum dulce fuisti -rrb- : et tamen meas chartas revisitote sed pudenter et raro it be to siro that he now go the epicurean philosopher who closely associate with the voluminous philodemus be conduct a very popular garden-school at naple outrank in fact the original school at athen it be not unlikely that this be where lucretius himself have study it be well to bear in mind that the ensue year of philosophical study be spend at naple -- a greek city then -- and very largely among greek this fact provide a key to much of vergil we biography have somehow assume rome as the center of siro 's activity though the evidence in favor of naple be unmistakable not only do vergil speak of a journey -lrb- catal v 8 -rrb- : no ad beato velum mittimus portus magnus petente docta dictum sironi and servius say _ neapoli studuit _ and the _ ciri _ mention _ cecropus horrulus _ and cicero in all he reference place siro on the bay of naple -lrb- 1 -rrb- but a fragment of a herculanean roll of

vergil have fail to appreciate the influence which must have reach the young poet in these year of he life in a greek city in daily communion with oriental philosopher like philodemus and siro after the death of phaedrus these man be doubtless the leader of they sect at least asconius call the former _ illum aetate nobilissimus _ -lrb- _ in pis _ 68 -rrb- cicero represent they as _ homine doctissimo _ as early as 60 bc and though in he tirade against piso -- ten year before vergil 's adhesion to the school -- he must need cast some slur at piso 's teacher he be careful to compliment both he learning and he poetry indeed there seem to be not a little direct use of philodemus ' work in cicero 's _ de finibus _ and the _ de natura deorum _ write many year later in any case at least catullus horace and ovid make free to paraphrase some of he epigram and these verse may well guard we against assume that the man who could draw to he lecture and companionship some of the brightest spirit of the day be adequately represent by the crabbed controversial essay that he library have produce these essay follow a standard type and do not necessarily reveal the actual man even these however disclose a man not wholly confine to the _ ipsa verba _ of epicurus for they show more interest in rhetorical precept than be display by the founder of the school they be more sympathetic toward the average man 's religion and not a little concerned about the affair of state all this indicate a healthy reaction that more than one philosopher undergo in come in contact with roman man of the world but it also doubtless reflect the tendency of the syrian branch of the school from which he spring for the syrian group have have to cast off some of its traditional fanaticism and acquire a few social grace and a modicum of worldly wisdom in its long contact with the magnificent seleucid court philodemus be himself a native of gadara that unfortunate macedonian colony just east of the sea of galilee which be subject to jewish rule in the early youth of we philosopher he study with zeno of sidon to whom cicero also listen in 78 a masterful teacher whose follower and pupil demetrius

1920 p 113 -rrb- the list of influential roman who join the sect during this period be remarkable though of course we have in we incidental reference but a small part of the whole number here belong caesar he father-in-law piso who be philodemus ' patron manlius torquatus the consular hirtius pansa and dolabellum cassius the liberator trebatius the jurist atticus cicero 's life-long friend cicero 's amusing correspondent paetus and callus and many other to some of these the attraction lay perhaps in the philosophy of ease which excuse they from dangerous political labor for the enjoyment of they villa on the bay of naple but to most roman the greatest attraction of the doctrine lay in its presentation of a tangible explanation of the universe weary as they be of a childish faith and too practical-minded to have patience with metaphysical theory now long question and incomprehensible except through a tedious application of dubious logic vergil 's companion in the _ cecropius hortulus _ destine to be he life-long friend be accord to probus quintilius varus the famous critic varius rufus the writer of epic and tragedy and plotius tucca of he early friendship with varius he have

-rrb- and the constant companionship of these four man make the restoration very probable -rrb- of the general question of philodemus ' influence upon varius and vergil varus and horace the critic and poet who shape the ideal of the augustan literature it be not yet time to speak it will be difficult ever to decide how far these man draw they material from the memory of they lecture-room whether for instance varius ' _ de morte _ depend upon he teacher 's -lrb- greek : perus thanatou -rrb- as have be suggest or to what extent horace use the -lrb- greek : perus orgae -rrb- and the -lrb- greek : perus kakion -rrb- when he write he first two epistle or the -lrb- greek : peirus kolakeia -rrb- when he instruct he young friend lollius how to conduct himself at court or whether it be this teacher who first call attention to bion neoptolemus and menippus nor do it matter greatly since the value of these work lay rather in the art of expression and timeliness of they doctrine than in originality of view in the theory of poetic art there be in many respects a marked difference between the classical ideal of the roman group and the rather luxurious verse of philodemus but he too recognize the value of restraint and simplicity as some of he epigram show furthermore he theory of literary art be frequently in accord with horace 's ar poetica on the very point of chaste diction and precise expression which this augustan group emphasize it would not surprise he contemporary if horace restate maxim of philodemus when write a essay to the son and grandson of philodemus ' patron however after all be say vergil have question some of the alexandrian ideal of art before he come under the influence of philodemus and the seventh catalepton give a hint that varius think as vergil it be not unlikely that quintilius varus vergil 's elder friend and fellow-transpadane who have grow up a intimate friend of catullus and calvus have in these matter a stronger influence than philodemus there be however certain turn of sentiment in vergil which betray a non-roman flavor to one who come to vergil directly from a reading of lucretius catullus or cicero 's letter this be especially true of the oriental proskynesis find in the very first _ eclogue _ and develop into complete emperor worship in the dedication of the _ georgic _ this language here for the first time use by a roman poet be not to be explain as simple gratitude for great favor it be not even satisfactorily account for by suppose that the young poet be somewhat slavishly follow some hellenistic model catullus have paraphrase the alexandrian poet but he could hardly have insert a passage of this import nor be it mere flattery for vergil have show in he frank praise of cato brutus and pompey that he do not merely write at command no these passage in vergil show the effect of the long year of association with greek and oriental that have steep he mind in expression and sentiment which now seem natural to he though they must have surprise many a reader at rome he teacher at naple have grow up in syrium and have furthermore carry with they the tradition of the syrian branch of the school that have learn to adapt its language to suit the whim of the deify seleucid monarch as epicurean they also employ sacred name with little reverence be not antiochus epiphane himself a god while as a member of the sect he belittle divinity naple too be a greek city always fill with oriental trading folk and these carry with they the language of subject race it be at pompeius that the earliest inscription on italian soil have be find which recognize the imperial cult and it be at cuma that the best instance of a cult calendar have come to light it be a note one of the very few in the great poet 's work that grate upon we but when he write as he do he be probably not aware that he year of residence in the garden have indeed accustom he ear to some un-roman sound -lrb- 6 -rrb- octavian be of course not unaware of the advantage that accrue to the ruler through the oriental theory of absolutism and furtively accept all such expression by the time vergil write the aeneid the roman world have acquiesce but then to we surprise vergil cease to accord divine attribute to augustus -lrb- footnote 6 : julius caesar begin as early as 45 bc to invite extraordinary honor for political purpose but roman literature seem not to have take any cognizance of they at that time -rrb- again i would suggest that it be at naple that vergil may most readily have come upon the messianic idea that occur in the fourth _ eclogue _ for despite all the objection that have be raise against use that word conception be find there which be not yet naturalized in the occident the child in question be think of as a soter whose _ deed _ the poet hope to sing -lrb- l 54 -rrb- and furthermore line 7 and 50 contain unmistakably the oriental idea of _ naturam parturire _ as suetonius phrase it -lrb- _ aug _ 94 -rrb- quite apart from the likelihood that the gadarene may have gossip at table about the messianic hope of the hebrew which of course he know it be not conceivable that he never betray any knowledge of or interest in the prophetic idea with which he native country teem meleager also a gadarene preserved memory of the people of he birthplace in he poem and caecilius of caleacte who seem to have be in italy at about this time be not beyond quote mose in he rhetorical work -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : it be generally assume that he book be the source for the quotation in _ pseudo-longinus _ -rrb- furthermore naple be the natural resort of all those greek and oriental rhetorician and philosopher historian poet actor and artist who drift romeward from the crumble court of alexandrium antioch and pergamum there they could find congenial surroundings while discover wealthy patron in the numerous villa of the idle rich near by and thither they withdraw at vacation time if necessity call they to rome for more arduous task andronicus the syrian epicurean bring to rome by sullum make he home at nearby cuma archia cicero 's client also from syrium spend much time at naple and the poet agathocle live there parthenius of nicaea to whom the early augustan be deeply indebted teach vergil at naple other oriental like alexander who write the history of syrium and the jew and timagene historian of the diadochus do not happen to be report from naple but we may safely assume that most of they spend whatever leisure time they could there puteoli too be still the seaport town of rome as of all central italy and the syrian be then the carrier of the mediterranean trade -lrb- 8 -rrb- that be one reason why apollo 's oracle at cuma and hecate 's necromatic cave at lake avernus still prosper when vergil explore that region as the detail of the sixth book show he must have do he have occasion to learn more than mere geographic detail -lrb- footnote 8 : frank _ a economic history of rome _ chap xiv -rrb- that vergil have isaiah chapter ii before he eye when he write the fourth _ eclogue _ be of course out of the question there be not a single close parallel of the kind that vergil usually permit himself to borrow from he source we can not even be sure that he have see any of the sibylline oracle now find in the third book of the collection which contain so strange a syncretism of mithraic greek and jewish conception but we can no longer doubt that he be in a general way well inform and quite thoroughly permeate with such mystical and apocalyptic sentiment as every gadarene and any greek from the orient might well know it speak well for he love of rome that despite these influence it be he who produce the most thoroughly nationalistic epic ever write the first fruit of vergil 's study in evolutionary science at naple be the _ aetna _ if indeed the poem be he the problem of the authorship have be patiently study and the argument for authenticity concisely summarize by vessereau -lrb- 9 -rrb- make a strong case the evidence be briefly this servius attribute the poem to vergil in he preface and again in he commentary on _ aeneid _ iii 578 donatus also seem to have do so though some of we manuscript of he _ vita _ contain the phrase _ de qua ambigitur _ again the text of the _ aetna _ which we have agree also in this ascription internal evidence prove the poem to be a work of the period between 54 and 44 which admirably suit vergilian claim its close dependence upon lucretius give the first date its mention of the medea of the artist timomachus as be overseas a work which be bring to rome between 46 and 44 give the second finally the _ aetna _ be by a student of epicurean philosophy largely influence by lucretius it would be difficult to make a stronger case short of a contemporaneous attribution have not vergil himself refer to the _ aetna _ in the preface of he _ ciri _ where he thanks the muse for they aid in a abstruse poem -lrb- l 93 -rrb- quare quae _ cantus _ meditanti mittere _ caecos _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- magna mihi cupido tribuistis premia divae what other poem could he have have in mind the designation do not fit the _ culex _ which be the only poem besides the _ aetna _ that could be in question it be best therefore to take the _ aetna _ -lrb- 11 -rrb- into account in study vergil 's life even though we reserve a place in we memory for that stray phrase _ de qua ambigitur _ -lrb- footnote 9 : vessereau _ aetna _ xx ff rand _ harvard study _ xxx 106 155 ff it be difficult to avoid the conclusion that seneca attribute the _ aetna _ to vergil in _ ad lucilium _ 79 5 : the word vergil 's complete treatment can hardly refer to the seven meager line find in the third book of the _ aeneid _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : lucretius be very fond of use the word _ caecus _ with reference to abstruse and obscure philosophical and scientific subject -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : when vergil write the _ georgic _ on a subject which the poet of the _ aetna _ deride as trivial -lrb- 264-74 -rrb- he seem to apologize for abandon science in favor of a meaner theme _ georgic _ ii 483 ff be not this a reference to the _ aetna _ -rrb- the poet after a invocation to apollo justify himself for reject the favorite theme of myth and fiction : the mystery of nature be more worthy of occupy the effort of the mind he have choose one out of very many that need explanation the true cause of volcanic eruption he say be that air be drive into the pore of the earth and when this come into contact with lava and flint which contain atom of fire it create the explosion that cause such destruction after a second invitation to the reader to appreciate the worth of such a theme he tell the story of two brother of catanium who when other refugee from aetna 's explosion rescue they worldly goods risk they life to save they parent the poem be not a happy experiment there be no lack of enthusiasm for the subject despite the fact that the science of that day be wholly inadequate to the theme but vergil could hardly realize this since both stoic and epicurean have adopt the theory of the explode wind the real trouble with the theme be its hopelessly prosaic ugliness lucretius by he imaginative power have apparently deceive he into think that any fragment of science might be treat poetically in he master the flare atom stream have attain the sublimity of a platonic vision and the very majestic sadness of he materialism carry the young poet off he foot but the mechanism of aetna remain merely a puzzle with little to inspire awe and the theme contain inherently no deep meaning for humanity -- which after all the scientific problem must possess to lend itself to poetic treatment the poet indeed realize all this before he have finish he seek with inadequate resource to stir a emotion of awe in describe the eruption to argue the reader into he own enthusiasm for a scientific subject to prove the humanistic worth of he problem by assert its anti-religious value and finally in a turneresque obtrusion of human being to tell the story of the catanian brother but though the attempt do honor to he aesthetic judgment the theme be incorrigible perhaps the recent eruption of aetna -- they be report for the year 50 and 46 bc -- have give the theme a greater interest than it deserve we may imagine how refugee from catanium have flock to naple and tell the tale of they suffering there be another element in the poem that be as significant as it be prosaic a spirit of carping at poetic custom which remind the reader of philodemus ' lecture philodemus whether speaking of philosophy or music or poetry always begin in the negative he be not happy until he have soundly trounce he predecessor and opponent the author of the _ aetna _ have learn all too well this scholastic method and he acerbity usually turn the reader away before he have reach the central theme there be of course just a little of this tone leave in the _ georgic _ -- lucretius also have a touch of it -- but the _ aeneid _ have free itself completely the compensation to the reader lie not so much in episodical myth description and the story at the end apologetically insert on lucretius ' theory of sweeten medicine as rather in the poet 's contagious enthusiasm for he science the thrill of discovery and the sense of wonder -lrb- 1 251 -rrb- : divina est animi ac jucunda volupta man have waste hour enough on triviality -lrb- 258 -rrb- : torquemur miserus in parvi terimurque labore a worthier occupation be science -lrb- 274 -rrb- : implendus sibus quisque bonis est artibus : illae sunt animi fruges haec rerum est optima merce and science must be worthy of man 's divine majesty -lrb- 224 -rrb- : non oculi solum pecudum miranda tuerus more nec effusis in humum grave pascere corpus nosse fidem rerum dubiasque exquirere causas ingenium sacrare caputque attollere caelo scire quot et quae sint magno fatalium mundo principium this may be prose but it have not a little of the magnificence of the lucretian logic the man who write this be at least a spiritual kinsman of vergil vi epigram and epic the year of vergil 's sojourn in naple be perhaps the most eventful in rome 's long history and we may be sure that nothing but a frail constitution could have save a man of he age for study through those year after the battle of pharsalium in 48 caesar aside from the lotus-month in egypt pacify the eastern province then in 46 subdue the senatorial remnant in africa drive cato to he death and in September of that year celebrate he fourfold triumph with a magnificence hitherto undream all italy go to see the spectacle and doubtless vergil too for here it be if we mistake not that he first resolve to write a epic of rome the year 45 see the defeat of the pompeian remnant in spain and the first preparation for the great parthian expedition which as all know be to inaugurate the new monarchy then come the sudden blow that strike caesar down the civil war that elevate antony and octavian and bring cicero to he death and finally the victory at philippus which end all hope of a republic through all this turmoil the philosophic group of the garden continue its pursuit of science comment as we shall see upon pass event the _ aetna _ -- which seem to date from about 47-6 -- reveal the young philosopher if it be vergil in a serious mood of single-minded devotion to he new pursuit but as may be infer from the fifth _ catalepton _ he be not sure of not backslide to the influence of catullus plainly visible all through these brief poem there be add the example of philodemus who write epigram from time to time several of the _ catalepton _ may belong to this period the very first -lrb- 1 -rrb- address to vergil 's lifelong friend plotius tucca be a amusing trifle in the very vein of philodemus the fourth like the first in elegiac be a gracious tribute to a depart friend musa perhaps he fellow-townsman octavius musa -lrb- 2 -rrb- it close with a generous expression of unquestioning friendship that ask for no return : quare illud sati est si te permittis amari nam contra ut sit amor mutuus unde mihus -lrb- footnote 1 : dequa saepe tibus venit sed tucca videre non licet occulitur limine clausa virus dequa saepe tibus non venit adhuc mihus namque si occulitur longe est tangere quod nequeas venerit audivus sed iam jnihus nuntius iste quid prodest illi dicito cuus rediit -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see horace _ sit _ i 10 82 servius on _ ecl _ ix 7 berne scholium on _ ecl _ viii 6 -rrb- that be the trait surely that account for horace 's outburst of admiration animae quales neque candidiores terra tulit the seventh be a epigram mildly twit varius for he insistence upon pure diction the crusade for purity of speech have be give a new impetus a decade before by the atticist and we may here infer that varius the quondam friend of catullus be consider the guardian of that tradition vergil despite he devotion to neat technique may have have he misgiving about rule that in the end endanger the freedom of the poet he early work range very widely in its experiment in style and horace 's _ ar poetica _ write many year later show that vergil have to the very end be criticize by the extremist for take liberty with the language the epigram begin as though it be a erotic poem in the style of philodemus then have use the greek word _ potho _ he check himself as though dread a frown from varius and substitute the latin word _ puer _ scilicet hoc fraude vari dulcissime dicam : dispeream nisus I perdidit iste potho sin autem praecepta vetant I dicere sane non dicam sed : I perdidit iste puer for the comprehension of the personal allusion in the sixth and twelfth epigram we have as yet discover no clue and as they be trifle of no poetic value we may disregard they the fourteenth be however of very great interest it purport to be a vow speak before venus ' shrine at sorrento pledge gift of devotion in return for aid in compose the story of trojan aenea si mihi susceptum fuerit decurrere munus o paphon o sede quae colis idalias troius aeneas romana per oppida digno iam tandem ut tecum carmine vectus eat : non ego ture modo aut picta tua templum tabellum ornabo et puris serta feram manibus -- corniger ho aries humilis et maximum taurus victima sacrato sparget honore foco marmoreusque tibus aut mille coloribus ale in morem picta stabit amor pharetra adsis o cytherea : tuo te caesar olympo et surrentini litoris ara vocat the poem have hitherto be assign to a period twenty year later but surely this youthful ferment of hope and anxiety do not represent the composure of a man who have already publish the _ georgic _ the eager offering of flower and a many-hued statue of cupid remind one rather of the youth who in the _ ciri _ beg for inspiration with hand full of lily and hyacinth however we be not entirely leave to conjecture there be indubitable evidence that vergil begin a epic at this time some fifteen year before he publish the _ georgic _ it seem clear also that the epic be a _ aeneid _ with julius caesar in the background and that part of the early epic be finally merge into the great work of he maturity the question be of such importance to the study of vergil 's develop art that we may be justify in go fully into the evidence -lrb- 3 -rrb- as it happen we be fortunate in have several reference to this early effort the ninth _ catalepton _ write in 42 mention the poet 's ambition to write a national poem worthy of a place among the great classic of greece -lrb- l62 -rrb- : si patrio graios carmine adire sale the sixth _ eclogue _ begin with a allusion to it : prima syracusio dignata est ludere versu nostra nec erubuit silvas habitare thalium cum canerem rege et proelia cynthius aurem vellit et admonuit pastorem tityre pingui pascere oportet ove deductum dicere carman -lrb- footnote 3 : cf _ classical quarterly _ 1920 156 -rrb- this may be paraphrase : my first song -- the _ culex _ -- be a pastoral strain when later i essayed to sing of king and battle phoebus warn I to return to my shepherd song on this passage servius have the comment : significat aut aeneidem aut gesta regum albanorum donatus finally in he _ vita _ say explicitly : mox cum re romana inchoasset offensus materium ad bucolica transit the poem therefore be on the stock before the _ bucolic _ we may surmise that the death of caesar whose deed seem to have bring the idea of such a poem to vergil 's mind cause he to lay the work aside return to the fourteenth _ catalepton _ we find what seem to be a definite key to the date and circumstance of its write the closing line be : adsis o cytherea : tuo te caesar olympo et surrentini litoris ara vocat it be on September 26 in 46 bc that julius caesar so strikingly call attention to he claim of descent from venus and aenea by dedicate a temple to venus genetrix the mother of the julian gen it be on that day that caesar call venus from heaven to dwell in she new temple -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : cassius dio 43 22 appian ii 102 there be independent proof that _ catalepton _ xiv be earlier than the _ georgic _ in _ georgic _ ii 146 vergil repeat the phrase _ maximum taurus victima _ but the phrase must have have its origin in the _ catalepton _ since here _ maximum _ balance _ humilis _ in the _ georgic _ the phrase be merely a verbal reminiscence for there be nothing in the context there to explain _ maximum _ on the order of composition of the aeneid see mm crump _ the growth of the aeneid _ -rrb- be not this the act that prompt the happy idea of write the epic of aenea vergil be then live at naple and we can picture the poet fever with the new impulse sailing away from he lecture across the fair bay for a day 's brooding could one find a more fitting place than venus 's shrine at sorrento for the invocation of the _ aeneid _ how far this first attempt proceed we shall probably not know vergil 's own word would imply that he early effort center about aenea ' war in italy the sixth _ eclogue _ cum canerem rege et proelia be rather explicit on this point furthermore the erroneous reference of calaeno 's omen to anchise in the seventh book -lrb- l 122 -rrb- would indicate that this part at least be write before the harpy-scene of the third for the latter be so extensive that the poet could hardly have forget it if it have already be write it be however in read the first and fifth book that i think we may profit most by keep in mind the fact that the poet have begin the _ aeneid _ before caesar 's death in book i 286 ff occur a passage which servius refer to julius caesar it read : nascetur pulchra troianus origine caesar imperium oceano famam quus terminet astri iulius a magno demissum nomen iulo hunc tu olim caelo spoliis orientis onustum accipy secura uocabitur he quoque uoti -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : the follow line -lrb- 291-6 -rrb- refer to the succeed reign of augustus as the poet be careful to indicate in the word _ tum positis-bellis _ -rrb- very few modern editor have dare accept servius ' judgment here and yet if we may think of these line as adapt from -lrb- say -rrb- a original dedication to julius caesar write about 45 bc the difficulty of the commentator will vanish the fact that vergil seem to have in mind be these : in September 46 bc julius caesar after return from thapsus celebrate he four great triumph over gaul egypt pontus and africa display load of booty such as have never before be see at rome he then give a extended series of athletic game of the kind describe in vergil 's fifth book include a restoration of the ancient _ ludus troiae _ when these be over he dedicate the temple of venus genetrix thereby publicly announce he descent from venus and presently proclaim he own superhuman rank more explicitly by place a statue of himself among the god on the capitoline -lrb- dio xliii 14-22 -rrb- be not the phrase _ imperium oceano _ and _ spolii orienti onustum _ a direct reference to this triumph which of course vergil saw and do not these dedication inspire the prophecy _ uocabitur hic quoque uoti _ be that as it may it be difficult to refuse credence to servius in this case for vergil here -lrb- i 267-274 and 283 -rrb- accept julius caesar 's claim of descent from iulus whereas in the sixth book in speaking of the descent of the royal roman line he derive it as be regularly do in augustus ' day from silvius the son of aenea and lavinium -lrb- vi 763 ff -rrb- we must notice also that in the _ aeneid _ as in the _ georgic _ augustus be regularly call ` augustus caesar ' or ` caesar ' whereas in the only other reference to julius in the _ aeneid _ the poet explicitly point to he by say ` caesar et omnis _ iuli _ progeny ' -lrb- vi 789 -rrb- servius therefore seem to be correct in regard julius as the subject of the passage in the first book and it follow that the passage contain memory of the year 46 bc whether or not the line be as i suggest first write soon after caesar 's triumph the fifth book also despite the fact that its beginning and end show a late hand contain much that can be best bring into connection with vergil 's earlier year it be for instance easier to comprehend the poet 's reference to memmius catiline and cluentius in the forty than twenty year later vergil 's strange comparison of messallum to the _ superbus eryx _ in _ catalepton _ ix write in 42 bc -lrb- 6 -rrb- be also readily explain if we may assume that he have recently study the eryx myth in preparation for the contest of book v -lrb- 11 392-420 -rrb- the poet 's enthusiasm for the _ ludus troia be well understand as a description of what he see at caesar 's re-introduction of the spectacle in 46 at caesar 's game octavian then sixteen year of age must have lead one of the troops : -lrb- 7 -rrb- in the fifth book atys the ancestor of octavian 's maternal line lead one column by the side of iulus : alter atys genus unde atius duxere latinus -lrb- 1 568 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : see chapter viii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : the brief account of nicolaus of damascus -lrb- 9 -rrb- mention that octavius have charge of the greek play at the triumphal game -rrb- then too mark of youth pervade the substance of the book the questionable witticism might perhaps be attribute to a attempt to relieve the strain but there be a unusual amount of homeric imitation and inartistic allusion to contemporary which as in the youthful _ bucolic _ destroy the dramatic illusion thus vergil not only dwell upon the ancestry of the memmius sergius and cluentius but insist upon remind the reader of catiline 's conspiracy in the _ sergestus furen animi _ who dash upon the rock in he mad eagerness to win and obtrude etymology in the phrase _ segnem menoeten _ -lrb- 1 173 -rrb- one be tempt to suspect that the whole narrative of the boat-race be fill with pragmatic allusion if the character of he epic must be connect with well-known roman family it be at least interesting that the connection be indicate in the fifth book and not in the passage where the name first meet the reader do it not appear that the body of the book be compose long before the rest and then leave at the poet 's death not quite furbished to the fastidious taste of a later day finally i would suggest that the strange and still unexplained -lrb- 8 -rrb- omen of aceste ' burning arrow in 11 520 ff probably refer to some event of importance to segesta in the same year 46 bc we be tell by the author of the _ bellum africanum _ that caesar muster he troops for the african campaign at lilybaeum in the winter of 47 we be not tell that while there he ascend the mountain offer sacrifice to venus erycina and order he statue to be place in she temple or that he give favor to the people of segesta who have the care of that temple but he probably do something of that kind for as he have already vow he temple to venus genetrix he could hardly have remain eight day at lilybaeum so near the shrine of aenea ' venus without some act of filial devotion if vergil write any part of the fifth book in or soon after 46 this would seem to be the solution of the obscure passage in question -lrb- footnote 8 : see however dewitt _ the arrow of aceste be jour phil _ 1920 369 -rrb- it be of importance then in the study of the _ aeneid _ to keep in mind the fact that the plot be probably shape and many episode block out while vergil be young and julius caesar still the dominant figure in rome many scene besides those in the fifth book may find a new meaning in this suggestion do it not explain why so many trait in dido 's character irresistibly suggest cleopatra -lrb- 9 -rrb- why half the line of the fourth book be reminiscent of caesar 's dally in egypt in 47 do not the protracted battle scene of the last book -- otherwise so un-vergilian -- remind one of caesar 's never-ending campaign against foe spring up in all quarter and of the fact that vergil have himself recently have a share in the struggle the young octavius also whose boyhood be so sympathetically sketch by nicolaus -lrb- 5-9 -rrb- -- a leader among he companion always but ever devoted and generous -- seem to peer through the portrait of ascanius -lrb- 10 -rrb- vergil 's memory of the boy at school the recipient of the _ culex _ the leader of the trojan troop at caesar 's game the lad of sixteen sit for a day in the forum as _ praefectus urbus _ seem very recent in the page of the epic -lrb- footnote 9 : nettleship _ ancient life of virgil _ 104 warde fowler _ religious experience of the roman people _ p 415 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : see warde fowler _ the death of turnus _ pp 87-92 on the character of ascanius -rrb- it would be futile to attempt to pick out definite line and claim that these be part of the youthful poem indeed the artistry of most of the verse discuss be as any reader will notice more on the plane of the later work than of the _ ciri _ write about 47-3 bc it be safe to say that vergil do not in he youth write the sonorous line of _ aen _ i 285-290 just as they now stand but as we may learn from the _ ciri _ which vergil attempt to suppress no poet have more successfully retouch line write in youth and fit they into mature work without leave a trace of the process critic have always express they admiration for the comprehensive scope of the _ aeneid _ its depth of learn its finish artistry and its wide range of observation the substantial character of the poem be not a mystery to we when we consider how long its theme lay in the poet 's mind vii epicurean politics caesar fall on the ides of march 44 the peaceful philosophic community at herculaneum seek wisdom in daily intercourse must have feel the shock as of a earthquake despite epicurean scorn for political ambition caesar have be friendly to the school he father-in-law piso have be philodemus ' life-long friend and patron and if we may believe cicero even at time a boon companion several of caesar 's nearest friend be epicurean of the neapolitan bay they future depend wholly upon caesar dolabellum be antony 's colleague in that year 's consulship while hirtius and pansa have be choose consul for the following year by caesar to add to the shock the liberator have be lead by a recent convert to the school cassius the community as a whole be caesarian a fact explain not wholly by piso 's relation to philodemus and the friendly attitude of so many follower of caesar but also by the consideration that the lead spirit be transpadane : vergil varius and quintilius at least but at rome the political struggle soon turn itself into a contest to decide not whether caesar 's regime should be honor and continue in the family -- octavius seem at first too young to be a decisive factor -- but whether antony would be able to make himself caesar 's successor when in July brutus and cassius be out-manoeuvered by antony and cicero flee helplessly from rome it be piso who step into the breach not to support brutus and cassius but to check the usurpation of antony this give cicero a program in September he enter the list against antony in December he accept the support of octavian who have with astonishing daring for a youth of eighteen collect a strong army of caesar 's veteran and place himself at the service of cicero and the senate in they warfare against antony spring find the new consul hirtius and pansa both caesarian with the aid of octavian caesar 's heir besiege antony at the bidding of the senate in the defense of decimus brutus one of caesar 's murderer such be cicero 's skill in generalship of course caesarian be not wholly pleased with this turn of event cicero 's success would mean not only the elimination of antony -- to which they do not object -- but also the recall of brutus and cassius and the consequent elimination of themselves from political influence piso accordingly begin to waver while assure the senate of he continued support in they effort to render antony harmless he refuse to follow cicero 's leadership in attempt the complete restoration of brutus ' party cicero 's _ philippic _ dwell with no little concern upon this phase of the question we would expect the garden group friendly to the memory of caesar to adopt the same point of view as piso and for the same reason they could hardly have sympathize with the murderer of caesar on the other hand they have no reason for support the usurpation of antony and seem to have enjoy cicero 's _ philippic _ in so far as these attack antony extreme measure be however not agreeable to epicurean who in general have nothing but condemnation for civil war however octavian 's strong stand could only have please they : caesar 's grand-nephew and heir would naturally be to they a sympathetic figure a fragment of philodemus recently decipher -lrb- 1 -rrb- reveal the teacher adopt in he lecture the very point of view which we have already find in piso the fragment be brief and mutilate but so much be clear : philodemus criticize the party of cicero for carry the attack upon antony to such extreme that through fear of the liberator a reaction in favor of antony might set in we find this position reflect even in vergil he never speak harshly of the liberator to be sure in fact he indirect reference to brutus in the _ aeneid _ be remarkably sympathetic for a augustan poet but we have two epigram of he attack partizan of antony in term that remind we of passage in cicero 's _ philippic _ it would almost appear that vergil now draw he theme for lampoon from cicero 's unforgettable phrase -lrb- 2 -rrb- as catullus have do some fifteen year before how thoroughly vergil dislike antony may be see in the familiar line in the _ aeneid _ which servius recognize as a allusion to that usurper -lrb- _ aen _ vi 622 -rrb- : fixit lege pretio atque refixit -lrb- footnote 1 : _ herme _ 1918 p 382 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : three other epigram vi xii xiii have be assume by some critic to be direct attack upon antony but the key to they have be lose and certainty be no longer attainable -rrb- if servius be correct we have here again a reminder of those stormy year this too be a dagger draw from cicero 's armory again and again the orator in the _ philippic _ charge antony with have use caesar 's seal ring for lucrative forgery in state document it be interesting to find that vergil 's school friend varius in he poem on caesar 's death call _ de morte _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- first put cicero 's charge into effective verse : vendidit hic latium populi agrosque quiritum eripuit : fixit lege pretio atque refixit -lrb- footnote 3 : some recent critic have suggest that the poem may have be a general discussion of the fear of death but varius be constantly refer to as a epic poet -lrb- horace _ sit _ i 10 43 _ carm _ i 6 and porphyrio _ ad loc _ -rrb- he poem be write before vergil 's eighth _ eclogue _ which we place in 41 bc -lrb- macrobius _ sit _ vi 2 20 -rrb- and probably before the ninth -lrb- see i36 -rrb- -rrb- the reference here too must have be to antony the circle be clearly in harmony in they political view the two creature of antony attack by cicero and vergil alike be ventidius and annius cimber the epigram on the former take the form of a parody of catullus ' phasellus ille a poem which vergil have good reason to remember since catullus ' yacht have be tow up the mincio past vergil 's home when he be a lad of about thirteen indeed we hope he be out fishing that day and share he catch with the home-returning traveler parody be usually not work of artistic importance and this for all its epigrammatic neatness be no exception to the rule but it be not without interest to catch the poet at play for a moment and learn he opinion on a political character of some importance ventidius have have a checkered career after captivity possibly slavery and manumission caesar have find he keep a line of post horse and pack mule for hire on the great aemilian way and have draft he into he transport service during the gallic war he suddenly become a important man and of course caesar let he as he let other chief of department profit by war contract it be the only way he could hold man of great ability on very small official salary vergil have doubtless hear of the meteoric rise of this _ mulio _ even when he be at school for the post-road for caesar 's great train of supplies lead through cremona after the war caesar reward ventidius further by let he stand for magistracy and become a senator -- which of course shock the nobility muleteer in the senate the man change he cognomen to be sure call himself sabinus on the election poster but vergil remember what name he bear at cremona caesar finally designate he for the judge 's bench as praetor and this high office he enter in 43 he at once attach himself to antony who use he as a agent to buy the service of caesarian veteran for he army it be this that stir cicero 's ire and cicero do not hesitate to expose the man 's career vergil 's lampoon be interesting then not only in its connection with catullus and the poet 's own boyhood memory but for its reminiscence of cicero 's speech and the revelation of he own sympathy in the partizan struggle the poem of catullus and vergil 's parody must be read side by side to reveal the purport of vergil 's epigram phaselus ille quem videti hospite ait fuisse navium celerrimus neque ullius natanti impetum trabi nequisse praeterire sive palmuli opus foret volare sive linteo et hoc negat minacis adriatici negare litus insulasve cycladas rhodumque nobilem horridamque thraciam propontida trucemve ponticum sinum ubus iste post phaselus antea fuit coma silva : nam cytorio in iugo loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma amastrus pontica et cytore buxifer tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima ait phaselus : ultima ex origine tuo stetisse dicit in cacumine tuo imbuisse palmula in aequore et inde tot per inpotentium freta erum tulisse laeva sive dextera vocaret aura sive utrumque iuppiter simul secundus incidisset in pedem neque ullum vota litoralibus deis sibi esse facta cum veniret a marus novissimo hunc ad usque limpidum lacum sed haec prius fuere nunc recondita senet quiete seque dedicat tibus gemelle castor et gemelle castoris vergil 's parody -lrb- 4 -rrb- which substitute the mule-team plod through the gallic mire for catullus ' graceful yacht speeding home from asia follow the original phraseology with amusing fidelity : sabinus ille quem videti hospite ait fuisse mulio celerrimus neque ullius volanti impetum cisus nequisse praeterire sive mantuam opus foret volare sive brixiam et hoc negat tryphonis aemuli domum negare nobilem insulamve caeruli ubi iste post sabinus ante quinctio bidente dicit attodisse forcipe coma collum ne cytorio iugo premente dura volnus ederet iuba cremona frigida et lutosa gallia tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima ait sabinus : ultima

\* neque ulla vota semitalibus deis sibi esse facta praeter hoc novissimum paterna lora proximumque pectinem sed haec prius fuere : mine eburnea sedetque sede seque dedicat tibus gemelle castor et gemelle castoris -lrb- footnote 4 : see _ classical philology _ 1920 p 114 -rrb- the other epigram refer to -lrb- _ catalefton ii _ -rrb- also attack a creature of antony 's annius cimber a despise rhetorician who have be help to high political office by antony again cicero 's _ philippic _ -lrb- xi 14 -rrb- serve as we best guide for the background corinthiorum amator iste verborum iste iste rhetor namque quatenus totus thucydide britannus attice febri tau gallicum min et sphin ut male illisit ita omnium ista verba miscuit fratrus it might be paraphrase : a maniac for archaic word a rhetor indeed he be as much and as little a thucydide as he be a british prince the bane of attic style it be a dose of archaic word and celtic brogue i fancy that he concoct for he brother there seem to be three point of attack cimber to judge from cicero 's invective be suspect of have rise from servile parentage and of try as freedman then frequently do to pass as a descendant of some unfortunate barbarian prince since he brogue be celtic -lrb- _ tau gallicum _ -rrb- he could readily make a plausible story of be british vergil seem to imply that the brogue as well as the name cimber have be assume to hide he asiatic parentage the second point seem to be that cimber though a teacher of rhetoric be so ignorant of greek that while proclaim himself a atticist he use non-attic form and vaunted thucydide instead of lysia as the model of the simple style finally it be rumor and cicero affect to believe the tale that cimber be not without guilt in the death of he brother vergil be of course not greatly concern in deride atticism itself : to this school vergil must have feel less aversion than to antony 's flowery style it be the perversion of the doctrine that amuse the poet take in conjunction with other hint these two poem show we where the poet 's sympathy lay during those year of terror there may well have be a number of similar epigram direct at antony himself but if so they would of course have be destroy during the reign of the triumvirate antony 's vindictiveness know no bound as rome learn when cicero be murder viii last day at the garden vergil 's dedication of the _ ciri _ to valerius messallum be as the poem itself reveal write several year after the main body of the poem the most probable date be 43 bc when the young nobleman then only about twenty-one go with cicero 's blessing -lrb- 1 -rrb- to join brutus and cassius in they fight for the republic messallum have then besides make himself a adept at philosophy -- at naple perhaps since vergil know he -- and steal away student hour at athen for greek verse write gain no little renown by take a lawsuit against the most learn lawyer of the day servius sulpicius cicero 's letter of commendation which we still have be unusually laudatory -lrb- footnote 1 : cicero _ ad brutum _ i 15 -rrb- the dedication of the _ ciri _ reveal vergil still eager to win he place as a rival of lucretius we may paraphrase it thus : have try in vain for the favor of the populace i be now in the ` garden ' seek a theme worthy of philosophy though i have spend many year to other purpose now i have dare to ascend the mountain of wisdom where but few have venture yet i must complete these verse that i have begin so that the muse may cease to entice I further oh if only wisdom the mistress of the four sage of old would lead I to she tower whence i might from afar view the error of man i should not then honor one so great with a theme so trifling but i should weave a marvelous fabric like athena 's picture robe a great poem on nature and into its texture i should weave you name but for that my power be still too frail i can only offer these verse on which i have spend many hour of my early school-day a vow long promise and now fulfil it be apparent that the student still throb with a desire to become a poet of philosophy and that he be willing to appease the muse of lighter song only because they insist on return but there be another poem address to messalla that be equally full of personal interest messallum as we know from plutarch 's _ brutus _ draw partly from the young man 's diary join cassius in asia and do noteworthy service in help he general win the eastern province from the euxine to syria for the republican cause later at philippus he lead the cavalry charge which break through the triumvirate line and capture octavius ' camp that be the famous first battle of philippus prematurely report in italy as a decisive victory for the republican cause three week later the force clash again and the triumvir win a complete victory messallum who have be choose commander by the defeat remnant recognize the hopelessness of he position and surrender to the victor vergil 's ninth _ catalepton _ seem to have be write as a paean in honor of messallum on receipt of the first incomplete report the poem do not by any means imply that vergil favor brutus and cassius or feel any ill-will towards octavian vergil 's regard for messallum be clearly a personal matter and of such a nature that political difference play no part in it the poet 's complete silence in the poem about brutus and cassius indicate that it be not to any extent the _ cause _ which interest he nor can a eulogy of a young republican at this time be consider as imply any ill-will toward octavian to whom vergil be always devote at this early day antony be still look upon as the dominate person in the triumvirate and for he vergil have no love whatever he may therefore though a caesarian and friendly to octavian sing the praise of a personal friend who be fight antony 's triumvirate the ninth _ catalepton _ like most eulogistic verse throw off at high speed have few good line -lrb- indeed it be probably never finish -rrb- but it be exceedingly interesting as a document in vergil 's life since it have generally be place about fifteen year too late and therefore misunderstand we must dwell at length on some of its significant detail the poem can be briefly summarize : a conqueror you come the great glory of a mighty triumph a victor on land and sea over barbarian tribe and yet a poet too some of you verse have find a place in my page pastoral song in which two shepherd lie under the spreading oak sing in honor of you heroine to whom the divinity bring gift the heroine of you song shall be more famous than the theme of greek song yes even than the roman lucrece for whose honor you sire drive the tyrant out of rome great be the honor that rome have bestow upon the liberty-loving -lrb- publicola -rrb- messalla for that and other deed so i need not sing of you recent exploit : how you leave you home you son and the forum to endure winter 's chill and summer 's heat in warfare on land and sea and now you be off to africa and spain and beyond the sea such deed be too great for my song i shall be satisfy if i can but praise you verse the most significant passage be the imply comparison of valerius messallum with the founder of the valerian family who have aid the first brutus in establish the republic as he now be aid the last brutus in restore it the comparison be the more startling because we messallum later explicitly reject all connection with the first valerius and seem never to have use the cognomen publicolum the explanation of vergil 's passage be obvious -lrb- 2 -rrb- the poet hearing of messallum 's remarkable exploit at philippus see at once that he association with brutus would remind every roman of the event of 509 bc and that the populace would as a matter of course acclaim the young hero by the ancient cognomen publicolum later after he defeat and submission messallum have of course to suppress every indication that might connect he with tyrannicide stock or faction the poem therefore must have be write before messallum 's surrender in 42 bc -lrb- footnote 2 : the argument be give in full in _ classical philology _ 1920 p 36 -rrb- the poet 's silence and hesitation in touch upon this subject of civil war be significant of he mood the principal of the triumph receive not a word : he friend be the glory of a triumph lead by man whose name be apparently not pleasant memory nor be there any exultation over a presumed defeat of tyrant and a restoration of a republic the exploit of messallum that vergil especially stress be the defeat of barbarian naturally the subjection of the thracian and pontic tribe and of the oriental province earlier in the year and the assumption be make -lrb- 1 51 ff -rrb- that messallum have as a recognition of he generalship be choose to complete the war in africa spain and britain most significant of all be vergil 's blunt confession that he mind be not wholly at ease concern the theme -lrb- ii 9-12 -rrb- : i be indeed strangely at a loss for word for i will confess that what have impel I to write ought rather to have deter I could he have be more explicit in explain that messallum 's exploit for which he have friendly praise be perform in a cause of which he heart do not approve and do not this explain why he give so much space to messallum 's verse and why he so quickly pass over the victory of philippus with a assertion of he incapacity for do it justice to the biographer however the passage praise messallum 's greek pastoral be the most interesting for it reveal clearly how vergil come to make the momentous decision of write pastoral since messallum 's verse be in greek they have of course be write two year before this while he be a student at athen would that we know this heroine upon whom he represent the divinity as bestow gift propertius who acknowledge mesallum as he patron later employ this same motive of celestial adoration in honor of cynthium -lrb- ii 3 25 -rrb- but surely messallum 's _ heroi _ be to judge from vergil 's comparison a person of far higher station than cynthium could she have be the lady he marry upon he return from athen such a treatment of a woman of social station would be in line with the custom of the new poet catullus calvus and ticida rather than of the augustan gallus propertius and tibullus vergil himself use the motive in the second _ eclogue _ -lrb- l 46 -rrb- a reminiscence which doubtless with many other that we be unable to trace messallum must have recognize as he own the pastoral which vergil have translate from messallum be quite fully describe : molliter hic _ viridus patula sub tegmine quercus _ moeris pastores et meliboeus erant dulcia jactantes alterno carmina versu qualia trinacriae doctus amat iuvenis that be of course the very beginning of he own _ eclogue _ when he publish they he place at the very begin the well-known line that recall messallum 's own line : tityre tu _ patulae recubans sub tegmine fagus _ what can this mean but a graceful reminder to messallum that it be he who have inspire the new effort -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : roman writer frequently observe the graceful custom of acknowledge they source of inspiration by weave in a recognizable phrase or line from the master into the very first sentence of a new work : cf _ arma virumque cano _ -- -lrb- greek : andra moi ennepe -rrb- -lrb- lundström _ erano _ 1915 p 4 -rrb- shelley respond to the same impulse paraphrase bion 's opening line in i weep for adonai -- he be dead -rrb- we may conclude then that vergil 's use of that line as the title of he _ eclogue _ be a recognition of messallum 's influence conversely it be proof if proof be need that the ninth _ catalepton _ be vergil 's we may then interpret line thirteen of the ninth _ catalepton : _ pauca tua in nostras venerunt carmina chartas as a statement that in the autumn of 42 vergil have already write some of he _ eclogue _ and that these early one -- presumably at least number ii iii and vii -- contain suggestion from messallum there be of course no triumph and vergil 's eulogy be never send indeed it probably never be entirely complete -lrb- 4 -rrb- messallum quickly make he peace with the triumvir and prefer not to return to rome in disgrace cast he lot with antony who remain in the east vergil who thoroughly dislike antony must then have feel that for the present at least a barrier have be raise between he and messallum accordingly the _ ciri _ also be abandon and presently pillage for other use -lrb- footnote 4 : it ought therefore not to be use seriously in discussion of vergil 's technique -rrb- the news of philippus be soon follow by order from octavian -- to be thoroughly accurate we ought of course to call he caesar -- that land must now accord to past pledge be procure in italy for nearly two hundred thousand veteran every one know that the city that have favor the liberator and even those that have try to preserve they neutrality would suffer vergil could of course guess that land in the po valley would be in particular demand because of they fertility the first note of fear be find in he eighth _ catalepton _ : villulum quae sironis eras et pauper agelle verum illi domino tu quoque divitiae I tibi et hos una mecum quos semper amavi si quid de patria tristius audiero commendo imprimisque patrem : tu nunc eris illi mantua quod fuerat quodque cremona prius it be usually assume from this passage that siro have recently die probably therefore some time in 42 bc and that in accordance with a custom frequently follow by greek philosopher at rome he have leave he property to he favorite pupil the garden school therefore seem to have come to a end though possibly philodemus may have continue it for the few remain year of he life siro 's villa apparently prove attractive to vergil for he make naple he permanent home despite the gift of a house on the esquiline from maecena this however be not vergil 's last mention of siro if we may believe servius who think that silenum in the sixth _ eclogue _ stand for sironem its metrical equivalent if as seem wholly likely servius be right the sixth _ eclogue _ be a fervid tribute to a teacher who deserve not to be forget in the story of vergil 's education the poem have be so strangely misinterpret in recent year that it be time to follow out servius ' suggestion and see whether it do not lead to some conclusion -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : skutsch rouse a storm of discussion over it by insist that it be a catalogue of poem write by gallus -lrb- _ aus vergil frühzeit _ -rrb- cartault _ étude sur les bucoliques de virgile _ -lrb- p 285 -rrb- almost accept servius ' suggestion : un résumé de se lecture et de ses études -rrb- after a introduction to varus the poem tell how two shepherd find silenus off he guard bind he and demand song that he have long promise the reader will recall of course how plato also liken he teacher socrate to silenus silenus sing indeed till hill and valley thrill with the music : of creation of sun and moon the world of live thing the golden age and of the myth of prometheus phaeton pasiphaë and many other he even sing of how gallus have be capture by the muse and be make a minister of apollo a strange pastoral it have seem to many and yet not so strange when we bear in mind that the book of philodemus reveal vergil and quintilius varus as fellow student at naple surely servius have provide the key the whole poem with its reference to old myth be merely a rehearsal of schoolroom reminiscence as might have be guess from the fine lucretian rhythm with which it begin : namque canebat utus magnum per inane coacta semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent et liquidi simul igni ut he exordium primi omnium et ipse tener mundus concreverit orbi tum durare solum et discludere nerea ponto coeperit et rerum paulatim sumere formas iamque novum terrae stupeant lucescere solem altius atque cadant summoti nubibus imbre incipiant silvae cum primum surgere cumque rara per ignaros errent animalia montis the myth that follow be mean to continue this list of subject only with somewhat less blunt obviousness they suggest to varus the usual epicurean theory of perception imagination passion and mental aberration subject that siro must have discuss in some such way as lucretius treat they in he third and fourth book of the _ de rerum natura _ it be of course not to be suppose that siro have lecture upon mythology as such but the epicurean teacher despite they scorn for legend employ they for pedagogical purpose in several way lucretius for instance use they sometimes for they picturesqueness as in the _ prooemium _ and again in the allegory of the season -lrb- v 732 -rrb- he also employ they in a euhemeristic fashion explain they as popular allegory of actual human experience cite the myth of tantalus and sisyphus for example as expression of the ever-present dread of punishment for crime indeed vergil himself in the _ aetna _ -- if it be he -- somewhat naïvely introduce the battle of the giant for its picturesque interest it be only after he have enjoy tell the story in full that he check himself with the blunt remark : -lrb- 1 74 -rrb- haec est mendosae vulgata licentia famae lucretius be little less amusing in he rejection of the cybele myth after a lovely passage of forty line -lrb- ii 600 -rrb- devote to it vergil be therefore on familiar ground when he try to remind he schoolmate of siro 's philosophical theme by designate each of they by means of a appropriate myth perhaps we who unlike varus have not hear the original lecture may not be able in every case to discover the theme from the myth but the poet have at least set we out on the right scent by make the first riddle very easy the _ lapide pyrrhae _ -lrb- i 41 -rrb- refer of course to the creation of man _ saturnium regna _ be in epicurean lore the primitive life of the early savage _ furtum prometheus _ -lrb- i 42 -rrb- must refer to epicurus ' explanation of how fire come from clash tree and from lightning the story of hyla -lrb- i 43 -rrb- probably remind varus of siro 's lecture on image and reflection pasiphaë -lrb- i 46 -rrb- of unruly passion explain perhaps as in lucretius ' fourth book atalanta -lrb- i 61 -rrb- of greed and phaeton of ambition as for scyllum vergil have himself in the _ ciri _ -lrb- i 69 -rrb- mention only to reject the allegorical interpretation here present accord to which she portray : the sin of lustfulness and love 's incontinence vergil have not then meet siro but he may have read some of he lecture finally the strange line on cornelius gallus might find a ready explanation if we know whether or not gallus have also be a member of the neapolitan circle probus if we may believe he suggest the possibility in call he a schoolmate of vergil 's and a plausible interpretation of this eclogue turn that possibility into a probability the passage -lrb- ii 64-73 -rrb- may well be vergil 's way of recall to varus a well-beloved fellow-student who have leave the circle to become a poet the whole poem therefore be a delightful commentary upon vergil 's life in siro 's garden write probably after siro have die the school close and varus go off to war the younger man 's school day be now over he have find he idiom in a poetic form to which messallum 's experiment have draw he the _ eclogue _ be already appear in rapid succession ix materialism in the service of poetry it have be remark that vergil 's genius be of slow growth he be twenty-eight before he write any verse that he mature judgment recognize as worthy of publication a survey of he early life reveal some of the reason for this tardy development bear and school in a province he be naturally hold back by lack of those contact which stimulate boy of the city to rapid mental growth the first few year at rome be in some measure waste upon a subject for which he have neither taste nor endowment the banal rhetorical training might indeed have make a lucan or a juvenal out of he have he not finally revolt so decisively however this work at rome prove not to be a total loss he choice of a national theme for a epic and he insight into the true quality of imperial rome owe something to the study of political question that he preparation for a public career have necessitate he learn something in he roman day that not even epicurean scorn for politics could eradicate however he next decision to devote he life to philosophy again retard he poetic development certainly it hold he in leash during the year of adolescent enthusiasm when he might have become a lyric poet of the neoteric school a catullus or a keat must be catch early indeed the very dogma of the epicurean school if take in all earnestness be suppressive of lyrical enthusiasm the _ aetna _ show perhaps the worst effect of epicurean doctrine in its scholastic insistence that myth must now give way to fact its author be still too absorb in the microscopic analysis of a petty piece of research to catch the spirit of lucretius who have find in the vision of the scientific workshop a majesty and beauty that partook of the essence of poetry in the end vergil 's poetry like that of lucretius owe more to epicureanism than modern critic -- too often obsess by a misapply _ odium philosophicum _ -- have be incline to admit it be all too easy to compare this philosophy with other system past and present and to prove its science inadequate its implication unethical and its attitude towards art banal but that be not a sound historical method of approach the student of vergil should rather remember how great be the need of that age for some practical philosophy capable of lift the mind out of the stupor in which a hybrid mythology have leave it and how when platonic idealism have be wreck by the skeptic and stoicism with its hypothetical premise have repel many student epicurean positivism come as a saving gospel of enlightenment the system despite its inadequate first answer employ a scientific method that give the roman faith in many of its result just at a time when orthodox mythology have yield before the first critical inspection as a preliminary system of illumination it prove invaluable untrained in metaphysical process of thought ignorant of the tool of exact science the roman have as yet be grant no answer to they grow curiosity about nature except those offer by a hopelessly naïve faith stoicism have first be bring over by greek teacher as a possible guide but the roman now train by he extraordinary career in world politics to think in term of experience could have but little patience with a metaphysical system that constantly take refuge in a faith in aprioristic logic which have already be successfully challenge by two century of skeptic the epicurean at least keep he foot on the ground appeal to the practical man 's faith in he own sens and plausibly prop he hypothesis with analogous illustration oftentimes approach very close to the cogent method of a new inductive logic he rest he case at least on the process of argumentation that the roman daily apply in the law-court and the senate and not upon flight of metaphysical reasoning he come with a gospel of illumination to a race eager for light open vista into a infinity of world marvelously create by process that the average man behold in he daily walk it be this capacity of the epicurean philosophy to free the imagination to lift man out of a trivial mythology into a world of infinite vision and to satisfy man 's curiosity regard the universe with tangible answer -lrb- 1 -rrb- that especially attract roman of vergil 's day to the new philosophy they experience be not unlike that of numberless man of the last generation who first escape from a puerile cosmology by way of popularize version of darwinism which the expert condemn as unscientific -lrb- footnote 1 : it be not quite accurate to say that the roman make a dogma of epicurus ' _ ipse dixit _ which destroy scientific open-mindedness vergil use posidonius and zeno as freely as the stoic seneca do epicurus -rrb- furthermore epicureanism provide a view of nature which be apt in the mind of a imaginative poet to lead toward romanticism stoicism indeed pretend to be pantheistic and wordsworth have demonstrate the value to romanticism of that attitude but to the clear of vision stoicism immediately take from nature with one hand what it have give with the other invariably its rule of follow nature have to be define in term that prove its distrust of what the world call nature as a matter of fact the stoic have only scorn for naturalism physical man be to he a creature to be chained trust not the scelera pulpa peccat et haec peccat cry persius in terror the earlier naïve animism of greece and rome have contain more of aesthetic value for it be the very spring from which have flow all the wealth of ancient myth but the nymph of that stream be dead slay by philosophical question the new poetic myth-making that still show the influence of a old habit of mind be apt to be rather self-conscious and diffident end in something resemble the pathetic fallacy epicureanism on the other hand by employ the theory of evolution be able to unite man and nature once more and since man be so self-centered that he imagination refuse to extend sympathetic treatment to nature unless he can feel a vital bond of fellowship with it the poetry of romance become possible only upon the discovery of that unity this be doubtless why lucretius first of all the roman could in he prooemium bring back to nature that sensuousness which through the song of the troubadour have become the central theme of romantic poetry even to we day nam simulac species patefactast verna dieus aëriae primum volucres te diva tuumque significant initum perculsae corda tua vi inde ferae pecude persultant pabulum laeta vergil convince by the same philosophy express himself similarly : et genus aequoreum pecudes pictaeque volucres amor omnibus idem and again : avia tum resonant avibus virgulta canori et venerem certis repetunt armenta diebus parturit almus ager zepherique trementibus auri laxant arva sinus it be of course the theme of sumer be icumen in lucretius feel so strongly the unity of naturally evolve creation that he never hesitate to compare man of various temperament with animal of sundry nature -- the fiery lion the cool-tempered ox -- and explain the difference in both by the same preponderance of some peculiar kind of soul-atoms obviously this be a system which by enlarge man 's mental horizon and sympathy could create new value for aesthetic use like the crude evolutionistic hypothesis in rousseau 's day it give one a more soundly base sympathy for one 's fellow -- since evolution be not yet red in tooth and claw if nature be to be trust why not man 's nature why curse the body any man 's body as the root-ground of sin be not the instinct a part of man might not the scientific view prove that the passion so far from be disease condition the very life and survival of the race perhaps the evil of excess call sin be after all due to defect in social and political institution that have apply incorrect regulative principle or to the selfishly impose religious fear which have drive the healthy instinct into tantrum rid man of these erroneous fear and of a political system beget for purpose of exploitation and see whether by return to a age of primitive innocence he can not prove that nature be trustworthy -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : lucretius iii 37-93 ii 23-39 v 1105-1135 -rrb- there be in this philosophy then a basis for a large humanitarianism dangerous perhaps in its implication and yet it could hardly have be more perilous than the roman orthodox religion which insist only upon formal correctness seldom upon ethical decorum or than stoicism with its categorical imperative which could restrain only those who be already convince the stoic pretence of appeal to a natural law could be prove illogical at first examination when drive to admit that nature must be explain by a question-begging definition before its rule could be apply indeed the roman of vergil 's day have not be accustom to look for ethical sanction in religion or creed morality have always be for they a matter of family custom parental teaching of the rule of decorum legal doctrine regard the universality of _ aequita _ and more than they know of puritanic instinct inherit from a well-sifted stock it probably do not occur to lucretius and vergil to ask whether this new philosophy encourage a higher or a lower ethical standard cicero as statesman do but the question have doubtless come to he first out of the literature of the academy which he be wont to read despite they creed lucretius and vergil be indeed rome 's foremost apostle of righteousness and if anyone have press home the charge of possible moral weakness in they system they might well have point to the exemplary life of epicurus and many of he follower to the roman this philosophy bring a creed of wide sympathy with none of the lust for sensation that accompany its return in the day of rousseau and werther have not the old roman stock sound in marrow and clear of eye be shatter by war and thin out by emigration only to be displace by a more nervous and impulsive people that have come in by the slave trade roman civilization would hardly have suffer from the application of the doctrine of epicurus whether or not vergil remain a epicurean to the end we must to be fair give credit to that philosophy for much that be most poetical in he later work -- a romantic charm in the treatment of nature a deep comprehension of man 's temper a broader sympathy with humanity and a clearer understanding of the difference between social virtue and mere ritualistic correctness than be to be expect of a roman at this time it be however very probable that vergil remain on the whole faithful to this creed -lrb- 3 -rrb- to the very end he be forty year of age and only eleven year from he death when he publish the _ georgic _ which be permeate with the epicurean view of nature and the restatement of this creed in the first book of the _ aeneid _ ought to warn we that he faith in it do not die -lrb- footnote 3 : this be of course not the view of sellar conington glover and norden -- to mention but a few of those who hold that vergil become a stoic see chapter xv for a development of this view -rrb- x recuban sub tegmine fagus the visitor to arcadium should perhaps be urge to leave he microscope at home happiest at any rate be the reader of vergil 's pastoral who can take a unannotated pocket edition to he vacation retreat forget what every inquisitive donatus have conjecture about the possible hidden meaning that lie in they but the biographer may not share that pleasure the _ eclogue _ be soon burden with comment by critic who seek in they for the secret of a early career hide in the obscurity of a unannaled provincial life in they eager search for datum they force every possible passage to yield some personal allusion till the poem come to be nothing but a symbolic biography of the author the modern student must delve into this material if only to clear away a little of the allegory that obscure the text it be well to admit honestly at once that modern criticism have no scientific method which can with absolute accuracy sift out all the falsehood that obscure the truth in this matter but at least a beginning have be make in demonstrate that the gloss be not themselves consistent those early commentator who variously place the confiscation of vergil 's farm after the battle of mutina -lrb- 43 bc -rrb- after philippus -lrb- 42 -rrb- and after actium -lrb- 31 -rrb- who conceive of mark antony as a partizan of brutus and alfenus varus as the governor of a province that do not exist may state some real fact : they certainly hazard many futile guess the safest way be to trust these record only when they harmonize with the datum provide by reliable historian and to interpret the _ eclogue _ primarily as imaginative pastoral poetry and not except when they demand it as a personal record we shall here treat the _ bucolic _ in what seem to be they order of composition not the order of they position in the collection the eulogy of messallum write in 42 bc reveal vergil already at work upon pastoral theme to which as he tell we messallum 's greek eclogue have call he attention we may then at once reject the statement of the scholiast that vergil write the _ eclogue _ for the purpose of thank pollio alfenus and gallus for have save he estate from confiscation at least a full half of these poem have be write before there be any material cause for gratitude and as we shall see presently these three man have in any case little to do with the matter it will serve as a good antidote against the conjecture of the allegorizing school if we remember that these commentator of the empire be for the most part greek freedman themselves largely occupy in fawn upon they patron they apparently assume that poet as a matter of course write what they do in order to please some patron -- a questionable enough assumption regard any roman poetry compose before the silver age the second _ eclogue _ be a very early study which in the theme of the gift-bringing seem to be reminiscent of messallum 's work -lrb- 1 -rrb- the third and seventh be also generally accept as early experiment in the more realistic form of amoebean pastoral since the fifth which should be place early in 41 bc actually cite the second and third we have a _ terminus ante quem _ for these two eclogue to the early list the tenth should be add if it be address to gallus while he be still do military service in greece and with these we may place the sixth discuss above -lrb- footnote 1 : see chapter viii -rrb- the lack of realistic local color in these pastoral have frequently be criticize on the supposition that vergil write they while at home in mantua and ought therefore to have give true picture of mantuan scenery and character he home country be and be a monotonous plain the jut crag with they athletic goat the grotto invite melodious shepherd to neglect they flock the mountain glade and waterfall of the _ eclogue _ can of course not be mantuan the po valley be thickly settle and its deep black soil intensively cultivate a few sheep be of course keep to provide wool but these be herd by farmer ' boy in the orchard the lone she-goat indispensable to every italian household be doubtless tethered by a leg on the roadside there be herd of swine where the old oak forest have not yet be cut but the swine-herd be usually not reckon among songster nor be any poetry to be expect from the cowboy who manage the cattle ranch at the foot hill of the alp and the buffalo herd along the undrained lowland be vergil 's scenery then nothing but literary reminiscence in point of fact the pastoral scenery in vergil be neapolitan the eighth _ catalepton _ be proof that vergil be at naple when he hear of the danger to he father 's property in the north it be doubtful whether vergil ever again see mantua after leave it for cremona in he early boyhood the property of course belong not to he but to he father who as the brief poem indicate have remain there with he family the pastoral scenery seldom except in the ninth _ eclogue _ pretend to be mantuan even where as in the first the poem be intend to convey a personal expression of gratitude for vergil 's exemption from harsh eviction the poet be very careful not to obtrude a picture of himself or he own circumstance tityrus be a old man and a slave in a typical shepherd 's country such as could be see every day in the mountain near naple and there be as many eviction near naple as in the north indeed it be the neapolitan country -- as picturesque as any in italy -- that constantly come to the reader 's mind we be tell by seneca that thousand of sheep feed upon the rough mountain behind stabia and the clothier 's hall and numerous fullery of pompeius remind we that wool-growing be a important industry of that region vergil 's excursion to sorrento be doubtless not the only visit across the bay behind naple along the ridge of posilipo -lrb- 2 -rrb- below which vergil be later bury in the mountain about camaldolus and behind puteolus all the way to avernus -- a country which the poet have roam with observant eye -- there could have be nothing but shepherd country here then be the crag and waterfall and grotto that vergil describe in the _ eclogue _ -lrb- footnote 2 : the picturesque road from naple to puteoli clung to the edge of the rocky promontory of posilipo finally pierce the outermost rock by means of a tunnel now misname the grotto di sejano most of the road be now under twenty foot of water : see günther _ pausilypon _ to see the splendid ridge as vergil see it from the road one must now row the length of it from naple to nésida sketch in a abundance of ilex and goat in place of the villa that now cover it -rrb- and here too be doubtless as many melodious shepherd as ever theocritus find in sicily for they be of the same race of people as the sicilian why should the slope of lactarius be less musical than those of aetna indeed the reasonable reader will find that except for a occasional transference of actual person into arcadian setting -- by a allegorical turn invent before vergil -- there be no serious confusion in the scenery or inconsistent treatment in the plot of vergil 's _ eclogue _ but by fail to make this simple assumption -- naturally due any and every poet -- reader of vergil have needlessly mar the effect of some of he finest passage the fifth _ eclogue _ write probably in 41 bc be a very melodious daphnis-song that have always be a favorite with poet it have be and may be read with entire pleasure as a elegy to daphni the patron god of singing shepherd those however who in roman time know vergil 's love of symbolism suspect that a more personal interest lead he to compose this elegy the death and apotheosis of julius caesar be still think by some to be the real subject of the poem while a few have accept another ancient conjecture that vergil here write of he brother the person mourn must however have be of more importance than vergil 's brother on the other hand certain detail in the poem -- the sorrow of the mother for instance -- preclude the conjecture that it be caesar unless the poet be here confuse he detail more than we need assume in any other eclogue it be indeed difficult to escape the very old persuasion that a sorrow so sympathetically express must be more than a mere theocritan reminiscence if we could find some poet -- for daphni must be that -- near to vergil himself who meet a unhappy death in those day a poet too who die in such circumstance during the civil strife that general expression of grief have to be hide behind a symbolic veil would not the poem thereby gain a theme worthy of its grace i think we have such a poet in cornificius the dear friend of catullus to whom in fact catullus address what seem to be he last verse -lrb- 3 -rrb- like so many of the new poet cornificius have espouse caesar 's cause but at the end be induce by cicero to support brutus against the triumvir after philippus cornificius keep up the hopeless struggle in africa for several month until finally he be defeat and put to death if he be vergil 's daphni we have a explanation of why he identity escape the notice of curious scholar tactful silence become quite necessary at a time when almost every household at rome be rent by divide sympathy and yet brotherhood in art could hardly be entirely stifle from the point of view of the master of rome cornificius have meet a just doom as a rebel if he poet friend mourn for he it must have be in some such guise as this -lrb- footnote 3 : catullus 38 -rrb- in this instance the circumstantial evidence be rather strong for we be tell by a commentator that valgius a early friend of vergil 's write elegy to the memory of a codrus identify by some as cornificius : -lrb- 4 -rrb- codrusque ille canit qualus tu voce canebas atque solet numero dicere cinna tuo -lrb- footnote 4 : _ scholium veronensium _ ecl vii 22 the evidence be present in _ classical review _ 1920 p 49 -rrb- that shepherd at least be a actual person a friend of cinna and a member of the neoteric group that indeed it be cornificius be exceedingly probable the poet-patriot seem then not to have be forget by he friend all too little be know about this friend of catullus and cinna but what be know excite a keen interest though he be younger than cicero by nearly a generation the great orator -lrb- 5 -rrb- do he no little deference as a representative of the atticistic group in verse write he be of catullus ' school composing at least one epyllion besides lyric verse accord to macrobius vergil pay he the compliment of imitate he and he in turn be cite by the scholiast as authority for a opinion of vergil 's if the daphnis-song be a elegy write at he death -- and it would be difficult to find a more fitting subject -- the poem undoubtedly one of the most charming of vergil 's _ eclogue _ be compose in 41 bc it be a pity if vergil 's prayer for the poet should after all not come true : semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt -lrb- footnote 5 : see cicero 's letter to he : _ ad fam _ xii 17 2 -rrb- the tenth _ eclogue _ to gallus steep in all the literary association of pastoral elegy from the time of theocritus ' daphni to we own lycida and adonai have perhaps surround itself with a atmosphere that should not be disturb by biographical detail however we must intrude vergil 's association with gallus as have be intimate be those apparently of neapolitan school day and of poetry the sixth _ eclogue _ delicately imply that the departure of gallus from the circle have make a very deep impression upon he teacher and fellow student what would we not barter of all the sesquipedalian epic of the empire for a few page write by cornelius gallus a thousand for each this brilliant hot-headed over-grown boy whom every one loved be very nearly vergil 's age a celt as one might conjecture from he career he have meet octavius in the schoolroom and win the boy 's endure admiration then like vergil he seem to have turn from rhetoric to philosophy from philosophy to poetry and to poetry of the catullan romance as a matter of course it be cytheri the fickle actress -- if the scholiast be right -- who open he eye to the fact that there be theme for passionate poetry nearer home than the legendary love-tale and when she forget he find excitement elsewhere during he month of service with octavian he nurse he morbid grief in un-roman self-pity this first poet of the _ poitrinaire _ school he subsequent career be meteoric octavian fascinate by a brilliancy that hide a lack of roman steadiness place he in charge of the stupendous task of organize egypt a work that would tax the power of a caesar the romantic poet lose he head wine-inspired oration that delight he guest portrait bust of himself in every town grotesque catalogue of campaign against unheard-of negro tribe inscribe even on the venerable pyramid do not accord with the tradition of rome octavian cut he career short and in deep chagrin gallus commit suicide the tenth _ eclogue _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- give vergil 's impression upon read one of the elegy of gallus which have apparently be write at some lonely army post in greece after the news of cytheri ' desertion in he elegy the poet have it would seem bemoan the lot that have draw he to the east away from he beloved would that he might have be a simple shepherd like the greek about he tent for they love remain true and this be of course the very theme which vergil dramatize in pastoral form -lrb- footnote 6 : this be the interpretation of leo _ herme _ 1902 p 15 -rrb- we like vergil realize that gallus invent a new genre in literature he have daringly bring the grief of wounded love out of the realm of fiction -- where classic tradition have insist upon keep it -- into the immediate and personal song the hint for this procedure have of course come from catullus but it be gallus whom succeed elegist all accredit with the discovery vergil at once feel the compelling force of this adventuresome experiment he give it immediate recognition in he _ eclogue _ and tibullus propertius and ovid become he follower the poem of gallus if the arcadian setting be real be probably write soon after philippus vergil 's _ eclogue _ of recognition may have be compose not much later for we have a right to assume that vergil would have have one of the first copy of gallus ' poem if this be true the first and last few line be fit on later when the whole book be publish to adapt the poem for its honorable position at the close of the volume xi the eviction the first and ninth _ eclogue _ and only these concern the confiscation of land at cremona and mantua which threaten to deprive vergil 's father of he estate and consequently the poet of he income there seem to be no way of decide which be the earlier ancient commentator follow the order of precedence interpret the ninth as a indication of a second eviction but there seem to be no sound reason for agree with they since they be entirely too literal in they inference conington sanely decide that only one eviction take place and he place the ninth before the first in order of time he may be right the two poem at any rate belong to the early month of 41 the obsequious scholiast of the empire have nowhere so thoroughly expose they own mode of think as in they interpretation of these two _ eclogue _ know and care little for the actual course of event have no comprehension of the institution of a earlier day concern only with extract what be to they a dramatic story from the _ eclogue _ they put all the historical character into impossible situation the one thing of which they feel comfortably sure be that every _ eclogue _ that mention pollio gallus and alfenus varus must have be a bread and butter poem write in gratitude for value receive of the close literary association of the time they seem to be unaware to suit such purpose pollio -lrb- 1 -rrb- be at time make governor of cisalpine gaul and at time place on the commission to colonize cremona alfenus be make pollio 's successor in a province that do not exist and gallus be also make a colonial commissioner if however we examine these statement in the light of fact provide by independent source we shall find that the whole structure base upon the subjective inference of the scholiast fall to the ground -lrb- footnote 1 : see diehl _ vitae vergilianae _ pp 51 ff -rrb- we must first follow pollio 's career through this period when the triumvirate be form in 43 pollio be make antony 's _ legatus _ in cisalpine gaul and promise the consulship for the year 40 -lrb- 2 -rrb- after philippus however in the autumn of 42 cisalpine gaul be declare a part of italy and therefore fall out of pollio 's control -lrb- 3 -rrb- nevertheless he be not deprive of a command for the year remain before he consulship -lrb- 41 bc -rrb- but be permit to withdraw to the upper end of the adriatic with he army of seven legion -lrb- 4 -rrb- he duty be doubtless to guard the low venetian coast against the remnant of the republican force still on the high sea and if he have time to subdue the illyrian tribe friendly to the republican cause -lrb- 5 -rrb- during this year in which octavian have to besiege lucius antony at perusium pollio a legatus of mark antony be naturally not on good term with octavian and could hardly have use any influence in behalf of vergil or any one else after the perusine war he join antony at brundisium in the spring of 40 and act as he spokesman at the conference which lead to the momentous treaty of peace we may therefore safely conclude that pollio be neither governor nor colonial commissioner in cisalpine gaul when cremona and mantua be disturb nor could he have be on such term with octavian as to use he influence in behalf of vergil the eighth and fourth _ eclogue _ which do honor to he seem to have nothing whatever to do with material favor they doubtless owe they origin to pollio 's position as a poet and pollio 's interest in young man of letter -lrb- footnote 2 : appian iv 2 and v 22 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : appian v 3 and v 22 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : velleius paterculus ii 762 macrobius _ sit _ i xi 22 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : a task which he perform in 39 -rrb- with regard to alfenus and gallus the scholiast remain somewhat nearer the truth for they have at hand a speech of callus criticize the former for he behavior at mantua by quote the precise word of this speech servius -lrb- 6 -rrb- have provide we with a solid criterion for accept what be consistent in the statement of vergil 's earlier biographer and eliminate some conjecture the passage read : when order to leave unoccupied a district of three mile outside the city you include within the district eight hundred pace of water which lie about the wall the passage of course show that alfenus be a commissioner on the colonial board as servius say it do not excuse servius ' error of make alfenus pollio 's successor as provincial governor -lrb- 7 -rrb- after cisalpine gaul have become autonomous nor do it imply that alfenus have in any manner be generous to vergil or to any one else in fact it reveal alfenus in the act of seize a unreasonable amount of land vergil -lrb- 8 -rrb- of course recognize alfenus ' position as commissioner in he ninth eclogue where he promise he great glory if he will show mercy to mantua : vare tuum noman superet modo mantua nobi and vergil 's appeal to he be reasonable since he too be a man of literary ambition -lrb- 9 -rrb- but there be no proof that alfenus give ear to he plea at any rate the poet never mention he again servius ' supposition that alfenus have be of service to the poet -lrb- 10 -rrb- seem to rest wholly on the mistaken idea that the sixth _ eclogue _ be obsequiously address to he as we have see however quintilius varus have a better claim to that poem -lrb- footnote 6 : servius _ dan _ on _ ecl _ ix 10 ex oratione cornelii in alfenum cf kroll in _ rhein museum _ 1909 52 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : servius _ dan _ on _ ecl _ vi 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : vergil _ eclogue _ ix 26-29 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : see _ suffenus and alfenus classical quarterly _ 1920 p 160 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : on _ eclogue _ vi 6 -rrb- the quotation from the speech of gallus also lend support to a statement in servius that gallus have be assign to the duty of exacting money from city which escape confiscation -lrb- 11 -rrb- for this we be duly grateful it indicate how alfenus and gallus come into conflict since the latter 's financial sphere would naturally be invade if the former seize exempt territory for the extension of he new colony of cremona in such condition we can realize that gallus be as a matter of course interested in save mantua from confiscation and that in this effort he may well have appeal to octavian in vergil 's behalf in fact he interpretation of the three-mile exemption might actually have save vergil 's property which seem to have lie about that distance from the city -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : servius _ dan _ on _ ecl _ vi 64 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : vita probiana _ milium passuum _ xxx be usually change to iii on the basis of donatus : _ a mantua non procul _ -rrb- again however there be little reason for the supposition that vergil 's _ eclogue _ in honor of gallus have any reference whatever to this affair the sixth follow the death of siro and the tenth seem to precede the day of colonial disturbance if it have reference to gallus as a soldier in greece if the sixth _ eclogue _ refer to siro as servius hold then vergil and gallus have long be literary associate before the first and ninth be write the student of vergil who have once compare the statement of the scholiast with the historical fact at these few point where they run parallel will have little patience with the petty gossip which be elicit from the _ eclogue _ the story of vergil 's tiff with a soldier for example be apparently a inference from menalca ' experience in _ eclogue _ ix 15 but menalca appear in four other _ eclogue _ where he can not be vergil the poet indeed be at naple as the eighth _ catalepton _ prove the estate in danger be not he but that of he father who presumably be the only man legally competent of action in case of eviction vergil 's poem to be sure be a plea for mantua but it be clearly a plea for the whole town and not for he father alone the landmark of the low hill and the beech up to which the property be save -lrb- ix8 -rrb- seem to be the limit of mantua 's boundary not of vergil 's estate on the low river-plain we need not then concern ourselves in a vergilian biography with the tale that arrius or clodius or claudius or milienus toro chase the poet into a coal-bin or duck he into the river -lrb- 13 -rrb- the shepherd of the poem be typical character make to pass through the typical experience of time of distress -lrb- footnote 13 : see diehl _ vitae vergilianae _ p 58 -rrb- the first _ eclogue tityre tu _ be even more general than the ninth in its application though of course it be mean to convey the poet 's thanks to octavian for a favorable decree it speak for all the poor peasant who have be save the aged slave tityrus do not represent vergil 's circumstance but rather those of the servile shepherd-tenant -lrb- 14 -rrb- so numerous in italy at this time such man though renter could not legally own property since they be slave but in practice they be allow and even encourage to accumulate possession in the hope that they might some day buy they freedom and with freedom would naturally come citizenship and the full ownership of they accumulation many of the poor peasant scatter through italy be _ colonus _ of this type and they doubtless suffer severely in the eviction tityrus be here picture as go to the city to ask for he liberty which would in turn ensure the right of ownership such be the allegory simple and logical it be only the old habit of confusing tityrus with vergil which have obscure the meaning of the poem however the real purpose of the poem lie in the second part where the poet express he sympathy for the luckless one that be be drive from they home and that this represent a cry of the whole of italy and not alone of he home town be evident from the fact that he set the character in typical shepherd country -lrb- 15 -rrb- not in mantuan scenery as in the ninth the plaint of meliboeus for those who must leave they home to barbarian and migrate to africa and britain to begin life again be so poignant that one wonder in what mood octavian read it en quo discordium cive produxit misero be not very flattering to he -lrb- footnote 14 : see leo _ herme _ 1903 p 1 ff question by stampinus _ le bucoliche _ ' 3 1905 p 93 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : capua and nucerium be two of the city near naple where vergil could see the work of eviction near at hand -rrb- the very deep sympathy of vergil for the poor exile ring also through the _ dirae _ a very surprising poem which he write at this same time but on second thought suppress it have the bitterness of the first _ eclogue _ without its grace and tactful begin the triumvir be in no mood to read a book of lamentation honey on the rim be lucretius ' wise precept and it be doubtless a prudent impulse that substitute the _ eclogue _ for the curse the former probably accomplish little enough the latter would not even have be read the _ dirae _ take the form of a cursing roundel a form once employ by callimachus who may have inherit it from the east it call down heaven 's wrath upon the confiscate land in language as bitter as ever mt ebal hear : fire and flood over the crop blight upon the fruit and pestilence upon the heartless barbarian who drive peaceful peasant into exile the setting be once more that of the country about naple of the campanian hill and the sea coast not that of mantua -lrb- 16 -rrb- it be doubtless the miserable poor of capua and nucerium that vergil particularly have in mind the singer be two slave-shepherd depart from the land of a master who have be dispossess the poem be pervade by a strong note of pity for the lover of peace -- pius cive shall we say the pacifist -- who have be punish for refuse to enlist in a civil war a sympathy for they must have be deep in the gentle philosopher of the garden : o male deuotus praetorum crimina agellus -lrb- 17 -rrb- tuque inimica pius semper discordia ciuis exsul ego indemnatus egen mea rura reliquus mile ut accipiat funestus premia bellus hinc ego de tumulo mea rura nouissima uisam hinc ibo in silua : obstabunt iam mihus colle obstabunt monte campo audire licebit -lrb- 18 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : it be just possible that lycurgus -lrb- l 8 -rrb- who be speak of as the author of the mischief be mean for alfenus varus who boast of he knowledge of law horace lampoon he as _ alfenus vafer _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : ye field accurse for we statesman 's sin o discord ever foe to man of peace in want a exile uncondemned i yield my land to pay the wages of a hell-born war ere i go hence one last look towards my field then to the wood i turn to close you out from view but ye shall hear my curse still -rrb- -lrb- footnote 18 : the _ lydium _ which come in the m attach to the _ dirae _ be not vergil 's nor can it be the famous poem of that name write by valerius cato despite the opinion of lindsay _ class review _ 1918 p 62 it be too slight and ineffectual to be identify with that work the poem abound with conceit that a neurotic and sentimental pupil of propertius -- not too well practice in verse writing -- would be likely to cull from he master -rrb- for vergil there be henceforth no joy in war or the fruit of war he devotion to julius caesar have be unquestioned and octavian when he prove himself a worthy successor and established peace inherit that devotion but for the patriot who have fight the losing battle he have only a heart full of pity ne puerus ne tanta animis adsuescite bella neu patria valido in viscera vertite viri tuque prior tu parce genus qui ducis olympo projice tela manu sanguis meus xii pollio we come finally to the two _ eclogue _ address to asinius pollio this remarkable man be only six year older than vergil but he be just old enough to become a member of caesar 's staff a experience that mature man quickly to vergil he seem to be a link with the last great generation of the republic that catullus have mention he gracefully in a poem and cinna have write he a _ propempticon _ that caesar have speak to he on the fateful night at the rubicon and that he have be one of cicero 's correspondent place he on a very high pedestal in the eye of the studious poet still grope he way it may well be that gallus be the tie that connect pollio and vergil for we find in a letter of pollio 's to cicero that the former while campaigning in spain be in the habit of exchange literary chitchat with gallus that be in the spring of 43 at the very time doubtless when pollio -- as young man then do -- spend he leisure moment between battle in write tragedy vergil in he eighth eclogue perhaps with over-generous praise compare these play with those of sophocle this _ eclogue _ present one of the most striking study in primitive custom that latin poetry have produce a bit of realism suffuse with a romantic pastoral atmosphere the first shepherd 's song be of unrequited love cherish from boyhood for a maiden who have now choose a worthless rival the second be a song sing while a desert shepherdess perform with scrupulous precision the magic rite which be to bring she faithless lover back to she there be reminiscence of theocritus of course any edition of the _ eclogue _ will give they in full but vergil so long as he live at naple do not have to go to sicilian book for these detail he who know the social custom of campanium the magical charm scribble on the wall of pompeius the deadly curse scratch on endure metal by forlorn lover -- curse hide beneath the threshold or hearthstone of the rival to blight she cheek and wrinkle she silly face -- know very well that such folk be the very singer that vergil might meet in he walk about the hill of the golden bay the eighth _ eclogue _ claim to have be write at the invitation of pollio who have apparently learn thus early that vergil be a poet worth encourage that the poem have nothing to do with the confiscation in so far at least as we be able to understand the historical situation have be suggest above it be usually date in the year of pollio 's albanian campaign in 39 that be a year after he consulship should it not rather be place two year earlier when pollio have give up the cisalpine province and withdraw to the upper adriatic coast preparatory to proceed on antony 's order against the illyrian rebel in the spring of 41 pollio camp near the timavus mention in line 6 two year later the natural route for he to take from rome would be via brundisium and dyrrhachium -lrb- 1 -rrb- the point be of little interest except in so far as the date of the poem aid we in trace pollio 's influence upon the poet and in arrange the _ eclogue _ in they chronological sequence -lrb- footnote 1 : antony 's province do not extend beyond scodra the road down the illyrian mountain from trieste be not easy for a army to travel if the _ eclogue _ be compose in three year -lrb- donatus -rrb- the year 39 be too late finally vellius ii 762 make it plain that in 41 pollio remain in venetium contrary to order he have apparently be order to proceed into illyrium at that time -rrb- finally we have the famous messianic _ eclogue _ the fourth which be address to pollio during he consulship by its fortuitous resemblance to the prophetic literature of the bible it come at one time to be the best know poem in latin and elevate its author to the position of a arch-magician in the medieval world indeed this poem be largely influential in save the rest of vergil 's work from the oblivion to which the dark age consign at least nine-tenth of latin literature the poem be write soon after the peace of brundisium -- in the consummation of which pollio have have a large share -- when all of italy be exult in its escape from another impending civil war its immediate purpose be to give adequate expression to this joy and hope at once in a abide record that the roman and the ruler of rome might read and not forget its form seem to have be condition largely by a strange allegorical poem write just before the peace by a still unknown poet the poet be horace who in the sixteenth epode have candidly express the fear of roman republican for rome 's capacity to survive horace have boldly ask the question whether after all it be not the duty of those who still love liberty to abandon the land of endless warfare and find a new home in the far west -- a land which still preserve the simple virtue of the golden age vergil 's enthusiasm for the new peace express itself as a answer to horace : -lrb- 2 -rrb- the golden age need not be seek for elsewhere in the new era of peace now inaugurate by octavian the virgin justice shall return to italy and the golden age shall come to this generation on italian soil vergil however introduce a new messianic element into the symbolism of he poem for he measure the progress of the new era by the stage in the growth of a child who be destine finally to bring the prophecy to fulfillment this happy idea may well have be suggest by table talk with philodemus or siro who must at time have recall story of savior-prince that they have hear in they youth in the east the oppressed orient be full of prophetic utterance promise the return of independence and prosperity under the leadership of some long-hoped-for worthy prince of the tediously unworthy reign dynasty indeed since philodemus grow to boyhood at gadara under jewish rule he could hardly have escape the knowledge of the very definite messianic hope of the hebrew people it may well be therefore that a stray image whose ultimate source be none other than isaiah come in this indirect fashion into vergil 's poem and that the monk of the dark age guess better than they know -lrb- footnote 2 : sellar _ horace and the elegiac poet _ p 123 ramsay quote by w warde fowler _ vergil 's messianic eclogue _ p 54 -rrb- to attempt to identify vergil 's child with a definite person would be a futile effort to analyze poetic allegory contemporary reader doubtless suppose that since the republic be dead the successor to power after the death of octavius and antony would naturally be a son of one of these the settlement of the year be seal by two marriage that of octavian to scribonium and that of octavian 's sister to antony it be enough that some prince worthy of leadership could naturally be expect from these dynastic marriage and that in either case it would be a child of octavian 's house -lrb- 3 -rrb- thus far he reader might let they imagination range what actually happen afterwards through a series of evil fortune have of course nothing to do with the question pollio be obviously address as the consul whose year mark the peace which all the world hope and pray would be lasting -lrb- footnote 3 : see _ class phil _ xi 334 -rrb- we have now review the circumstance which call forth the _ eclogue _ they seem as donatus say to have be write within a period of three year the second third seventh and sixth apparently fall within the year 42 the tenth fifth eighth ninth and first in the year 41 while the _ pollio _ certainly belong to the year 40 when vergil become thirty year of age the writing of these poem have call the poet more and more away from philosophy and bring he into closer touch with the suffering and experience of he own people he have find a theme after he own heart and with the theme have come a style and expression that fit he genius he abandon hellenistic conceit with they prettiness of sentiment attain a easy modulation of line readily respond to a variety of emotion learn the dignity of he own language as he acquire a deeper sympathy for the suffering of he own people there be a new note as there be a new rhythm in : _ magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo _ xiii the circle of maecenas julius caesar have learn from bitter experience that poet be dangerous enemy cicero 's innuendo be disagreeable enough but they might be forget when however catullus and calvus put they into bite epigram there be no forget this be doubtless caesar 's chief reason for he constant endeavor to win the goodwill of the young poet and he ultimately do win that of calvus and catullus whether octavian and he sage adviser maecena act from the same motive we do not know though they too have see in vergil 's epigram on antony 's creature and in horace 's sixteenth epode that the poet of the new generation seem likely to give effective expression to political sentiment at any rate the new court at rome begin very soon to make generous overture to the literary man of the day pollio octavian 's senior by many year and of noble family could hardly be approach though gradually draw away from antony he have so closely associate himself with this brilliant companion of he gallic-war day that he prefer not to take a subordinate place at the roman court messallum who have enter the service of antony be also out of reach there remain the brilliant circle of young man at naple man whose name occur in the dedication of philodemus ' lecture : vergil varius plotius and quintilius varus three of whom at least be from the north and would naturally be incline to look upon octavian with sympathy varius have already write he epic _ de morte _ which seem to have mourn caesar 's death and though in hidden language he have allude bitterly to antony 's usurpation in the year that follow the murder before vergil 's epic appear it be varius who be always consider the epic poet of the group of plotius tucca we know little except that he be call a poet be a constant member of the circle and with varius the literary executor who publish vergil 's work after he death quintilius varus have like varius come from cremona know catullus intimately and if we accept the view of servius for the sixth _ eclogue _ have be vergil 's most devoted companion in siro 's school he also take some part in the civil war and come to be look upon as a very firm supporter of sound literary standard -lrb- 1 -rrb- horace 's _ oui desiderio _ show that varus be one of vergil 's most devoted friend -lrb- footnote 1 : cf horace _ ar poetica _ 440 -rrb- vergil 's position as foremost of these poet be doubtless establish by the publication of the _ eclogue _ they take rome by storm and be even set to music and sing on the stage accord to a alexandrian fashion then prevail in the capital octavian be of course attract to they by a personal interest the poet be give a house in maecena ' garden on the esquiline with the hope of entice he to rome vergil doubtless spend some time in the city before he turn to the more serious task of the _ georgic _ but we be tell that he prefer the neapolitan bay and establish he home there this group it would seem be definitely draw into octavian 's circle soon after the peace of brundisium and form the nucleus of a kind of literary academy that set the standard for the augustan age the introduction of horace into this circle make a interesting story he be five year younger than vergil and have have he advanced education at athen there brutus find he in 43 when attend philosophical lecture in order to hide he political intrigue and though horace be a freedman 's son brutus give he the high dignity of a military tribuneship brutus as a republican be of course a stickler for all the aristocratic custom that he confer upon horace a knight 's office probably indicate that the _ libertinus pater _ have be a war captive rather than a man of servile stock and therefore only technically a freedman in practical life the roman observe this distinction even though it be not usually feasible to do so in political life after philippus horace find himself with the defeat remnant and return to italy only to discover that he property have be confiscate he be eager for a career in literature but have to earn he bread he buy a poor clerkship in the treasury office then during spare moment he write -- satire of course what else could such a wreckage of enthusiasm and ambition produce he only hope lay in attract the attention of some kindly disposed literary man and for some reason he choose vergil the _ eclogue _ be not yet out but the _ culex _ be in circulation and he make the pastoral scene of this the basis of a epode -- the second -- write with no little good-natured humor horace imagine a broker of the forum reading that passage and quite carry away by the succession of delightful scene decide to quit business for the simple life he accordingly draw in all he money on the calends -- on the ides he lend they out again -lrb- 2 -rrb- what vergil write horace when he receive a copy of the _ epode _ we be not tell but in he next work the _ georgic _ he return the compliment by similarly thread horace 's phrase into a description of country life -- a passage that be indeed one of the most successful in the book -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : horace 's scene -lrb- he memory be visual rather than auditory -rrb- unmistakably reproduce those of the _ culex _ cf _ culex _ 148-58 with _ epode _ 26-28 _ culex _ 86-7 with _ epode _ 21-22 _ culex _ 49-50 with _ epode _ 11-12 etc a full comparison be make in _ classical philology _ 1920 p 24 vergil could of course be expect to recognize the allusion to he own poem -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : _ see georgic _ ii 458-542 and a discussion of it in _ classical philology _ 1920 p 42 -rrb- the composition of the sixteenth epode by horace -- soon after the second it would seem -- give vergil a opportunity to recognize the new poet and answer he pessimistic appeal with the cheerful prophecy of the fourth eclogue as we have see by this time we may suppose that a intimate friendship have spring up between the two poet strengthen of course by friendly intercourse now that vergil could spend some of he time at rome horace himself tell how vergil and varius introduce he to maecena -lrb- _ sit _ 1 6 -rrb- a important event in he career that take place some time before the brundisian journey -lrb- _ sit _ 1 5 -rrb- maecena have hesitate somewhat before accept the intimacy of the young satirist : horace have fight quite recently in the enemy 's army have criticize the government in he _ epode _ and be of a class -- at least technically -- which octavian have be warn not to recognize socially unless he be prepare to offend the old nobility but horace 's dignified candor win he the confidence of maecena and that there might be no misunderstanding he include in he first book of _ satire _ a simple account of what he be and hope to be thus through the effort of vergil and varius he enter the circle whose guide spirit he be destine to become thus the coterie be form which under such powerful patronage be bind to become a sort of unofficial commission for the regulation of literary standard it be a important question not only for the young man themselves but for the future of roman literature which direction this group would take and whose influence would predominate it might be maecena the holder of the purse-string a man who could not check he ambition to express himself whether in prose or verse this etruscan whose few survive page reveal the fact that he never acquire a understanding of the dignity of rome 's language that he be temperamentally un-roman in he love for meretricious gaudiness and prettiness might have work incalculable harm on this school have he taste in the least affected it but whether he withhold he dictum or it be disregard by the other no influence of he can be detect in the literature of the epoch apollodorus octavian 's aged teacher a man of very great personal influence and highly respect probably count for more in he lecture and he book one of which valgius a member of the circle translate into latin he preach the doctrine of a chaste and dignified classicism he creed fortunately fall in with the tendency of the time and whether this teaching be call a cause or whether the popularity of it be a effect of pre-existing cause we know that this man come to represent many of the ideal of the school but to trace these ideal in they contact with vergil 's mental development we must look back for a moment to the tendency of the catullan age from which he be emerge in a curious passage write not many year after this horace when group the poet accord to they style and department -lrb- 4 -rrb- place vergil in a class apart he mention first a turgid epic poet for whom he have no regard then there be varius and pollio in epic and tragedy respectively of whose forceful directness he do approve in comedy he friend fundanius represent a homely plainness which he commend while vergil stand for gentleness and urbanity -lrb- molle atque facetum -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ sit _ i 10 40 ff -rrb- the passage be important not only because it reveal a contemporaneous view of vergil 's position but because it show horace thus early as the spokesman of the classical coterie the tenet of which in the end prevail in this passage horace employ the category of the standard text-book of rhetoric of that day -lrb- 5 -rrb- which be accustom to classify style into four type : -lrb- 1 -rrb- grand and ornate -lrb- 2 -rrb- grand but austere -lrb- 3 -rrb- plain and austere -lrb- 4 -rrb- plain but graceful the first two style might obviously be use in forensic prose or in ambitious poetic work like epic and tragedy horace would clearly reject the former represent for instance by hortensius and pacuvius in favor of the austere dignity and force of the second affect by man like cornificius in prose and varius and pollio in verse the two type of the plain style be employ in more modest poem of literature both in prose and in such poetry as comedy the epyllion in pastoral verse and the like severe simplicity be favor by calvus in he oration catullus in he lyric 5 while a more polished and well-nigh _ précieuse _ plainness be illustrate in the speech of calidius and in the alexandrian epyllion of catullus ' _ peleus and theti _ and in vergil 's _ ciri _ and _ bucolic _ -lrb- footnote 5 : eg demetrius philodemus cicero of _ class phil _ 1920 p 230 -rrb- in choose between these two horace of course sympathize with the ideal of the severe and chaste style which he find in the comedy of fundanius vergil 's early work unambitious and plain though it be fall of course into the last group and though horace recognize he type with a friendly remark one feel that he recognize it for reason of friendship rather than because of any native sympathy for it by he juxtaposition he show that the classical ideal of the second and third of the four style be to he most sympathetic _ mollitudo _ do not find favor in any of he own work or in he criticism of other man 's work vergil therefore though he appear in this augustan coterie as a important member be still feel to be something of a free lance who adhere to alexandrian art -lrb- 6 -rrb- not wholly in accord with the standard which be now be formulate if horace have obey he literary instinct alone he would probably have relegate vergil at this period to the silence he accord callus and propertius if not to the open hostility he express towards the alexandrianism of catullus it be significant of vergil 's breadth of sympathy that he remit not a jot in he devotion to catullus and gallus and that he win the deep reverence of propertius while remain the friend and companion of the courtly group work towards a stricter classicism if we may attempt to classify the early augustan we find they align themselves thus the strict classicist be horace the satirist varius a writer of epic pollio of tragedy while varus valgius plotius and fundanius though less productive employ they influence in the support of this tendency as do tibullus somewhat later vergil be a close personal friend of these man but refuse to accept the axiom of any one school gallus he friend be a free romanticist and be follow in this tendency a few year later by propertius -lrb- footnote 6 : horace have doubtless see not only the _ culex _ but several of the other minor work that vergil never deign to put into general circulation -rrb- the influence that make for classicism be many apollodorus the teacher of octavian must have be a strong factor but since he work have be lose the weight of it can not now be estimate horace imbibe he love for severe ideal in athen of course there he teacher be stoic rhetorician who train he in a uncompromising respect for stylistic rule -lrb- 7 -rrb- he read the hellenistic poet to be sure and reveal in he poem a ready memory of they but it be the great epoch of greek poetry that form he style such be the foreign influence but the native roman factor must not be forget in point of fact it be the classicistic catullus and calvus of the simple limpid lyric write in pure unalloyed every-day latin that teach the new generation to reject the later hellenistic style of catullus and calvus as illustrate in the verse romance varus pollio and varius be old enough to know catullus and calvus personally to remember the day when poem like _ diana sumus in fide _ be just issue and they be poet who could value the perfect art of such work even after the author of they have be entice by ambition into dangerous by-path in a word it be catullus and calvus the lyric poet who make it possible for the next generation to reject catullus and calvus the neoteric romancer -lrb- footnote 7 : for the stylistic tenet of the stoic teacher see fiske _ lucilius and horace _ pp 64-143 apollodorus seem to be the rhetorician whom horace call heliodorus in _ sit _ i 5 see _ class phil _ 1920 393 -rrb- for the modern therefore it be difficult to restrain a just resentment when he find horace refer to these two great predecessor with a sneer yet we can if we will detect a adequate explanation of horace 's attitude very few poet of any time have be able to capture and hold the generation immediately succeed the stronger the impression make by a genius the farther away be the pendulum of approbation apt to swing the _ neoterous _ have to face in addition to this revulsion the misfortune of the time the civil war which come close upon they have little use for the sentimentality of they romance or the involution of they manner of composition and again catullus and calvus have be over-brutal in they attack upon julius caesar a character lift to the high heaven by the war and the martyrdom that follow and as fortune would have it almost all of the new literary man be as we have see peculiarly devote to caesar we know enough of war to have discover that intense partizanship do silence literary judgment except in the case of a very few man of unusual balance vergil be one of the very few he keep he candle light at the shrine of catullus still but this be hardly to be expect of the rest in prose also the augustan uphold the refine and chaste work of classical atticism a ideal which they derive from the roman of the precede generation rather than from teacher like apollodorus pollio and messallum be now the foremost orator pollio have stand close to calvus as well as to caesar and have witness the revulsion of feeling against cicero 's style which continue to move in its old leisurely course even after the civil war have quicken man 's pulse messallum may have be influence by the example of he general brutus a man who never waste word -lrb- so long as he keep he temper -rrb- messallum and pollio be the dictator of prose style during this period we find vergil therefore in a peculiar position he be still recognize as a pupil of catullus and the alexandrian at a time when the pendulum be swing so violently away from the republican poet that they do not even get credit for the lesson that they have so well teach the new generation vergil himself be in each new work drift more and more toward classicism but he continue to the last to honor catullus and calvus cinna and cornificius and he friend gallus in complimentary imitation or by friendly mention the new academy be proud to claim he as a member though it doubtless know that vergil be too great to be bind by rule to after age while horace have come to stand as a extremist who carry the law beyond the spirit vergil honor the past and welcome the future have assume the position of rome 's most representative poet xiv the georgic the year that follow the publication of the _ eclogue _ seem to have be a season of read travel observe and brood maecenas desire to keep the poet at rome and as a inducement provide he with a villa in he own garden on the esquiline the fame of the _ digitus praetereuntium _ await he come and go he _ bucolic _ have be set to music and sing in the concert hall to vehement applause -lrb- 1 -rrb- he seem even to have make a effort to be socially congenial there be intimate knowledge of courtly custom in the staging of he epic and in horace 's fourth book a refurbish early poem in philodemus ' manner picture a vergil -- apparently the poet -- as the pet of the fashionable world but these thing have no attraction for he rome indeed appeal to he imagination _ roma pulcherrima rerum _ but it be the invisible rome rather than the _ fumum et opes strepitumque _ it be the city of pristine ideal of irresistible potency of anchise ' pageant of hero when he walk through the forum he see not only the glisten monument in they new marble veneer but beyond these in the far distant past the straw hut

make the forum the court of a world-wide empire the rome of he own day be too feverish it soon drive he back to he garden villa near naple -lrb- footnote 1 : tacitus _ dialogus _ 13 : malo securum et

many citizen in high position who be at variance with the government quite prepared to declare for antony or pompey if either should appear a match for the young heir of caesar clearly the great epic of rome could not have mature in that atmosphere of suspicion intrigue and selfishness the convulsion of the die republic behold day by day near at hand could only have inspire a disgust sufficient to poison a poet 's sensitive hope it be indeed fortunate that vergil could escape all this that he could retain through the period of transition the memory of rome 's former greatness and the faith in she destiny that he have imbibe in he youth the time come when octavian after actium reunite the empire with a firm hand and justify the buoyant optimism which vergil almost alone of he generation have be able to preserve during these few year vergil seem to have write but little we have however a strange poem of thirty-eight line the _ copa _ which to judge from its exclusion from the _ catalepton _ should perhaps be assign to this period a study in temper realism not unlike the eighth _ eclogue _ it give we the song of a syrian tavern-maid invite wayfarer into she inn from the hot

be consider a experiment in a new style if the rather dubious manuscript evidence be support by a single ancient citation see rand _ loc cit _ p 178 -rrb- there be also three brief _ priapea _ which should probably be assign to this period the third may indeed have be a inscription on a pedestal of the scare-crow god set out to keep off thieving rook and urchin in the poet 's own garden : this

ply you theft : we neighbor be a miser he scare-crow get no gift he apple be not guard -- the path be on you leave the quaint simplicity of the sentiment and the playful surprise at the end quickly disarm any skepticism that would deny these line to horace 's poet of tender humor during this period the poet seem also to have travel maecena enjoy the society of literary man and we may well suppose that he take vergil with he in he administrative tour on more than the one occasion which horace happen to have record the poet certainly know italy remarkably well the meager and inaccurate map and geographical work of that day could not have provide he with the insight into detail which the georgic and the last six book of the _ aeneid _ reveal we know of course from horace 's third ode that vergil go to greece this famous poem a steamer-letter as it be be undated but it may well be a continuation of the brundisian diary the strange turn which the poem take -- its dread of the sea 's danger -- seem to point to a time when horace 's memory of he own shipwreck be still very vivid there be also time for extensive read that vergil range widely and deeply in philosophy and history antiquity and all the world 's best prose and poetry the vast learning of the _ georgic _ and the _ aeneid _ abundantly prove the epic story which he have early plot out must have lie very near the threshold of he consciousness through this period for he mind keep seize upon and store up apposite incident and germ of fruitful lore reference to aenea crop out here and there in the _ georgic _ and the mysterious address to mantua in the third book promise under allusive metaphor a epic of trojan hero nor could the poet forget the philosophic work he have so long ponder over doubt increase however of he capacity to justify himself after the sure success of lucretius a remarkable confession in the second book of the _ georgic _ reveal he conviction that in this poem he have through lack of confidence choose the inferior theme of nature 's physical and sensuous appeal when he would far rather have experience the intellectual joy of penetrate into nature 's inner mystery -lrb- 5 -rrb-

_ 264-74 he have pronounced peasant-lore trivial in comparison with science -rrb- though we need not take too literally a poet 's prefatorial remark vergil doubtless hope that he _ georgic _ might turn man 's thought towards a serious effort at rehabilitate agriculture and the practical-minded maecena certainly encourage the work with some such aim in view the government might well be deeply concern the veteran who have recently settle many of italy 's best tract could not have be skilled farmer the very fact that the land be give they for political service could only have suggest to the shrewd among they that the old roman respect for property rights have be infringe and that it be wise to sell as soon as possible and depart with some tangible gain before another revolution result in a new redistribution such suspicion could hardly beget the patience essential for the development of agriculture and yet this be the very time when farm must be encouraged large part of the arable land have be abandon to grazing during the preceding century because of the importation of the provincial stipendiary grain and italy have lose the custom of raise the amount of food that she population require as a result the younger pompey 's control of sicily and the trade route have now bring on a series of famine and consequent bread-riot year after year octavian fail in he attempt to lure away or to defeat this obnoxious rebel at best he could buy he off for a while though he never know at what season of scarcity the purchase price might become prohibitive the choice of vergil 's subject coincide therefore with a need that all man appreciate the _ georgic _ however be not write in the spirit of a colonial advertisement in the youthful _ culex _ vergil have dwell somewhat too emphatically upon the song-bird and the cool shade and have draw upon himself the genial comment of horace that alfius do not find condition in the country quite as enchanting as picture this time the poet paint no idealized landscape entice though the picture be vergil insist on the need of unceasing ungrudging toil he list the weed and blight the pest and the vermin against which the farmer must contend indeed it be in the contemplation of a life of toil that he find he honest philosophy of life : the gospel of salvation through work hardship whet the ingenuity of man god himself for man 's own good bring a end to the age of golden indolence shake the honey from the tree and give viper they venom man have be leave alone to contend with a obstinate nature and in that struggle to discover he own worth the _ georgic _ be far remove from pastoral allegory italy be no longer arcadia it be just italy in all its glory and all its cruelty vergil 's delight in nature be essentially roman though somewhat more self-conscious than that of he fellow there be little of the sentimental rapture that the eighteenth century discover for we vergil be not likely to stand in posture before the awful solemnity of the sea or the majesty of wide vista from mountain top italian hill-top afford view of numerous charming landscape but no scene of entrance grandeur or awe-inspiring desolation and the sea before the day of the compass be too suggestive of death and sorrow to invite consideration of its lawless beauty these aspect of nature have to be discover by later experience in other land at first glance vergil seem to care most for the obvious gift of italy 's generous amenity the physical pleasure in the free out-of-door the form and color of landscape the wholesome life as one read on however one become aware of a intimacy and fellowship with animate thing that go deeper particularly in the second book the very blade of grass and tendril of the vine seem to be sentient the graft tree behold with wonder strange leaf and fruit grow from they stem transplant shoot put off they wild-wood instinct the thirsting plant lift up its head in gratitude when water we own generation which be sedulously entice into nature study by book cram with the pathetic fallacy have become suspicious of everything akin to nature fake it have learn that this device have be a trick employ by a crafty pedagogy for the sake of appeal to unimaginative child vergil be probably far from be conscious of any such purpose as a roman he simply give expression to a mode of view nature that still seem natural to most greek and roman the roman farmer have not entirely outgrow he primitive animism when he say he prayer to the spirit of the grove the field and the stream he probably do not visualize these being in human form manifestation of life betoken spirit that produce life and growth vergil 's phrase be the poetic expression of the animism of the unsophisticated rustic which at a earlier age have shape the great nature myth and if vergil have be question about he own faith he could well have find a consistent answer though he have himself long cease to pay homage to these _ animae _ he philosophy like that of lucretius also seek the life-principle in nature though he seek that principle a step farther remove in the atom the vitalize seed of thing forever in motion forever create new combination and forever work the miracle of life by means of the energy with which they be themselves instinct the memorable line on spring in the second book be cast into the form of old poetry but the basis of they be epicurean energism as in lucretius ' prooemium vergil 's study of evolution have for he also unite man and nature make the romance of the _ georgic _ possible it have shape a kind of scientific animism that permit he to accept the language of the simple peasant even though its connotation be for he more complex and subtle finally the careful reader will discover in vergil 's nature poetry a very modern attention to detail such as we hardly expect to find before the nineteenth century here again vergil be lucretius ' companion this habit be apparently a composite product the ingredient be the capacity for wonder that we find in some great poet like wordsworth and plato a genius for note detail breed in he as in lucretius by long occupation with deductive method of philosophy -- scientific pursuit have thus enriched modern poetry also -- and a sure aesthetic sense this power of observation have be overlook by many of vergil 's commentator conington for example have frequently do the poet a injustice by assume that vergil be in error whenever he statement seem not to accord with what we happen to know we have now learn to be more wary it be usually a safer assumption that we observation be in error a recent study of tree shrub and plant of vergil illuminating in numberless detail have fall into the same error here and there by fail to notice that vergil write he _ bucolic _ and _ georgic _ not near mantua but in southern italy the modern botanical critic of vergil should as mackail have say study the flora of campanium not of lombardy in every line of composition vergil take infinite pain to give a accurate setting and atmosphere carcopino -lrb- 6 -rrb- have just astonished we with proof of the poet 's minute study of topographical detail

less than generation of close scrutiny could remove but the right kind of observe have begin on the other hand the book be not merely a farmer 's practical manual on how to raise bee for profit the poet 's interest be in the amazing insect themselves they how and why and wherefore it be the mystery of they instinct habit and all-compelling energy that lead he to study the bee and finally to the half-concealed confession that he philosophy have fail to solve the problem of animate nature xv the aeneid while caesar octavian now grow to full political stature be reunite the east and the west after actium vergil be write the last page of the _ georgic _ the battle that decide rome 's future also determine the poet 's next theme the epic of rome abandon at the death of caesar unthinkable during the civil war which follow appeal for a hearing now that rome be save and the empire restore vergil 's youthful enthusiasm for rome which have spring from a critical reading of she past career seem fully justified he begin at once he _ arma virumque _ the _ aeneid _ reveal as the critic of nineteen century have reiterate a unsurpassed range of reading but it be not necessary to repeat the evidence of vergil 's literary obligation in a essay concerned chiefly with the poet 's more intimate experience in point of fact the tracking of poetic reminiscence in a poet who live when no concealment of borrow thought be demand do as much violence to vergil as it do to euripide or petrarch the poet have always be expect to give expression to he own conviction but until recently it have be consider a graceful act on he part to honor the good work of he predecessor by the frank use in recognizable form of the line that he most admire the only requirement have be that the poet should assimilate and not merely agglomerate he acceptance that he should as vergil put it wrest the club from hercule and wield it as its master in essence the poetry of the _ aeneid _ be never homeric despite the incorporation of many homeric line it be rather a sapling of vergil 's hellenistic garden slowly acclimate to the italian soil fed richly by year of philosophic study brace prune and rear into a tree of noble strength and classic dignity the form and majesty of the tree bespeak infinite care in cultivation but the fruit have not lose the delicate tang and savor of its seed the poet of the _ ciri _ the _ copa _ the _ dirae _ and the _ bucolic _ be never far to seek in the _ aeneid _ it would be a long story to trace the flowering in the aeneid of the seedling sown in vergil 's boyhood garden-plot -lrb- 1 -rrb- the note of intimacy unexpected in a epic the occasional drawing of the veil to reveal the poet 's own countenance a un-homeric sentimentality now and then the great abundance of sense-teeming collocation the depth of sympathy reveal in such tragic character as palla lausus euryalus the insistent study of inner motive the meticulous selection of incident the careful artistry of the meter the fastidious choice of word and the precision of the joiner 's craft in the composition of traditional element all suggest the habit of work practice by the friend of cinna and valerius cato -lrb- footnote 1 : for a careful study of this subject see duckett _ hellenistic influence on the aeneid _ smith college study 1920 -rrb- the last point be well illustrate in sinon 's speech at the opening of the second book the old folktale of how the wooden horse leave on the shore by the greek be recklessly drag to the citadel by the trojan satisfy the unquestioning homer vergil do not take the improbable on faith sinon be compel to be entirely convince in he speech he use every art of persuasion : he awaken in turn curiosity surprise pity admiration sympathy and faith the passage be as curiously work as any episode of catullus or the _ ciri _ it be not as have be hold a result of rhetorical study alone it reveal rather a native good sense temper with a neoteric interest in psychology and a neoteric exactness in formal composition and yet the passage exhibit a great advance upon the geometric formality of the _ ciri _ the incident be not treat episodically as it might have be in vergil 's early work the pattern be not whimsically intricate but be shape by a understanding mind while its art be as study and conscious as that of the _ ciri _ it have the directness and integrity of homeric narrative yet vergil have not forget the startling effect that catullus would attain by compress a long tale into a suggestive phrase if only a memory of the tale could be assume the story of priam 's death on the citadel be tell in all its tragic horror till the climax be reach then suddenly with astonishing force the mind be fling through and beyond the memory of the awful mutilation by the amazingly condensed phrase : jacet ingen litore truncus avulsumque umeri caput et sine nomine corpus there vergil have give only the last line of a suppress tragedy which the reader be compel to visualize for himself neoteric too be the accurate observation and the patience with detail display by the author of the _ aeneid _ in he youth vergil have to be sure avoid the extreme of photographic realism illustrate by the very curious _ moretum _ but he have nevertheless in work like the _ copa _ the _ dirae _ and the eighth _ eclogue _ practice the craft of the miniaturist whenever he find the minutiae aesthetically significant to realize the precision of he stroke even then one have but to recall the couplet of the _ copa _ which in a instant set one upon the dusty road of a italian July midday : nunc cantu crebro rumpunt arbusta cicada nunc varium in gelida sede lacerta latet throughout the _ aeneid _ the patch of landscape the retreat for storm-tossed ship the carve temple-door the group of accoutred warrior march past and many a gruesome battle scene be reminder of this early technique what degree of conscientious workmanship go into these result we be just now learn carcopino -lrb- 2 -rrb- who with a copy of vergil in hand have carefully survey the latin coast from the tiber mouth past the site of lavinium down to ardea be convince that the poet trace every maneuver and every sally on the actual ground which he choose for he theater of action in the last six book it still seem possible to recognize the deep valley of the ambuscade and the plain where camillum deploy she cavalry furthermore there can be little doubt that for the sake of a heroic-age setting vergil study the remains and record of most ancient rome there be still in existence in various latin town sixth-century temple laden with antique arm and armor deposit as votive offering terracotta statue of god and hero and even document store for safe-keeping in the expansion of rome over the campus martius unmarked tomb with they antique furniture be often disclose it be apparent from he work that vergil examine such material just as he delve into varro 's antiquity and cato 's origin for ancient lore he remark on praeneste and antemna he knowledge of ancient coin symbol of the early rite of the hercule cult show the result of these early habit of work it must always be notice however that in he mature art he be master of he vast hoard of material there be never as in the _ culex _ and _ ciris _ a display of irrelevant fact a yielding to the temptation of be excursive and episodic wherever the work have receive the final touch the composition show a flawless unity -lrb- footnote 2 : carcopino _ virgile et les origines d'ostie _ -rrb- the poet 's response to personal experience reveal itself nowhere more than in the political aspect of the _ aeneid _ a fact that be the more remarkable because vergil live so long in epicurean circle where a interest in politics be studiously suppress what make the poem the first of national epic be however not a devotion to rome 's historical claim to primacy in italy the narrow imperialism of the urban aristocracy find no support in he not the city of rome but italy be the _ patrium _ of the _ aeneid _ and italy as a civilizing and peace-bringing force not as the exploit conqueror here we recognize a spirit akin to julius caesar vergil 's hero aenea be not a latin but a trojan that fact be of course due to the exigency of tradition but that aenea receive he aid from the greek evander and from the numerous etruscan city north of the tiber while most of the latin join turnus the enemy can not be attribute to tradition in fact livy who give the more usual roman version say nothing of the greek but join latinus and the latian aborigine to aenea while he muster the etruscan under the rutulian turnus the explanation for vergil 's striking departure from the usual patriotic version of the legend be rather involve and need not be examine here but we may at any rate remark he wish to recognize the many race that have be amalgamate by the state to refuse he approval of a narrow urban patriotism and to give he assent to a view of rome 's place and mission upon which julius caesar have always act in extend citizenship to people of all race in scatter roman colony throughout the empire and in set the province on the road to a full participation in imperial privilege and duty with such a policy vergil school at cremona milan and naple could hardly fail to sympathize it have be infer from the position of authority which aenea assume that vergil favor a strong monarchial form of government and intended aenea to be as it be a prototype of augustus the inference be doubtless over-hasty vergil have a lively historical sense and in he hero seem only to have attempt a picture of a primitive king of the heroic age indeed aenea be perhaps more of a autocrat than be the homeric king but that be because the trojan be picture as a migrate group tear root and branch from they land and government and follow a semi-divine leader whose direction they have deliberately choose to obey in he reference to roman history in the pageant of hero of the sixth book as well as in the historical scene of the shield no monarchial tendency appear brutus the tyrannicide pompey and cato the irreconcilable foe of caesar vergil 's youthful hero receive they meed of praise in the _ aeneid _ though there be many who hold it treason in that day to mention rebel with respect it be indeed a very striking fact that vergil who be the first of roman writer to attribute divine honor to the youthful octavian refrain entirely from do so in the _ aeneid _ at a time when the rest of rome hesitate at no form of laudation julius caesar be still recognize as more than human vocabitur hic quoque voti but augustus be not the contrast be significant the language of the very young man at naple have of course be color by oriental form of expression that be in part unconsciously imbibe from the conversation of the garden these be phrase too which julius caesar in the last two year of he life encourage for he have learn from alexander 's experience that the shortest cut through constitutional obstruction to supreme power lay by way of the doctrine of divine royalty in fact the senate be force to recognize the doctrine before caesar 's death and after he death consistently vote public sacrifice at he grave vergil be therefore follow a high authority in the case of caesar and be draw the logical inference in the case of octavian when he write the first _ eclogue _ and the prooemium of the _ georgic _ this make it all the more remarkable that while he admiration for augustus increase with the year he cease to give any countenance to the grow cult of emperor worship that the restraint be not simply in obedience to a governmental policy seem clear for horace who in he youthful work have show he distrust of the government have now learn to make very liberal use of celestial appellative augustus then be not in any way identify with the semi-divine aenea vergil do not even place he at a post of special honor on the mount of revelation but rather in the midst of a long line of remarkable _ principe _ with dignity and sanity he lay the stress upon the great event of the republic and upon its hero we may therefore justly conclude that when he write the epic he advocate a constitution of the type propose by cicero in which the _ princep _ should be a true leader in the state but in a constitutional republic it be the great past illustrate by the pageant of hero and the prophetic picture of aenea 's shield that kindle the poet 's imagination he sympathy be generous enough to include every race within the empire and every leader who have share in rome 's make from the divine founder romulus and the tyrannicide brutus to the republican martyr cato and pompey as well as the restorer of peace caesar and augustus he have no false patriotism that blind he to rome 's shortcoming he frankly admit with regret she failure in art and science with a modesty that permit of no reference to he own saving work what rome have do and can do supremely well he also know : she can rule with justice banish violence with law and displace war by peace after the year of civil war which he have live through in agony of spirit it be not strange that such a mission seem to he supreme and that be why the last word of anchise to aenea be : hae tibi erunt arte : pacisque imponere morem parcere subjecti et debellare superbo the tragedy of dido reveal better perhaps than any other portion of the _ aeneid _ how sensitively the poet reflect rome 's life and think rather than those of he greek literary source and yet the irrepressible servius be so reckless as to say that the whole book have be transfer from apollonius fortunately we have in this case the alleged source and can meet the scholiast with a sweeping denial both author portray the love of a woman and there the similarity end apollonius be wholly dependent upon a literal cupid and he shaft vergil to be sure be so far obedient to greek convention as to play with the motive -- cupid come to the banquet in the form of ascanius -- but only after it be really no longer need the psychology of passion 's progress in the first book be convincingly express for the first time in any literature aenea first receive a full account of dido 's deed of courage and presently behold she as she sit upon she throne direct the work of city building judge and rule as lawgiver and administrator and finally proclaim mercy for he shipwrecked companion for she part she we discover as he do have long know he story and in she admiration for he people have choose the deed of trojan hero for representation upon the temple door : sunt lacrimae rerum the poet simply and naturally lead hero and heroine through the experience of admiration generous sympathy and gratitude to a inevitable affection which at the night 's banquet through a soul-stirring tale tell with dignity and hear in rapture could only ripen into a very human passion the vital difference between vergil 's treatment of the theme and apollonius ' may be trace to the difference between the roman and the greek family into italy as into greece have come many century before horde of indo-european migrant from the danubian region who have carry into the south the wholesome family custom of the north the very custom indeed out of which the transalpine literature of medieval chivalry later blossom in greece those social custom -- still recognizable in homer and the early mythology -- have in the sixth century be overwhelm by a back-flow of aegean society when the northern aristocracy be compel to surrender to the native element which constitute the backbone of the democracy with the re-emergence of the aegean society in which woman be relegate to a menial position the possibility of a genuine romantic literature naturally come to a end at rome there be no such cataclysm during the century of the republic here the old stock though somewhat mix with etruscan survive the ancient aristocracy retain its dominant position in the state and society and its mores even penetrate downward they be not stifle by new southern custom well up from below at least not until the plebeian element win the support of the founder of the empire and finally overwhelm the nobility at rome during the republic there be no question of social inequality between the sex for though in law the patriarchal clan-system impose by the exigency of a migrate group make the father of the family responsible for civil order no inference be draw to the detriment of the mother 's position in the household nepo once aptly remark : many thing be consider entirely proper here which the greek hold to be indelicate no roman ever hesitate to take he wife with he to a social dinner in fact we woman invariably have the seat of honor at temple and large gathering in such matter we differ wholly from the greek indeed the very persistence of a nobility be in itself a favorable factor in establish a better position for woman not only do the accumulation of wealth in the household and the persistence of courtly manners demand respect for the _ domina _ of the villa but the transference of noble blood and of a goodly inheritance of name and land through the mother 's hand be matter of vital importance the nobility of the senate moreover long control the foreign policy of the empire and as the empire grow the man be call away to foreign part on mission and legation at such time the lady in a important household be mistress of large affair it have be point out as a significant fact that the father of the gracchus be engage for long year in ambassadorial and military duty the training of the lad consequently fall to the share of cornelium a fact which may in some measure account for the humanitarian interest of those two brilliant reformer the responsibility that fall upon the shoulder of such woman must have stimulate they keenest power and thus win for they the high esteem which in this case we know the son accord they mother one do not soon forget the scene -lrb- cicero _ ad att _ xv ii -rrb- at which brutus and cassius together with they wife porcium and tertium and servilium the mother of brutus discuss momentous decision with cicero when brutus stand waver cicero avoid the issue and cassius as usual lose he temper it be servilium who offer the only feasible solution and it be she program which they adopt be it surprising that greek historian like plutarch could never quite comprehend the part in roman politics play by woman like clodium porcium and terentium in sheer despair he usually resort to the hypothesis of some personal intrigue for a explanation of they powerful influence it be in truth very likely that have roman literature be permit to run its own natural course without be overwhelm as be the italian literature of the renaissance it would have progress much farther on the road to romanticism apollonius be far more a restrain influence in this respect than a inspiration as it be vergil 's first and fourth book be as unthinkable in greek dress as be the sixth they constitute a very conspicuous landmark in the history of literature vergil do not wholly escape the powerful convention of he greek predecessor : in he fourth book for instance there be suggestion of the melodramatic maiden 's lament so dear to the music hall gallery of alexandrium but vergil apparently to he own surprise permit he roman understanding of life to prevail and transcend he first intention as soon as he have feel the grip of the character he be portray dido quickly emerge from the role of a temptress design as a last snare to trap the hero and become a woman who reveal human law paramount even to divine ordinance once realize this the poet sacrifice even he hero and wreck he original plot to be true to he insight into human nature the confession of aenea as he depart that in heed heaven 's command he have blaspheme against love -- _ polluto amore _ -- how strange a thought for the _ pius aeneas _ that sentiment be not greek it be a new flash of intuition of the very quality of purest romance the _ aeneid _ be also a remarkably religious poem to have come from one who have devote so many enthusiastic year to a materialistic philosophy indeed it be usual to assume that the poet have abandon he philosophy and turn to stoicism before he death but there be after all no legitimate ground for this supposition the _ aeneid _ have of course none of the scientific fanaticism that mar the _ aetna _ and the poet have grow mellow and tolerant with year but that he be still convince of the general soundness of the epicurean hypothesis seem certain many puzzle of the _ aeneid _ be at least best explain by that view the repetition of he creed in the first _ aeneid _ ought to warn we that he enthusiasm for the study of _ rerum natura _ do not die indeed the _ aeneid _ be full of epicurean phrase and notion the atom of fire be strike out of the flint -lrb- vi 6 -rrb- the atom of light be emit from the sun -lrb- vii 527 and viii 23 -rrb- early man be bear _ duro robore _ and live like those describe in the fifth book of lucretius -lrb- viii 320 -rrb- and conington find almost two hundred reminiscence of lucretius in the _ aeneid _ the proportion increase rather than decrease in the later book -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : servius vi 264 make the explicit statement : ex majore parte sironem id est magistrum epicureum sequitur -rrb- it be however in the interpretation of the word _ fatum _ and the role play by the god -lrb- 4 -rrb- that the test of vergil 's philosophy be usually apply the modern equivalent of _ fatum _ be as guyau -lrb- 5 -rrb- have say _ determinism _ determinism be accept by both school but with a difference to the stoic _ fatum _ be a synonym of providence whose popular name be zeus the epicurean also accept _ fatum _ as govern the universe but it be not teleological and zeus be not identify with it but be like man subordinate to it again the stoic be consistently fatalistic even man 's moral obligation which be admit imply no real freedom in the shaping of result for though man have the choice between pursue he end voluntarily -lrb- which be virtue -rrb- or kick against the prick -lrb- which be vice -rrb- the sum total of he accomplishment be not alter by he choice : _ ducunt volentern fa nolentem trahunt _ on the other hand vergil 's master while he affirm the causal nexus for the governance of the universe : nec sanctum numan _ fatus protollere fine _ posse neque adversus natura foedera nitus -lrb- footnote 4 : the passage have be analyze and discuss frequently see especially heinze _ vergil epische technik _ 290 ff who interpret zeus as fate matthaei _ class quart _ 1917 pp 11-26 who deny the identity drachmann guderne ko vergil 1887 macinnis _ class rev _ 1910 p 160 and warde fowler _ aenea at the site of rome _ pp 122 ff for a fuller statement of this question see _ be jour _ phil 1920 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ morale d'epicure _ p 72 -rrb- -lrb- lucr v 309 -rrb- posit a spontaneous initiative in the soul-atom of man : quod _ fatus foedera rumpat _ ex infinite _ ne causam causa sequatur _ -lrb- lucr ii 254 -rrb- if then vergil be a stoic he jupiter should be omnipotent and omniscient and the embodiment of _ fatum _ and he human character must be represent as devoid of independent power but such idea be not find in the _ aeneid _ jupiter be indeed call omnipoten at time but so be juno and apollo which show that the term must be use in a relative sense in a few case he can grant very great power as when he tell venus : imperium sine fine dedus -lrb- i 278 -rrb- but very providence he never seem to be he draw -lrb- sortitur -rrb- the lot of fate -lrb- iii 375 -rrb- he do not assign they at will and he unroll the book of fate and announce what he find -lrb- i 261 -rrb- he be powerless to grant cybele 's prayer that the ship may escape decay : cuus tanta deo permissa potestas -lrb- ix 97 -rrb- he can not decide the battle between the warrior until he weigh they fate -lrb- xii 725 -rrb- and in the council of the god he confess explicitly he non-interference with the law of causality : sua cuique exorsa laborem fortunamque ferent rex jupiter omnibus idem fa viam invenient -lrb- x 112 -rrb- and here the scholiast naïvely remark : videtur he ostendisse aliud esse fa aliud jovem -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : serv _ ad loc _ macinni _ class rev _ 1910 p 172 cite several other passage to the point in refutation of heinze -rrb- again contrary to the stoic creed the poet conceive of he human character as capable of initiate action and even of thwart fate aenea in the second book rush into battle on a impulse he could forget he fate and remain in sicily if he choose -lrb- v 700 -rrb- he might also remain in carthage and explain fully why he do not and dido if leave _ nesclum fatus _ might thwart the fate -lrb- i 299 -rrb- and finally do slaying herself before she time -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- iv 696 -rrb- the stoic hypothesis seem to break down completely in such passage -lrb- footnote 7 : see matthaei _ class quart _ 1917 p 19 -rrb- can we assume a epicurean creed with better success at least in so far as it place the _ foedera natura _ above the god and attribute some freedom of will and action to man for as we have see in both of these matter vergil agree with lucretius but there be one apparent difficulty in that vergil contrary to he teacher 's usual practice permit the interference of the god in human action the difficulty be however only apparent if as vergil do we conceive of these god simply as heroic and super-human character in the drama accept from a heroic age in order to keep the ancient atmosphere in which aenea have live in man 's imagination ever since homer first speak of he as such character they have the power of initiative and the right to interfere in action that epicurus attribute to man and in so far as they be of heroic stature they action may be the more effective thus far a epicurean might well go and must go in a epic of the heroic age this be of course not the same as say that vergil adopt the god in imitation of homer or that he need olympic machinery because he suppose it a necessary part of the epic technique surely vergil be gifted with as much critical acumen as lucan but he have to accept these creature as subsidiary character the moment he choose aenea as he hero for aenea be the son of venus who dwell with the celestial at least a part of the time she presence in turn involve juno and jupiter and the rest of she daily associate furthermore since the tale be of the heroic age of long ago the character must naturally behave as the character of that day be wont to do and there be old book like homer and hesiod from which every schoolboy have become familiar with they behavior if the poet wish to make a plausible tale of that period he could no more undertake to modernize he character than could tennyson in he _ idyll _ the would-be god be in the tale not to reveal vergil 's philosophy -- they do not -- but to orient the reader in the atmosphere in which aenea have always be conceive as move they perform the same function as the heroic accoutrements and architecture for a correct description of which vergil visit ancient temple and study cato have he choose a contemporary hero or one less bless with celestial relative there be no reason to suppose that he would have employ the super-human personage at all if this be true it be as uncritical to search for the poet 's own conception of divinity in these personage as it would be to infer he taste in furniture from the straw cot which he choose to give he hero at evander 's hovel in the epic of primitive rome the claim of art take precedence over personal creed and so they would with any true poet and if any critic be prosaic enough to object vergil might have answer with livy : datur haec venia antiquitatus ut miscendo humana divini primordium urbium augustiora faciat and if the inconsistency with he philosophy be stressed he could refer to lucretius ' proemium it be clear then that while the conception of destiny and free-will find in the _ aeneid _ be at variance with stoic creed at every point they fit readily into the epicurean scheme of thing as soon as we grant what any epicurean poet would readily have grant that the celestial might be employ as character of the drama if in general subordinate to the same law of causality and of freedom as be human being what then be we to say of the stoic coloring of the sixth book in the first place it be not actually stoic it be a syncretism of mystical belief develop by orphic and apocalyptic poet and mystic from pythagora and plato to a group of hellenistic writer popularize by the later less logical stoic philosopher like posidonius and gain in vergil 's day a wide acceptance among those who be grow impatient of the exact metaphysical process of thought indeed vergil contribute something toward foist these belief upon early christianity though they be no more essential to it than to stoicism be that as it may this mystical setting be here adopt because the poet need for he own purpose -lrb- 8 -rrb- a vision of incorporated soul of roman hero a thing which neither epicurean nor orthodox stoic creed could provide so he create this _ mytho _ as plato for he own purpose create a vision of er -lrb- 9 -rrb- the dramatic purpose of the _ descensus _ be of course to complete for aenea the progressive revelation of he mission so skilfully develop by careful stage all through the third book -lrb- 10 -rrb- to give the hero he final command and to inspire he for the final struggle -lrb- 11 -rrb- then the poet realize that he could at the same time produce a powerful artistic effect upon the reader if he accomplish this by means of a vision of rome 's great hero present in review by anchise from the mount of revelation for this be a age in which rome be grow proud of she history but to do this he must have a _ mytho _ which assume that soul live before they earthly existence a homeric limbo of depart soul do not suffice -lrb- though vergil also avail himself of that in order to recall the friend of the early book -rrb- with this in view he build he home of the dead out of what servius call much _ sapientium _ fill in detail here and there even from the legendary lower-world personage so that the reader may meet some familiar face however the setting be not to be take literally for of course neither he nor anyone else actually believe that prenatal spirit bear the attribute and garment of they future existence nor be the poet concern about the eschatology which have to be assume for the setting but he judgment on life though afford a opportunity to find expression through the character of the scene be not allow to be circumscribe by they they be he own deepest conviction -lrb- footnote 8 : no one would attempt to infer stephen phillip ' eschatology from the setting of he _ christ in hade _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : vergil indeed be careful to warn the reader -lrb- vi 893 -rrb- that the portal of unreal dream refer the imagery of the sixth book to fiction and servius reiterate the warning on the employment of myth by epicurean see chapter viii above -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : see heinze _ epische technik _ pp 82 ff -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : this vergil indicate repeatedly : _ aen _ v 737 vi 718 806-7 890-2 -rrb- it have frequently be say that vergil 's philosophical system be confuse and that he judgment on providence be inconsistent that in fact he seem not to have think he problem through this be of course true so far as it be true of all the student of philosophy of he day indeed we must admit that with the very inadequate psychology of that time no reasonable solution of the then central problem of determinism could be find but there be no reason for suppose that the poet do not have a complete mastery of what the best teacher of he day have to offer vergil 's epicureanism however serve he chiefly as a work hypothesis for scientific purpose with its ethical and religious implication he have not concerned himself and so it be not permit in he later day to interfere with a deep respect for the essential of religion similarly the profoundest student of science today man who in all they experiment act implicitly and undeviatingly on the hypothesis of atomism and determinism in the world of research be usually the last to deny the validity of the basic religious tenet in he knowledge of religious rite vergil reveal a exactness that seem to point to very careful observance in he childhood home they have become second nature as it be and go as deep as the filial devotion which so constantly bring the word _ pieta _ to he pen but he religion be more than a matter of rite and ceremony it have to a degree very unusual for a roman associate itself with morality and especially with social morality the culprit of he tartarus be not merely the legendary offender against exact deity : hic quibus invisus fratre dum vita manebat pulsatusve paren et fraus innexa clienti aut qui divitiis soli incubuere repertis nec partem posuere suis quae maximum turba est the virtue that win a place in elysium indicate the same fusion of religion with humanitarian sympathy : hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passus quique sacerdote casti dum vita manebat quique pius vate et phoebo digna locuti inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artis quique sui memore aliquo fecere merendo : omnibus he nivea cinguntur tempora vitta he elysium be far remove from homer 's limbo truly do he deserve he place among those phoebo digna locutus before he have complete he work the poet set out for greece to visit the place which he have describe and which in he fastidious zeal he seem to have think in need of the same careful examination that he have accord he italian scenery three year he still think requisite for the completion of he epic but at megara he fall ill and be carry back in augustus ' company to brundisium he die there in 19 bc at the age of fifty-one before he death he give instruction that he epic should be burn and that he executor he life-long friend varius and tucca should suppress whatever of he manuscript he have himself fail to publish in order to save the
