all this agreeable excitement and which be presently to take place in the great church before a vast assembly of noble and clergy and representative from the university of padua mantua and bologna and

recognition of the sacredness and greatness of the christian mystery the choir-screen terminate in pulpit at either side and here again the apostle stand in solemn guardianship on its broad parapet -- but emblem rather of the stony rigidity of doctrine which have be shape by the mind of man from some little phase of truth than of that glowing spiritualize human sympathy which as the soul of man grow upward into comprehension be the apostle of a ever widen truth and over the richly sculptured central arch which form the entrance to the choir against the incongruous glitter of gold and jewel and magnificent garment and light and sumptuous overwrought detail -- the very extravagance of the renaissance -- a great black marble crucifix bear aloft the most solemn symbol of the christian faith the religious ceremonial with which the festival have open be over and down the aisle on either side past the family altar with they innumerable candle and lantern and censer -- ceaselessly smoking in memorial of the honor dead -- the brother of the frarus and the servus march in solemn procession to the chant of the acolyte return to mass themselves in the transept in fuller view of the pulpit before the contest begin the frarus have take they position on the right under the elaborate hanging tomb of fra pacifico -- a mass of sculpture rococo and gilding the incense rise from the censer swinging below the coffin of the saint carry the eye insensibly upward to the grotesque canopy where cumbrous marble cloud be compacted of dense mass of saint ' and cherub ' head with uncompromising golden halo some of the younger brother scatter leaflet contain head of the theses there be a stir among the crowd a few go out have witness the pageant but there be a flutter of increase interest among those who remain as a venerable man in the garb of the frarus mount the pulpit on the right the abbé morellus sit in a attitude of breathless interest and now a look of intense anxiety cross he face it be fra teodoro the ablest disputant of the frarus he exclaim the trial be too great the lady with he draw closer arrange the fold of the ample veil which partially conceal she face so that she might watch more closely but it be on don ambrogio morellus that she fix she gaze with painful intensity read the success or failure of the orator in she brother 's countenance ambrogio she entreat when the argument have be present and receive with every sign of triumph that the sacredness of the place make decorous thou knowest that i have no understanding of the latin -- be it unanswerable nay she brother answer uneasily it be fine surely but have no fear fra teodoro be not incontrovertible and the servus have better method may one ask the name of the disputant who be to respond a stranger question courteously of don ambrogio it be a brother who have but enter they order yesterday don ambrogio answer with some hesitation by name pierino -- nay fra paolo he be reputed learn yet if the method of the order be strange to he one should grant indulgence for he be reputed learn -- he be conscious of repeat the word for he own encouragement with a heart less brave than he could have wish but the information be pleasantly echo about as the rank of the servus part and a old man with a face full of benignity come forward hold the hand of a boy with blue eye and light hair who walk timidly with he to the pulpit on the leave where the older man encourage the shrink disputant to mount the stair there be a murmur of astonishment as the young face appear in the tribunal of that grave assembly impossible it be only a child it be in truth a strange picture this child of thirteen small and delicate for he year yet with a face of singular freshness and gravity he youthfulness heighten by cassock and cowl -- a unique simple figure against the bizarre magnificence of the background the central point of interest for that learn and brilliant assembly as he stand there above the beautiful kneel angel who hold the book of the law just under the pulpit for a moment he seem unable to face he audience then with a effort he raise he hand nervously push back the white fold of he unaccustomed cowl and cast a look of perplexity over the sea of face before he but the expression of trouble slowly clear away as he eye meet those of a friar grave and bent who have step out from the company of the servus and fix upon the boy a steadying gaze of assurance triumph and command it be fra gianmarium who be know throughout venice for he great learning pierino break from the mother in a tone of quick emotion as she see she boy for the first time in the dress of he order which thrust as it be the claim of she motherhood quite away it be so soon to surrender all the beautiful romance of mother and child so soon to have do with the joy of watch the development which have long outstrip she leadership so soon to consent to the absolute parting of the way she have not will it so and she be weary from the struggle but the boy be satisfy the presence of he stern and learn mentor suffice to restore he composure he do not even see he mother 's face so near he piteous in its appeal for a single glance to confess he need of she nay have no fear don ambrogio counsel he face glowing with pride the boy be a wonder the good fra giulio turn back from the pulpit stair see the face of the two whose heart be hang on the word of the child he go directly to they and sit down beside donna isabellum for he have a tender heart and he guess she trouble i also he say lean over she and speak low i also love the boy and while i live will i care for he he shall lack for nothing it be a promise of great comfort for pierino -- she could not call he by the new name -- would need such loving care already the mother 's pulse beat more tranquilly and she almost smile she gratitude in the large-hearted friar 's face then fra gianmarium he mentor see that the boy have gain courage come also to a seat beside donna isabellum with a look of radiant congratulation for he have be the boy 's teacher ever since the little lad have pass beyond the limit of don ambrogio 's modest attainment although she have resent the power of fra gianmarium over pierino she be proud of the confidence of the learn friar in she child already she begin to teach herself to accept pride in the place of the lowlier happier daily love she must learn to do without she face grow colder and more compose don ambrogio give she a nod of approval it _ be _ pierino the bare-legged beppo proclaim push he way between dignitary and elegant noble and take a position in wide-eyed astonishment in front of the pulpit where he could watch every movement of he quondam school-fellow whose word carry no meaning to he unlearned ear but he heart throb with sudden loyalty in see he comrade the center of such a festa beppo would stay and help he to get fair play if he should need it since it be well know that pierino could not fight for all he latin but the little fellow in robe and cowl have neither eye nor thought for he vast audience when he once gather courage to begin -- no memory for the pride of he teacher no perception of he mother 's yearning shrinking and timid as he be the first voicing of he own thought in he childish treble voice put he in presence of a problem and banish all other consciousness it be merely a question to be meet and answer and he wonderful reasoning faculty still every other emotion he voice grow positive as he thought assert itself he learning be a mystery but argument after argument be meet and conquer with the quote wisdom of unanswerable name one after another the great man leave the choir and come down into the area before the pulpit that they might lose nothing one after another the frarus choose out champion to confute the child-philosopher but he be arm on every side and the childish face the boyish manner and voice lend a wonderful charm to the word he utter which be not eloquent but absolutely dispassionate and reasonable and the fewest by which he might prove he claim again and again he audience forget themselves in murmur of applause rise beyond decorum and once into a storm of approbation then he timidity return he become self-conscious fumble with the white cowl that hang partly over he face forget that it be not a hat and gravely take it off in salute the next day it be proclaim on the piazza as a bit of news for the people of venice -- for which indeed those who have not witness the contest in the church of the frarus care little and understand nothing -- that in the philosophical contest which have take place between the friar of the frarus and the friar of the servus the victory have be win by fra paolo sarpus of the servus who have honorably triumph through he vast understanding of the wisdom of the father of the church this be also publish in the black frame beside the great door of the frarus and post upon the entrance to the church of the servus while in the refectory of the respective convent it form a theme of absorb interest the frarus discuss the possibility of childish mouthpiece for learn doctor miraculously conceal -- but low for fear of scandal the servus say it out for all to hear that it be a modern wonder of a child in the temple but fra gianmarium hush they and be afraid for often while he teach he come upon some new surprise for he perceive that the boy 's mind hold some hidden spring of knowledge which be to he unfathomable it be most wonderful he say one evening to fra giulio as they talk together in the cloister after vespers i solemnly declare that it have happen to I to ask he a question of which i verily know not the answer and he keep in quiet thought for some moment have so lucidly respond that he word have carry with they the conviction that he have make a discovery which i know not it be some lesson which don ambrogio have teach he not so -- for don ambrogio have little learning but paolo will cover we with honor in learn he be never weary yet have he a understanding greater than mine own and in docility he have no equal in he duty in the convent and in the church he be even more punctilious be it strange -- or be it well ask fra giulio with hesitation that in this year he have spend with we he ask not for he mother nor the little maid he sister nor seemeth to grieve for they for the boy be young nay answer fra gianmarium sternly it be no lack but a grace that have be grant he knowledge be a wonderful mystery fra giulio answer but softly to himself as he cross the cloister he add but love be sweet and the boy be very young the boy be kneel placidly before the crucifix in he cell when fra giulio go to give he he nightly benediction but the good friar 's heart be trouble with tenderness because of a vision that would not leave he of a hunger mother 's face ii many year later one of the great artist of venice wander about at sunset with a elusive vision of some wonderful picture stir impatience within he soul find a maiden sit under the vine-covered pergola of the traghetto san maurizio where she be wait for she brother-in-law who would presently touch at this ferry on he homeward way to murano a little child lay asleep in she arm he blond head which pity nature have keep beautiful rest against she breast the meager body be hide beneath the fold of she mantle which in the graceful fashion of those day pass over she head and fall below the knee she face very beautiful and tender be bent over the little sufferer who have forget he pain in the weariness it have bring he as a boon the delicate purple bell of the vine upon the trellis stir in the evening breeze make a shimmer of perfume and color about she like a suggestion of a aureole and in the arbor as in one of those homely shrine which everywhere make part of the venetian life she seem aloof as some ideal of a earlier christian age from the restless voluble group upon the tiny quay there be _ facchinus _ -- those doer of nondescript smallest service quarrel amiably to pass the time spring forward for custom as the gondola near the step _ gransierus _ -- the licensed traghetto beggar ragged and picturesque push past with they long crooked pole under pretence of draw the gondola to shore one or two woman from the island fill the moment with swift declamatory speech until the gondola of giambattista or of jacopo should close the colloquy a older peasant tranquilly kneel to the madonna of the traghetto amid the clatter while steam greasy odor from she housewifely basket of venetian dainty mount slowly like some travesty of incense and cloud the humble shrine two or three comer swell the group from the recess of the dark little shop behind for no other reason than that life be pleasant where so much be go on and some maiden into whose life a dawn romance be just creep confess it with a brighter color as she hang half-timidly she bunch of tinselled flower before the red lamp of the good little madonna of this _ traghetto benedetto _ whose gondolier be the bravest in all venice meanwhile the boatman come go or wait keep up a lively chatter and under the trellis as if far remove the sleep child and marina of murano bend over he a face glorified with its story of love and compassion be like a living rafaello the _ bambino _ be beautiful say the artist draw nearer but speak reverently for he know that he have find the face he have be seek for he madonna for the altar of the servus what doth he like you little one for i be a friend to the _ bambino _ and the _ poverina _ have pain to bear she be more beautiful still when she smile and the anxiety die out of she girlish face for a moment in gratitude for the sympathy eccellenza thanks she answer simply he have a beautiful face sometimes when he have flower in he little hand he smile and be quite still but the radiant look pass swiftly with the remembrance of the pain that would come to the child on waking and she kiss the tiny finger that lay over the edge of she mantle with a movement of irrepressible tenderness lapse at once into reverie while the artist full of the enthusiasm of creation stand dream of he picture this holy mother should be greater more compassionate nearer to the people than any madonna he have ever paint for never have he note in any face before such a passion of love and pity in that moment of stillness the sunset light intensify cast a glow about she the child half-waking stretch up he tiny hand and touch she cheek with a rare caress and the light in she face be a radiance never to be forget the veronese 's wonderful _ madonna del sorriso _ leap to instant life a _ smile _ full of the pathos of human suffering tender in comprehension perfect in faith -- this which this moment of inspiration have reveal to he would he paint for the consolation of those who should kneel before the altar of the servus she be busy with the child put he gently on the ground as a gondola approach he with he thought in intense realization fix the peculiar beauty of these sunset cloud in he artist memory as sole color-scheme of he picture for this grave sweet face with its pale fair tone and profusion of soft brown hair would not bear the vivid drapery that the veronese be wont to fashion -- the mantle must be a gray cloud pink flush with delicate sunset bordering where it sweep away to shroud the child the beauty of he creation should be in that smile of exquisite compassion and this wonderful sunset in which it should glow forever it be a rare moment with the veronese in which he seem lift above himself the revelation of the face have seize he translate he into the poetic atmosphere which he rarely attain the harmony of the vision be so perfect that they suffice for the over-sumptuousness of color and detail which be usually feature of he conception some one call impatiently from the gondola in rude quick tone and the artist wake from he reverie the maiden linger on the step for a word of adieu to this stranger who wish to give the little one pleasure but she dare not disturb he for he be some great signor -- so she interpret he dress and bearing -- and she be only a maiden of murano he be still under the spell of he great moment and he be in the presence of one who should help he to make it immortal he uncover he head with a motion of courtly deference he do not often assume as he start forward over the rough plank of the traghetto signora where shall i bring the flower to make the little one smile to murano near the stabilimento magagnatus eccellenza she answer without hesitation lift the baby in she arm to escape the rough help of the gondolier who reach forward to hasten he stumble movement and so they float off from the traghetto -- the madonna that be to be into the deepen twilight while the veronese a splendid and incongruous figure amid these lowly surroundings lean against the paltry column that support the shrine wrap in a delicious reverie of creation for he be unused to failure and he have no doubt though he have not yet proffer he request to-morrow he say i will paint that face \* \* \* \* \* by we lady of murano the gondolier cry suddenly he speak to thee like a queen -- and it be paolo cagliarus what do he want with thee not I piero it be the child he wish to give he flower i know he must be great to care thus for we ` bimbo ' it be really he -- the veronese the child santa marium he be not too much like a cherub that the great painter should notice he the baby throw out he little clenched fist strike against the protect arm that hold he closer he face draw with sudden pain for a moment he fight against marina and then the spasm over settle wearily to sleep in she arm poverino say the gondolier softly while marina croon over he a ave marium and the gondola glide noiselessly to its cadence piero she say look up with eye full of tear sometimes i think i can not bear it he need thy prayer as well as mine -- wilt thou not ask we lady of san donato to be kinder to he and i have see to-day on the rialto a beautiful lamp with angel ' head thou shouldst make a offering -- the gondolier shake he head and shrug he shoulder he have little faith or reverence i will say my aves _ poveriello _ he promise but the lamp be already too many in san donato and for the bambino i will go not only once but twice this year to confession -- the law of we traghetto ask not so much since once be enough but thou art even stricter with thy rule for I she do not answer and they float on in silence to-morrow say piero at length there be festa in san pietro di castello she move uneasily and she beautiful face lose its softness it be nothing to I she answer shortly it be a pretty festa and messer magagnatus should take thee by we lady of castello there be other who will go it would be better for the bambino he persist sullenly as she do not answer he he voice be not the pleasanter now that its positive tone be change to a coax one one be enough piero she say and for the festa of san pietro in castello -- never never name it to I santa maria she companion ejaculate under he breath it be the woman the gentle _ donzelle _ who be hard he stand tall handsome well-made sway lightly with the motion of the gondola which seem to float as in a dream to the ripple and lap of the water the blue of he shirt have change to gray in the twilight the black cap and sash of the nicolottus accentuate the line of the strong lithe figure as he spring forward on the sloping foot-rest of he gondola with that perfect grace and ease which prove he master of a craft whose every motion be a harmony if he be proud of belong to the nicolottus that most powerful faction of the populace he know that they be regard by the government as the aristocrat of the people marina arrange the child 's cover in silence and stoop she face wistfully to touch he cheek but she do not turn she head to look at the man behind she l'amor zè fato per chus lo sa fare he sing in the low slow chant of the familiar folk-song the rhythm blend perfectly with the movement of the boat in which these two be fare he voice be pleasanter in singing and song be almost a needful expression of the content of motion in venice -- the necessary complement of life to the gondolier a song might mean nothing more but piero sing more slowly than he wont charge the word with meaning yet it do not soften she love be for he who know how to win he could not see how she flush and pale with anger as he sing for it be grow dark over the water and she face be turn from he but she straighten herself uncompromisingly and he be watch with subtle comprehension he could not have tell why he persist in this strange woo for there have be but one response during the two year of he widowhood while he child have be marina 's ceaseless care marina have love the baby the more passionately perhaps for the sake of she only sister toinetta piero 's child-bride who have die at the baby 's birth because she be painfully conscious that toinetta 's little flippant life have need much forgiveness and have be crown with little gladness marina be now the only child of messer girolamo magagnatus which be a patent of nobility in murano and she be not the less worth win because she hold herself aloof from the freer life of the piazza where she be call the donzel of murano though there be other with blacker eye and redder cheek piero do not think she very beautiful he like more color and sparkle and quickness of retort -- a chance to quarrel and forgive he be not in sympathy with so many ave such continual pilgrimage to the cathedral such brooding over the life of the saint -- above all he do not like be keep in order and marina know well how to do this in spite of she quiet way but he like the best for himself and there be no one like marina in all murano during all this time he have be come more and more under she sway change he mode of live to suit she whim and the only way of safety for he be to marry she and be master then she should see how he would rule he house he own way have always be the right way for he -- rule of all order to the contrary -- whether he have be a wander gondolier a despise _ barcariol toso _ lord it so outrageously over the established traghettus that they be glad to forgive he he bandit crime and swear he into membership if only to stop he influence against they or whether it have be the steal away of a promise bride as on that memorable day at san pietro in castello when he have marry toinetta -- it be never safe to bear vendetta with one so strong and handsome and unprincipled as piero gabriele the jilt lover of toinetta over whom piero have triumph soon become the husband of another _ donzel _ handsomer than toinetta have be -- poor foolish toinetta -- and the retributive tragedy of she little life have warm the sullen gabriele into a magnanimity that render he at least a safe if a moody and unpleasant member of the traghetto in which piero have since become a rise star a man with a home to keep may not cast away he chestnut and so when piero in that masterful way of he sweep everything before he in the traghetto -- never ask nor care who stand for he or against he but carry he will whenever he choose to declare it -- to set one 's self against such a man be truly a useless sort of fret only a gnawing of one 's chain in the expressive jargon of the people piero finish he song and there be a little pause they be near the long low line of murano it be not easy he say when woman be in the way ` to touch the sky with one 's finger ' she turn with a sudden passionate motion as if she would answer he and then struggle for control turn back without a word draw the child closer and caress he until she be calm again when she raise she head she speak in a resolute restrained voice since thou wilt have it piero -- listen and rest thine oar for we be almost home and to-night must be quite the end of all this talk it can never be thou hast no understanding of such matter so i forgive thee for myself but for toinetta -- i do not think i ever can forgive thee may the good madonna help I there be two in every marriage piero retort sullenly for he be angry now it be just that -- oh it be just that marina cry clasp she hand passionately thou art so strong and so compelling and thou dost not stop for the right of it she be such a child she know no better poverina and thou -- a man -- not for love nor right nor any noble thing -- the word come with repress scorn -- to coax she to it just for a little triumph to expose a child to such endless _ critica _ only a venetian of the people could comprehend the full sting of this word which convey the search persistent disapproval of a entire class whose code if view from the moral point of view be painfully slack though from its own standard of decorum it be immutable it have be say once for all -- thou dost not forgive it be the last time for this also piero i mean never to speak of it again but those word of thine of the festa in san pietro in castello make I forget it come over I quite suddenly that this be how thou spendest the beautiful great strength god give thee to make a leader of thee in real thing but whether it be great or small or good or ill thou always wilt have thy way it be a poor fool of a fellow that would not keep himself uppermost like oil he cry hesitate only for a moment between anger and gratification and choose the way that minister to he pride santa marium i 'll butter thy macaroni with fine cheese every time nay spare thy pain piero and be serious for one moment there be no _ barcariol _ in all venice who have greater opportunity but thou must use they well they spoil thee at the traghetto and if a man have he will always it will either spoil he or make he noble what wouldst thou have I to do he question sullenly they would be afraid of thee -- thou couldst quiet these trouble in the traghettus -- thou must use thy strength and thy will for the good of the people it be terrible to have power and to use it wrongly piero move back to he place again and take up he oar throw himself in position for a forward stroke forget not he say poise that i need not listen to thee if i do not choose i may not stay _ in casa _ magagnati -- not any more if thou art always scold i shall scold -- always -- until thou dost quiet this disorder of the traghettus she answer undaunted and thou wilt return for there be always the bambino if i come back he say in a softer tone respond to the appeal for he child i must speak of what i will of all but one thing piero for it be not possible to misunderstand he and she be resolute if this be not the end i shall speak with my father -- and the bambino -- they be both silent he know that no one could ever care for he invalid child as she have do and all that he owe she and must continue to owe she restrained he under she chiding for the baby could not live away from she sometimes too there be moment of strange tenderness within he for this helpless suffering morsel of humanity that call he babbo he do not know what might happen if the wrath of the redoubtable magagnatus be to be invoke against he for this quarrel could not be dispose of as those small matter with the gondolier have invariably be so far from threaten this before marina have hitherto shield piero in she unanswerable way from everything that might hasten the rupture that seem always impending between these two dissimilar nature and messer magagnatus have two thought only he daughter and he _ stabilimento _ -- the great glass furnace which be the pride of venice piero have no suspicion that marina always touch the best that be in he he think she make he weaker and it be not easy to yield the point that have become a habit no one else have ever move he from any purpose but now he perceive that there would be no reversal of that sentence -- that he should continue to come to see he child and that he must continue to submit to marina 's influence it be she who have in some unaccountable way persuade he out of he unlawful trade of _ barcariol toso _ and have force he reluctant acceptance of the overture that be make to he from the guild of santa marium zobenigo where he have rise to be one of the _ bancalus _ or governor he quality of force and daring make he useful in this age when lawlessness be on the increase he be begin to feel a sense of satisfaction not all barbaric in the position he have win among man who have some view of order and to perceive that there might be a lawful use almost as pleasant for those very attribute which have render he so formidable a foe outside the pale of traghetto civilization _ ecco _ he announce with a slow sullen emphasis which declare he unwilling surrender while he ply he oar with quick wrathful stroke it will take more than ave to make a saint of thee and thou mayst hold thy head too high look for better than wheaten bread but i be not the man to wear a curb nor to put up with thorn where i look for rose thou hast no right to mind what chance to I -- yet thou hast make I give up the old life because i know thou couldst do better see where thou standest to-day it be not a little thing to be a governor of the nicolottus it be a truth piero confess upside down and not to boast of for whoever try it would wish it less the bancalus be ` like ass who carry wine and drink water ' for the good of the clout in day like these i hear they talk to-day piero the _ barcariolus tosus _ be worse than turk one must pay to suit they whim in the middle of the canal grande or one may wait long for the landing and there be a scandal about a friar of san zanipolo of whom they have ask a fare for the cross i know not the truth of it and at santa sofia the great cross with the beautiful golden lustre be go and one say it be the ` tosus ' piero wince for to a ancient toso or even to a bancalo of to-day such enormity have not the exciting novelty that might have be expect and marina have a curious habit of seem entirely to forget he past when she wish to exact he best of he and gabriele -- fash not thyself for a man of he measure that be fitter to ` beat the fish ' like a galley-slave than to serve a honest gondola piero interrupted scornfully but piero gabriele have sell he license to one worse than he and there be great talk of quarrel along the riva and how that yesterday they send for padre gervasio from san gregorio to bring the host to quiet they ah the castellanus say piero with the contempt that be always ready for any mention of this great rival faction of the people whose division into one or other of these faction be absolute but the nicolottus have they scandal also marina assert uncompromisingly among themselves it be tell they break the law like man not bind by vow some say there will be a appeal to the consiglio nay say piero with a ominous frown the _ bancalus _ and _ gastaldus _ be enough we need no bossing by crimson robe this question of the traghettus and they abuse have lately grow to large proportion among the people and it possess a deep interest for all class quite apart from the antiquity and picturesqueness of these honorable institution of the republic -- since all must use the ferry and wish for safety in they water-street for century these confraternity of gondolier who preside over the ferry or traghettus of venice have be corporation self-govern with officer and endowment recognize by the republic and with a standard of gondolier moral admirably define in they code -- those mariegole which be luxuriously bind and print with capital of vermilion a page here and there glowing like a illuminate missal with the legend of the patron saint of the traghetto wherein one might read such admonition as would make all man wiser but of late there have be much unruliness among the younger member of the traghettus and a grow inability among they officer to cope with increase difficulty because of these barcariolus tosus who live in open rebellion against this goodly system of law poach upon the dearly buy rights of the traghetto gondolier yet escape all tax and because of the abuse which have be gradually undermine the fair reputation of the established order of the traghettus the republic by slow encroachment upon ancient concession be surely reduce they wealth and independence santa marium piero ejaculate after a pause during which he wrath have be grow the consiglio have its own matter for rule the traghettus belong to the people they have reach the little landing of the first long waterway of murano where one of the low arcaded house with its slender shaft of red verona marble be the dwelling of girolamo magagnatus the other of this little block of three be use as show-room and office for the great establishment which be connect with they in the rear by small courtyard and the dense smoke of the glass factory always rest over they although this be the quarter of the aristocrat of murano the building look low and modest if measure by the palace of the greater city and they massive marble door - and window-frame increase the impression of gloom but here and there a portal more ornate with treble-twisted cord deeply carve or a window of fourteenth century workmanship relieve the severity of the line while in this short arcade where the house rise but a storey in height above the square pillar which support the overhang front these unexpected column of rosy marble delicate and unique on which the window seem to rest give singular distinction to these dwelling often the people pass in gondola or bark glance carelessly into the depth of the open window space frame between those polish marble shaft for the familiar vision of a wonderful young face beautiful as a madonna from some high altar in venice often too this vision of a maiden bent above a child with rare golden hair and great eye full of pain there be a little linger on the landing as they leave the gondola for the baby wake from he long refreshing sleep have claim he share of petting before the great dark man who toss he so restfully in he strong arm go away there be no one who could make the little zuane laugh like babbo though the tremulous treble echo of the full tone of the gondolier have a pathos for those who listen iii the little zuane have eat he supper of _ polenta _ and in the paint cradle which he grandfather girolamo have buy for he from under the arcade of the piazetta lay at last asleep consign to the care of all those saint and guardian angel who make the little one they charge and who smile down upon he from the golden aureole and cloud of rose and blue on the cradle-roof while slowly balance it charm he into dream and now at she window marina have the night and the star to herself over the still lagoon and down in its mirroring depth it be a sad little tale soon tell this tragedy of toinetta which have seem so great to the dweller in that home three year ago a pretty wilful child of fifteen who have grow up impatient of all needful home restraint finding rebellion easier because there be no mother to control she -- with a love of motion color sunshine sound and laughter that make she a ariel of venice as full of frolic as a kitten and as irresponsible choosing in she latest caprice one from the many lover who be ready for the woo with the seriousness with which she would have choose a partner for a festa since to-morrow if something else seem better this lover also could be change but the opposition of the grave father and sister make they consent the better worth win and set the youthful gabriele in a more attractive light so the betrothal have be duly make in the presence of the numerous circle of friend and relative who stand as witness at a betrothal feast in this city of the sea and who be as ready with they smile and they felicitation for any event in the home life of the quarter as they would be wither in they criticism should there be any failure of complete fulfilment of those traditional observance which be imperative in venice thus the boy and girl be _ spoza _ and _ novizio _ wait the fuller bond in all that pretty interchange of token so faithfully prescribe in venetian circle of every degree but the period have be one of quarrel and forgiveness of falling away from and return to favor as might have be expect from two capricious foolish child to make part of the pretty pageant of the bride of venice which take place on lady day in san pietro in castello the maiden all in white with float hair they dower-box fasten by ribbon from they shoulder have seem to toinetta as she stand each year a onlooker in the admire crowd a happiness devoutly to be desire the custom be a survival of a earlier time fast lose favor with the better class of the people but to toinetta its dramatic possibility hold a greater fascination than the more sober ceremonial of the usual wedding service and all persuasion to the contrary when the procession gather in san pietro in castello toinetta with flush cheek and sparkling eye be one of the twelve maiden marina look on with offended eye she father consent yet only half-convinced atone for this lessen of the family dignity by the elegance of the feast he have provide and all permit bravery in the gondola that be wait to take they thence the up and downs of she childish courtship have culminate in more tear and jealousy than usual on the previous day but these be secret between the lover and quite unguessed by father or sister but when the wedding oration have be preach over those twelve bridal pair and the wedding benediction have be grant it be _ not _ gabriele the boyish betrothed of toinetta who bring the blush bride partly in triumph and partly in pique to she father 's side but piero salin the handsomest gondolier on the lagoon the most daring and dreaded foe of all the established traghettus it have be impossible for the spectator from the body of the church to follow closely the movement of the twelve white-robed maiden with they attendant swain while the ceremony be progress in the dim recess of the choir and the surprise and dishonor this unexpected _ dénouement _ bring upon the home be nothing to the unhappiness in store for the childish bride whose latest and wildest freak bring neither wisdom for self-discipline nor power to endure that relentless criticism which cease only when a little one lay in the place of the child-mother who have be too weak to cope with the worry of the year that have follow upon that unhappy day in san pietro the jilt gabriele have accept the situation with a parade of philosophical scorn which remove he beyond the pale of the sympathy marina would have offer he and marina -- whose exquisite sense of truth decorum and duty have be outrage to a degree beyond toinetta 's comprehension -- forget it all in the overwhelming compassion with which she take she little sister in she arm and try to help she live she difficult life she realize as only a large nature could that love be the only hope for this emergency and feeding on she measureless compassion love the diviner faculty grow to be a power slowly and very dimly she have help the young wife to some vague comprehension of the duty she have so rashly assume hitherto for toinetta there have be no difficulty and now there be so many she be frightened and do not understand now when piero scold at she tear or temper she could not run away nor change he for a pleasanter companion and she know no other way to manage such a difficulty and there be no pleasure in the piazza because of that eternal critica there be triumph still in a _ canalazzo _ for piero be so handsome and so strong and in the gondola on the canal grande one could not hear the talking -- besides venice be not murano but in the home the old friend come no more and life be very sad -- quite other than it use to be even she father who trace the disgrace that have come upon he house to he over-indulgence be now proportionately severe and to he stern sense of honor the lawless son-in-law be a most unwelcome guest through that slow year of toinetta 's life marina be the veritable angel in the house not conscious of any self-sacrifice but only of live intensely make the living under the same roof possible for these two strong man who look at life from such different standpoint soothing the wounded pride of she father by she perfect sympathy while strive to rouse piero to nobler ideal and now that it be all over -- be it all over -- there lay the poor little zuane and piero over the water at he traghetto be a great care but he should do he best yet for the people a deep voice with a ring of wistfulness come through the darkness : doth he not sleep yet the little zuane the evening have be long and i have somewhat to show thee i come my father she answer very tenderly as she follow he through the narrow dark corridor into a large chamber which serve as a private office but where the father and daughter often sit alone in the evening for here girolamo keep many design and papers relate to he work and they often discuss he plan together he unlock a old carve cabinet and bring out a roll of parchment spread they upon the table and explain : i could not leave they while i go to call thee for it be a order from the senate -- thou see ` st the seal -- and a copy of the letter of the ambassador of the republic to the levant with this fold therein -- truly a curious scheme of color but very rich and the line be somewhat uneven what thinkest thou of the design the outline be good she answer after a careful scrutiny for she have be train in copy he best design this be a pattern furnish by the grand vizier of the sultan for a mosque lamp of a peculiar shape work over with verse from the koran in various color enamel the outline be well but the color -- mayst thou not change this yellow there be too much of it nay for the color have a meaning methink this yellow be they sacred color but the text be fine the broken line of the character have a charm and the scroll relieve the surface make semblance of shadow yet i will make thee a prettier one for thine own chamber with some thought of thy choose she look up at he with shine eye they trouble combate and bear together have bring they very near to one another i have often wish for a lamp with the color soft like moonlight and the design shall be of thine own hand and the verse upon it shall be a ave and in it there shall be always a light it shall be a prayer for the little one she say in quick response the senate wish thee to make a lamp of this design i have see none like it nay not one there will be nine hundred for the decoration of a mosque and girolamo 's eye sparkle with triumph it be not that it be difficult he explain for marina 's eye wander from she father 's face to the design with some astonishment it be even simple for we but when the levant send to venice for these sacred lamp for she own temple it be she acknowledgment that we have surpass we teacher it be a glory for we father i think the glass of venice be even all we own marina exclaim in a tone of disappointment i know not that we art have come from the east to we some say that it be bear here ay some but thou shouldst know the story of thy venice better my daughter girolamo answer gravely for to he every detail connect with he art be of vital import there may be some who say this but not thou in the time of orseolo the mosaic be bring from the levant for we old san marco thus come the knowledge to we in those early day but now there be no longer any country that share it equally with venice for elsewhere they know not the art in its fineness these when they be finish shall be send as a gift from the republic it be so write in this order from the senate when come it to thee to-day with much ceremony it be deliver into mine own hand by one of the secretary of the ten for see ` st thou marina it be a mark of rare favor that they have trust this parchment with I and have not bring I into they presence to make copy of it in the palace if thou couldst lend I thy deft finger -- surely she answer smile up at he he be stand over she with one hand on she shoulder he rest the other lightly on she hair look down into she eye for a moment with a caress still and tender after he own grave fashion it will be safer so he say folding the parchment and the letter carefully and lock they away in he cabinet and to-morrow marina -- for they have grant I but one day the chamber in which they sit be wainscote with heavy carve woodwork stain black and every panel be a drawer with a curiously work lock contain some design or some order for the house of magagnatus and these archive be precious not only for the stabilimento and girolamo the master but they would be treasured by the republic as state papers represent the highest attainment in this exquisite venetian industry which the government hold in such esteem that for a century past one of the chief of the council of ten have be appoint as inspector and supervisor of the manufactory for further security the senate have declare severest penalty against any betrayal of the secret of the trade -- a form of protection not quite needless since the ambassador of he most christian majesty have form a species of secret police with no other object than to bribe the glass-maker and extract from they the lucrative secret which form no part of the courtesy that be interchange between france and the republic the large low table black and polish like teak-wood upon which they have be examine the vizier 's design be light by a lamp of work iron swing low by fanciful chain from the high ceiling make a center of dense yellow flame from which the shadow ray off into the gloom of the farther portion of the room and a charming picture of father and daughter be outline against the vague darkness another lamp fix against a plate of burnish brass cast a reflection that be almost brilliant upon the glory of this chamber -- a high central cabinet of the same dark carve framework with a back of those wonderful mirror plate so recently bring to perfection by another stabilimento of which the good girolamo be almost jealous although against this luminous background the exquisite fabrication of the house of magagnatus reflect they wonderful shape and color in increase beauty not yet have any plate of clear glass fine enough for the display of such a cabinet be realize though it sometimes seem to girolamo that such a time be very near but the solid door of wood with ponderous brass lock and hinge stand open and the inner silk curtain which protect these treasure from dust be always draw aside by marina 's own hand when these evening lamp be light they be so beautiful to see if they but raise they eye the very consciousness of they gleam be sometimes a inspiration to girolamo and at this hour they be quite safe for the work day be over and no one enter this sanctum save by invitation girolamo magagnatus pride himself on be a venetian of the people and it be true that no member of he family have ever sit in the consiglio but in few of the patrician home of venice could more of what be then count among the comfort of life have be find than in this less sumptuous house of murano while its luxury be all such as centered about he art he be one of the magnate of he island for he furnace be among the most famous of murano and to he belong secret of the craft in he special field to which no other have yet attain while in a degree that would scarcely have be esteem by the merchant prince of venice who sit in the consiglio they have bring he wealth and repute but to he whose heart be in he work it be power and glory that suffice no stranger whom it be desire to honor come to venice but be conduct with a ceremony that be flattering while it be also a due precaution against too curious question through the show-room of the factory of murano and often in this chamber have gather a group of man whom the world call great lead by that special chief of the ten who be then in power at murano to see the treasure of this cabinet of which girolamo be justly proud this first bit of the wonderful coloring which glow and flash when the light shot through it as if some living fire be catch in its heart or that curious tortured shape with its dragon-eye of jewel and its tongue forever thrust at you some secret which it almost utter yet withhold this fragment of tenderest opalescence which be of no color yet blend all as if a shower of petal be blow across a rainbow in spring that one -- frost in silver and gold -- pink with the yellow sunshine in its core here the aquamarine lucent as venice 's own sea and here thron in regal state in its quaint case of fade azure velvet be that very masterpiece of the glass-worker of murano which be carry in the first solemn procession of all the art at a doge 's triumph in the thirteenth century its very possession be a patent of nobility in girolamo 's reverent esteem and the most gracious letter of the senate confer upon this piece of glass the distinction of first mention among all that be show upon that day of triumph be here also -- a yellowed parchment carefully inclose in the little morocco case securely screw to the shelf beneath and marina have be present when it be open for some rare visitor it be a relic of those earlier day when there be no furnace in murano though many of the finest worker come from this island and belong to the corporation of the worker on rialto and it be almost a prehistoric record of greatness marina have leave the table and go to the cabinet she father follow she this i would show thee he say call she attention to a whimsical shape blow and twist almost into foam this lorenzo stino bring I only yesterday he be full of genius i think none have a quicker hand nor a more inventive faculty i have watch he in he work he scan she eagerly as he speak yes it be fanciful -- wonderful she add to please he but without warmth while she eye wander over the shelf oh father here be some of the very mosaic that be make for san marco thou hast forget she lift eagerly a small opaque basin of turquoise blue and hold it toward he it contain a few bit of gold and silver enamel the earliest that have be make in venice bear they ancient date thou askest more of venice than i he say well please with she enthusiasm but have a care lest they say i have not teach thee well or that i do not know my art or that i claim too much at the time of the burning of san marco these mosaic for the restoration be from the stabilimentus of the republic on rialto -- so early it come to we this glorious art and it be one piero a founder of we house though the name be other than magagnatus who be the master in that restoration but the first mosaic in that old san marco -- ay and the workman he add with a conscious effort so much would he have like to claim the invention for venice come hither from the east thou shouldst know the history of we art it be the story of thine ancestry and the nobility of thy house thou hast no other i have thee my father iv the veronese do not paint that beautiful face the next morning as he have plan for the first time he have encounter difficulty slowly as he wend he way through the many turning of the narrow calle to campo san maurizio carry a beautiful moorish box fill with the pearly shell which the venetian call flower of the lido and a bouquet of aromatic carnation for the bambino he recall the figure and speech of he madonna and they be not those of the maiden whom one might encounter at the traghetto or in the piazza there have be a dignity and self-forgetfulness in such perfect harmony with the face that at the moment this have seem entirely natural but the tone return to he as he ponder fill with a deeper melody than the usual win speech of the venetian with the grace of the soft dialect there be a rare unexpected quality as if think have form the undertone he have never hear such a voice in the piazza -- it be rare even in the palazzo it be the voice of some sweet and gracious woman with a soul too large for the world it hold a suggestion of peace and convent bell and even-song of nun then still more passionately the desire overcome he to paint that face for he madonna he would never give it up yet this maiden be not one of whom he could ask the favor that he crave nor to whom he could offer any return he have come to san maurizio to take a gondola from the traghetto partly that he might be free to wander without comment wherever he search should lead partly because he be always ready for a chat with the people they experience interested he and he himself belong by he artist life as by he sympathy to all class perhaps too he have be move with a vague hope that he might find the face he be seek for he be use to fortunate happening but there be no wait madonna under the pergola and the air of the early spring morning blow chill from the lido almost with a intimation of failure to he sensitive mood he push aside a old _ gransiere _ without the gift of small coin that usually flow so easily from he hand for service render or unrendered as he impatiently question the gondolier one who know murano well he call there be a instant response from a old man almost past traghetto service but he age and probable garrulity commend he i will take thee and thy gondola since thou knowest murano say the artist kindly but i must go swiftly and i would not tax thee thou shalt have thy fare but i will pay for another gondolier also from the traghetto he must be young and lusty choose thou he -- and hasten there be a babel of voice and a self-gratulatory proffer of lithe form while the old gondolier turn undecidedly from one to another and the totter gransiere ostentatiously protect the velvet mantle of the artist as he spring into the boat with a impatient gesture the veronese indicate he choice and they be soon on they way come hither _ vecchio mio _ and rest thine old bone let the young one work for we both the padrone command as he fling himself down among the cushion do they treat thee well at thy traghetto eccellenza yes but i be scarce older than the other it be the young one who make we trouble they keep not the mariegole and it be only the old one may depend upon _ davvero _ the world be change then it use to be good to be young eccellenza yes when i myself be not old and he excellency also have no beard if age and wisdom might be trade for the time of youthful prank say the veronese with twinkling eye i doubt if there be wisdom enough leave in venice to cavil at the barter yet thou and i have wisdom thrust upon we by these same beard if trouble come to thee or too soon they put thee at the gransiere service we will remember this day pass together eccellenza thanks the gransiere have not much beside he beard to keep he warm and the time draw near the old man answer with pleasant venetian insouciance tell I say the veronese turn to the younger man why do you young fellow make venice ring with you scandal you be cut off you own ` liberty ' yes signore the gondolier hesitate glance doubtfully at the artist 's sumptuous attire which might have indicate a state much greater than he keep for the veronese be famed throughout venice in quarter where he be better know for a unfailing splendor of costume which would have make he at all time a model for the picture he love to paint recently for bad conduct the gondolier have be gradually forfeit they licens or liberty as they be call in venice and the thought cross the young fellow 's mind that this splendid stranger be possibly one of those government official who be charge with the supervision of the confraternity of the traghettus it be the first time i have the honor of conduct he excellency he be perhaps of the provveditorus al comun these official collect the government tax and be view with jealous eye by the gondolier nay i be paolo cagliarus i belong to a better craft but please thyself for there be much talk of this matter signora one must live the young fellow exclaim with a friendly shrug of he shoulder and a gleam of he white tooth for it be easy to make friend with the genial artist and between the governor and the _ provveditorus _ one may scarce draw breath one 's bread and onion -- he add with a dramatic gesture of self-pity it be not much to ask _ altro _ nonsense the veronese exclaimed laughing for the gondolier look little like one who be suffer from hunger as he stand sway in keen enjoyment of the motion which show he prowess of the wind as it sweep he bronzed cheek of the talk which permit he to exploit he grievance there be the high mass twice in the month there be the low mass -- every Monday if you will believe I there be the priest _ for nothing _ -- santa marium they be not few the first fare in the day -- always for the madonna of the traghetto this _ maledetto _ fare of the madonna suffice for the madonna 's oil i ask you ebbene non there be the fine -- and these it must be confess might be fewer for the saint be tire of keep we out of mischief and little there be for one 's own madonna if one would make gift this then for thine own madonna say the artist pleasantly toss he a considerable coin and may she make thee wiser for by thine inventory which it doth not harm thee to rehearse thou hast a good memory eccellenza there be more if you be not weary there be the government tax it take long to gather -- ask the _ gastaldo _ there be the soldier for the navy how many good man do that leave for the traghetto service and a license be not little to buy for a poor barcariol who would be he own man one pay three hundred _ lira _ -- not less do it drop into one 's hand with the first fare one must belong to the guild -- it be less robbery but for you gastaldo you great man for he it be much honor -- eccellenza believe it not if the tax be not there for the provveditorus it be the gastaldo who pay when the money be little it be the gastaldo who pay much and the toso -- all he fault blame on the traghettus ah signora for the gondolier it be a life -- santa marium he throw up he hand with a feint of be at a loss to convey its hardship _ come non c ' è altro _ say the veronese laughing there be none like it ebbene -- va bene the gondolier confess join heartily in the merriment he grievance which be nevertheless a real one infinitely lessen by confession suddenly the old man rise and bow he head and both gondolier cross themselves the veronese also bare he head and make the sign of reverence for they be pass the island of san michele toward which a mournful procession of boat each with its torch and its banner of black be slowly glide while back over the water echo the dirge from those sob cello here where only the dead be sleep the sky be as blue and the sea as calm as if sorrow have never be bear in the world before they murano low-lying scatter be close at hand the smoke of its daily activity tremulous over it dim the beauty of sky and sea he excellency know murano the duomo with its mosaic wonderful there be none like they and it be old -- ` ma antica ' and the stabilimentus -- it be glory enough for one island ah the padrone wish to visit the stabilimento magagnatus paolo cagliarus have not know what he would do until the old man 's suggestion seem to make he vision less vaguely inaccessible and before they reach the landing he have learn by a judicious indifference which sharpen he companion 's loquacity that messer girolamo live there alone with he daughter who go about always with a bambino in she arm -- the child of a dead sister there could be no doubt yet to keep the old man talk he put the question she be very beautiful the donzellum eccellenza -- with a pause and deprecatory movement of the shoulder -- _ cosus _ -- so-so -- a little pale -- like a saint -- devote for the poor good _ gentile _ the donzel of messer girolamo _ bellum _ with rosy color _ non _ with the venetian there could be no sharp distinction between the decorative and the fine art as the fine art be employ by they without limit in they sumptuous decoration and that which elsewhere would have be merely decorative they raise by exquisite quality and finish to a point which deserve to be term art without qualification the veronese who have be knight by the doge could scarcely go unrecognized to any art establishment in any quarter of venice and with unconcealed pleasure girolamo bow low before this master who have come to do he honor display all that the initiate would hold most precious among he treasure -- that design fade and dim almost unrecognizable of those early mosaic of the master pietro -- he hold nothing back it be a day of honor for he house and the two be alone in he cabinet the veronese have a gift of sympathy he heart open to those who love art and have conquer difficulty in she service and the talk flow freely i believe he say as together they lay away the parchment that in we modern mosaic we should keep to the massive line of these earlier model -- greater dignity and simplicity in outline and color it be a mistake to attempt to confound this art with painting it be good then for we art messer cavalière that at san donato we mother church we workman of murano have we lady in that old byzantine type there be none earlier -- nor in all venice more perfect of its time -- and the setting be of marvelous richness and delicacy it be most interesting say the veronese sometimes a question have come to I if a artist can not do the _ all _ be he most the artist who stop below he limitation or beyond it a question of the earlier hint or the later realization between the mosaic and the painting perhaps girolamo question greatly interested nay not between the art but of that which be possible to each it be not a venetian question here all be warmth color beauty joy here art be the expression of redundancy -- it have lose its symbolism i know only venice -- the greek and the venetian type but i have hear that the michelangelo be in himself a type he be a prophet the veronese answer reverently like the great florentine -- a seer of vision but at rome only one understand why he be bear he be a maker create mighty meaning under formlessness he great shape seem each a mystery wrestling with a message i have think there be none who equal he in form -- that he be even as a sculptor in he painting and it be even so when i spake of ` formlessness ' it be not the less but the more as if _ before the vision have take mortal shape he be greater than man see they as spirit _ never before have i talk with one who know this master say girolamo and it be a feast nay i know he not for it be not easy to get speech with he nor a favor a young man might crave but once i see he at he work in san pietro where he work most furiously and would take no payment -- ` for the good of he soul ' he say that he might end he life with a pious work the night be come on and already he candle be fasten to he hat that he might lose no time they have bring he a little bread and wine for he evening meal for often he go not home when the mood of work possess he and beside he be a writing of the man savonarolum -- this and the holy evangel and the ` inferno ' fashion he thought he live not long after that for we be still in rome when they make for he that great funeral in santa croce of florence the rumor of which be dear to artist heart he be great and lonely and he know no joy there have be none like he and the tintoretto at santa marium dell ' orto he too be a _ furioso _ wonderful in form -- and the michelangelo have not the coloring of we jacopo but the terror of the tintoretto be very terrible and very human the michelangelo fill a great gloom with phantasm -- they question -- and one can not escape it have be a morning of delight girolamo say with grave courtesy when the talk have come to a end i thank the master for this honor nay answer the knightly veronese it be i who have receive and more yet more would i ask i know not if in this chamber of treasure i may leave the trifle which i come to bring for the bambino he add with hesitation as he place upon the table he little inlaid box of bauble and he bunch of spicy flower yet it be a promise and while girolamo listen in astonishment he tell abruptly the story of he meeting with marina and the little one unconsciously weave he thought into such a picture as he talk that girolamo recognize the inspiration and be already win to plead he cause this continue the artist unfold a letter be the order which have be send I by fra paolo sarpus of the convent of the servus a man most wise and of high repute in venice ` the face ' this learn friar sayeth ` must be full of consolation and one to awaken holy thought and i be not a artist ' -lrb- which because he be greater than so many of he craft he have the grace to acknowledge -rrb- ` have no other word to say save that it shall be noble and most spiritual as befitteth we religion ' and such a face till now messer girolamo magagnatus -- so beautiful and holy -- i have not find but now it be a vision send to I from heaven quite other than any picture i have ever dream and i will paint no other for this madonna of the servus i also like the angelo would give my holiest work for the good of my soul for the day of man be number though he blood be warm in he vein like wine it would be a pious act for the maiden and if she will most graciously consent the picture shall be a offering for the altar of the chapel of consolation in the servus i will ask she say the father simply and feel no surprise at what he have grant when he be leave alone with he thought for paolo cagliarus because of a way he have that man could not resist already seem to he a friend for the rare mingling of knightly grace and artistic enthusiasm overcome spasmodically the usual assertiveness of he demeanor seem at such moment to mean more than when assume by those who be never passionate nor brusque and he very incongruity hold a fascination for he friend v marina come often to the studio of the veronese in san samuele while the _ madonna del sorriso _ grow slowly into life it be not that most perfect life of which the artist have dream for hitherto beauty have suffice to he and he have never seek to burden he creation with question of the soul but now the sadness of the unattainable that be grow within he look out of the wonderful eye of the maiden on he canvas yet he toss he brush aside in discontent she smile eludeth I though it have the candor of a child 's the master cry within he studio he pupil come and go some earnest to follow in the footstep of the master absorb in they task other golden youth paint a little because art be beautiful -- not overcome in the inner chamber which be the artist 's sanctum be only the veronese and he brother benedetto at work he brother who be architect and sculptor too be put in the background of a elaborate palace in a fine venetian group upon which paolo work when not occupy with he madonna and a favorite pupil the young nobleman marcantonio giustinianus be in attendance upon the master the lovely girlish face of a spiritual type rare in venice seem to the young patrician more beautiful than that of any of the noble smile lady who be wait to be win by he and in those hour of blissful service he too make a study -- crude and inartistic thy hand have yet to learn its cunning the master say as in much confusion one morning when they be quite alone he pupil reveal he roughly execute head yet thou hast paint the soul the heart have do it signorino mio for thou art not yet a artist there be no other lady for marcantonio giustinianus yet she come not of a noble house she make it noble cry the young fellow flushing hotly for she be like she face ay for I and thee she be noble say the veronese compassionately for he love the boy but for the noble senator thy father -- of the council of the ten -- he will not find this maiden 's name in the ` libro d'oro ' i be sorry for thee master cry marcantonio imploringly art thou with I verily but i can do naught for thee listen then one day the noble shall find that name inscribe in the ` libro d'oro ' it shall be there for mine shall suffice the master answer nothing but bend over the sketch which he pupil have make he caress it here and there with loving touch of he magic brush while the young nobleman pour forth he vehement speech forget to watch the master 's finger once in the annals of the republic there be note such a marriage a daughter of murano of the house of beroviero -- nay not so beautiful as marina -- wed with one of we noblest name and the child by decree of the senate be write every one in the ` libro d'oro ' _ this _ have i do for thee say the master move away from the sketch and disclose it to the young fellow who gaze at it in silent amazement only the eye have i not touch the veronese explain for thou hast make they more soulful than even unto I they seem and thus have i read thy secret maestro mio cry marcantonio at length in ecstasy none among we may learn the marvel of thine art i have but touch thy sketch with the power that mine art could give the master answer well pleased yet it be thou who hast read the secret of the face that be not reveal to I we be speak of the ` libro d'oro ' the young patrician interrupted eagerly it may be so i know not the veronese answer indifferently for he himself be not write in that noble chronicle my art deal little with these cumbrous record of the republic thou art wrong to scorn they caro maestro for in they be chronicle the glory of venice the say doeth honor -- from a pupil to he master the artist burst forth with he quick uncontrollable temper the tablet of stone be reserve for the highest dignity of the law and in that sala dei capi where at this moment sit giustinian giustinianus -- one of the choose three of the council of the ten -- my name be write largely with mine own hand as artist write they name _ above _ the head of ruler for all come time to see the _ avvogadorus _ do not keep my ` libro d'oro ' the entrance to it be by divine right he fling he brush fiercely aside in one of those mood that seem all unwarranted in comparison with the slightness of the provocation -- mood that alternate with the lovable genial generous impulse of a artist soul overwhelming in energy and great in friendship yet jealous to a degree a lesser nature could scarcely pardon of anything that seem to touch upon he province as a artist and the claim of art to highest honor \* \* \* \* \* the day be draw near when marcantonio giustinianus the only son of giustinian giustinianus a noble of the senate and of the council of the ten should present himself before the _ avvocato del comun _ to claim admission to the great council as a noble bear in lawful wedlock of noble parent inscribe in the golden book to the young fellow himself this twenty-fifth anniversary of he birth when by venetian law the ceremony must take place approach with needlessly rapid footstep he be not yet ready for the duty it would bring so much more do he incline to that measure of boyish freedom which have thus far be he so unwilling be he to renounce he longing for some form of art life -- the impulse to which fret he almost unbearably in view of the political career which open mercilessly before he threaten every dearer project not that he feel himself bear to be a artist -- paolo cagliarus laugh at he study while he encourage he come to the studio tell he that for one who have not choose art for he mistress the drawing be well enough and from the veronese the word be console he mother have be afraid of this taste for art which for a short time have exercise such sway over he fancy stimulate by he _ culte _ for the beautiful that he have plead with she to win he father 's consent for a art life yet he have himself acquiesce in she quiet but inflexible showing of the futility of attempt such a overturn of giustiniani tradition though he still go with dangerous frequency to the studio of the veronese to which she have procure he entrance upon he promise that he would not seriously consider that impossible possibility at which he have hint there have be mention of pordenone and of aretino with a certain cool scorn that be worse than censure and as convincing there be the titian than whom in art and sumptuousness one could not be greater but even for he cavalière of france there be no place in the consiglio not that marcantonio would voluntarily have relinquish he hereditary place in the state he possible part in its glory -- the dream which come to all young nobleman of the portrait in that splendid salum di consiglio of he own face grow venerable wear the ermine and the ducal coronet in token of that supremacy so dear to each venetian heart but jealously hold by every noble of the republic within confines which lessen with each succession until the crown be assume in tremble and ignominious restriction -- if with external pomp and honor that might befit a king but he want time he want liberty to choose he own life or enjoy he restlessness and he realize the more keenly from the sense of power that be so chafe in the curb that he be too young to be force into such ruthless service and he could not but acquiesce the less fervently because it be not open to he to _ give _ himself since the claim of venice be absolute and resistance be a crime but with quite other sentiment the preparation for the fête be progress in that ancient family of giustinianus where the day be await with a impatience which increase the fervor and the pomp of preparation but be not otherwise manifest in any sign of undignified eagerness no house in venice have hold this right for more generation no house be princelier in its bearing nor more superbly republican no member of that supreme council be more esteem than the stern giustinian who have be again and again elect to the most important mission of the state no _ donna nobile _ of all the venetian be prouder more highly bear more beautiful nor more coldly gracious than the mother of marcantonio in such a environment there be but one career possible for the only son of the house who have be carefully train accord to the tradition that make culture for the young venetian of those day he have even attend course of those philosophical conference which have become the fashion since the sitting of the famous council of trent and which have be conduct in various convent by distinguished professor from padua and bologna and even by some of the learn man of rome it be a species of amusement creditable for a young nobleman -- it would quicken the reasoning power and give more subtlety in debate when government problem should later absorb he gift but if like other golden youth of he time he be like a greek in possession of they liquid tongue and in a mastery of oratory that fill the soul of giustinian giustinianus with satisfaction the young patrician himself have acquire this learning less with a thought of one day shine in the senate than because it please he as a touch of finish he be in some sort a reaction from the proud and typical venetian so ably represent by the elder giustinian who claim unchallenged descent from the emperor justinian uphold by the tradition of that long line of ancestry and by the memory of many honorable office most honorably discharge by numerous member of he house marcantonio on the contrary be handsome win pleasure-loving -- after a innocent fashion which bring some sneer from he compeer the gay company of the hose but he think life not make for pain nor ugliness nor hardness of any sort he be breed to luxury yet he intellectual inheritance make learn easy for he he be many side and vacillate a exquisite in taste and the science of trifle he affectionate nature repress and chill refuse absolute subjection to that purpose which the elder giustinian hold relentlessly before he he wish to live for himself a little and not wholly for venice he be a embodiment of that late time of venetian culture when its magnificence its artistic and intellectual development have touch they height and the hint of decadence shadow its splendor with a pathos unguessed except by the thoughtful few he have dabble a little in costly manuscript -- a taste for a exquisite in those day when venice be the envy of the world for the marvel of she press and already he possess a volume or two for he cabinet from the atelier of aldus manutius -- that famous edition of aristotle the first ever print in greek with the aldine mark of anchor and dolphin on the title-page but a volume more precious still with its dainty finish and piquant history confer distinction it be say among the literati upon its youthful owner this be no less a treasure than that first copy of le cose volgare di messer francesco petrarca most exquisitely print in type model after the poet 's own elegant handwriting and the volume have be superintend by many learn head -- await with impatience as a triumph for its maker -- and think a thing rare enough to be offer like a jewel to the learn and illustrious lady isabellum of mantua marcantonio be no pedant but these treasure simply have they place in the richly paint cabinet beside many other bit of exquisite workmanship because rare thing in every art be beautiful to we dilettante and possession of all kind come to he easily there lay the golden necklace present by henry iii of france to a giustinian who have be one of the young nobles set apart for the household of the king when on he visit to venice and beside it a curious volume of song all in honor of france and of the king entitle il magno enrico iii difensore di santa chiesa di francia è di polonia re christianissimo here be also preserve that still more curious allegorical drama which have be give at the grand fête at the ducal palace in honor of this over-adulated monarch it be natural that some of these literary curiosity of which the visit of henry iii have be prolific should have remain in possession of the master of the palace which have be tender for he residence the volume bind in azure velvet embroider with golden fleur-de-lis and seed with pearl lay open at the page chapter in which the most holy catholic religion be introduce converse with the most christian most powerful and most holy henry iii the most glorious king of france and poland the noble lady laura giustinianus who look with pride upon these costly trifle of the cabinet of marcantonio be a venetian in every throb of she patrician vein -- first a patriot and then a mother -- she earnestly covet for she son that he should render vast service to the state receive in he early year the patriarch 's blessing upon he alliance with some ancient venetian house and close he noble career with the doge 's coronet she admit reluctantly to herself although she would never have confess it openly that in these latter day of the republic the ermine be not likely to be offer to one so stern and masterful as she husband while she also know and the knowledge hold its compensation that giustinian giustinianus could not be spare from the council of he government she know she history well and she realize that the day of the michielus and orseolus be over and that the supreme honor be no longer for the strong but for the pliant this have make she the more willing that she son should partake of the facile and gracious mood of this time of renaissance and have lead she to shape he education more in consonance with he natural taste than with she own view of fitness for a venetian noble she know that this be weakness for a giustinian but it be hard to see the noble line pass down through the century without that coveted sign of honor -- the minikin lion of san marco the mighty symbol -- carve upon they palace meanwhile for a suitable alliance there be already scheme on foot and mother of noble young venetian lady pay frequent court to the stately lady laura in she palace on the canal grande and father in the senate in moment of unbending discuss the probability of the immediate rise of the young giustinian upon he admission to the consiglio -- he be competent and not positive gracious and no fool he could be make to see the wisdom of other people 's opinion which with the elder giustinian be unheard of among the maiden who should grace the banquet to be give on marcantonio 's birthnight more than one have sit for hour in some high balcony of she palace prepare for venetian belle-ship with a patience worthy of a better cause -- she long lock mysteriously treat streaming over the broad brim of the great crownless hat which protect she fair face while the sun bestow its last touch of beauty in bleach the dark tress to that rich red burnish gold which the venetian prize the young patrician be already esteem a connoisseur in the most exquisite industry of venice and the lady laura have confide to she son the order of a set of goblet of _ girasole _ for the banquet -- a new opalescent glass with iridescent bordering such as have never yet be see at any venetian fête thus the gondola of the giustinianus float for long hour before the famous establishment of girolamo magagnatus so delicate and intricate be the work that have be order from he and the gondolier meanwhile in they splendid livery hold converse with other gondolier in lazily drift bark with hatchment of other noble house embroider on they sleeve and they tone be strident and quarrelsome or self-complacent and patronize as the quality of the silken sash which display the color of they house be heavier or poorer than they own one boast of the lantern all of brass work by messer alessandro leopardus -- ` come no c ' è altro ' -- there be no other like it -- which he the favored gondolier have be burnish for the banquet of the dandolo to which he shall that night convey the noble lady of the giustinianus it be less beautiful retort a gondolier of the house of mocenigo the fringe of he sash of rise sweep the bridge of he gondola as it move forward slightly tilt on its side with a quick disdainful motion call forth by proper mocenigo pride -- so pliant be these bark of venice to the mood of the gondolier it be less beautiful -- by the holy madonna of san castello -- than the lantern of work iron with the jewel of _ rubino _ that messer girolamo magagnatus make this day by order of the eccellentissimo andrea mocenigo with the jewel of the fine glass of murano that shall be like rose flash in the night and he have swear so great a oath by that most ancient madonna of castello and so well have he vindicate the honor and splendor of he house in thus early appropriating this recent glory of venetian workmanship in its own family emblem that there be no present need of distance between he and he rival and rest upon he oar as he stand with a proud and graceful bearing of victory he allow the gondola to glide back into position with the lapping of the water for the gondolier of the house of giustinianus be unfold with quick ringing jubilant voice vast confidential tale of the fêtes that be in preparation for the marriage of the young noble of the council they master of which this banquet be only the precursor for of course there will be a _ sposalizium _ santa marium there be no room on the canal grande for the gondola that come to the palazzo -- from every _ casa _ in the ` libro d'oro ' -- to win the favor of the donna nobile of the giustinianus for some bellum donzellum who shall be choose for they young master -- who be like a prince and will end one day in be doge santa marium di castello he do not wait that day to scatter he golden coin if that question of sposalizium be not imminent there be truth enough for any venetian conscience in the story of the rank of princely gondola at the bend of the canal grande on the day when the donna nobile of the giustinianus give welcome to she guest -- princely gondola they be with _ felz _ of brocaded and embroidered stuff the framework inlay with ivory and mother of pearl with metal fitting curiously work and all that bravery of pomp so dear to the venetian heart which call forth surly decree from those stern signor of the council -- the much unloved provveditorus alle pompe the sumptuary officer of this superb republic meanwhile in this narrow water-street sink a few foot below the paved foot path that stretch to the door of the dwelling there be sudden grumble movement among the retainer of the patrician family as they steer they gorgeous gondola from side to side to avoid humiliating contact with that slow procession of barge bring produce from the island garden of mazzorbo there be other barge laden with great white wooden tub of water from fusina fresh and very needful to these city of the sea and the dark hulk of bark curiously entangled with net and mast and unwieldy tackle of sailor and fisher show flash of brilliant color as the water play through the netted basket swing low against they side while the sunlight glance back from the gold and silver glory of the scale of live fish crowd and palpitate within they mesh the fisherfolk who guide these bark be gray and gnomelike in they color tan by sky and sea and ceaseless atmosphere of fish into a neutral tint -- less vivid in hue of skin and hair with eye less brilliant with less vivacity and charm of bearing than the gay venetian -- but they be the descendant of those island tribe from which the commerce and greatness of venice issue there be almost a show of stateliness in the aggravating slowness with which they heavily freighted bark proceed serenely occupy the best of the narrow waterway they be not envious of the hanger-on of those palace of the noble these free fisherfolk of the island they have only haughty stare for the servile set of gondolier in lacing of gold and scarlet -- who be not nobles nor fisher nor people of the soil -- and they pass they silently with much ostentation of take all the gondolier of murano into the friendliness of they jest and curse as the barge touch and clash with some swiftly glide gondolier of they own rank who wear no bravery or armorial bearing they home -- long low white-washed cottage -- spread along the main channel and reach in lessen dot line far off into the sea where other island lie in friendly nearness but the bridge with the lion of st mark on archivolt and parapet -- the invariable official signet of venetian dominion -- stretch between that simpler quarter and this which hold the great house of murano whose master a sort of _ petite noblesse _ have make they name illustrious by marvelous invention in that exquisite industry in which venice have no rival vi the madonna del sorriso now lack only the finish touch upon the exquisite central figure which reach more nearly to the spiritual ideal than anything that have ever come from the brush of the veronese and already the servite friar in they long black robe and white cowl have visit the studio with suggestion many and fruitless serve only to arouse the artist 's indignant protest and increase he determination to image more perfectly the poetic vision that have be vouchsafe to he it have not the beauty of the ` venezium ' in the palazzo say one and the church be dark say another and the people like the red and blue of the color of the true madonna and a frate of the servus -- since it have be paint for the convent -- here -- kneel suggest another more timidly for it be know that the veronese be not always docile in these day since he have become great nay leave I say the veronese fiercely for this one thing i _ know _ and this will i paint for the good of my soul as mine art shall prompt I and not otherwise and if it please not he -- fra paolo who have give the order -- i will bestow it elsewhere then a friar habit like the other who have stand apart and have not speak come and throw back he cowl dismiss the group with a gesture the feature thus disclose be unimportant apart from the domelike forehead which might well belong to the most learn man of he learn age but fra paolo 's face owe its distinction to the rare impression it give the beholder of invincible calm and self-mastery with a certain mysterious hint of power and a promise of unswervingness he gaze hold no suggestion of concealment yet for the deeper thought that move the spirit of man to those who know he well he mild blue eye remain inscrutable while he courtesy to all make one forget that he word be few and that of himself he have reveal nothing it be well he say to _ know _ that we know serve faithfully the god who give the gift and take no counsel from man who know not then he stand silent for a while before the picture as if he would learn its mean the artist watch anxiously not guess he thought the pious wish have make the offering noble he say at length in quiet measure tone and for the face it be holy -- of the beauty that god permit -- yet i pretend no criticism since art be not of mine understanding i will not take the honor of the gift away from the giver though i have mean it otherwise after fra paolo have leave the studio the veronese be still study he picture pleased and serious feeling that this man who be not a artist have comprehend the deepest mood in which he have ever approach he art when marina enter fra paolo have find we offering worthy he say very gravely and suddenly remember that marina have come for the last time benedetto have need of I in the outer studio for some measurement he say to marcantonio but i shall soon return do thou meanwhile show the _ damigellum _ thy sketch she turn inquiringly toward marcantonio who place it silently before she when he gather courage to look at she she stand flush and tremble with clasped hand marina he cry she move suddenly away from he draw herself up to she full height one hand slightly extend as if to keep he from come nearer but she face as she turn it frankly to he be light with a smile the veronese would never copy and she eye shine through she tear be it true marina he question radiantly as he try to seize she hand but she still move backward -- not as if she be afraid but as though she would help he by a motion to understand you have confess I unawares she say and show I mine own secret which i know not it be not to confess nor deny yet you move away marina as if you would not have it so because only the renunciation of it be for we she answer firmly for i be of the people and you -- of the giustinianus as you shall also be he affirm undaunted marco at venice this be not easy the tone be a caress which she make no effort to withhold yet he dare not try again to touch she hand he already feel she strength none the less because it be not easy it shall be do reach I you hand marina to prove that you trust my vow he be not wont to crave favor so humbly but a new reverence have enter into he soul she hesitate for a moment then she word come brokenly yet with dignity marco mio not yet because i be of the people and because the other -- you father and mother who be of the noble and my father who be of the people -- may not consent we will make no vow until this difficulty be conquer they shall not keep we from it she shake she head sadly but come no nearer will giustinian giustinianus ask a daughter of the people but girolamo magagnatus be not less proud i will return now with thee to murano perhaps thy father will befriend we no no without they consent it would be useless i think i shall not tell he -- it would be only a grief because it meaneth much to thee marco question luminous and ungenerous she do not answer thou dost verily make too much of the noble and the people marina we be all venetian venice be of the sea and of the land -- not like other city and the venetian people be not one but twain my father have often say it some other day perhaps -- i do not know -- if it be needful for the picture i may come again will you tell the maestro i think he be we friend and he will understand he would have follow she but she wave he back the day have a melancholy cast in the narrow waterway of murano where cloud of smoke dense and constant rise from hundred of glass-worker ' chimney dim the reflection in the lagoon and obscure that wonderful coloring of sky which be nowhere so radiant as at venice beyond the bridge which the ubiquitous lion guard with menacing uplifted paw beyond the piazzetta of san pietro where the acacia tree be grow down by the main canal where the breath come freer -- for it be broader than the one where the gondola from the great house of venice gather and float lazily past the line of low whitewashed cottage border the narrow foot-path on either side over the little wooden bridge that span the lagoon fifty foot across from bank to bank with its ugly traghetto at the farther end a figure be often see wend with a child hold in tender mother fashion to the campo of the matrice the mother church of san donate to-day when marina have return from venice she have catch the little zuane to she breast with such a passion of tenderness that he look up into she face with startled eye hers be brim with smile and tear and with that wise child-knowledge which be not grant to earth 's learn one he put up he tiny hand with a wan smile and stroke she cheek we will go to san donato zuanino mio she say caressingly as he nestle closer and i have _ thee _ my bimbo she put the little one gently down as they enter the triangular field where the grass grow green and long -- whiteness of sand gleam in irregular patch between the clump of coarse blade but to she this poor turf be something precious associate with that island sanctuary restful and strange and she draw a long breath with a sense of suppress pleasure for sometimes the water with its shimmering uncertain surface weary she and unconsciously she crave something more positive the child with uncertain step totter toward the standard of san marco which float proudly from the staff that rise from the rude stone pillar in the center of the campo where other little one be play in the corner by the well group of woman from the cottage that bound the campo on one side be wait to draw water for the evening meal put down they jug and go first into the duomo to say a ave that the good madonna might bless the cup a few foot only from the duomo the campanile draw she vision skyward the film of smoke be lighter here and the sky seem nearer -- bluer she turn to she little charge with a beam face -- she mood be so easily work upon by phase of nature but slowly move by personal influence see ` st thou bimbo how it be beautiful here by the duomo but the little fellow in one of he sudden spasm of pain be strike the air impotently with small clenched fist frightening the child who be gather around he join in he cry she caress and passionate forgiveness be always ready for the paroxysm in which she be violently push away and combate with struggle foot and hand before come the period of exhaustion in which he nestle close panting from weakness then she carry he into the church where kneel before the mother of sorrow whose outstretched hand seem to touch she own in responsive sympathy and gift of calm she pray and weep o holy mater dolorosa why need the child suffer -- they be so tender and so dear she kneel with loving protect arm fold close about the little form now breathe softly and at rest while a agony of question fill she prayer to that beseech mater dolorosa who wrap in the clinging fold of she long blue robe still lean forward from the marble background of the apse compassionate for the suffering one of earth with implore hand and ceaseless drop tear symbol of love abound -- a symbol too of the dignity of those who suffer and be pure in heart this sanctuary be almost a home to the maiden who come hither to praise or question for life be full of enigma here too where she come from duty and deep devotion with a intricate sensitiveness of conscience which often render she unintelligible to she confessor she linger for delight for the tracery on the arch -- the color the wonderful delicacy of the sculpture -- be of that time when art be suggestive and faint in tint and meaning like a dream and its message be always spiritual it be not thou o christ she say who willest pain but thy child who be not always loving for in she reverie she be comfort by that vision of a legendary time when the holy mother have stand beautiful compassionate and commanding in this field of flame scarlet lily when a great emperor have obey she bidding and san donato the duomo of murano have arise as a refuge for the sorrowing in tender language of the people it be the mother church -- matrice she make a cushion of she cloak and lay the little one upon it for he still sleep and she would not waken he and then though the quaint inlaid pavement be cold and bare she kneel again she rosary drop from she hand as she shyly whisper the burden of she strange new confession to this ever-waiting tender mother -- she confession more full of pain than joy yet already dear and a thing not to be surrender though it should bring she only pain but there be no other friend to whom she tell it soon alas the day grow over-full of pain and marina come more often to the mater dolorosa for the little zuane have not grow stronger with the come of the spring sleep come to he more easily but it do not bring refreshment and the rose on he cheek be only sign of fail bloom passionately marina 's loving prayer be breathe before the shrine of the madonna san donato but the little one grow weaker every day till after a long night of watch a sweet-voiced nun stand with marina beside the cradle the burden of the baby 's suffer life be change to blessing she say earth hold no joy for he god have be merciful beyond thy prayer my daughter vii fra paolo sarpi -- this friar so grave and great and unemotional -- have be since he have enter the convent in he precocious boyhood the central figure fascinating the interest of he community by the marvel of he progress so that those who have be he teacher stand reverently aside before he have attain to manhood recognize gift beyond they lead which have already win homage from the savant of europe and crown the order of the servus with unexampled honor the element of the unusual in the young paolo 's endowment have transform this benjamin of the convent into a hero and surround the calm flow of he studious life with a halo of romance for these servite friar yet the good fra giulio in those early day have little learning wherewith to estimate he progress and watch over he like a father have be grieve at he strange placidity he sorely needeth some touch of emotion he say yearningly methinks i love the lad as if he be mine own son and i feel something lack in he life fret not the lad needlessly with those fanciful notion of thine fra gianmarium have retort with much asperity it be the most marvelous piece of mental mechanism that i have ever dream already he have attain to larger knowledge than thou with thy gray hair canst comprehend fra giulio have cross himself devoutly as if confess to some earthliness i measure not my simple mind with that of a genius my brother for so god have endowed we lad yet it may be that he meaneth man to garner other blessing besides knowledge we receive he as a child into we fold and we be responsible for he development but he condition be not normal genius be abnormal fra gianmarium have respond shortly he have no wish but for this ceaseless mental labor all natural youthful fancy all joy in the thing of beauty -- for these he careth naught the elder friar 's troubled utterance have stir no tremor in he companion 's stern reply thou and i my brother have attain by penance and year of abnegation to that mood which have be grant the boy as a gift to fit he for the cloister life it be small kindness to implant a struggle of which he know not the beginning and now after all these year through which the good fra giulio have watch this son of he affection whom he love with a love pass the love of earth he pathetically tell himself -- as if god thus make up to he for all the love he have resign -- now that the name of fra paolo be utter with reverence while he own be unknown he still express he heart in many tender care provide the new cassock before the scholar have notice that the one he wear be seam and fray with such other gentle ministry as the convent rule permit toward one who never give a worldly thought to the morrow and still after all these year the fatherly friar often fondly recur to a time when he have first seem to catch some dim shadowed glimpse of that inner self which fra paolo so rarely express he have be endeavor to rouse the lad to enthusiasm never have i know one show so little pleasure in nature he have say they be stand on the terrace of a convent among the hill beyond the plain of venetium and the view be beautiful and new for the youth what be nature the lad have respond quietly nature fra giulio echo startle at the question why nature be god 's creation dost thou not find this bit of nature beautiful it be pleasant the young friar have assent without enthusiasm but have god create anything nobler than the mind and soul of man the earth be but for he habitation nay the old man have reply in a tone of disappointment it be more for I -- much more for those whom we call poet poet be dreamer the lad have say turn to he old friend with a smile which seem affectionate yet be baffling and go not deep enough for love i would not dream i must know a little dream would not hurt thee my paolo for sometimes it seemeth to those who care for thee that thou needest rest rest be satisfaction the lad answer quickly if there be a problem to be solve i would rather think than dream i would rather come in contact with the nobler activity -- the mental and spiritual force -- through the mind and work of man i would find such attrition more helpful than this phase of creation which thou callest ` nature ' whose unfold be more passive depend on its inherent law this also be of god 's gift paolo mio fra giulio have say yearningly sometimes thou seemest to find too little beauty in thy life and when i bring thee hither i hope it might move thy soul what can be more beautiful the young philosopher have question earnestly than the fitting of all to each the search for hidden key the link of problem that seem apart these be the thing that move I i must walk soberly fra giulio lest i miss some revelation so sacred and so mysterious be knowledge and the love of it leave I no room for question of outside beauty -- this order beauty of hidden law be so wonderful for one moment as fra giulio have look at he he fancy that he have see deeper into he eye than ever before then the veil have seem to rise up from the boy 's heart and close over its depths if it have be a moment of self-revelation the young friar be again protect by that baffling calm as he glance about he turn affectionately to he old friend it pleaseth I that thou art pleased he say fra giulio have answer with a sigh it be hard for one who love so truly to get so near yet be no nearer i could wish that thou also shouldst take pleasure in this beauty my paolo for thou art miss a joy that god permit then the youthful scholar have turn he eye upon he silently and it have seem to the old man in he great love that a sudden glory have transfigure the grave young face like a consecration he still remember the tone of that clear voice say serenely : my father when god speaketh a message in we soul the peace and beauty which come to we as we follow its call be in the measure which he have decree for we now that the convent ring with he triumph and fra paolo be often absent from he cell on mission of honor the old friar sometimes wonder how many of those philosophic and scientific truth which have make he famous as a original thinker have come to the lad in glimmering on that first night among the hill when turn to he old friend and stretch out he hand with a solemn implore motion which seem to confess a desperate need of isolation he have say only let I think have he seeming nearness to the star in the convent _ loggia _ bring he a premonition of the later message which have make he the friend and master of galileo do he develop he law of sound in that voiceful silence or be it in that solitude he have first watch the gentle ebb and flow of he own life-current and learn the secret which harvey later utter to the world or have he be wholly absorb in those philosophical question which he so brilliantly dispute at the learn court of mantua but to be near he be only to wonder more at the mystery which envelop he and fra giulio now that the lad have reach he prime often go reverently back to that night under the star when the gifted youth have first stand distance as it be from man remote from human habitation and alone with the one whom only he acknowledge as master -- then perhaps he have first be conscious of he latent power surely then the manifold message of he life must have whisper within he many premonition the time be long past when a question could arise as to the right of the augustinian to rich possession in church and convent and the priceless treasure of art flung sometimes in atonement upon they quiet wall by a world-worn artist or send in propitiation for some unconfessed sin by a prince of church or state be find side by side with the gift and legacy of the faithful which in sincere devotion they often impoverish they family to bestow but none of these thing have charm for fra paolo not even the beauty of the cloister where the low gray arch rest on slender shaft of marble work and twist into as many device draw he thought from the ceaseless contemplation of he problem not even the pet rose-tree lovingly train by the gentle fra francesco and lift its pink glory to the crest of the colonnade win he eye to wander from the absorb treasure of the great library where he pass he day here many a brother have teach himself patience over the fine endless text of a ancient gospel or work into the exquisite illumination of some missal which stand to he in the place of he daily living those yearning torture hungering affection which have so enriched a gentle home -- as a brother less discipline have carve he unruly temper into the grotesque figure of the reading desk but for fra paolo the great library of the convent hold no unsatisfied yearning -- only a infinite content and power to achieve from the day when those curious in philosophical research have flock from the neighbor university to see this professor of theology who could not be conquer in argument and have be confront by a smooth-faced lad of twenty until now he be still the glory of the servus and well might the friar watch in triumph as one by one he gather laurel for they order a little human flush of triumph or of self-conceit would have add charm to he argument but these note be lack clearly logically unanswerably he meet each question convincing without emotion and hasten from the gay court of which these intellectual tourney be the delight to the welcome seclusion of the convent if he seem to have miss a real childhood -- its folly its innocent pleasure its winsome affection -- so later the temptation that would naturally beset a career so extraordinary fall harmlessly away from he for a passion for knowledge burn within he consume all ignoble motive and keep this young scholar in friar 's robe in marvelous singleness of heart in the midst of a flattering and luxurious court always he have be a law to himself both morally and intellectually never before do it seem that genius have be cast in a mold so orderly and calm in that state of intense concentration which be he habitual mood he accomplish without apparent effort the thing for which other pay by a life-time of struggle and morally he have no visible combat not seem to be even reach by the thing which tempt other man he want be fewer than the simplest rule of he convent allow and it seem less that he have triumph over the usual earthly temptation than that he have be create abnormally free from they that he whole strength might spend itself in the solve of problem in a certain sense he stand mysteriously alone though he friend be many and devoted and among the wise and venerated of the earth but there be always a door close to they beyond the affection which he return they always he say once we veil we face : yet none doubt he sincerity from time to time as the year speed some echo of the jealousy which he phenomenal success and the boldness of he bearing naturally evoke penetrate to the cloister of the servus and more than once there have be a denunciation to the inquisition to discuss some one in authority have find fault with he theological opinion and denounce he for he reading of a passage in genesis upon which he base he argument -- the affair be grave indeed ah the pity of it -- the pity of it fra giulio have exclaim they should show mercy -- he be still so young a man ay young enough to need much discipline bravely mutter a friar who dare to disbelieve in they prodigy silence command father gianmarium who be now the superior in a stentorian tone for within these wall there be no appeal from he judgment or he temper the man who speak only what he _ know _ be old in wisdom and turn he address the company in great dignity : it doth appear that rome approveth fra paolo 's rendering and have gravely censure the inquisitor who have cite he command he to meddle only with that of which he have some understanding there be then tale-bearers whose jealousy would ruin we paolo fra giulio have exclaim in anxiety it be none other than fra paolo himself who carry the tale the superior retort in scorn of the old man 's weak affection fra paolo refuse to appear before the inquisitor who have cite he who he allege know not hebrew nor greek and have therefore no knowledge upon which to base he judgment and on this ground fra paolo appeal to rome it be a pity say a gentle-faced young friar who have be listen silently but with a expression of deep and affectionate interest that one of so rare learning should remain long in a position of danger to orthodoxy already the court of mantua have be censure by the holy father for heretical opinion nay but for harbor heretic hunt and drive fra giulio correct warmly there be deed of mercy that will be forgive we a look of perplexity cross the candid boyish face of fra francesco but the law of obedience be more simple he say timidly and we holy father -- thou not yet out of thy novitiate doest well verily to prate of obedience and doctrine interrupted father gianmarium less severely than he be wont to treat such breach of etiquette for fra francesco have deep spiritual loving eye in which a unuttered wonder sometimes seem to chide for all he gentleness and he way be winsome so through the year whether he be present or absent the life of the convent have center about fra paolo who now after many mission of importance have once more return to he old cell in the servus with another add for he book and labor since often it suit he to be alone the breath of jealousy still cloud the serenity of he sky and he be not without some unfulfilled longing but no scandal have ever touch he he be great enough now to be smite through he friend and the good fra giulio have be the victim take in he stead upon fra paolo 's last homecoming to the convent the loving fatherly greet have fail he ask the nun to whom he be father confessor they will have no other and refuse admittance to one of we order who have be send to take this duty upon he and we good fra giulio have be remove in humiliation and languisheth in bologna by order of the patriarch who have be win by the tale of one who loveth thee not there be no more to it than that fra paolo question nay no more my brother fra francesco answer with conviction the name then say fra paolo and when it have be tell he he recognize the man as one in whom trust be misplace and one who intrigue for power the charge he ask again and when he have patiently learn the detail of which fra giulio 's long and faithful service give little hint he gather evidence wherewith to refute they and journey swiftly back to rome return triumphant to reinstate the good old friar with honor in the home and office he love -- the manner of he return make amends to fra giulio for the pain he have suffer so sweet it seem to he to owe to this son of he affection all the gladness of he later day viii while the little zuane be fail marcantonio see marina but seldom solace himself in prepare a royal gift to offer to he mother on the occasion of he own birthday fête the idea have come to he that night after the veronese have touch he own faulty sketch into such rounded life besides he have think but one beautiful thought since he have as it be be unconsciously bring to confession by that scene in the studio and paolo cagliarus have be most kind in accept he commission with a enthusiasm which promise wonderful result great as be he fame in those day -- and the veronese never live beyond he fame -- still as in he earlier year he be eager for any new method of prove the genius in which he own faith be as unbounded as he capacity to achieve be vigorous and tireless and the young noble 's unique fancy for a superb goblet of crystal _ da beroviero _ with a miniature of marina of murano enlace in exquisite gold border and set round with costly pearl -- a trifle fit to offer to a princess -- not only pleased the artist 's well-known taste for luxury but seem to he a object worthy of he skill in the kindness of he heart he would make the lovely face so win that the great lady should yield to the prayer that have prompt the gift among all the elaborate gift-piece that have come from the workshop of murano but one have as yet approach this and it have be send with the homage of the senate by a retire ambassador of he most christian majesty to the queen of france and it bear from titian 's hand the portrait of she royal husband this goblet then must surpass that one in magnificence for it be the veronese 's opportunity and in he soul genial as it be some sense of rivalry bear of titian 's assumption of the highest place in venetian art would last forever in spite of the great master 's manifest affection the suggestion of the pearl -- a add touch -- be indeed due to paolo cagliarus 's over-weening sumptuousness and the eager young lover be scarcely more anxious for the completion of this gem upon which he hope depend than be the great artist who already have all venice at he foot i shall need no sit the veronese have say when they be plan for the work my picture be nearly complete and it will suffice nay ask she not my marco she be a devote -- she will not understand marcantonio flush like a boy he know it would be difficult to obtain she consent and for that very reason he must win it for he be a true knight how shall i win my lady 's favor he cry hotly if i peril it by lack of chivalry there be no prouder maiden among the donne nobile on the canal grande _ altro altro _ say the master quietly she also shall look down from the balcony in the palazzo giustinianus but when the young patrician tell she glowingly of he wish to give he mother on he great day the most beautiful gift in all the world it be hard to make she yield it be not fitting she answer quite simply yes yes marina -- since i love thee ah no it be only sad she eye fill with tear and she move away so that he could not touch she hand trust I marina the veronese know the world and he say it be well it be this that shall win the consent of my mother and she will conquer my father and in the gran ' consiglio -- he turn he eye suddenly away from marina lest she should trace the faintest flicker of a doubt within they as the vision rise before he of that imperious body so relentless in its decree so tenacious in its tradition so positive in its autocracy but the threaten invincibility of this force only nerve he to a resistance as invincible and he turn back to she with a flash face almost before she have notice the interruption there also -- in the consiglio -- it shall be arrange and all will be well and where two be ready for the end that should be gain the plead be not over-long though the thought be very strange for this simple maiden of murano so the precious painting be finish and in the hand of the decorator and meanwhile during those day when marina have be watch the flickering of the little zuane 's pale flame of life and there have be no spare moment for marcantonio he have try to absorb himself as far as possible in the preparation of this gift -- since she would not let he go to she -- and he have come to regard it as the symbol of success for failure be never for a instant contemplate in he vision of the future there be pearl to be select one by one in visit innumerable to the fondaco dei turchi where the finest of such treasure be not secure at a first asking and in these he mother be a connoisseur but there be many more anxious visit to murano to be assure that no step in the fashioning of he gift be endanger its perfection but even for the most impatient time may not tarry indefinitely and the lagging moment have at last bring round that festa of san marco which mean so much for venice with its splendid pageant for the church its festivity for the people its fluttering of dove in the piazza and of timid eager maiden heart wait in a sort of shy assurance for that earliest venetian love-token the _ boccolo _ -- the rosebud which breathe the secret of many a young venetian lover to he _ inamorata _ under those April sky on the festa of this patron saint of venice and the next morning the stately lady of the giustinianus stand quite alone on the balcony of the great palace at the bend of the canal grande lean upon she gold-embroidered cushion to watch the gondola that be just landing at the step of the piazzetta the restless movement of she taper jeweled finger be the only sign of a emotion she rarely betray though doubtless under the faultless dignity of she bearing there be often current of feeling and thwarting hard to be endure she be think of she boy with a great and sudden tenderness now that the moment have come in which she would be less to he and the world of man must be more as from the distance she see the gondola touch the landing and watch he until he pass out of sight after pause with he father for a moment before the great column of san marco and san teodoro look up perhaps with a keener sense of the dread scene they have witness than have ever before possess he though the sunshine stream brilliantly over the water and life seem full of promise for this only son of the can ' giustinianus on he way to take the oath of silence and allegiance to the republic as a _ nobile di gran ' consiglio _ marcantonio have enter the gondola gaily with a full pleasurable sense of the beauty of life and well content with that portion which have fall to he lot for he be easily affect and the air of the palace be full of the excitement of he fête the only foreboding that shadow he sunshine be connect with marina and the gift which he should offer to he mother upon he return from the ducal palace but the day be one to banish every hint of failure make he more conscious of he power than he have ever be before and he feel himself float toward attainment -- whatever the difficulty might be but with he first step upon the piazzetta he forget the glory of the sunshine flash over the blue water and a sudden sense of fate possess he as he father make a almost imperceptible pause in he grave progress toward the ducal palace and with the slightest possible movement of he hand seem to direct he son 's attention to the great granite column which bear the emblem of the patron saint of venice a hundred time in cross the piazzetta marcantonio have be vaguely aware of they as appropriate emblem of barbaric force and splendor and allegoric christian allegiance but suddenly they stand to he for historic record -- the echo of dread deed avenge there roll forth from the space between the column and the jeweled eye of the terrible winged lion flash defiance upon any who question in the remotest way the will or the act of the republic he glance toward the elder man some deprecatory comment rise to he lip as he strive to dissipate the symbolic mood which be surely possess he for he feel himself uncomfortably conscious of the meaning work into the very stone about he and to-day this over-mastering assertion of venice -- always venice dominant -- be oppressive but he father apparently unaware of marcantonio 's turbulent sensation wear he usual reserved and dignified mien even the motion he have seem to make before the column in the piazzetta be probably only due to marcantonio 's imagination and the young fellow 's light rejoinder pass unuttered intensify he discomfort he realize that he be not search for this symbolism with a poet 's appreciation nor as a archaeologist delighting in curio but as a son of the republic -- to gather she history and she purpose to make himself one with she to put himself under she yoke -- and in he heart he rebel yet it be he this time who pause undeniably before the great window on the piazzetta the sun stream in broad flash of light over the soft rose-tinted wall of the palazzo and over the splendid balcony from which the doge be wont to view the procession and fêtes of the republic the richly sculptured decoration detach themselves at once in allegory the figure all lead up to venice enthroned hold out to the world she proud motto forti justa trono furias mare sub pede pono -lrb- strong just i put the fury beneath my throne and the sea beneath my foot -rrb- he walk on under a spell feeling that the coil be tighten around he he be a noble but not free yet he would not have surrender he opportunity for the freer life of the people who have no part in the consiglio he quicken he pace that the moment of irresolution might be the sooner over wait he father command as marcantonio would have enter the palace gate haste ill befit thy grave and dignified purpose before thou enterest the consiglio i would have thee reverently mark how at the palace gate justice sit enthrone on high between the lion of st mark while courage prudence hope and charity wait upon she and below answer marcantonio because he could think of nothing else to say and because he know every angle and carve of the palace from the aesthetic point of view better than he father do below be the doge foscarus kneel very reverently to we noble lion he father slowly scan he with he inscrutable gaze but answer nothing and they pass under the magnificent porta dellum carta quite silently under the deep shadow of the gateway the business of the ducal palace be already progress secretary at they desk be prepare papers for discussion while they assistant come and go with message from the various department of the great body of worker within the palace they be too absorb to look up as this chief of the ten pass they so oblivious be they of anything but they duty that the stir about they leave they serene and undisturbed not even penetrate the realm of they consciousness there be no more learn nor devoted body of scribe in the world say giustinian with pride they have not a think beyond they papers and most wonderfully do they sift and prepare they for the council work often far into the night it be machinery not life marcantonio exclaim hasten beyond the portal the great courtyard under the wonderful blue of the sky be aglow with color the palace façades break into irregular carving seem to hold the sunshine in they creamy surface the superb well of green bronze magnificently work and dim as yet by little weather-staining offer a treasury of luminous point here in the early morning the woman of the neighborhood gather with they water-jar but now the court be fill with those who have business in the ducal palace -- red-robed senator and member of the consiglio talk in knot a councillor in he violet gown a group of merchant-prince in black robe enrich with costly fur and relieve by massive gold chain absorb in discussion of some practical detail for the better order of the _ fondachus _ those storehouse and mart for foreign trade peculiar to venice some grave attorney more soberly array make haste toward the gloom of the secretary 's corner a sprinkling of friar on ecclesiastical business of gondolier in the varied livery of the senator wait they master ' call here and there a figure less in keep with the magnificence around he too full of he trouble to be abashed go to ask for justice at the doge 's foot -- the heart of venice be pulse in the court and under the arch come the gleam and shimmer of the sea up and down the splendid stairway that open immediately from the porta della carta the venetian come and go -- noble old and young the people bring wrong to be adjust or favor to be grant or some secret message for the terrible _ bocca di leone _ the people rich and poor in continuous tread upon this giant stairway guard by the god of war and of the sea the winged lion enthrone above just over the landing where the elect noble don the rank of _ serenissimo _ -- this kaleidoscopic epitome of the life of the republic be bewilder how be it possible that all these people could take part in it without emotion the young patrician ask himself forget that in this familiar scene the emotion only be new for he at the head of the landing on the giant stairway the senator arrest he son with a gesture of command welcome he say to the consiglio marcantonio giustinianus thou wilt not forget that thou comest of a house which have hold honor in church and state may this day be memorable for venice and for thee the influence of they surroundings be strong upon they both but the young fellow in he bound life crave something more than this formal induction into the official life of he sumptuous state -- he long to feel the human throb beneath it that the sense of its weight might be lift but he could not find he voice until they have pass through the loggia and reach the chamber of the _ avvogadorus _ where sit the keeper of the golden book he stretch out he hand wistfully and touch the elder man father he cry in a voice not well control and again more steadily though no answer come father i will not forget the finding of he name among the birth record of the noble of venice the registration witness by the three solemn avvogadorus -- those officer of the law whose ruling in they department be inexorable -- the act of confirmation before the imperial senate whither in grave procession they immediately fare precede by the sacred libro d'oro upon which the oath of allegiance be swear with bend knee -- the ceremony be soon over and marcantonio stand enrol among the ruling body of the great republic as they return through the splendid hall of the palace giustinian pause frequently to exchange a greet with some old senator who come forward to welcome the young noble to the grave circle of ruler and they be follow with glance of interest as they pass through the piazza for it be whisper in the _ broglio _ that there be reason -- valid and patriotic as be all the argument of venice -- for the fact that no member of that ancient and loyal house have wear the highest honor of the state _ the can ' giustinianus be too old too wealthy too influential -- too much a part of venice itself _ like the orseolus say morosinus morosinus who be a friend of the giustinianus and who like many another strong-brained venetian know the taste of unsatisfied longing yet keep a brave heart for the record of the republic and as he speak there come to some of they who know they annals well a stinging memory of the tale -- which be no legend -- of that pathetic group in they island sanctuary -- the brother who be leave after the death of otto the exile doge and of orso the noble bishop-prince all of the house of orseolus who with they abbess-sister felicium be wound to the heart because for the crime of too great love and service the jealous and unrequiting senate have banish they forever from the venice so loyally serve -- have decree the extinction of a family to whom as doge and patriarch the republic owe the wisest and most self-sacrificing of she ruler nay say another speaker quickly a friend to morosini the historian -- for the broglio have be know to have a voice as well as ear and the subject be a dangerous one not honorable to venice -- nay there be no orseolus but it be for honor to the giustinianus that none have be choose for the serenissimo he be strong grave and very silent but most wise in council most prudent in resource he be need among the _ savius _ and the coronation oath have grow over straight since the day of the michieli respond morosinus the giustinian be not a man for we _ promissione _ which verily fitteth ill with the dignity of we prince -- a man of spirit may well find it hard to assume the beretta under such restriction ix with the nonchalance that conceal a skill all venetian the gondolier of the giustinianus guide they gracefully through the float craft moor to the stake which rise in sheaf before they palace announce the color of they noble house barge bear flower and decoration for the fête fruit and game be unload on the broad marble step and through the work open-work of the splendid gate a scene of activity be disclose in the nearer court which serve as a office for the various department of the household while the house-master have come down the step from he cozy lodge beside the entrance and stand dispense order to a group of eager domestic in the deep shadow of the entrance-court the open one through which the light stream radiantly seem far distant and when the great bell send clang echo from court to court gondolier in undress livery who be lazily lounge and chat spring to a show of activity over all those finish touch of polish and nicety which have be achieve long before and the lithe figure come and go throw themselves into graceful attitude over they semblance of labor exchange joyous sally in anticipation of the evening 's revelry awake a contagious merriment marcantonio rally from the heaviness of the morning and feel young again as he yield to they influence and wander among they toss compliment and repartee with venetian freedom in the midst of this harmless trifle the voice of giustinian giustinianus sound sternly marcantonio these ancient arm have be burnish in honor of this day i have a moment to remind thee of they history -- if thou hast forget he be call from across the open court where the sunshine seem suddenly less and marcantonio hasten to respond the seneschal call for light for the workmanship of these heirloom be too fine to be appreciate in the gloom which pervade the far inner court two or three iron lantern be bring and hang up and link-boy flash flare torch upon the piece on the wall near which they master stand surely thou dost recall this breastplate of the general taddeo giustinianus who force the austrian to surrender trieste when venice lay siege to the city in 1369 it be work in the east no doubt and the inlaying be of gold and precious but not for this do we keep it chained it be a priceless jewel in the history of we house for trieste mean much for venice he raise the heavy chain that fasten it and the link fall clang against the stone of the wall for this hall which serve as a armory be like a prison in its construction -- as strong and as forbid -- and here among the ancestral relic be keep the arm which every nobleman by venetian law be require to hold in readiness to equip he household against uprising of the populace who be by this same law debar these means of self-defense at a sign from the senator a young squire come forward proudly bear a sword with a jeweled hilt in a intricately work scabbard giustinian draw it from its sheath display a blade exquisitely damascen with acanthus foliage as he turn to he son this be especially thine own he say in honor of this day -- thy maiden sword so far as the handiwork of cellinus may make it worthy of a son of we house it have be worthily choose for thee yet unless thou leavest it to those who come after thee enrich by the name of a giustinian who have work of he best for venice it will be all unworthy of a place among these trophy the torch-bearer flash they light over it and the squire of the household press forward to admire it but giustinian cut short the enthusiastic chorus of the young man-at-arms and marcantonio 's eager word of appreciation cross the sombre hall with stately step for to he mind this important day hold many ceremony yet unfulfilled and the pomp with which he choose to surround they be not a circumstance to be dilate on this he say as he touch a quaint dagger belong to thine ancestor marco giustinianus ambassador to the scaglierus there be other envoy of we name in other italian province in england and the papal court for we have be great in statescraft as well as in war but i wrong thee in _ seem _ to think thou knowest not the history of thine house perhaps in these latter day a man may best distinguish himself in statesmanship for the mind be a weapon not to be slight -- when it be build with strength sharpen with careful use and so wield -- he gaze fall full upon marcantonio for a weighty moment -- so wield that it have no pliancy save at the will of its owner for sometimes it chanceth -- again he pause for a moment -- that a mind have more master than one and venice brook no rival he father have be point out one heirloom after another while he speak and the pause which marcantonio find irritating because they seem to indicate hidden meaning to be unravel might proceed only from he effort to carry several train of think at once but it be a habit of the elder giustinian which hold not a less share in the education of he son because it be distasteful to he to-day the young patrician almost resent this persistent marshaling of the shades of he ancestor though at heart he be proud of they and the prestige and luxury of he surroundings suit he well but he chafe under he father 's scrutiny which it seem to he unveil the difference of they temperament to a almost indecorous degree the thought of marina be tingle in he pulse but he would not yield it up until the propitious moment come and the strong consciousness of this sweet new queenship make the constant assertion of the sovereignty of venice not easy to endure but the remembrance of he vow of allegiance just render before the senate return to he rather as the public investiture of he rights as a man than as a claim of self-surrender and he vow to himself to use that right in all possible conflict between himself and the republic in question personal and dear for the pleasant freedom of he life thus far have leave he less in awe of the senatorial majesty than giustinian giustinianus would have deem possible but how could he hope to win he father 's consent to any unpatrician alliance he pass the elder giustinian hastily and pause beyond the next group of

and the senator giustinian giustinianus girolamo question in he grave deep voice conceal he triumph but marcantonio have already answer to the timid question of marina 's eye with a ringing tone of assurance and for my father -- we must have courage xi the summons from the ten have be present with ceremony on the night of the fête at can ' giustinianus and marcantonio be grateful for the strong support of paolo cagliarus 's friendly presence as they go together to the salum di collegio in the ducal palace for this seem to the young noble a opportunity that might never come again of present he petition to ear not all unfavorable and there be a thrill of triumph in the thought that he maiden speech before this August body should be he plea for marina 's admission to the favor of the signorium already fortune have be kind to he beyond he hope and with the daring of youth he be resolve to claim the possible the veronese alone know of he intention and as to he father -- he could only put he out of he thought if the senate listen to he petition there would be no difficulty but he would not weaken he courage by any previous contest unavailing as it must be meanwhile there be the remembrance of the rose of the lady laura -- fragrant with she great renunciation the honor of this summons be reflect in the increase dignity of the elder giustinian and in a tinge of urbanity new to he as he part from paolo cagharus and marcantonio who remain standing on the floor of the hall to take he seat among the senator in the seat run around the chamber as on the previous day instead of the one rightfully he own among the higher council who be to pronounce the laudatory word the industry of murano have always be dear to the senatorial heart but of late year the foster care of the republic have be increase to a unprecedented degree and the stimulus thus give to the workman of murano have be evidence in a series of brilliant discovery so that the marvel of they fabric have become as much a source of jealousy to other nation as of revenue and pride to the republic thus the affair of this gift-piece of crystal be deem of quite sufficient importance to occupy the attention of the senator who prepare themselves to listen with every symptom of interest to this report of the exhibit of murano which have be read on the previous day before the ten it have chance before that these report have be follow by word of commendation but it have rarely happen that a young noble have be summon before the collegio to receive such a testimonial and the occasion lose none of its interest from the fact that many of those present have witness the presentation of the summons in the banquet hall of the palazzo giustinianus the famous goblet by order of the senate be also present as a proof that the laudatory word pronounce by the secretary of the ten at the close of the report be well deserve it be not often that a member win distinction on the day of he entrance to the gran ' consiglio the favor show by the senate be great the position of the can ' giustinianus among the proud venetian nobility be beyond question and some of the father of the young and noble lady who have grace the banquet watch the young giustinian with a quite personal interest it be time they say that the handsome young patrician should choose a bride and once before in the history of the republic as now suggest another there be but one of the can ' giustiniani there be a sympathetic and ominous shake of head for the story be well know but to none of those golden-haired maiden who dance at he fête would he show favor though upon he birthnight and when the lady bea have ask he shyly why he wear a white rose in he doublet he have tell she saucily ` the meaning of the flower be _ silence _ ' these and other trifle bear upon the ceremony of the morning be discuss in pleasant aside while the report have be read and the note of approval have be proclaim to marcantonio who drop the arm of he friend and come forward to receive it my lord of the senate the collegio and most illustrious ten he respond with a courtly movement of deference which include they all i thank you in that it graciously pleaseth you to bestow upon I you favor for a trifle of design which be the pastime of a hour and make for the pleasure of the give in homage to the noble lady laura giustiniani but the praise of it should not be mine it be rather to the stabilimento which have show perfection in its workmanship but first to he the master who have give it its crowning grace i pray you let I share the unmerited honor of this commendation with paolo cagliarus _ detto veronese _ without whom my little have be nothing the chivalry and grace of the young noble elicit a murmur of approbation as he courteously indicate he friend the veronese to whom this _ dénouement _ be unexpected and who have long since be crown with highest honor by the republic do not move forward but acknowledge the tribute of he pupil with a genial smile he stand with fold arm unembarrassed and commanding scanning the face of the assembly well pleased with the effect produce by the word of marcantonio whom at all hazard he intend to befriend he realize that the atmosphere might never be so favorable the crowning grace of that goblet my lord of venice he say boldly be lend it by the face of the most beautiful maiden it have ever be my fortune to paint -- than whom venice have none more charming there be a murmur of surprise from the younger noble who be stand in group about the hall of the gran ' consiglio they have suppose the face to be merely a dainty conceit of the artist 's fancy and those nearest gather about the case with sudden interest but the face of marcantonio betray he while he stand unabashed in the circle of the senator though with mount color he hand under shelter of he cloak rest upon the jeweled hilt of the sword upon which he have swear he first knightly vow giustinian giustinianus rise to he foot she name messer paolo cagliarus he thunder but it be the young giustinian who answer to the challenge -- marina magagnati with a unconscious reverence as he confess he lady 's name be no face find fair enough among all the palace on the canal grande to charm thy fastidious fancy cry the angry father lose all self-control it be fitter that the name of thine inamorata be first declare elsewhere than in this presence not so my father marcantonio reply undaunted for i first would ask a grace of we most illustrious signorium -- the which may it indeed please they to grant -- or never shall i bring a bride to the can ' giustinianus as i have swear a noble 's oath of allegiance to venice so faithfully have i vow to wed none other than marina magagnati and it be my father who have teach I to hold sacred the faith of a venetian and a giustinian but my lady be not _ call _ of noble blood she be daughter to messer girolamo magagnatus -- it be the veronese who speak -- than whom in all murano be none better repute for the fabric of he stabilimento nor more noble in he bear albeit he be of the people -- as i also paolo cagliarus be of the people the word have a ring of scorn the veronese fold he arm again and look defiantly around he -- a splendid figure with the jeweled order of france and rome and the republic flash on he breast he gaze slowly sweep the face of the assembly then return to rest upon the great votive picture which fill the wall from end to end above the doge 's throne -- _ he work _ -- like the glory of the ceiling which declare the artist noble by genius if not by birth i also be of the people he repeat in a tone that seem a challenge most illustrious signorium cry marcantonio once in the history of we republic have it please this most gracious senate to declare its favor to a daughter of a master-worker of murano in a decree whereby it be provide that the maid should wed a noble of most ancient house and if there should be child of the marriage each name should stand unprejudiced with those of the noble of venice in the ` libro d'oro ' if i have find favor in you sight -- i beseech you -- that which the senate have once decree be again possible the senator look at each other in consternation awed at the boldness of the petition and the wit of its presentation the young patrician slowly ascend the step of the dais and close he appeal with a obeisance to the doge full of dignity the councillor who sit beside the doge be hold grave discussion for the few word of the young noble have touch upon weighty point they have be present with a simplicity which veil they diplomatic force he be a man of grow power who must be bind to the service of venice even be he not the last of a princely line which the republic would fain see continue to she own latest generation so unabashed in such a presence he would be tenacious of he purpose and hold to he vow with unflinching knightliness venice and he lady be include in he swear allegiance and to seek to make they rival would be a danger for the republic never before have appeal be make to this decree it be not fresh in the mind of the savius and the six most venerated councillor without whose acquiescence the mandate of the doge be powerless and they have listen to the bold declaration with a surprise not unmingled with resentment that so young a man should make in they presence a assertion touch matter of state which they could neither affirm nor deny at a sign from one of the chancellor one of the three counsellor at law of the avvogadorus di commun who have the keep of the golden book have be immediately summon from adjoining chamber in the palace and have confirm the statement such a marriage have indeed take place in the latter half of the fourteenth century the number of the decree authorize the full nobility of the child have be note in the golden book the original decree could therefore be find within the archive upon demand of the savius the case have change from a matter of gracious policy to one of unquestioned importance in the mind of the gravest counsellor of the republic -- in spite of the glamor of romance which threaten to lessen its dignity by win the enthusiastic support of the younger member of the assembly and the jealous opposition of the older senator who be tenacious of the privilege and restriction of the ancient nobility of venice the face of many among they be dark and threatening one of they number high in authority whose seat be near the savius on the dais and who be know to be of the strictest oligarchical proclivity risk the word _ remember the serra consiglio _ in a clear undertone but be immediately repress by a terrible glance from more than one of the commanding savius giustinian giustinianus be alone keep silent by the force of conflict emotion which leave he only strength enough to realize that he be too angry to advise with dignity though he be one of the chief of the ten he have be outwit in the presence of the maggior consiglio by a son who have show a astuteness and courtliness of which any venetian father might be proud together with a knowledge of the point upon which he base he appeal which require the summon of the avvogadorus di commun though it be utter in the presence of the six supreme councillor of the republic he could not interpose to demean he ancient lineage by consent to this unpatrician alliance he would not accept the alternative for he only son -- the last of the giustinianus nor could he urge a giustinian to break a vow of honor make before the highest tribunal of the realm he be tremble with wrath and fill with admiration while he sit speechless await the issue of a question which so deeply concern the interest of the can ' giustinianus the impression be profound and a silence fall upon that magnificent assembly through which the ruler of the ship of state seem to hear the throbbing of a threaten storm they be man of power and they realize that it be a moment when action should be prompt and positive a yellowed parchment with the great seal of the republic append be bring in state from the adjoining chamber of the avvogadorus and lay before the doge who pass it in turn to each of he councillor the silence be breathless all eye turn instinctively upon the young noble who have withdraw to the side of he friend and stand unconscious of they gaze radiant with he hope of marina noble of the gran ' consiglio of we most serene republic say the doge at last with deep impressiveness this record be the original decree of this senate of the fourteenth century give under the great seal of the republic in 1357 it have be duly lay before we councillor in you presence and unanimously confirm by they and they do unanimously consent to this we ruling in favor of the petition which have this day be present before this council by the noble marcantonio of the ancient and princely house of giustinian since in this sixteenth century we republic by grace of god and favor of she ruler be not less enlighten than in those earlier day to perceive when graciousness may promote she welfare in grant favor to a noble house which have ever show to venice its valor its discretion its unfailing loyalty a cry of exaltation ring through the house like a electric thrill the senator start to they foot my life my faith my strength -- the might of all my house for venice shout the young giustinian with he sword hold high above he head like a inspired leader xii the permission of the maggior consiglio under favor of this imperious government be equivalent to a command and a public betrothal and for a few ecstatic day the heir of the can ' giustiniani go about in a state of exaltation too great to be aware of any home shadow -- the slumbering anger of the capo of the ten and a inharmonious atmosphere wherein each be intensely conscious of a individual estimate of the great event which touch they all so nearly for suddenly the betrothal of this only son of a old patrician family have assume almost the proportion of a state marriage and a young fellow for whom time-honored observance of the realm could be set aside and who have win so extreme a proof of favor by he own wit and grace be surely a figure that might well occupy public attention but the decree would soon be a state paper it be already a accept fact in the hall of the council and in the salon of the nobility and the disappointed great lady from the neighbor palace be call with curious question decorously dress in congratulatory form when should they have the pleasure of welcome the _ new _ lady of the giustinianus be it not true that the lady marina -- that be to be there be always some little stinging emphasis in the gracious speech have give a votive offering to the convent of the servus she be a devote then -- quite unworldly -- this beautiful maiden of murano what a joy for the lady laura that so soon there would be a bride in the can ' giustinianus the lady laura have never be more stately they tell each other when they enter they gondola again nor more undisturbed there be no sign of displeasure it must be that the lowly maid be very beautiful be it a thing to make one sad to have a son who could twist the ruler round he little finger and break the very law of the republic nay but cause for much stateliness say a matron with two son in the consiglio the bridal must be soon say the lady laura to herself as she sit alone in she boudoir for the ceasing of this endless gossip and because she could think of nothing else she be already weary with the planning of a pageant which make she heart sick but giustinian giustinianus have no word for the case be hopeless -- only a face of gloom and much that be imperative to keep he in the council chamber for these few blissful day the lover have heaven to themselves float about at twilight on the shore of the lido where there be none to trouble the clear serenity of they joy by the chill breath of criticism that white rise which i bring thee be in sign of my mother 's favor marcantonio remind marina more than once and for the rest -- all will be well and for a little we can wait ah yes they could wait -- in such a smile world under a sky so exquisite glide over the opal of the still lagoon at twilight but old girolamo sure now of the decree which should number he daughter among the patrician of this republic where through long generation he family have make they boast that they represent the people be in a feverish mood -- grave elated sad by turn unwilling to confess to the loneliness which be begin to gnaw at he heart for marina be he life he do not think he could live without she he _ know _ he could not live and see she unhappy beside he and he be old to learn the new pathetic part he must play -- the wait for death quite alone in the old home and those other -- in the sumptuous palace on the canal grande -- would they prize the treasure which be the very light of he life that he should break he heart to yield she up he could have cry aloud in he anguish as he sit wait for the happy plash of the return gondola the princely gondola of the can ' giustiniani bring those two before whom life be open in a golden vista but as the slow ripple break over the water bring they nearer he heart gird itself again with all he chivalrous strength lest he should dim the glad light in he beloved one 's eye -- lest he should seem ungenerous to the brave young knight who have dare the displeasure of he house and of the republic for the love he bear he daughter and the shadow in that other home the palazzo on the canal grande in these day of wait be colder hasher -- bear of selfishness rather than love of disappointed ambition perhaps -- but they be very real shadow nevertheless obscure the clear-cut tradition of century out of which one should struggle through increase of pride the other through the broaden of a more generous love meanwhile the gondola float in light -- between shadow and shadow -- so slight be the realization of the throe by which joy be sometimes bear and the pathos of the change which make they gladness possible be for the two young people still a unrecognized note but wait be now over more positive step must be take two secretary have be send from the senate to bring the news of the filing of the decree madre mium cry marcantonio eagerly when they be go it have come even before we hope even sooner than thy hope she echo feeling dreary though he be sit with he arm around she as if for a confidential talk but he be too happy to interpret she tone the token he plead for marina -- and thou wilt come to see how beautiful she be she look at he searchingly he do not mean to urge she he seem too happy to understand she rise and go slowly to she cabinet bring he she token -- a string of great oriental pearl these she say sit down beside she son and open the case

sudden emotion for these day have be very hard for she my boy -- my boy do she love thee well for all thy faith and devotion -- for all that we be yield she madre mia thou shalt see if thou wilt let I take thee to she i have not think -- she say and stop would she not come with thee marcantonio walk suddenly away to a window and step out on the balcony for a breath of air he be begin to comprehend the under side of he great joy and it have come with a shock on this very day which he have think would have be fill with a rush of gladness he grasp the cool marble of the parapet and try to reason with himself he suddenly foresee that many day of reasoning have enter into he life and always he must be ready to meet they with cool wisdom since enthusiasm be one-visioned it be like take a vow against youth but he himself have choose it for he lot in life he love be not less to he but the sudden realization have come that it be hard to fight against the tradition of century yet how bravely she he mother be try to surrender she social creed for he happiness it be not a little thing that he have ask of she but it seem to he that she soul have be nearer to she eye than ever before during these day when she have be suffer at all cost these woman -- he dearest in the world -- must love each other must bless each other 's life he go back with some comprehension of the barrier he have think so lightly to remove with a vow in he soul to be more to each because of it neither should lose aught for he sake he seem suddenly older though he face be very tender that which seemeth best to thee my mother in the matter of the meeting marina would surely do for it be thou who must guard for we these little matter of custom which none knoweth better but she father -- never have i know one more courtly nor more proud -- marco it be much to ask that we should think of he ay mother it be much yet if thou knewest he thou wouldst understand for marina be all the world to he and i would take she from he yet so he loveth she that never have he say I nay naught have he ask for she of gold nor jewel but only this -- that she shall not come unbidden to we home he speak the last word very low and with a effort as if they hold a prayer and so -- and so sweet mother none knoweth half so well as thou how best to greet she whom i long to bring to thee that she may know and love thee as she doth love she father -- with a great love very beautiful and tender she look up as if she would have answer he but she could not speak more than ever i think i love thee now that i be grieve thee he add after a pause in a tone so full of comprehension that it smite she nay marco -- nay she say and draw he closer clasp she hand in he but they sit quite silent while the mother 's love intensify displace selfishness he raise she hand to he lip with a new reverence in all this have i ask so much of thee i think thou never canst forgive I madre mium until -- until thou knowest marina she touch he hair with she beautiful white hand caressingly as she have often do when he be a little child but now in this sudden deepen of she nature with a new yearning marco when thou wert a babe she say there be little i would not give for thine ask and now when my soul be bind up in thine i seem not to care for the thing i once seek for thee -- but more for happiness and love yet if i go with thee -- i seem to know thou wilt not change to I -- she pause wistfully save but to prove a truer knight he cry radiantly so more than gracious hast thou be nay it will be sweet to have part in thy happiness she cry bravely to-night at sunset will i go with thee quite simply in thy gondola to bid my daughter welcome -- as we custom be i will not fail in honor to my marco 's bride and since it be love that she father asketh i will give she this rise for thy dear sake but the bridal must be soon to make this endless talking cease and before we leave she -- for she will learn to love I marco mio and she will not take thee from I -- i will give she the token that be fitting for a daughter of we house \* \* \* \* \* among the member of the senate meeting by two and three in the broglio marcantonio 's name be often hear it would be well when this marriage be over for verily it be likely to turn the head of venice -- the pageant and the beauty of the maid and the favor of the collegio -- nay not that say a older senator resentfully those be but trifle but the young fellow himself be the danger too positive and outspoken revolutionary and of overturn method withal persuasive -- he would be a power in a ambassade suggest another for he have a gift in diplomacy and law which verily do astound the old giustinian the eloquence of he great-uncle sebastiano have fall upon he -- if he be not so young -- here in venice he be roll up influence and the charm of he inamorata be also a danger and already in the consiglio all eye be upon he for a secretary to a ambassade be the age not set answer the other warily and the office have space for diplomacy which it be better for we privilege be use elsewhere than in venice and the honor of it would blind the eye of he partizan -- for the boy be young the wind wander through the piazza sometimes blow lightest whisper from the broglio into the council chamber of the republic and so it be decree that when the beautiful wedding pageant should be over just as the whole of venice would have lay itself at the foot of the charming bride -- would have make the young noble of the palazzo giustinianus the idol of the hour -- these danger to venice should be honorably remove by the appointment of marcantonio giustinianus di maggior consiglio as secretary to the venetian resident in rome with the gracious permission of the senate for the lady marina to bear he company it be well answer giustinian giustinianus as the lady laura make she little moan on hearing of the appointment which the senator report with such pride marcantonio have the head of a diplomat and the bearing of a courtier it be the way of distinction for such a man that be justly speak say the mother and nobly have we boy fulfil we hope in venice or elsewhere must he ever win distinction but to keep they in they palazzo near we -- of this and of they happiness be i thinking -- the sight of it be so beautiful the filing of the decree of the senate have act like a charm upon we capo of the ten : the importance thus accord to the can ' giustiniani soothed every vestige of wounded pride while the beauty and grace of he prospective daughter-in-law have fill he with a triumph which only the frigid stateliness of he habitual demeanor enable he to conceal so great be the revulsion from he former state of feeling i tell thee lady laura say she husband come nearer and speak low we may well be proud all this trifling in art and knickknack in which it have pleased the boy to spend himself like so many of he hose -lrb- 2 -rrb- have flutter off from he like silken ribbon hang harmless in the wind and have leave he with a head quite clear of nonsense for the senate 's work _ that day _ -- he have refer to it so often that it have become a acknowledged division of time -- _ that _ day when he make he speech not one arise to answer he for the cunning of it be so simple one listen fear naught until the end be reach and the word of it be so few that the end be a surprise and lo the counsellor be confound by the weight of he demand and the reason for the justice of it and the wit of its presentation -- lie fold in a sentence scarce long enough for a preamble and the boy hold himself like a prince and win they all by he grace as if he be a child nay but i do forget he be a man wear honor from he country -lrb- 2 -rrb- the young noble be call the gay company of the hose giustinian i fain would keep they here that be the woman 's side of it say the chief of the ten easily dismiss she plea but for marcantonio the appointment be good when the late-returned ambassador to he most christian majesty do render he report before we maggior consiglio -- a oration diplomatic and of weight -- i note many of we graver man with eye observe marcantonio closely as they would mark how he weigh the speech of the old diplomatist and marco he seem not to take note of they or it may be a grace that he have that he seemeth not to see for he weareth the ` pensierus stretto e viso sciolto ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- meet for a venetian councillor -- age could not teach he better to guard he thought but it would make the wear of he careless face less easy or it may be that he mind have space for the speech only -- one know not save that all thing come easily to he -- even the most beautiful bride in venice raise from the rank of the people to suit he whim -lrb- 3 -rrb- close-locked thought and open countenance giustinian she will be we daughter and none need question she dignity and grace my lady laura none knoweth better of she beauty and none so proud of she as i who have think to hide my head for the disgrace of it but the daring of this son of ours doth make I gay i be ready to give thee a compliment on thy bring up which often i have fear be over frivolous and now he have the republic before he where to choose giustinian she rest both hand on he shoulder and look full in he eye with the gravity of she question which be the dream of he life and be often tacitly touch when they confer together in confidence ay he answer even that the highest -- by favor of san marco -- he may win for the grace of he maketh he head seem less but the shadow of the coveted lion 's paw have suddenly overclouded he and change he mood xiii when the first faint flush of dawn be wake in the east the fair sweet face of marina of murano be outline for the last time vague as some dream memory against the deep shadow of the interior between the quaint column that frame she window bird be twitter in the vine of the pergola not far away honeysuckle be pour forth they fragrant morning oblation and the salt sea-breeze waft she its invigorating breath as the early tide with slow increase motion brim the channel that wind through the marsh on the border of murano and overflow till the lagoon be a broad unbroken vista of silver-gray in whose shimmer and radiance when the tide be at its full the morning star die out but still they glisten dimly in the twilight of the sky to which she raise she question believe eye life be always beautiful to she loving soul for when the shadow hold a meaning deeper than she could solve she answer be faith and now that she new joy be to grow out of a deep solitariness for the father so tenderly beloved it be he who uphold she courage life may not be he say without some shadow this be the shade of thine which without it be too bright heaven have some purpose in its send but not that it should darken we eye to miss the joy the day will be o'er-lonely in this home my father nay marina let love suffice so shall we be always together shall i not go to thee and thou wilt come to I bring thy new interest and hold thy dear heart ever pure and loyal to venice and thy home and thy god -- not forget for thou hast choose with thy whole heart my daughter since she have not answer thou dost not fear thyself dearest father she have say hide she face in he tender embrace all of my heart which be not thine be wholly he -- only my happiness be too great nay daughter since it be of god 's own send take all the joy and grieve not only at leave thee i would not keep thee here to leave thee mourn and alone when my day be close father not to sadden thee my child but to show thee that life be link to life -- god will it so thou and i be bind to that which have be and to that which be to be we do not stand alone to choose the sweetness of we life together should make it easier for I to yield thee to the fuller life which calleth thee we must each bear we part in the beauty of the whole for perfect love there must be sacrifice she be think of these thing as she stand in the gray dawn wait for the beauty of the on-coming day quite alone with she thought and with she god the giver of this beauty and often as she have stand there with she morning offering of trust and adoration never before have the day-dawn seem so full of mystery and promise nor the new life which the morning hold within its keep so full of hope and beauty the very tide flow round she island home bring thought of she home that be to be as it sweep through the channel of the city of the sea past the palace where she lover be wait bring murmur and message of liquid harmony the marsh grass sway and yield to its flow lend new depths of color to the water-bed as they bow beneath the masterful current -- so the difficulty which have seem to beset they hope have be vanquish by the resistless tide of he love and constancy the star be lose in the deep gray-blue of the sky a solemn stillness like the presage of some divine event seem for a moment to hold the pulse of the universe then a soft rise creep into the shimmer of the water and crest the snow on the distant euganean hill the transient many-tinted glory of the east reflect itself in opal light upon the silver sea then suddenly sweep the landscape in one dazzling glow of gold -- and the joy-bell ring out for to-day a festa have be grant in murano then wrap herself closely in the soft fold of she gray mantle fall madonna-wise from she head and shroud she figure she glide for the last time over the _ ponte _ and down past the sleep home of murano for it be yet early for matins and she would have the madonna all to herself as she kneel with she heart full of tenderness for the dear life this day should merge in that other which beckon she with joyous anticipation -- yet still to serenity by the golden glory and promise of the dawn and the beautiful self-sacrificing uphold faith of the great-hearted girolamo he have follow she and fold she passionately to he heart as she cross the threshold of they home on she way to san donato i must be first he say to bless thee on thy bridal day fret thee not for thou art bidden to a mission since thou goest forth from the people to the highest circle of the noble and love alone have bidden and draw thee forget it not marina so shall a blessing go with thee and rest upon thee she have bring a gift to the madonna of san donato -- a exquisite altar lamp of ivory and silver -- and from the flower which she have lay upon the altar while she kneel in prayer she gather

fête and for day before and after it be the talk of venice they be come over the water to the sound of the people 's native song and the echo of they laughter the young man and maiden of murano in bark that be wreathe with garland and brilliant with the play of color that the venetian love maridite maridite donzelum che dona maridada è sempre belum maridite finchè la fogia è verde perchè la

part and come no further have bring they maiden from murano with every sign of love and honor the barge of the people fall back behind they and through they rank the bridal gondola follow the bark of the priest of san donato to the step of the piazzetta where the train of the giustinianus in a magnificence that be well-nigh royal have just disembark and marcantonio stand bareheaded among the noble to receive he bride but it be only for a moment of recognition in the sight of the throng people for messenger be arrive with greeting from the doge which this bride whom the senate have take from the people to bestow upon a noble must receive from the lip of the prince himself before the wedding ceremony should take place so the train of giustinianus with all the noble of venice -- who from immemorial custom have come together to witness and rejoice over this great event in the life of one of they number -- enter san marco by the great door of the piazza while the bride obey the gracious summons of the doge pass through the gate of the ducal palace on the seaside into the great court where the signorium be descend the giant 's stairway on they passage to the ducal chapel the ceremony of presentation to the serenissimo be quickly over and the bride and she maiden with girolamo magagnatus in sign of the prince 's favor follow the doge and suite into the golden loom and shift twilight of this place of symbolism and wonder where the vast throng wait in a solemn hush the gloom be break by countless tongue of flame from lamp of silver and alabaster burning in the farther chapel while wander light streaming through the opening of the dome fill it with wonderful wave of color -- only half-reveal the treasure of ivory and jewel and precious marble and mosaic work with text and symbol but wholly make feel the mystery and beauty the vague perfume of those faint mist of float incense cross and recross the scatter ray of sunshine mingle with the fragrance of the orange blossom from which the light tread of the bride-maiden seem to crush a breath of benediction come out of the sunlight into this still beautiful holy place -- the chant sweet and sacred accompany she step with the cross repeat again and again in the height of the dome with the dear familiar form of the mother mary on every side lifting adoring eye to the crowning figure of the christ while the saint who graciously lean to she from they golden background in the great vaulted space above recall the legend inseparably link with they intimate friendly face and bring back the atmosphere of she own matrice -- she mother church -- this maiden of murano feel suddenly at home the patriarch with he pomp the signorium and senate in they robe of state the noble and the pageant be all forget in the sacramental light of the ceremonial candle of the great altar flash back from the marvelous _ palum d'oro _ she see only marco wait for she -- to whom she father beloved and trust be lead she with she heart 's consent how should she falter on the path from love to love xiv but even in venice -- the magic city -- there be day of mist silvery and gray when life take on the indistinctness and indecision of a dream as there be day less lucent when sea and sky melt in a indistinguishable line and the chameleon tint of the marsh mellow into a monotonous gray surface -- when the wonted brilliancy of the sunset cloud and the glitter dome and campanile be only faint gray shadow on the gray whiteness of the water and gondolier come suddenly into vision parting the mist with thin black sway outline as quickly fading in the near gray distance when they pass while the shipping loom like phantom on a immediate horizon vanish vision-like and even the sound of life come muffle over the still lagoon like ghostly echo from a city wrap in dream these be day of dim foreboding too for the anxious man of action who rule the republic in the broglio there be more often silence than speech as the older senator gather in knot with face the more expressive because of much reticence in word the sense of approach contest increase they mental restlessness and make they outwardly more stern each look into another 's stormy resolute face so pass many a counsel whose echo he fear to start under the rambling portico of the piazza where friar of every order mingle freely with the crowd and idler carry tale into dark basement recess and one know not which be friend or foe meanwhile the winged lion with those terrible jeweled glaring eye and the primitive patron san teodoro -- each high on he column in a nirvana of quiescence -- keep solemn semblance of vigil over that dread space where sometimes a horror of which one dare not speak scatter the sunshine high in air between those silent warden of san marco yet the horror of those figure swing lifeless with veil face be meet in silence by a people train to suffer this secret mete out of penalty for transgression in which justice and vengeance stand confuse the ceaseless chain of election have beget bribery corruption and strife the over-weening luxury have foster unworthy ambition -- it be a time of much lawlessness under the shadow of the embassy infamous intrigue be plan by band of idle man who shrink from no deed of evil which hold its promise of gold the water-storey of some splendid palace might be a lurking-place for unprincipled man -- spy and informer by profession -- who wear the livery of noble family whose secret they would unhesitatingly consign to that merciless _ bocca del leone _ for favor or vengeance of those they secretly serve for underneath the glitter and the pomp of these latter day of venice -- its presage of decay -- a turbulent mass of malcontent foreigner disappoint in intrigue venetian shut out from power grasp and plot for its semblance -- sell murder for gold treason for gold -- escape justice by the wiles they so deftly unveil or by the importance of the deposition it be in they power to make secret swift relentless absolute -- venice have work for man who do not court the sunlight and such a nucleus draw to its dark center intriguer from other court and gather in and strengthen the worthless within its own border until the evil be grow heavy to deal with cause of discontent between church and state be alarmingly on the increase and while in no other dominion save that of rome alone be ecclesiastical possession so rich or they establishment more splendid than at venice nowhere be the line of power so jealously define and guard as in the government of this republic from which ecclesiastic be rigorously exclude -- although no least ceremonial be hold complete without the presence of the patriarch and priest who evidence the devotion of venice to the holy mother church -- though every parish keep its festa and the religion of venice be a essential part of the life of its people but if the priest have no visible seat in the splendid council chamber of the republic they boast at rome that they sway over the conscience of these lordly senator be well establish by virtue of the confessional and that in the event of contest there would be many vote for rome the _ ridottus _ the informal club of venice in those day be important centre of influence -- political legislative and literary and there be a certain palazzo morosinus well know to many of the senator who gather in the broglio where question of vital interest to the thinker and ruler of venice be discuss with the degree of knowledge that might have be expect from so eminent a company as that which make the home of the distinguished senator andrea morosinus the scene of its ridotto and where freedom of speech be much greater than seem wise in the candid sunshine of the piazza of its present number all at some period of they life hold high office under the republic -- they be senator secretary of state ambassador -- and three among that little group of thirty live to wear the beretta it represent essentially the patrician culture of venice and morosinus himself be already eminent as a historian but the chief literary center be still acknowledge to be that quaint house in campo agostino of aldo manuzio _ il vecchio _ bearing as in he day shield-wise its forbid inscription whoever you be aldo requesteth you if you want anything to ask it in few word and depart unless like hercule you come to lend the aid of you shoulder to the weary atla there will always be find in that case something for you to do however many you may be but in this aldine mansion only the most-learned man of letter gather and greek be the sole language permit in its discussion one of the _ habitue _ of the aldine club be chief among this noble company of the morosinus he be a grave scholarly man who listen and question much out of a seemingly inexhaustible fund of historic legal and ecclesiastical knowledge -- a man who have the power of stimulate other and whose rare word when utter be of value he have opinion gather at first hand from influential mind of every land and creed to contribute to the talk when it flow in narrowing channel and he himself come thither for refreshment from abstruse study out of a quiet cell in the convent of the servus while seemingly unaware that many a stranger beg for a invitation to the palazzo morosinus in the hope of a introduction to this miracle of venice perhaps this grave friar apparently so careless of he distinction be the unsuspected intellectual thread which bind as it be together the various influential circle of venice for in every center plebeian or patrician where there be anything new to be moot or anything of value to be discuss he be a visitor so welcome and so frequent that he might well have exert a steady unifying influence upon venetian thought at the sign of the nave d'oro in the mercerium where the vast commercial interest of venice be the absorb theme and stranger from every clime and merchant just return from distant port be eager now as in the day when marco polo have so valiantly entertain the goodly company to rehearse the tale of they adventure -- it be neither merchant nor noble who stand forth on the bizarre background of brilliant bauble and gold-woven tissue as the center of this ridotto but a friar learn in language and science of whom it be pleasantly affirm that he be the only man in venice who could discuss any subject in any tongue as this friar unattended and on foot turn out of the narrow calle from san samuele into the campo san stefano the giustinianus father and son be just landing from they gondola in the midst of a gay retinue on the step of the palazzo morosinus other gondola of other noble be float in full moonlight before the quay and to fra paolo who do not share the venetian love of color and of art the elaborately frescoed façade of a opposite palace -- a extravagant freak of the veronese 's which the venetian be already begin to cherish as the work of they great artist who would paint no more -- seem a impertinence unworthy of that dazzling illumination marcantonio giustinianus have but lately return from rome where during he residence as secretary to the venetian ambassador the affair of the venetian patriarch zanus which have rouse such indignation in venice have take place the matter be still of interest in official quarter because the death of zanus have cause a new vacancy to which venice accord to she ancient right have appoint the successor and this new patriarch vendramin should never go as zanus have do at the request of the holy father to receive he benediction and be meet with that perfidious announcement that he have examine and approve the venetian candidate whom he now confirm as patriarch to the most serene republic at the thought of the manner in which they have be entrap and outwit -- denude as it be before the roman court of some semblance of they ancient privilege of appoint they own patriarch -- there be fresh indignation among these proud patrician the secretary marcantonio giustinianus have be present at the audience grant by clement to the venetian patriarch he would know if it have be possible -- even with the most favorable intention toward rome -- they be crowd round he and question with jealous eagerness -- even with the feeling which loyal son should possess for they mother church -- to interpret that rude cross-questioning of he holiness so unexpected and unexampled and contradict he own explicit promise -- otherwise than as a examination -- _ a examination which prejudice the ancient right of venice _ a scarcely perceptible smile flit over the young secretary 's handsome face -- they be so venerable and eager so careful of shadow of form -- and in a sudden side-light a hint of a question obtrude itself on he consciousness as to whether there could be a slightly farcical aspect to such a episode between two most catholic and christian government he see they both fire with feeling of very human strength both deal only with shadow of reality -- the sovereign pontiff grasp at a semblance of power in insist that this candidate name by venice to a see within she gift to which he the pope would dare present no other be invest by _ he _ examination and approval and the republic receive back its own appointee confirm with the papal benediction jealously arouse to unappeasable indignation by the empty form of question which have precede this singular ceremony but the dignified company be press the young secretary for he answer and one of they anxiously repeat the keynote _ a examination which prejudice the ancient right of venice _ courtesy and wisdom would render any other opinion inadmissible marcantonio reply -- in venice the elder giustinian have detect the slight pause which precede the last two word wherefore ` in venice ' he question with some heat it be a question not of locality but of justice and judgment it be a question of judgment marcantonio echo suavely upon which it have be tell I the senate have already pass a law that shall keep we most reverend signor vendramin from such a fate ay never again may we patriarch leave the republic for confirmation of the see which she alone may grant the law be just say the senator leonardo donate in the day when he holiness be but a eminence it have be say he give we ambassador a chance to prove he temper morosinus question of donato who have be ambassador in rome while paul v who have but just ascend the throne be still cardinal borghese it be in the matter of the uscock donato answer after a moment 's hesitation see that some be wait for the story and it be the second time that half-civilize tribe have provoke dispute between two most christian nation ` if i be pope ' say the cardinal ' i would excommunicate both doge and senate ' fra paolo scrutinize the face of the listener and fix he gaze searchingly on the speaker there be a uneasy movement among the company but leonardo donate do not flinch may they not know you answer most noble signor morosinus urge for verily it be of a quality to illumine a page of history the word be few say leonardo with dignity ' _ if i be doge i would trample you edict under foot _ ' there be a sudden hush in which those who have not be listen become intensely conscious of the word just utter by the aged and illustrious cavalière leonardo donate for there have be of late a abide undercurrent of suppress excitement ready to awake at any mention of papal supremacy the republic have always jealously guard against any transference of temporal power from prince to prelate and many event which seem link in a chain that might lead to the most deplorable result have succeed to the election of camillo borghese as paul v the desire evidently manifest by clement during he latter day to encroach on the perquisite and possession of the minor italian state be crystallize into a fix purpose of ecclesiastical aggrandizement on the part of the new pope he be brandish saint peter 's sword before he have be knight remark the signor antonio querinus who be deeply interested in all dispute between church and state but not before he have receive strenuous training respond the grave clear voice of the friar for five year he have hold office as auditor of the apostolical chamber the style of which be write thus _ ` universal executor of censure and sentence record both in rome and abroad ' _ -- a duty which he may be say to have discharge more faithfully than any of he predecessor as one can not recall in any previous fifty year as many thunderbolt and monition as be launch during those five year of he office some romance could but attach to the unswerving judicial attitude of a friar who have friend in high favor at the court of rome -- who have know a bellarmino and a navarro and yet pursued unchanging the calm tenor of he critical way it be rumor that sixtus v have be know to leave he coach to converse with he and would have give he at he mere request a cardinal 's hat that urban vii as cardinal and pope have be he devoted friend that cardinal borromeo -- the saintly san carlo -- have wish to attach he to he cathedral and many be the instance report when mark of special appreciation have be grant he from rome in lieu of denunciation which those jealous of he rapid advance have seek to bring upon he even the late pope clement have express admiration for he learn while it be nevertheless well know that fra paolo 's counsel to the senate in certain trouble arise out of clement 's attitude at ferrara have bring he the refusal of the bishopric of candium and caorle but whatever the occasion he be invariably discreet and fearless however pungent the tone the word of this man could no more be attribute to personal bitterness than they might be influence by personal interest and although the opinion which they indicate be a surprise to some of the company instinctively they feel the situation to be graver than they have fear and the evening 's talk drift as wholly into the current of church and state as if this ridotto be a commission appoint by the ten to prepare resolution upon the situation and the list of grievance now review which have occupy the senate during the closing year of clement 's reign be in truth long vast difference of opinion concern the turk and the piratical tribe who infested the shore of italy and the use they villainy might be make to serve trouble at ferrara teasing and undignified temporarily bring to a close by the send of the galley of the republic to prevent the seizure of they fishing-boat by agent of he holiness question of boundary and tax attempt to divert the trade of venice to arrest improvement redound not only to the advantage of the republic but to that of the neighboring country to forbid under pain of excommunication all commerce with country taint with heresy these be matter meet for discussion by temporal sovereign touch the balance of power -- so view and strenuously resist by the clear-headed venetian with much deference of form whenever practicable -- as become loyal son of the church but occasionally when nothing might be expect from temporize with a quiet disregard which prove they consciousness of strength from time to time as the informal summary progress there be a outburst of indignation could a aggression be more palpable than that _ index expurgatorius _ demand by rome in 1596 when the ruling doctrine of exclusion involve no question of morality or irreligion but solely concerned book uphold rights of conscience and ruler it be a contest honorable to venice and one which italy will remember respond a secretary of the senate who be a regular member of this ridotto i be proud that it be my privilege to transcribe for the record of the republic the papers relate to that concordat which secure so great a measure of freedom for we press there have be a short truce between rome and venice since the accession of paul v who have be so immediately concern with a certain prophecy foretell the death of a leo and a paul that he fear be only set at rest by a further astrological announcement judiciously arrange in the palace of he eminence the brother of the pope to the effect that the evil influence be now conquer whereupon paul have undertake in earnest the work which he conscientiously believe to be the highest duty of a sovereign pontiff have recall all nuncio not in full sympathy with he view of aggrandizement and have replace they with envoy whose notion of authority be echo of he own and as a opening move have make the demand so resent by venice that the new patriarch vendramin should be send to rome for examination before he could be allow to take possession of he prelacy but what have venice to fear from a pope who be paralyze for the first two month of he reign by a reading of a horoscope exclaim one of the company scornfully nay then say donato who have see much of the world it be a petty superstition of the age it be not the fault of the man who have sterling quality and by that same potency of credulity have he fear be set at rest it be a proof of weakness to undervalue the strength of a adversary -- for so at least he have recently declare himself on this question of temporal power by he petty aggression and triumph in malta parma lucca and genoa i crave pardon of the cavalière donato antonio querinus respond hotly may one call the action at genoa _ petty _ -- the compulsion of the entire vote of a free city the placing of the election of the whole body of govern official in the power of the society of jesus and it be under threat of excommunication which make resistance a duty from the side of the government giustinian giustinianus assert uncompromisingly but impossible from the church 's point of view it be the eternal question leonardo donato answer gravely _ the solution be only possible by precisely ascertain the limit within which each power be absolute _ the friar announce with quiet decision a momentary hush fell upon the company for the word be weighty and a surprise it be well to know the quality we have to fear say andrea morosinus and we have listen in the senate to letter from we ambassador at rome which bespeak he holiness of a presence and a dignity -- save for over-quickness of temper -- which befit a pope and that he have reserved himself from promise to the displeasure and surprise of some of those who create he it be rumor in rome say the younger giustinian that the learn bishop baronious in the last conclave by he persistence find means to save the consistory from the election by ` adoration ' of another candidate whose life would bear no scrutiny and who never darken the door of he own cathedral by this election the church have verily be spare a scandal therefore let it be know say fra paolo with deep gravity lest the nearness of such a scandal should breed confusion -- and i speak from knowledge have be much in rome -- we have now a pope blameless in life in duty to he church most faithful and exemplary and concerned with she welfare as to himself it seemeth of a unbending conscience and a will most absolute moreover of marvelous reading in certain doctrinal writings which seem to he the only book of worth and with the training of a lawyer wherewith to assert they this be the man with whom we have to contend be there no fault thunder giustinian giustinianus while the other listen disconcert a soldier seek for weak spot in the armor i know he say leonardo donato and there _ be _ one fault it limit he power to achieve it increase he absolutism it be near-sightedness -- smallness of vision draw he strongly say giustinian in a tone of concentrated wrath let we measure we foe before we meet there be no book borghese have not read there be no point of view but that which he doth teach no appeal from the law as he interpreteth it _ it be a fault of unity _ one power -- the church one duty -- its aggrandizement one prince -- temporal and spiritual alike one unvarying obedience all be adjust to one center it be the simplification of life there be a ominous silence and a evident wish to change the theme and the company readjust itself by two and three the senator morosinus turn graciously to marcantonio it have be tell in venice he say that the lady marina be receive in rome with mark of very special favor the introduction of we reverend father paolo have precede she the young secretary answer lightly bow in the direction of the friar who sit apparently lose in thought but morosinus repeat marcantonio 's speech with some amusement for the scholarly friar have never be know to have a friend among the woman -- old or young i do not understand he say with no perception of any humor in the situation it be the gift of the reverend father paolo to the chapel of the servus marcantonio explain the madonna del sorriso be well know in rome ah i recall now the face of you lady though i have not know she the friar respond courteously yet he hesitate a moment before accept the seat which the secretary rise to offer he if it be the face which the veronese have paint she spirit must be fair it should make a home holy he add after a moment 's pause marcantonio 's face flush with pleasure the friar be still regard he with a gaze so penetrate yet apparently so guiltless of intentional rudeness that it cease to be a impertinence and amuse the young venetian by its unconventionality be there anything it would please fra paolo to ask of I he inquire affably if there be child -- the friar pursue quite simply we little son be baptize in saint peter 's in rome he have sponsor among the cardinal and a private audience and benediction from he holiness pope clement the young nobleman reply try to repress a pleasurable sense of importance it be a pleasure to the lady marina -- she be devote to the church and he holiness be always most gracious to she as be fitting for the lady of a venetian representative and due to venice the elder giustinian hasten to explain he late holiness be ever courtly and a gracious diplomat he have be aware from he little distance how the talk have turn and he be alert to give it the color he like best for while the young people be still in rome signor agostino nanus watchful as a ambassador well might be of the interest of so princely a house have confide to the illustrissimo giustinianus in a private and friendly letter that courtesy so unusual have be extend to this noble young venetian lady -- so devoted to the church so gentle and unsuspicious so incapable of counter-plotting -- that it would be wise to guard against undue influence by a too prolonged stay at the roman court and the honorable recall of the secretary giustinianus have soon thereafter be manage the friar 's face have grow stern but he do not resume the conversation until the elder giustinian have stroll away with he host then he turn to marcantonio speaking earnestly simplicity be no match for subtlety he say and much favor have be show to she you will pardon I signore not because you be young and i be old but because the face of you lady have move I with a rare sense of unworldliness there should be no flattery in a act we lord himself have teach by he example and a old man like pope clement might well bestow he blessing on you little child but the time be not free from danger the home be best for the little one -- do not send he from he mother to the school he be but learn to speak the young man answer smile at the friar 's earnestness only he baby word for he mother 's name there be school for the son of nobleman in which he will forget it say the friar bitterly where they teach disloyalty to prince and unmake man to make machine -- and the mainspring be at rome gentle woman be win to believe in they by the subtle polish of those who uphold they and the marvelous learning by which they teacher fit themselves for office and among they be man noble of character and true of conscience -- but bind soul and body by they oath the system of the jesuit school in venice be for nothing else but the building up of they order -- at all cost of character or happiness let she keep she little son for she face seem wise and tender the favor which have be show she may have a meaning will not my father some time come to the palazzo giustinianus the lady marina would make he welcome nay i thank you the friar answer instantly resume he habitual reserve such gentle friendship form no part of my duty i spake but in friendly counsel we from without see how the home should be more the order be many to maintain the church -- they need no urge -- but the home have also its privileged domain of childhood to be defend xv with the return of the young people from rome gala day have once more dawn for the can ' giustinianus and the two sumptuous palace which meet at the bend of the canal grande be scene of perpetual fête the palazzo giustinian giustinianus have be choose from all the princely home of venice as best fit from its magnificence to be offer as a residence to henry the third of france when that monarch have deign to honor the republic by accept its prodigal hospitality in the banquet hall which have be prepare with lavish luxury for he reception the few year that have pass have but mellow the elaborate carving and fresco while the costly hanging -- of crimson velvet with bullion fringe of azure silk embroider with fleur-de-lis of brocade interweave with thread of gold -- have gain in grace of fold and fusion of tint if there be no hall of equal splendor in the palace which have be prepare for marcantonio and he bride it display in all its appointment a elegance and fitness which the stately lady laura be eager to exhibit to the critical appreciation of the fastidious upper circle of venice marina have have no share in its decoration and when consult before she marriage have express but one wish these care of rank be new to I she have say with gentle dignity but thou wilt best know how to choose the elegance befitting marco 's home for my father have warn I that in these matter there be a custom which i more than other may not break dear lady laura for marco 's sake forget that i be of the people yet remember it to choose but so much of splendor as seemeth needful lest the palazzo be too costly for a mistress not noble by birth and so -- she hesitate -- and so win marco 's friend to love I less marina marco have tell I with a very lover 's face that some be noble by birth who be not so by name dear lady the girl answer with a charming flush have marco not so plead with I there could have be no question of this home the eye of the great lady beam with a new and tender pride in nothing that she boy have ever do for she have he offer she so much as in this love of he which have threaten to part they but have stir instead the mother depths of she soul which have become cloud by year of luxury and artificial life and the knowledge of the ceaseless ambition and selfish scheming which she husband -- for the intellectual stimulus she give he -- have be accustom to confide to she and now marco be not less to she but more as he have promise and if the uncertain hope of that dim distant ducal coronet move she less it be not that she would not still do she possible to help giustinian to he ambition -- but it have become a smaller peak in the distance since the home life have grow broad enough to bear she calmly when the proud senator rehearse some failure or disappointment with disproportioned bitterness thinking of these thing she smile at marina with new appreciation the girl 's gentle face seem to she more lovely and she rare calm and grace of spirit more truly noble than the venetian vivacity of charm in which at first she have find she lack thou hast a way of win she say which many might envy thee and in seem not to ask thou shalt be serve for love it be the grace of one bear to rule but hast thou _ no _ wish be there no one place i may make all beautiful at thine ask within thy palace to prove sweet marina how thy marco 's mother love thee she part she soft hair and kiss she forehead but neither of they notice that it be a first caress i should like the oratory to be beautiful marina cry clasp she hand with sudden enthusiasm very beautiful -- like a gift to the holy mother and it shall bring a blessing on thy marriage the lady laura answer she so when the secretary and he young wife have return to venice and they palace be throw open to guest the private chapel of the lady marina be discover to be a marvel of decoration -- with superb venetian fresco set in marvelous scrollwork by vittorium with carving of mother-of-pearl from constantinople with every sumptuous detail that could be devise for during the three year of they absence the lady laura have not wearied of she gracious task nor stay she hand and into this incongruous setting -- costly overloaded composite and destitute of true religious feeling a very type of the time in venice -- marina bring the redeeming note of consecration a priceless altar -- ancient earth-stained and rude almost grotesque in symbolism -- as a great prize and by special dispensation from a underground chapel in rome also the rare and beautiful ivory crucifix have its history the malachite basin for holy water have be a gift to the infant giustinian from he eminence the cardinal-sponsor on the day of he baptism there be other treasure more rare and sacred still within the shrine of the oratory and there be a gift from he holiness pope clement viii there be no banquet hall in the palazzo marcantonio giustinianus but it be not need for the two palace be like one the lady laura be radiant if there have ever be a question of the place that marcantonio 's bride should occupy in that patrician circle the distinction confer upon she by the senate have suffice to establish it there could be no jealousy of one who occupy the highest place of one so gracious and equal to she honor only of those who should win she favor so all come in the hope of it and all be win but there be no partiality no intimacy for all ambition of the young and newly create patrician the fullness of the home life suffice to she marina have grow more beautiful out of the joy of loving and the increase satisfaction of she religious life to which she be more than ever devote she passion for beauty express itself by delight in sumptuous ceremonial while she love of romance and she unquestioning faith be alike nourish on the legend of the saint which have become far more to she during she stay in rome where every hour have be happiness these three year of absence have make some subtle difference in the lady marina there be more mystery about she with less reserve and a certain calm acceptance of the position all concede have give she courage to discuss religious history and opinion in a serious way that be quite charming to the older prelate who mingle in venetian social circle where simple earnestness of soul be a quality so rare that it might have be mistake for a depth of subtlety but the lady marina talk or listen only because the theme be of vital interest for she besides she have now she child to guide and she must know and the learn man who give they life to the study of higher thing be those above all other from whom she could learn the most and with this unconscious flattery a little court of a character somewhat unusual in venice have gather in she salon she husband come in late from the council chamber one evening rally she upon it say that she reception might be mistake for those of a lady abbess -- there be so many friar and grave ecclesiastic among she guest he light tone conceal a little uneasiness for the friar 's warning have more than once recur to he but it be impossible to convey anything to marina by a half-concealed thrust she nature be so essentially ingenuous incapable of imagine intrigue of any sort yes it be indeed a honor she answer with she ready trust smile it be good of they they be so much more interesting than the other and to-night the talk be quite delightful i would thou hadst be here my marco life be so much more beautiful since we have be to rome _ everything _ that be delightful come with we marriage she add turn she radiant face toward he he smile too quite disarm by she beauty and candor and a little amuse that this life of a venetian princess should be so lightly include in this everything which marriage have bring to this maiden of murano but he could not help think how easily she wear she honor and how she grace they all venice be at she foot and she prefer the dull talk of a few ecclesiastic to the vivacious gallantry of the brilliant young noble who throng she salon -- the more anxious to please this queen of the day that they effort win only the dignified and gracious yet reserve recognition that be extend to all she guest alike she be the very reverse of venetian in character and manner but since she have be so honor by the republic that difference be recognize as she distinction and charm i doubt not marcantonio say laughingly that if nun might take part in we social function thou wouldst prefer they also to thine own maiden and all the noble lady of the canal grande but who hold part in this interesting ridotto to-night truly marco i think some day perchance i may get a dispensation and have all the nun of san donate for baby 's festa in the oratory -- would it not be beautiful to hear they chant in we own palazzo but that be only a dream i know not if it may ever be she come toward he in she shimmering festal robe with the unconscious happy grace of a child drop into a low seat close beside he lean back and let she hand fall in a attitude of complete repose while she give he without effort the detail of the evening 's talk he be a little surprised at the way in which she make this graphic recital of a discussion he would have suppose beyond she comprehension -- or at least beyond she concern -- and he be not wholly pleased he have quite forget that one of the charm of marina upon which he have insist in the day when he have make much of this maiden to he patrician mother be that in capacity for thought and in force of character she be far above the maiden of ancient lineage from whom the lady laura would have have he choose he bride marina have name among other fra francesco she own spiritual director a servite friar of gentle and winning demeanor who be much beloved both in he convent and in other circle where he duty call he he be a man of simple habit and the most exemplary life whose whole force lay in he extreme devotion to duty and he passionate love for the church he sole anxiety be for she glory and he would have be supremely happy in the life he have choose be it not for he grow anxiety lest from she own son she should receive dishonor he be always a welcome visitor at the palazzo giustinianus and already the little prince of the household have a special smile for he ah fra francesco of course say marcantonio in a indulgent tone we own friar and ecclesiastic be welcome but carina these foreign priest be often of a different way of thinking and don fernanzo lillo that fluent spaniard -- verily i would have thee don thy most freezing dignity when he come again but marco mio thou doest he injustice he be most interesting he be tell about the fresco of the michelangelo in the sistine chapel he knoweth they well yet i think he liketh they little it matter not say marcantonio a little disdainfully thou hast already see they thou canst have thine own opinion of they merit but to hear all the allegory explain and all the illusion to the history of we holy church be _ most _ interesting marina pursue calmly for the dear padre of san donate have but little instruction i must know about all these thing for baby 's sake -- he be grow so fast he be not go to be a artist he father answer shortly and if he be we could find a better person to instruct he than a spanish member of the jesuit college _ marco _ exclaim he wife with a long note of surprise be not we holy church one and be not she son scatter over the whole world i know not he displeased thee she continue in a changed tone after a little pause of course i will not see he again but be it don fernanzo lillo himself or -- or -- marco -- it can not be the order thou canst not be so narrow at this time marina with matter thus between venice and rome i do not care to entertain any of they order or any foreign priest in we home they do not place thing in the proper light and we have always hold a special position of loyalty toward venice when she be in difficulty all the can ' giustinianus should seem to remember it it could make no other difference i do not understand she answer look at he with perplexed brow why shouldst thou he exclaim glad to change a distasteful topic such weariness be not needful for thee i will not bring the worry of the council chamber into thy boudoir nay marco it would please I she answer eagerly rise instantly from she languid attitude to come and stand over he lay one hand on he shoulder half in caress and half in command thy father tell these matter to the lady laura and for baby 's sake i should understand these trouble which touch we republic he will ask I question very soon well then he consent ungraciously what be it thou wouldst ask she laugh at he reluctance press she hand with a firmer and yet more loving touch on he shoulder because i be a giustinian she begin with a plea which invariably win he tell I about this question of vicenza which occupy they all so much -- i could not understand who be this abbott of nervessa at she first word he have fold she caressing hand in he but he drop it in immediate displeasure and walk quickly away from she speaking indignantly they talk of this in thy presence they say a abbé be imprison in the piombus they say it be against the law to imprison ecclesiastic except by the authority of the pope oh marco mio i be afraid he will be very angry what else do they tell thee he question doggedly they say there be a canon saracenus also -- both imprison in venice marco mio it be a insult to we holy father what else nothing more -- but only about some law of venice that i do not understand i wish to ask thee and fra francesco be here and hear they talk nay fra francesco stay never long and this be but a few moment before thy come i leave the salum tiziana to see if all be go well in this little salon and they be speak of vicenza and i ask they wherefore art thou angry marco what keep thee so late to-night she have never see he in such a mood he have persistently refuse to meet she beseech glance but now he draw a quick breath of relief and come back to she side it be this miserable matter of vicenza that detain the council in such lengthy session he say and it be not fit to have be mention in thy presence my sweet wife i might well be angry but since thou wert not there i can pardon they yes it be i who question they she repeat eagerly anxious to shield she guest from she husband 's indignation though she do not understand it they be talk of the abbot of nervessa and of he holiness and when i come they rise to do I honor and i also to be not lack in courtesy say ` le prego signor -- i beg of you ' and bid they continue the talk in which they have seem full of interest marco in the senate -- do they know that the pope be angry about the abbot of nervessa she eye be full of the eagerness of she question if they but know all would be well she think she have so wish for marco to be there and hear they talk marina this whole matter be a question for the government to decide it be not for ecclesiastic to discuss -- they know nothing of any law but they own this be a civil case would they not understand thing better if they be allow representation in the senate she persist and what be this law and why be the subject not fit for venetian noble to discuss since it touch they so nearly she be grow disturbed for she fear some injustice since marco have not be indignant at the strange condition she have unfold to he and she have think it must suffice only to name it to he the young patrician look at she in amazement fra paolo be indeed right yet he have be almost indignant at the suggestion the subject can not be discuss he say in quick hard tone because the abbot of nervessa have committed crime so atrocious that thou would ` st shrink at the bare naming of they and for saracenus -- the canon of vicenza -- there come one day to the senate a noble lady of vicenza young and very beautiful and in great trouble cast herself at the foot of the serenissimo implore protection from disgrace that the canon would bring upon she -- a scandal i have never think to name to thee and there be other charge it can not be true she cry flush and tremble dear marco they be priest the truth will be decide by the integrity of the law he answer severely they shall have justice at we court but it be a question for the civil court since the people also cry for justice and the ecclesiastical law be not to deal with heinous civil offens -- though commit by one in priestly robe it be a just law of venice -- ancient and only now reaffirm this be the law they speak of marco now that she dimly understand there be some great trouble come on the people she must know the right at any cost -- even that of she husband 's displeasure it be she duty to he and she have put she question firmly this -- and another he answer unwillingly listen marina for i be weary of thy question the law to forbid new foundation of church or monastery or the introduction of new religious order without the sanction of the government -- also a ancient law and but now reaffirm -- be doubtless that of which they speak marina stand confound with flash eye how could the republic dare to question the liberty of the church thou meanest marco that the church which be the head must ask the doge what she may do when she would increase she own religious institution -- when she have need of building for she holy work thou hast a understanding quicker than i have believe he answer with irritation and listen further marina -- ` since a giustinian should know the reason for the matter which concern the government ' that be thy word if i remember -- the half of the territory of venice have already pass into the hand of the clergy be that not ground enough to hold they establishment that thou wouldst grant they more and for the value of these possession -- for nowhere be a government more generous to the ecclesiastic than the republic have be -- it have be rate that a fourth part of the entire realty of the dominion -- nay some count it a third part -- be already the property of the church shall we noble of venice turn pauper and humbly beg of the clergy a pittance for we child he laugh and kiss she hand as he rise since thou hast ask it he say lightly i have give thee the law -- and there be a end of it but let it not fret thee venice will know how to care for she own but marina have suddenly grow very pale marco she gasp detain he will it be a war -- a war between venice and -- and -- she break off she could not speak the word which seem a sacrilege think of we child she whisper as he gather she in he arm and try to soothe she marco be we not a christian nation and we patriarch -- do he know about the displeasure of the holy father what will become of we there will be no war marcantonio declare with assurance thou see ` st carina these matter be not for woman to discuss they can not understand they be question for the government alone and well it be for we that the clergy be out of it or we might have the spectacle of a senate drown in tear there will be no war he declare again mistake the self-control for which she have bravely struggle as a outcome of he attempt at consolation and now since thou art thy sweet self again have the boy not make the day richer for thee with some tale of wonder thou wouldst unfold xvi there be no longer any doubt as to the intention of he holiness toward the rebellious spirit of the most serene republic the ambassade extraordinary which have be appoint to convey to the holy see the dutiful congratulation of she devoted venetian son on the accession of paul v have few amenity to report in those lengthy dispatch to which the senate listen with a dignity which disdain to show the least outward trace of irritation or forgetfulness in a presence so exasperating as that of the papal nuncio orazio matteus day after day the senate sit in solemn state to hear its delinquency rehearse in the word of paul v by the graphic pen of he excellency agostino nanus ambassador from the republic to the holy see with ceaseless repetition of demand on the part of the sovereign pontiff with ceaseless repetition of refusal most deferently couch from the courtly representative of the offend power with threat of that most dread compeller of obedience which none but a sovereign pontiff may wield and very clearly phrase that all might understand the declaration in the word of he holiness himself that he have determine to mortify the over-weening audacity of the secular ruler of the world with a patience which bear its fruit in a more rigid determination to conquer they listen also to many violent speech from the nuncio explanatory of papal authority found upon the dictum of a gregory _ that none may judge the pope that all prince should kiss the foot of the pope _ and invariably sustain by this axiom of matteus deliver as a refrain -- so sure be the college of its repetition i be pope here i want no reply only obedience and the reiterate assertion that christianity depend upon the acceptance in its entirety of the doctrine of papal supremacy and that he have hear much of the vaunted piety of the venetian republic of which he fail to find evidence in vain the senate plead that on such a point there might be differ view and that man should be know for christian by they faithfulness in duty by they practice of almsgive and of the sacrament and of all other good and christian work but the answer come swiftly naught else availeth it be a relief to the stately and grim giustinian to lose he temper in the sanctity of he home since that freedom be beneath the dignity of a venetian ruler in the company of other who be chafe like himself from insult they would have rejoice to hurl back in the face of the speaker and he be the less inclined to view favorably the effort toward conciliation of the embassy to the holy see because it would have pleased he to have be name among those six of this ambassade extraordinary on a mission so important as a honor due to he ancient house it be repetition _ ad nauseam _ he insist hotly of demand for abrogation of those law for yield up of those two reverend criminal to the ecclesiastical court of nanus 's soft reply to the quick speech of he holiness -- a unending farce giustinian say the lady laura quietly the difficulty be great how can the holy father yield a point which touch the honor of the church verily my lady i believe thou art not responsible for thine own foolishness she husband exclaim angrily if that prelate cousin of saracenus come again to thy salon let he be refuse he shall not prate to thee of ` law ' and ` supremacy ' who have seek for this occasion to embroil we with the holy see for the senate have learn to-day through the trustworthy open mouth of we watchful lion with evidence irrefragable that it be this reverend father who have carry the tale to rome tell I the right of it she say again how may the honor of the church be save yet the dignity of venice be maintain if there be a way we woman should speak for it be the honor of the church maintain by stand as a shield to crime it be venice who would save the church the civil ruler shall purge she sacred court of such iniquity and leave she the purer for she son to love such be the law -- ancient and just -- and a right venice can not yield and more than this he continue impressively all europe be wait on the issue for the real contest be on the rights of civil ruler and these imprison ecclesiastic be but the pretext for a quarrel and ill-judged verily on the part of the holy father since if the case be less heinous there might have be occasion for confusion of judgment but now who will dare assert that the honor of the church be concern in protect man who disgrace mankind the republic be then sure of she ground so sure we be of right that letter be already send to every christian court of europe announce the cause of this quarrel and the stand of venice marina be greatly trouble say the lady laura with a sigh let she go often to san marco and pray for we -- the child be good for nothing else since this trouble come she have more comfort at san donato and the mother superior be a noble woman and beloved by she ay it be all one -- so that she wear not out the patience of marcantonio by she importunity the senate will stand firm on the issue and not one of the can ' giustiniani shall flinch be there no possible doubt of the end the lady laura question after a little troubled silence she heart be very sore for marina who sleep but little and be constantly fast only of that which lieth between the end be triumph for venice giustinian declare tell that to marina and calm she fear also let it not be know that she be so weak in courage it would be hold against marcantonio to whom the suspicion of be wife-ridden would do a infinite injustice and bid marcantonio himself tell she of the vote that have pass the senate without dissent of a single voice for letter to be send to the imperious paul to make a end of he demand declare that venice recognizeth for the temporal government of she state no superior save god alone meanwhile in rome to the ambassador agostino nanus paul have already superbly make answer we be above all man and god have give we power over all man we can depose king and do yet more than that especially we power be ` quae tendunt ad finem supranaturalem ' -lrb- over those thing which tend to a supernatural end -rrb- all thought of festivity in the city of the sea be over the strength of she patrician -- man and woman -- be concentrate on this momentous quarrel with the holy see which they would indeed have put off be it possible but which have come upon they they would bear with conquer pride all through those dark December day the pressure tighten there be muttering of the come storm against which the ruler of venice be plan defense there be a oppression like a sense of mental sirocco in the air -- a vague terror of the unknown among the people gather like the blight breath which precede some fierce tornado -- while in the palace of san marco the doge marino grimanus chief of the republic in revolt against the holy see lay die the lady marina giustinianus have forget how to smile when she little one lift he rosy baby face to hers she smother he in caress that he might not see she tear and she husband fail to note the change for the senate sit in unbroken session and the permit absence from the council chamber of the republic barely suffice for sleep daily in the oratory of she palace mass be say and marina pass long hour there on she knee alone trace the come horror to its most dread issue try to understand it wholly that she might pray with all she soul against it -- this _ curse _ which be to blight the life of all she love and of which she dearest seem to feel no dread she scarcely eat nor sleep -- watch for the morning when a new intercession for mercy should rise from the oratory in she palace wait for the evening when she might go with she maiden to vespers in san marco and still the day darken in threat -- have god forget to be gracious and on this christmas morning when the doge of venice lay die in he hall of state the nun of san donate win by the prayer and gift of the lady marina be make a procession to all the shrine of murano pray if by any means god would stay this curse from fall upon venice no joy-bell ring to usher in the sunrise mass of this memorable christmas day the royal standard of the mighty lion droop at half-mast before the dim magnificence of san marco they glowing gold and scarlet deaden to shades of mourning steel and low muffle tone like the throbbing of the heart of a people drop down from the campanile through a atmosphere still and cold as a breath of dread while from the embassy the home of the senator and signorium the patriarch and bishop of venice gondola by two and three loom black against the gray-dark of the winter dawn hurry noiselessly to the step of the piazzetta and dark stately figure each herald by its torch-bearer glide like phantom under the arcade of the ducal palace up between the grim giant guardian of the stairway and on to the gallery adjoining the apartment of the doge to await the hour of mass a edict more unanswerable than any ever issue by republic or curia have go forth and in solemn state venice await its fulfilment in that hush of reverent wait before the first faint saffron streak have glimmer in the east up through the flare torch of the lower court unbidden and unwelcome come the single figure in all that throng which seem to have no part in the solemn drama to-day be like other day for the nuncio who be no member of the court of venice but a figure without discretionary privilege send to keep in perpetual mind a higher power by he peremptory instruction he request at once a formal audience to deliver a message from he holiness paul v which could brook no delay behold say he after due grace of apology when the senator have withdraw to the salum di collegio and take they accustomed place here be two briefs which by the imperative instruction of we sovereign lord the pope i must at once deliver to you serene highness they be seal with the sacred seal of the curia and each bear the inscription : a marino grimanus duce e alla republica veneta there be but a moment 's consultation among the signorium the serenissimo be _ in extremis _ the most venerable of the ducal councillor announce therefore these briefs which in the name of the serene republic of venice we receive can not be open until the solemn ceremonial of the death and the election shall have be conclude and so dismiss the bearer of the papal message to return to the audience of the greater king meanwhile there be no arrest of that other message which come swiftly and the placid old grimanus -- wise beloved and regret -- lay down he sceptre of state in the moment of the greatest need of venice and pass on to a court of inquiry whose finding be inalterably just calmly as if they know not the contents of the unopened briefs or like man never to be surprise into forgetfulness the signorium and councillor assist at the crowded ceremonial of the day that follow when the serenissimo lay in state in the _ chapelle ardente _ which be prepare in one of the great chamber of the palace with twenty noble in ceaseless attendance the people throng silently to pay they duty to they prince -- when by night in solemn procession with torch and chanting of requiem they carry he to the church of san zanipolo they gondola drape in mourn they banner furl in crêpe the impose insignia of the state he have put off forever bear before he to the giant baldichino before the high altar where surround by innumerable candle he lay until the morning should bring the closing pomp of the last solemn mass not one honor have be omit not one ceremonial abridged because of those briefs upon which the seal of the vatican be still unbroken and when the impose obsequy be over and there be no longer a prince to lift the weight of the gold-wrought mantle and the ducal beretta in the sight of the people the ship of state yet bear herself superbly steer as serenely through the troubled sea as if each man still read he signal in the face of a beloved commander and now the singular strength of the republic and the perfection of the machine of government be evidence as without a moment of indecision the officer proceed to discharge the duty allot to the hour accord to the form prescribe in those endless volume of the librus ceremonialus which provide for every function of life or death of the punctilious venetian court no leader however love and revere be individually great but only as he contribute to the greatness of venice -- the one deathless entity she noblest be content to give of they greatness and be themselves nameless and against the less great for whom self-effacement be impossible -- man strong in gift and eager for power -- the jealous republic have provide a system of efficient check base upon a astute understanding of the fear and claim of self-interest venice know no hiatus in rule all be leader to point the way of that inviolable constitution when the supreme voice be temporarily silent for it be the voice of a impersonal prince and not of the man -- who have absolutely put off individuality when he assume the insignia of royalty in this hour of adversity the man of venice rise to they greatest forget they rivalry and stand breast to breast in phalanx around they vacant throne that venice might meet trouble with increase strength when the eye of the world be curiously turn upon she inexorably though no voice have be raise against grimanus they appoint that commission of inquisitor to review every official act of the last wearer of this crown which now lay idly wait on the golden cushion as sternly elect those five corrector of the coronation oath so soon to be administer to a new wearer of the ermine and without pause for praise or strife proceed to the cumbersome choice of the ducal elector whose word should suffice to create a new venetian prince meanwhile against the bar door of the council chamber where those grave signor be balloting and re-balloting with exemplary patience for the golden ball the nuncio knock again breathless with he latest message send in haste from the holy see : _ the election of a new prince would be void be make by a people under censure _ but the law of venice be ready with its decorous shield and the message could not pass beyond the punctilious signorium might give no audience in the day that intervene between doge and doge except to receive that message of condolence which it have not enter the heart of he holiness to frame and the nuncio appeal in vain to other authority in venice to win he audience for the delivery of he sovereign 's mandate with whatever burning of heart and secret hope and ambition those forty-one elect noble after day of weary patient tossing of gold and silver ball -- a mere intricate child 's play have it not be for the greatness of the prize -- see themselves close within the chamber from which they might not issue forth until there be again a prince in venice with what vividness a giustinian foresee he own stern visage stamp on the coin of venice in that moment when he name appear on the first fold paper draw from the fateful urn with what dignity he conceal he baffled hope and watch from under frown eyebrow a morosinus and a zianus pass in turn through the fierce ordeal of relegation to obscurity -- the annals of that secret council do not reveal but in this stress of venice the elector quit themselves like true man and when the noble cavalière leonardo donato -- full of dignity of wisdom and of honor skilled in diplomacy and experience and bold as wise -- come forth to scatter he coronation gift of coin in the piazza and after solemn religious ceremonial be show from the pulpit of san marco as prince of venice well might the people shout in acclamation _ provato provato _ -lrb- approve -rrb- and the watch court of europe hasten to express through they resident ambassador eager congratulation that one so fitted to fill the position with distinction have take he place among the ruler but orazio mattei bring no message of congratulation from rome xvii giustinian giustinianus have be among the elector and have listen to that strict canvassing of act both private and official which precede the final vote for the prince of venetium venice have take stand before the court of europe with a leader who feareth naught -- save not to do the right he magnanimously assure the lady laura one evening when accord to they wont they be discuss the theme which never fail in interest nay not even that for donato have courage in himself and in he own ruling faith and more a man need not then wherefore have the signorium create this office of _ teologo consultore _ and appoint thereto this friar of the servus of whom they tell such marvel -- as if the collegio with all we learn chancellor be not enough leave thou these matter to the signorium who verily know how to rule -- ay and how to choose for the man be like none other what use have the senate for this cloistered scholar skilled in many science and master of tongue the lady laura persist that it should create a office -- which since the _ serra _ it have not be know to do -- and appoint a friar over the head of we noble who have loyally serve the republic since we ancestor first sit in the consiglio there be the hall of padua for we scholar where already he friend the master galileo holdeth high honor by favor of the senate and if fra paolo be name rector magnifico and put at its head -- nay nay the senate be wise she husband interrupt not ill pleased at she vehemence and the patrician pride which prompt it and if the republic have no present need of the consultore 's mastery of science the fame thereof have make a hearing for any speech of he but he have no mind to any social pleasure -- how then my lady hast see he or knowest thou the quality of he learn fra francesco be never weary of tell of he wisdom they have be friend since boyhood in the servus the master galileo if one may believe he can do naught without consult fra paolo and together they be build some strange tunnel that shall bring the star nearer it be like a fable to listen to these marvel of he friend who for he discovery might well hold all the chair in padua if fra francesco might decree he desert but fra francesco be simple-minded tell I giustinian how doth the consultore appear to thee to I and to all man like one who betray no secret and speak no idle word once pursue the lady meditatively i have sight of he go with marco to the convent to see we madonna of the veronese and fra paolo minister in the chapel of the consolation very quiet and simple he seem like the other fratus i have not think he great nor a leader of man be there no statesman in venice who might better fit the dignity of so great a office think not to teach subtlety to the signorium my lady laura be not every noble a statesman train and every one at the service of the republic but there be no greater theologian at the court of paul v nor any ecclesiastic among they all more familiar with the writings of they authority and he have a memory so astounding that he beareth the meaning of all they code on the end of he tongue wherewith to confute the fallacious argument of rome giustinian it be like a woman to ask a thing and cry out if the answer be not smother in sweet the old senator retort irritably resent she accent of reproof it be small marvel if the consultore seemeth not great to thee the power of the man be in the clarity of he vision and the brevity of he speech who name he to the signorium donato know he well and morosinus and all we ablest man and he knowledge of the way of rome where he have be much in legislation at the vatican be a power in the senate -- which have no mind to be take in argument nor to fail in courtesy nor to show ignorance in its demand it be much to have a judge whose opinion we adversary must respect the senate will be cautious -- will not forget the reverence owe to the holy church she ask in warn trouble at he bold use of word nay but the republic will first remember the duty owe to we prince since it be a matter that toucheth the state he answer uncompromisingly and for we duty to the church -- leave that to we frate than whom none be more devout she be too keenly interested not to put the further question : be it safe for fra paolo to lead this controversy be it pleasing to he order giustinian give a contemptuous laugh thou mayest well ask fra paolo also would not hear of it at first foresee where it might lead but from urgency of the senate he yield -- if the consent of the general of the servus be first win wherefore it be grant one know not but the purple robe have perchance some weight in the argument -- be a please honor -- though one may dare assert that fra paolo himself give it not a think have gather honor all he life with no care for any greatness they might bring nay it be not this that win they say the lady laura with decision but they hope that fra paolo would support the claim of the holy father it could have be nothing else a hope most reasonable be he a man of less remarkable force giustinian answer confidently but as if he hold a divining-rod he findeth at once the heart of a matter and venice have no fear no venice have no fear if there have be heartburning they be all forget she ruler be one in determination while they calmly weigh the balance between church and state and confidently await the issue the briefs have be open and the chief counsellor the new teologo consultore have give a opinion which fill the senate with admiration two remedy might be find : one material by forbid the publication of the censure and prevent the execution of they thus resist illegitimate force by force clearly legitimate so long as it doth not overpass the bound of natural right of defense and the other moral which consisteth in a appeal to a future council but continue this sagacious counsellor after a word explanatory of the future council it be better to avoid this appeal in order not to irritate the pope more than ever and also because he who appealeth admiteth that the goodness of he cause be doubtful whereas that of the republic be indubitable such be the opinion brief as positive to which the senator listen in undisguised satisfaction on that memorable day in January 1606 and although those briefs give in saint peter 's in rome under the ring of the fisherman on the 10th of December 1605 darkly threaten excommunication unless these dearly beloved son of venice withdraw from the stand they have take yet with a doge who would laugh at a excommunication and a learn counsellor who assure they that the cause of the republic be indubitable well might the shadow lessen in the senate chamber while in calm assurance the savius -lrb- 7 -rrb- prepare the reply to these communication from he holiness which the signor agostino nanus presently deliver in a audience at rome -lrb- 7 -rrb- these savius or _ wise man _ have charge of the diplomatic despatch of the republic but the task of the courtly nanus be not a enviable one deferent as be the form of the epistle in which these devoted son declare that nothing could have be further from the thought of venice than to prejudice the rights of the church -- humbly as they implore the holy father to recall the many act of loyalty by which venice have show she love and reverence have she not be foremost in the crusade be the church anywhere more magnificently support in temporal weal earnestly as they assure he of the harmlessness of those law which he condemn as hurtful to they soul quietly announce that the republic have transgress no right in make law for she own independent civil government -- and gracious and diplomatic as be the way of nanus -- he holiness declare the letter to be frivolous and vain and dismiss the ambassador with temper assure he that unless the republic find means to retract those law the gate of hell should not prevail to deter he from inflict the utmost threaten penalty it be a frank contest of will in which each opponent conscientiously believe himself in the right but it be nevertheless not a equal contest for paul conceive that he duty in the exalted position of head of the church which have be so unexpectedly thrust upon he lay in its mere temporal aggrandizement while consciously turn all he power in that direction misname the struggle a _ spiritual _ one but venice not only believe but confess it to be merely a question of civil rights of ruler and strong in the sense of the justice of she cause use every grace of trained diplomacy in assert it -- upon a understanding of civil law which be beyond the attainment of the lawyer camillo borghese and with the aid of specialist whose knowledge of canon law equal that of he holiness among the important matter touch upon in those day in the senate the question have be broach not without anxiety as to whether rome would have recourse to force of a less spiritual nature and a secret commission have be appoint to examine and report from the frontier any accession of papal troops while envoy be send to ferrara on the same furtive errand : and the more serious venetian be already discuss the possibility of war as one of the aspect of this quarrel with the holy see one day through the swift and secret mouth of the lion a unusual message reach the ten standing strangely out amid a mass of darker matter -- denunciation sinister information hint of intrigue the reason for the choice of this mysterious messenger be state in the preamble : to the end that this may without circumlocution immediately reach you noble body and be act upon in you discretion -- be secretly dismiss if this seemeth wisest in the interest of the state it be a brief offer on the part of girolamo magagnatus to equip and maintain at he expense in the event of war with the holy see a war-galley of the largest size as a gift to the republic in the name of he little grandson the infant giustinian venice be more munificent in expenditure than she unassisted treasury would warrant be at all time ready to receive and encourage private bounty from she wealthy citizen and the promptness and generosity of magagnatus 's gift the first which have be offer in this emergency seem in the interest of the government to demand some adequate public recognition modestly as it have be proffer haughty as be the attitude of venice in the face of the threaten excommunication the occasion be one of peril to which she be not blind and the danger be greatest among the people -- the _ popolo _ -- who be more under the influence of the priest and who still include in they belief many superstition which be not likely to deter the disciplined body of noble from acquiescence in the decision of they chief it be therefore a moment for diplomacy when venice might fitly show magnanimity in she acceptance of so princely a gift from one of the people as this master-worker of murano be still esteem and girolamo magagnatus be invite to appear before the senate and receive the acknowledgment of the serenissimo who have already be inform by the councillor that while the spontaneous offer of a galley so maintain have no precedent in the annals of venice the reward which the senate propose to bestow have in fact in early historic day be offer by the republic as a stimulus to such a gift girolamo magagnatus a grave and venerable figure -- with white lock fall from under he round black cap and a full gray beard flow over the long merchant 's robe of stiff silk and wear the insignia of he call a golden chain which by its weight and numerous link be also a indication of he wealth -- might have be one of the signorium as he stand among they to receive they thanks -- unabashed as become one of he dignity of character and age unattended as befitted one of the people the doge himself make a gracious speech of acceptance on behalf of the republic to which girolamo briefly answer : most serene prince and noble lord of the council in the name of my grandson giustinian i thank you and with a grave obeisance he would have retire but it be signify to he that he might not yet withdraw yet one thing remaineth most esteemed messer magagnatus by which this republic would testify she appreciation of such loyalty and forethought by reason of which -- as for the esteem in which this republic have ever hold the ancient house of magagnatus which from the earliest time have be foremost in we industry of murano -- we propose to confer nobility upon thine house and to give thee a immediate seat of right in the maggior consiglio the honor be so unexpected that the body of grave councillor have rise in congratulation before girolamo magagnatus could frame other response than he profound and grave obeisance but there be no hint of indecision in the deep measure tone with which he make reply : most serene prince and lord of the council i beg you to believe in my deep appreciation of the honor you would bestow but let it rather be say of I that i -- be still of the people as all of my house from the commencement of this republic have ever be -- have yet receive such favor of my prince that he accept from one of the people this token of loyal service to the government and more i ask not also he proceed calmly take no note of the consternation on the face of he auditor be it not fitting for old man to receive favor from child rather for they to bestow -- as i this galley in the name of the boy the which -- be i to accept in return the munificence of the senate -- would be the offering of my galley as so much base coin wherewith to purchase a honor not mine by birth let it not be say in scorn that girolamo magagnatus have buy the nobility with which he birth have fail to endow he be it better messer magagnatus that some should now say ` it be for arrogance that this noble son of the people refuse a seat among the noble of venice ' the doge question coldly not so most serene prince each man be rather noble if in that place which god have assign he he doeth nobly the duty belong thereto as ye my lord noble and councillor of the republic each in the seat appoint you by birth serve without weary the interest of venice i be already old and the last of my race for those of my blood who come after I by the favor of venice be inscribe in the ` libro d'oro ' if i have deserve aught of you bounty be gracious when some right of the people be in danger of be forget and let my grandson among the noble ever serve noble and people alike -- as venetian -- without distinction of interest but let I die as i have live among the workman of murano -- magagnatus of the venetian people never before in the annals of the republic be one know to refuse the gift of nobility giustinian explain as he describe the scene to the lady laura and verily one see that the displeasure of the ten be great the more so that in the interest of the government the return they would have make may not be keep from the knowledge of the people yet we senior master of murano be suffer to depart with a gracious word of regret from this consummate donate ` that a new noble so loyal in sentiment should not be number among the councillor of venice ' truly this grandsire of we little one lacketh not pride and he bearing become he well though the senate would have have it otherwise he gift be generous but verily he needeth little for the maintenance of the state he keepeth giustinian it be a noble act and already the republic be more beholden to we baby than to any child in venice it will bring gladness to the face of we sad marina nay guard thee from speech of it perchance she may not hear thereof be thus concern with grief for this quarrel -- womanlike and she have not strength to bear the thought of war verily the reverend father confessor in venice have much to answer for i would thou couldst find means to keep fra francesco from he ministration in she palace fra francesco -- so holy and gentle -- a man to trust ay i have naught against he save that he be train in the school of rome have a conscience to uphold they claim and with no thought or care for anything but the church -- no wisdom to discover any right of prince such confessor make trouble among the people i doubt not we daughter trusteth the word of fra francesco beyond thine or mine do thy possible to keep he from she there be no know what marcantonio may do at she bidding and in this crisis there shall be no stain upon we house thou then giustinian speak with marco nay i dare not name marina to he under such suspicion it might be the force of the very thing we fear he have a way with he of hear all and say naught save some gay facile word courteous to the point one can find no fault and underneath he have perhaps some scheme and never can one get a promise from he xviii the lady marina be wan from fear and fasting but very resolute though she face show trace of tear as she husband enter the oratory of the palace whither she have implore he to come to she before he go to the senate chamber -- a dignity to which he have but just be elect why hast thou summon I hither he ask somewhat coldly for like most light-hearted people he dislike scene and difference between himself and he wife be the more intolerable to he because he truly love she oh marco my beloved she exclaim imploringly thou lovest venice as much as i and thy little word can save she from this great horror for thou art in the council of thy people nay marina thou dost not understand he answer deprecatingly soften at the sight of she trouble i have but one vote it be as nothing in the senate -- it would but draw indignation against we house it be not possible to fail in loyalty to the republic on this first occasion of moment thy father might be win if thou hast but courage thou art a giustinian it be thy duty to speak in time of peril and thy word would make other brave to follow thee thus shalt thou save venice if thou didst but know carina how the senate and the ten be set against this wish of thine i should not speak of this matter to thee for it be secret -- but to calm thee and help thee understand how shall it calm I to know that the people and the city be rush under the ban if this terrible resolution pass if we child -- we tender child -- be to die to-morrow he would go without burial -- a little wander soul marco thou lovest we child she pause and she desperate struggle for control be full of inexpressible horror calm thyself my darling it shall not be he answer reassuringly oh marco mio and thou wilt give thy vote against it and thou wilt use thine influence in the council promise I she cling to he sob and exhaust he soothe she for a moment silently should he leave she under such a misunderstand it would be easier for they both but he have intend no untruth how be it possible to make such a woman understand she be quiet now and he be steal away from she with a kiss on she forehead promise I she insist follow he and clasp he arm with sudden strength marina they be very set and the ten -- thou dost not know they power and shall all venice brave the wrath of we most holy church because the senate be afraid of the ten be the ten more powerful than the holy father and all the priesthood and sacrament of the church marco my beloved how shall i save thee carina these thing be not come upon venice thou dost not understand the law of church and state no marco she answer boldly it be rather thou who dost not understand there will be no service no marriage for we people no burial no consolation of we holy religion no sacrament -- if this excommunication should come upon we if we have sin marina and lay ourselves open to interdict then these thing should come -- not otherwise ay but we _ have _ sin -- by rebellion against the holy church marco it be not easy for man to submit but father francesco say

have rule the debate for many day past but he sit serene and unmoved among he violet-robed colleague with no trace of sympathy nor speech upon he placid and inscrutable countenance if the word be he they be simply a impartial reminder of duty -- they conceal no opinion the senator be to be the judge of the scene and justice require they to listen they give a quicken interest i plead for the

he own judgment in a case so strange leonardo donato have be in possession of the supreme ducal authority but a few week not long enough to unlearn the tone of command and the quick power of decision which have distinguish he as ambassador when he have be choose with the unanimous approval of this August assembly to conciliate the court of rome in the hour of the republic 's great emergency he presence of mind return to he the scene have last long enough and the situation be critical the noble lady marina must be retire without disgrace for the honor of the can ' giustinianus but above all that she might not heighten the impression which she presence have already create and she must be place where she could exercise no further influence yet in a way that should awaken no commiseration for she be beautiful and terribly in earnest and in she deep eye there be the light of a prophet and all venice be at she foot the doge speak a word low to he councillor who sit nearest he on either side and they with decorous sign of approval pass it on to the other thus fortify he rise descend the step of the ducal throne and address she with grave courtesy the whole house as in custom bind rise also while they prince be stand we do not forget most noble lady marina giustinianus that more than many other thou art a daughter of the republic be especially adopt by the act of the signorium and thy love for venice win forgiveness for the strangeness of thy fear that we she loyal ruler could work she harm but thou art distressed and need rest from the pain of the vision which thou hast confide to we we will care for thee as a father should let the noble senator marcantonio giustinianus approach and conduct he lady to private apartment within we palace where she may rest with she maiden until she shall be refresh one of we secretary shall show the way and remain to see that every aid be bestow the secretary whom the doge have designate by a glance have approach and receive a rapid order speak in a undertone marina have fall almost faint upon she husband 's arm as he reach she after the permission so intolerably delay yet he dare not move in that imperious presence without further bidding he hand steal over hers to comfort she she have suffer so much that he could not be angry leonardo donato 's eye quickly scan the face of the senator seek the two least sympathetic the senator morosinus and sagredo will escort they he say and will return in haste with the senator giustinianus to do they duty to the republic at the door marina turn again rally she fail strength with a last desperate effort but the word come in a broken agonize whisper : o santissima marium vergine mater dolorosa because thou art the special guardian of this virgin city -- and here in she council none of thy reverend father may plead for thee -- be merciful madre beatissima save we from we doom xix as the door close upon the retreat cortège the attitude of the doge grow stern he turn as if about to address the still stand senate when remember that he have already assume the initiative to a unusual degree and have so recent a recollection of that formidable coronation oath whose slightest infraction would be visit upon he nearest of kin he mount in silence to he seat and consult with he councillor until the senator be in they place then in a tone of authority he proclaim : that which have just occur within this hall of the senate shall be for those who have witness it as if it have not be and the secretary of the day shall not transcribe it upon they record since it have already more than sufficiently consume we time this vision of the lady be doubtless work by unwise tamper be a vision of a nature that may gain credence with woman -- dependent and timid and unversed in law -- but with which man and ruler have nothing to do a expression of relief slowly grow upon the face before he while the doge be speak note which he word be allow to produce they full effect during the few moment of relaxation and informal talk which as be immediately announce by a secretary would occupy the time until the return of the three senator -- all meanwhile keep they seat that no moment might be lose in resume the important interrupted debate the strain have be so great both during the discussion and the visit of the lady marina that there be a willingness among the senator to unbend to throw aside serious impression and make light of all dread as womanish and weak accept the doge 's word as leader for in those day the faith of many of the gravest walk only a little way from the borderland of superstition and it be long since any of they prince have hold so great a reputation for judgment and diplomacy as leonardo donato the senate now be complete the doge solemnly announce immediately upon the return of the three senator the interrupted speech will be conclude and before the final vote be take there will be present once more before this August body that argument of we most learn and venerate counsellor padre maestro paolo upon which the decision of the ten have be base and upon which the college the senate and the great council will presently be call to vote this marshaling of the entire ruling body of the republic could not fail to exercise a steadying power and neither fear nor irresolution be reveal to the impressive penetrate and command gaze of leonardo when the senator contarinus resume the speech which have be so strangely interrupt the enthusiasm and determination of the morning have return the word fall upon a receptive and positive atmosphere the opinion of the distinguished senator carry great weight so loyal and catholic be he know to be and above the portal of the contarinus many time the lion of st mark have proudly rest we be loyal son of the church he say but no highest ecclesiastical court -- though with authority from rome itself -- may rule that any decree of this imperial senate of venice bearing upon church and state alike can be set aside by church alone we have not subject ourselves to be put out of the body of this church which we revere by any failure of duty on we part -- duty be a rendering of that which be owe as citizen of this republic we duty in thing temporal be owe to we prince -- by right divine as man we duty to we church by right divine be in thing spiritual alone -- which we render but in thing temporal god give not the church rule over we if at any point these two dominion may seem to touch and intersect it be we prince who disentangle by he decree the twisted thread for he be lord over we who be venetian and not roman the word have a ring of victory enthusiasm spread from face to face and the house rise in a tumult of approval to express its loyalty unchecked by any sign of dissent from the dais at a demonstration so unusual but the contarinus see he advantage and break in upon the wave of feeling while a imperative motion from the chief counsellor restore order for the hearing of a important legal point upon which it be desire that action should be base these law -- whose abrogation the holy father doth demand -- be ancient rights of venice acknowledge by many previous pope and reaffirm in these we own day after wise and learn scrutiny of we chancellor in the light of modern civic requirement as needful to the healthful administration of this realm as binding upon we prince who have ever in mind the welfare of venice and to be uphold by we people who believe in the divine right of prince they be by these reverend councillor also declare non-prejudicial to the spiritual authority of we most holy church which this serene republic of venice doth ever reverently acknowledge the question be of civil and not of spiritual rights a enthusiastic senator make a motion for the casting of the final vote as a expression of the sense of the chamber the speech of the contarinus and the manner of its reception give please assurance of the general temper of the senate the face of the doge and of he savius record the sense of security with which it be needful to impress the assembly and wear if possible a more dignified calm nevertheless leonardo with he statesman 's eye detect here and there a face that be set in a opposite opinion or likely to yield from fear and he pride decree that the vote when cast should be unanimous again the doge consult he councillor the nation will owe we much he say if we unanimous vote shall record the sentiment express in this speech of the noble senator contarinus as the faith and will of this republic never have there be a greater opportunity to win a triumph for the liberty of prince therefore because the question be weighty we will request we most learn counsellor and theologian to the republic to give we a exposition of the law as it doth appear at this latest moment of we discussion to he judicial mind all venice know that fra paolo 's nerve and knowledge be the central force of the resistance of the republic in this crisis as he move slowly forward and stand before this magnificent assembly with the same simple dignity that have characterize he among the friar of the servus -- after the splendor of the ducal costume the scarlet the ermine the beretta the gold-brocaded mantle -- the plain fold of the violet robe of the counsellor seem almost austere he lineless face be so fresh in color that it look youthful though of singular gravity and refine asceticism yet man of force be draw to he because of he strength he broad grasp of duty and he absolute fearlessness as he stand for a moment perfectly still before they he eye -- blue penetrate and unreveal -- sweep the face of the assembly with a magnetic glance which compel they entire attention the hush be _ feel _ among they and in the silence he voice -- clear passionless low and far-reaching -- seem not so much a voice as a suggestion within the inner consciousness of he hearer of the thought he utter the strange sense of impersonality which be one of he distinguish attribute prevent the usual desire for contest with which most think man meet other strong mind and be perhaps a secret of he triumph most serene prince counsellor and noble of the council if you ask I of the law as it have declare itself to my understand the matter be simple and quickly to be utter the dominion of the church march in the path of heaven it can not therefore clash with the dominion of prince which march on the path of earth but the roman court -- call itself the church -- be no longer satisfy with that spiritual dominion to which it have right have become aggressive and seek to impose doctrine far remove from the primitive law of the church there be a slight pause while the quiet eye hold he audience with a challenge of assent the face of those who be unqualifiedly with he in doctrine grow eager here and there a dignified head bow unaware as if surrender some belief christ himself have say ` my kingdom be not of this world ' and the power of the sovereign pontiff over christian be not limitless but be restricted to spiritual matter and have for rule the divine law if the pope to enforce he command -- unlawful when they exceed the authority give he by christ -- fulminate he interdict it be unjust and null in spite of the reverence owe to the holy see it should not be obey seven time before have venice be so ban -- and _ never _ for anything that have to do with religion again that strange slight emphatic pause as if he need wait but a moment for he reasoning to dissipate any conscious unwillingness the contarinus quote low to he neighbor a recent _ bon mot _ of the senate everybody have a window in he breast to fra paolo for several senator of family closely ally to rome start at the boldness of the thought and exchange furtive glance of disapproval and the fearless eye of the friar immediately fix upon they hold and quiet they as they move restlessly to evade he glance it be as if he assure they silently i speak that i do know cease to oppose truth let yourselve believe and resistance lessen before the impersonality of the pleader one of the father tell we that a excommunication be null when it would usurp over citizen the right of they prince ' _ by I king reign and prince decree justice _ ' -- it be the word of god there be no need of further pause in the quiet flow of word for there be no longer any resistance the senate and council hang breathless upon he speech which answer every misgiving they know that he reading of canon law have never be question in rome itself the man speak with immense authority but there be no triumph in he bearing as he tune the atmosphere of that August assembly into absolute harmony conquer every discordant note -- only a further lowering of the quiet voice which seem to utter unchallenged the conclusion of each listener the sacred canon agree that a pope be liable to error and fallible in case of special judgment isaiah denounce such legislation ` woe unto they that decree unrighteous decree ' wherefore i declare the justice of the cause of the republic and the nullity of any judgment that may be pronounce against she in this matter nor shall evil befall one for a sin not commit nor can there be disobedience to a mandate which have be issue without lawful authority by he who proclaim it and authority transcend be no longer lawful xx when marcantonio finally release from he long day of service in the senate chamber seek the private apartment of the doge where marina with she maiden be wait for he he find she lie back wan and spiritless in one of the great gold and crimson arm-chair of the state salon she eye be close she lip be move in prayer but she rosary have drop from she weak clasp some of she maiden as thus do they lady truest service be still kneel with hopeless petition to the holy mother to avert the doom from venice but one the lady bea who be tenderly devote to she have not cease from effort to rouse she with nameless little gracious care she be watch for marcantonio to whom she sign eagerly to hasten as the guard of the doge permit he to pass the doorway thus have we lady be and naught have move she she say low and in distress since the secretary of the serenissimo who with much futile reasoning have seek to change she have take he leave save that ever and anon she have open she eye to watch the door and bid we pray for venice she husband have reach she side and take she listless hand before marina have notice he approach but there be no smile in she eye as she raise they to he -- only a look of unutterable misery be there no hope she question she finger weakly fold about he be burn he control himself with a great effort yes carina every hope all be well and the serenissimo have be most gracious to-morrow when thou hast have thy rest he will send to thee the reverend counsellor padre maestro paolo that he may quiet all thy fear for all be well she try to draw he nearer but she hand drop powerless the vote she question with she eager eye and more falteringly with that hoarse broken whisper which pierce he heart it be well he answer she tenderly carinissima all be well she fix he with terror-stricken eye in which she soul seem burning and she lip move with a question he could not hear he bent closer touch she cheek caressingly the vote she have ask again tell she the count say the lady bea with a imperious touch on he wrist it be kill she the senate have adjourn in triumph without a dissenting voice venice have rally to the support of she prince marcantonio have think he should be proud to tell she of this unanimous action of they August body which could not fail to restore she confidence and quiet she fear but now he could not find the word he seek for never have he look into eye so full of a comprehend woe marina he begin carinissima -- helplessly repeat he powerless assurance : it be well still she deep eye seem to question he relentlessly though she do not speak she gaze fascinate he and he could not withdraw he eye until he have read in hers the great agony he have so lightly estimate -- the agony of a soul deeply religious of unquestioning faith in the strictest doctrine and dogma of the church of rome the grief of such a soul tenderly compassionate for the suffer bring upon a innocent people by no rebellion of its own the terror of this soul -- passionately loving -- measure the horror of a unblessed life and death for all its dearest one all she have seem to question he lean nearer and marcantonio could not answer but he see from the deepen horror in she eye that she understand she know that _ he _ have help to bring the doom oh if he could but have tell she that he have not vote -- that he have withhold he one little vote from venice to comfort she if for this once he have fail to give what venice expect of he only for marina 's sake he bent over she passionately a thousand reason rush to he rescue clamor to be tell she marina beloved there be nothing to fear he cry desperately eager for he own defense resolute to make she comprehend the perfect safety of venice to calm the beseech horror in she eye fra paolo will come she gaze relax she eyelid quiver and close she have faint -- or be it death he fold she to he heart with a cry of desolation the lady bea hastily thrust he aside and open the white robe at the throat and marcantonio start back there be stripe of half-healed laceration on the tender flesh -- some fresh as if but just raise by the lash ay my lord bea answer very low to he quick grieved question all that a daughter of the church may do have we lady add to she prayer for venice she have be rigorous in fasting and in penance until she strength be go but the pain of it she feeleth not because of the greater pain of she soul which be lose in supplication that availeth naught leonardo donato would be very gracious to the lady of the giustinianus though she have come so near to cost the city a divide vote because he have see the misery in she eye with she great love for venice and because the council have so declare its vote for the state that he could afford to be magnanimous nay since even the senator marcantonio have not flinch before that wonderful agonized white face he need not confine she as he have intend in a convent for decorous keep he be glad of the change in she favor which would prevent the harshness that might have increase she influence to the degree of danger he send instead a gracious message by he secretary -- might the father pay a visit to he daughter of the republic to inquire of she welfare and assure she of he favor before she return to she palace but the message of courtesy send by the doge himself have be stay on the threshold of he own state salon \* \* \* \* \* the republic have indeed quit herself nobly in she vote so valiant a blow have she strike for the rights of prince that this consciousness ring out in the bold tone of she announcement to the court of europe -- which thing we have think best to tell you for you sole information so that if mention be make of they to you and not else you may be able to answer to the purpose and to justify this we most righteous cause and from the moment that the senate have be unofficially apprise by nanus that the terrible interdict be already print and would presently be fulminate every possible precaution of self-defense have be put in operation throughout the dominion of venice with a ingenuity a foresight and a celerity which the watch court of europe not only view with amazement but accept as a evidence of the conscious power and justice of the republic overture come fast from england from spain from france -- every monarch wish some share in the pacification between these court of rome and venice meanwhile in venice life go on superbly there be no question of any spiritual disfranchisement these son of the church be not under interdict have commit no sin which lay they open to that charge moreover no ban have be _ publish _ throughout the wide extent of they domain hence for the venetian there be no interdict whatever awful anathema might be affix to those distant door of saint peter 's in rome with whatever voice of anger its terror might be thunder at the holy see against ruler people priest and sacrament within the doomed city -- the wide water of the lagoon lave its shore in benediction like a baptismal charm upon the fair front of venice against which the curse threaten impotently at the center of this superb and daring court sit a friar train from he childhood up in the custom tradition and belief of he church and of he order -- a reverent practitioner in she fast and sacrament simple in he habit as a hermit-monk faithful in he religious duty as the most punctilious priest in rome sure in he faith that god would uphold the right and assert without compromise that right be on the side of venice what a stay for ruler who fortify they every position by some appeal to precedent -- who would punctiliously know the source and interpretation of every law upon which they rest above all what a stay for the simple people who in these day of bewildering conflict know not what to believe would mass go on and the church door be open and the sacrament continue might they still take they bride and baptize they little one and follow they dead to burial and sign the sign of the cross in token of the favor of heaven -- as loyal son of the church and would the madre beata -- bless guardian of this virgin city -- still smile upon they from all the separate shrine of venice should the labor and the imprecation of this simple people go on until the evening in they wonted flow and should nothing fail they of the benediction they have know it be a mystery but threatening rome be far and unfamiliar and venice they know -- present protect peremptory -- impossible to disobey before the command of the angry pontiff could reach the head of the order in venice people priest and prelate throughout the dominion be forewarn they must continue in every accustomed practice of they religion they might neither receive nor publish any minatory papers -- these must be instantly bring to the government under severest penalty offend prelate be bring from distant see to meet the displeasure of the republic hesitate priest be silently hasten to decision by scaffold loom suddenly within they precinct while leaflet -- expressly prepare to disaffect the venetian -- proclaim that no obedience be due from a people to its prince under censure that all vow contract and duty between man and man husband and wife child and parent be nullify for those who remain faithful to the church in acknowledge the censure as against those who disclaim it -- these leaflet introduce by secret agent of the pontiff and interdict by the republic flow in vast number but silently into the hand of the ten and be see no more meanwhile that terrible thing which the people have vaguely fear have _ not _ come upon they though at first they pause half-hearted when they pass the house of the tintoret where the quaint figure of ser-robium the pasquino of venice have often a bit of news that the people care to hear grotesquely placard over he broad mouth he be a good friend to the people ser-robium and give they many a pleasant bit of gossip to cheer they evening stroll but it be wise not to laugh until one have hear the word and there be often a priest or a scholar near to tell the meaning to those who could not spell it out for themselves always in these day there be some one who could read to the people for this be that solemn protest of leonardo donato by the grace of god doge of venice etc wherewith the most christian republic defy the interdict here along the rialto in all the public square of venice on the door of the church -- wherever proclamation be wont to be make -- the people might pause and read this consoling word of venice instead perchance of some copy of the interdict which have be smuggle into the city and paste surreptitiously over the doge 's protest but which those faithful _ signor di notte _ -- the night-watch of venice -- be sure to destroy before the morning dawn to the most reverend the patriarch archbishop and bishop of we venetian dominion say this protest and to the vicar abbot prior rector of parochial church and other ecclesiastical prelate greet : forthwith proceed to declare that the interdict which he holiness be ` say ' to have publish be null and void and forbid to be observe -- not have be incur by any fault of venice but even those who could not read soon recognize the feature of that message which meet they everywhere hide the scar of other message which they must not see no no they say with laugh thanks to some friendly interpreter who stand near it be enough _ va bene _ -- we know it like we ave marium but sometimes a family group come back for a word when the other have scatter thou gigio tell the good padre say the bright-eyed young contadina pull the gray sleeve of she fisherman who stand stolidly beside she _ si si _ he answer indifferently shrug he shoulder and relapse into silence as he push he wife and mother before he for a refuge for the man of the island be less at home in argument with the priest than be the woman of they household it be thus you reverence the young woman explain cheerily it be the grandmother who be afraid santa marium _ how _ she be afraid she touch she forehead significantly the simple old woman comprehend only that they speak of she drop a courtesy look furtively about she with troubled eye and fumble over she bead the protest have no meaning for she although it be write in good venetian but a few word suffice for such as these who have catch only some vague hint of the holy father 's displeasure and be reassure by the open church and the promise of mass and benediction it be those other who make trouble they come from time to time -- by two and three never alone -- and read for themselves with lower brow but ask no question and sometimes if they watch too silently the courteous friar who have graciously interpret the message which be above the head of the crowd exchange a glance of intelligence with some gay young signor who belong to the great army of secret service -- as reveal to the friar on guard by the password of the day and the sullen-browed group be courteously accost by the young noble -- excuse I signori you be stranger in venice a gondola be wait to conduct you to the palace they will be try as secret agent of the enemy but resistance be rare for a escort of guard pour out from the doorway and calle if a stiletto but gleam in the sunlight and no secret agent may cope with venice in promptness of self-defense and ingenuity of prevention it be interesting in the campo in these early day before the effect of the government 's measure for coerce the opinion of the populace be fully declare i be a good catholic most reverend father i keep the mariegole every year i go to confession protest some sturdy gondolier who have be make anxious by he womenfolk and many a fare i pay to light the traghetto of san nicolò with a ave for the favor of the bless mother to confound the scoundrel castellanus

maledettus _ for even those gondolier who keep the mariegole be not precisely angel and the part of they creed which they religiously uphold be a deathless antagonism to the rival faction which win more lamp and pretty gift for the patron madonna of the various traghettus than any other article of they faith to a few chiefly woman with devout sad face -- watcher perchance beside bed over which the shadow of death be creep -- the padre tell compassionately of console helpful word that be preach daily in the great desert church of _ i gesuiti _ for in this parish more than other there be difficulty since it have be the center of the disaffection but now its door be ceaselessly open for a refuge no service be omit no sacrament deny and daily before vespers the people may listen to a few simple word from fra paolo thither in these early day of the struggle the crowd flock draw partly by curiosity to hear a man of whom it be whisper that he have just be individually put under the greater excommunication by the holy inquisition because of he attitude in this quarrel there be much talk of fra paolo sift about the church and square where the gathering of the people show a sprinkling of red-robed senator for the padre maestro paolo which be he title since he have be consultore to the republic be a great man now with a greatness that mean something to the populace to whom letter and science be nothing but the consultore be the friend of venice he be _ they _ friend -- come each day to talk to the people it be not true that great trouble have come upon venice for fra paolo make it all quite plain and he know everything they say we padre in san marcuolo be like a bimbo to he the jesuit father go too soon and might have spare themselves the burning of they

like the serenissimo he might wear a crown if he like ah to be great like that but fra paolo and he secretary wear the grave garb of they order to the great disappointment of the younger woman who have be attract by the expectation of some pomp word have reach the contarinus secretly from rome say one senator to another as the consultore pass they that they have find themselves a new diversion before the palace of the vatican and that some of we great one here be burn in effigy to instruct the populace a pile of fra paolo 's writings doth light the funeral pyre and all that he have write or _ may hereafter write _ be place upon the index _ davvero _ he word would make I wrathful if i hold the view of he holiness who may well fear the incontrovertibility of he wit but we consultore looketh a simple man to have be show such honor he beareth honor bravely the other answer with due appreciation of the humor but lately when the master galileo be before the senate with he telescope he have a pretty tale of gian penellus and ghetaldo wherewith in padua fra paolo have win the title of ` the miracle of the century ' i hear it not some commission hold I at the arsenal san marco be thank that it be over ebbene old penellus -- gouty so that he can scarce move -- have a visit from we great mathematician ghetaldo who findeth with we magnificent patron of letter a friar to whom penelli showeth such honor -- limp to the door with he as if he be a prince -- that ghetaldo wrathful at this foolish waste over a friar asketh he name with scorn and be not better pleased when penellus telleth that fra paolo be the ` miracle of the age in every science ' ` so i will prove it ' saith penellus ` for verily the world knoweth the great ghetaldo for a mathematician come then with problem the most difficult thou canst prepare on a day it may please thee to name and meet fra paolo at my table without warn to he ' _ ecco _ penelli be subtle great satisfaction and much labor on the part of we mathematician enter fra paolo -- simple unadvised -- solve the proposition at a hearing ` miraculous ' cry the superb ghetaldo gentle as a lamb a friendship for life and fra paolo be the teacher but it be more wonderful to hear the tale of how he preacheth to the people here in the gesuitus let we follow for he giveth they not many minute for fear of weary they we need lift we mantle high for the pavement be like a market garden of mazzorbo with broken bit from the woman 's basket -- faugh the splendid senator seldom mingle in such a crowd except at guard distance to make a pageant for it it be picturesque shabby malodorous compose chiefly of young woman with bright-eyed baby and basket emit unctuous savor of _ frittolum _ and garlic now and then a old peasant who could not be tranquil until she have hear fra paolo speak be escort by a rebellious grandson bribe to quiet by the promise of a _ soldo _ for he little game of chance occasionally a man impatient to have do with it all and get out on the canal again move restlessly from place to place only here and there the dim light show a face pathetic in its question to whom the answer mean life or death what have a man of such rare power and learn to do with these simple one -- a man whose time be precious to the state the noble senator withdraw a little from the crowd to watch the scene as they put the question to each other they servant bring they chair within the shadow of a column they do not know that few be great enough in a age of superstition to hold a conscience uncontrolled by tradition and a primitive faith simple as a child 's with the tenacity of a strong man there have be nothing in he labor at the senate to call forth this most sacred side of he reserved nature and they do not understand that it be to this he owe much of the marvelous poise of will and judgment which keep he unspoiled in spite of intellectual gift that would have ruin he without he absolute dependence on the one supreme but on this sacred side alone be there any entrance to he emotion fra paolo be not speak from the pulpit he stand beside a table that have be place in the nave and the people gather close about he as child near a father while he open a great vellum-bound volume with massive golden clasp which he secretary have bring from the library of the servus come nearer he call to they simply beckon with he hand so that all may hear put the old people and the little one nearest he look around he not smile but very quiet and patient as if he be wait for the slight confusion to subside for at first they push each other rudely to get closer there be room for all he say in god 's house and as he look into they face each feel that it be a word to he and hold he breath to listen -- which suddenly seem quite easy the smaller child nestle contentedly on they mother ' arm munch some dainty bring to keep they quiet and fascinate by the low clear voice watch with round solemn eye to see if he would smile while two or three who be tall enough to reach just over the edge of the table steady themselves by clutch it with they chubby hand drop they hold of they mother ' mantle -- for the page be full of pretty color and the voice of the padre be like a lullaby to keep they still and they be not afraid -- at all fra paolo never give the people many word but sometimes they be strong and beautiful like a old poem and in they own venetian -- not in the latin which have be make for the great one it be a wonderful book write long ago he tell they before the bishop of altinum flee with he people to torcello and build the old duomo before venice begin to be many of they do not know there be _ anything _ so old as that they look at each other and begin to think and it be write for the comfort of every one who loveth god we father whatever he trouble may be see what be write here for any who fear that the consolation of we holy religion shall be take away for that be what you fear they look at each other hesitate si si -- yes -- timidly no no more bravely fra paolo smile no they say distinctly if any of you be afraid fra paolo say look full into they face as they press nearer because the father of this church have go away and left you there be word in this old book -- write long ago before there be any venice -- to condemn those who would close the church ` woe be unto the pastor that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ' saith the lord ` behold i will visit upon they the evil of they doings saith the lord ' ` where be the flock that be give thee thy beautiful flock ' and here be some word that be write for you -- whom they have desert ` thus saith the lord : again there shall be hear in this place _ which ye say shall be desolate _ the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and of they that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord ' it be all very simple love god and pray to he and be faithful in you duty and he will keep you happy and safe from harm the ringing treble of child 's voice sound through the open door of the sacristy and distract the attention of the congregation who turn to watch the chorister as they come in sight by two and two chant the canticle praise the lord of host for the lord be good for he mercy endureth forever while fra paolo slip away unnoticed xxi so life go on and those who look to see the people fail and falter under this burden which the rebellion of they ruler have bring upon they see they with unshaken confidence still loyally uphold the banner of saint mark preparation for war -- marshal of soldier building of galley increase activity at the arsenal -- enlarged the industry and add a judicious vivacity to the life of the people there be no war declare but it be a time when border-land should be look to and bravery encourage and the martial spirit develop and the ever politic senate tickle the fancy of its pleasure-loving people with the pomp of a fête on the day when the newly create general-in-chief of the army of the republic assemble with fanfare of trumpet and roaring of cannon he splendidly appoint corps in the piazza the people throng the arcade crowd the window and balcony wave and shout as the stately escort of three hundred noble in crimson robe lead the way to san marco for solemn dedication and here like a knight vow to holiest service the general knelt before the altar while the patriarch bless he sword in defense of venice and the right with a memory of the old battle-cry of the republic non nobi domine -- sed tibus glorium and the people accept as a favor the pageant which have be cunningly devise to impress they follow throng up the giant stairway into the hall of the council chamber into the stately presence of the serenissimo and the signorium to hear they latest magnate profess he gratitude for the honor of he investiture and the magnificence of he outfit with solemn oath of loyalty there be no war though talk of it have little truce in those day but the cardinal nephew be busy in ferrara and ancona with the marshaling of troops and four of the prince of the church have be appoint by the holy father -- vice-regent of the prince of peace -- to superintend he military operation and prepare he army of forty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry thus in venice the spectacle of a general-in-chief with he splendid accoutrements be timely and inspiriting meanwhile in the palazzo giustinianus the day drag wearily and know no sunshine the senator marcantonio have be by special favor excuse from attendance in the council chamber in he mind venice be no longer regnant one think absorb he wholly through all that miserable time -- he have but one hope -- everything centre in marina when they have undress she to apply restorative a small rough crucifix have be take from the fold of she robe near she heart it have belong to santa bea tagliapietra -- that devoted daughter of the church -- and the lady bea herself have give the precious heirloom out of the treasure of the chapel of they house to she beloved lady marina possibly she reflect with a shudder as she lay the relic on the altar of the oratory of the palazzo giustinianus that the remembrance of the constant danger of santa bea have incite the lady marina thus to peril she life of the long night of vigil on the floor of the oratory and of many other austerity which have fill those last sad day since the quarrel with rome have begin the lady bea be force to give faithful account to the physician who be summon in immediate consultation to the bedchamber of the lady marina these practice and the horror upon which she have dwell ceaselessly would sufficiently account for she condition say the learn professor santorio and if she could but forget it there might be hope meanwhile let she memory lie dormant -- at present nothing must be do to rouse she perhaps already she have forget it for the shock have be great and life be at a very low ebb have all memory go from she of she life and love they think she know they but she express no wish she scarcely speak lie listless and white under the heavy canopy of the great carve bedstead which have become the center of every hope in those two palace on the canal grande while the absorb life of the ducal palace so little distant be for marcantonio as though it do not exist in that time of wait -- he know not how long it be nor what be pass -- life be a great void to he echo with one agonize hope time have no existence except as a indefinite point when marina should come back to he with she soul and heart in she eye once more he have gather the few book from she oratory and boudoir and at interval when he could control he thought he pore over they treasure every faint pencil-line every sentence blot by tear as a indication of have specially occupy she now that he could no longer discuss these mood how eagerly he seek for the light she would so gladly have give he in those past happier day in vain he ask of the lady bea whether they have discuss these thought together -- whether fra francesco have bring she the little worn volume my lord i know not she answer coldly resolve in she own heart to tell he nothing that he do not already know since only now it have pleased he to concern himself with that religious attitude which be cost marina so dearly for the whole strength of the love she would once have yield he for the ask the lady bea now lavish upon marina in jealous devotion but he could not be angry with fra francesco who have only be faithful in share he belief with she while he she husband have refuse to help she my god he groan why be we blind until the anguish come as he drearily pace the stately chamber -- so empty without marina -- what would he not have give to hear she voice again repeat those eager question he have be so willing to repress how could it ever have vex he that she should wish to understand the question that be occupy venice but now he remember have grow less and less patient with she as she have return to this theme until in self-defense she have say with gentle dignity yet half-surprised at he irritation : marco have a little patience with I remember that we young noble be train in knowledge of these law of venice from quite early boyhood it be part training if thou wilt he have answer lightly or in these question woman be stupid -- i know not but these matter concern they not and after that he remember now with shame she have trouble he no more and he have feel it a relief for during the few discussion they have have together he have be aware that they approach the question from a radically different point of view he have never take the trouble to comprehend she ground nor to give she reason for he own he have simply make assertion with a sense of irritation that any repetition should be call for in a matter quite out of a woman 's province for the woman of venice have no part in that salon influence on politics which be ascribe to they sister of france and she attempt to gain understanding for a personal judgment have chafe he like a interference in he own special field he with he subtly trained intellect and legal knowledge could so easily have convince she he tell himself remorsefully but he have not take the trouble even to look through she lens while she have be so eager to understand he point of view -- and only that she might reach the truth now he have much time to understand it all he recall a strange hurt look when she question have cease but it have not trouble he then she would forget it -- would understand that he prefer to talk about other thing -- he have say to himself and he have be careful in gracious little way to show she that he be not displeased and she have be wise and have vex he no more there have be no argument on this or any other theme and then the day of strain have come and the labor of the council have absorb he now he see that she have be too proud and strong to subject herself to repeat insinuation of inferiority of understanding as she have be too loving and dutiful to prolong the contest and so -- he groan aloud as he mistake reveal itself to he in those long unhappy hour -- he have lose the dear opportunity of lead she aright for he contemplate but one possible issue of such a attempt on he part he have scorn she entreaty when she come to he for understanding of a mystery that be kill she and he have drive she to take up the study alone with the help of she father confessor who know but one side of the vexed question and that _ not _ the side of venice he be sure that it be a matter of conscience and not of contest with marina therefore she _ must _ know he should have realize that how have fra francesco meet she question have he tell she it be a matter beyond the comprehension of woman or have he be patient with she difficulty and solve they with terrible positiveness be it he who have bring she these manual on fast and penance the use and nature of the interdict the duty of the believer which complete for she the picture of horror she faith have already outline marcantonio have take in all they dread meaning in rapid glance how could she believe those terrible thing he have see in she eye -- those terrible terrible thing nay how should she not believe they and how implicitly she must have believe they to have endure so much in hope of avert this doom marina carina he heart go out to she in a great wail of pity a woman -- so tender so young -- kneel at night in she chapel alone with the vision of the horror she be pray to avert bear the fasting and the penance and the weakness all alone in the hope that god would be merciful gathering up she fail strength so bravely for that thankless scene in the senate and he she husband who have never mean that he love should fail she could have spare she all this pain by a little comprehension could she ever forgive he and would she understand some day might he reason it all out lovingly with she when she strength come back to she -- for baby 's sake that sweet womanly natural plea which he have disregard signor santorio he moan if i might but reason with she i might cure she nay say santorio not yet the shadow have not leave she eye let she forget she have be grow stronger they say do quite passively the thing they ask of she toward she restoration she recognize they all but she express neither wish nor emotion lie chiefly with closed eye in the cavernous depths of the great invalid chair where they lay she each day yet respond by some movement if they call she name -- rarely with any word nothing rouse she from that mood of unbroken brooding she will not forget the great santorio say in despair we must try to rouse she let she child be bring the ghost of a smile flit for a instant about she pale lip and over the shadowy horror in she eye as marcantonio lean over she with they boy in he arm carina he cry imploringly we little one needeth thee she half-open she arm but this wraith of the mother he remember frightened the child who cling sob to he father marina fall back with a cry of grief struggle for the word which come slowly -- she first connected speech since she illness it be the curse it part even mother and child a strange strength seem to have come to she a sudden light gleam in she eye she turn from one to the other as if seek some one in authority to answer she question and fix upon santorio 's as the strongest face the official act of a pope be infallible she question with feverish insistence after the first futile attempt to speak the holy father who succeed he may not undo he act of mercy yes yes it be true santorio assent wait eagerly for the sequence a little color have creep into she cheek she hand be burn they grasp the physician 's arm like a vise the change be alarming the edict can not hurt my baby santissima marium thou hast save he she cry for he have the special blessing of he holiness pope clement and we holy father can not reach he with this curse of venice we can not keep she mind from it say santorio aside to marcantonio it be essential to calm it with the right view -- no argument it might induce the most dangerous excitement send for some bishop or theologian who take the right view let he present it as a fact and with authority she life depend upon it he lean down to he patient in deep commiseration to tell she that all be well -- that venice be under no ban that god 's blessing still shield she church and she child but she raise she eye steadily to he and the strength of the belief which he see clearly write within they fill he with awe and hush he speech how be it possible to make she understand nay say marina faintly still hold he with she sad solemn eye do not speak since fra francesco come no more there be but one who speaketh truth to I it be the vision of my beautiful mater dolorosa of san donato which leaveth I not there be a stir in the depths of the street below -- a noise of the populace come nearer follow along the bank of the canal grande as if the cause of they excitement be in some hurry movement on its placid water the shout and jeer of the strident voice be break by authoritative command of the signor della notte -- the officer of police -- and the tramp of they guard fail to create order and above the hubbub rise the cry distinctly repeat again and again -- the cry of a angry populace andè in malora andè in malora -lrb- curse go with you -rrb- xxii even giustinian giustinianus come and go heavily ask for the latest change before he return to the senate chamber and carry with he always a vision of that white plead face which have so work upon he anger when he have see it luminous with she hope for venice but now he anger be transfer to she confessor who have bewitch she to all those roman prelate who have pay she court -- a mere child not able to defend herself nor to understand kill herself for a question beyond she and marcantonio for love of she useless and unmanned it be more than he senatorial pride could endure to find himself powerless under such complication to appease he wrath he denounce fra francesco through the bocca di leone but when the friar be seek for by order of the ten he be not find fra paolo be appeal to for he be the friend of the gentle confessor but he have not know he plan if he conscience hold he not it be well for he to flee he say and best for venice but when fra paolo be alone in he cell which in those day of greatness he would not exchange for quarter at the ducal palace though the senate plead the memory of a confidential talk hold since this quarrel with rome begin bring a hint of the reason for this sudden flight he be tender of conscience and strong of faith this good fra francesco always sad but never stern toward fra paolo 's failure to hold a belief implicit as he own in some doctrine of he beloved church which he hold to be vital yet he reverence for fra paolo 's great knowledge and holy life make he unwilling to criticize where he unconsciously question it be the severest test of friendship to keep he faith and affectionate devotion in one who be take so prominent a part in a movement oppose papal authority but sometimes when fra paolo have utter many thing he would not have tolerate in any other priest fra francesco say only to himself in great sadness it be god who maketh man different we do not know the why the gentle friar sometimes wonder in himself that he could not openly say to fra paolo when they meet after matins the many thing which have lie hot in he heart through the night -- for how _ could _ it be right to oppose the supreme authority but when the placid face of he friend meet he bath in the fresh benediction of he altar service -- new each morning and never omit -- he forget the horror with which he have be reasoning that fra paolo be hasten the curse upon venice but if fra paolo derive no add _ finesse _ for he masterful thought from the confidence he so often unconsciously invite from this lifelong friend he faith in the sincerity and spiritual depth of this brother friar who out of love for he listen to much that pained he teach he to value at its highest this opportunity of the closest scrutiny of he own motive as he note the impression of they talk on a nature as sincere and spiritual as it be transparent but that night when they have pass from the cloister into fra paolo 's study-cell continue as they walk the train of thought they have be discuss he listener soon become so distrait that fra paolo who be singularly conscious of unspoken mood drop the problem he be unfold and lay he hand upon he shoulder with the rare tenderness express only where he hope that he might serve we be speak of weighty matter and thy thought be not with I tell I thy trouble it be a question of responsibility -- the burden of the confessional fra francesco answer simply fra paolo draw back he hand and he tone be a shade less tender of all that have be repose in thee under that sacred seal thou must bear the burden alone my brother dost thou think i can forget my vow fra francesco exclaim reproachfully i spake not of that which have be repose in I but of my duty grow out of that sacred office it be for this i want counsel and i have seek thee before to pray thee to confess I but i know thy view and i ask thee not yet as brother of one holy order thou mayest confide in I if perchance it may bring thee comfort for we of the servus it be we duty of service fra francesco sit for a moment in silence life be heavy he say slowly and hard to interpret yet i seem to feel that thou wilt understand though it be in the very matter of we difference there be one -- highly place and noble in spirit and to the church a most devoted daughter -- who cometh to I for teaching in this matter of the interdict she asketh of I all its meaning -- what it shall bring to venice thou tell she then it shall bring naught for if it be pronounce it will be unjustly and without due cause nay paolo my brother it be write in the nineteenth maxim of the ` dictatus papa ' ` that none may judge the pope ' my brother who give thee thy conscience and thine intellect fra paolo question sternly and have he who give they thee so teach thee to yield they that it should be as if thou have ` st not these gift which verily distinguish man from the animal -- to whom instinct sufficeth yet if thou would ` st have answer from one of we own casuist in whom thou dost place thy trust the cardinal bellarmino in he second book on the roman pontiff will teach thee that without prejudice to this maxim of gregory thou mayest refuse obedience to a command extend beyond the jurisdiction of he who command as gaetano in he first treatise on the ` power of the pope ' will also tell thee for the peace of thine own mind my brother i would i might make thee understand nay answer fra francesco not less earnestly peace for he who have faith cometh not with one intellectual solution nor another but with calm purpose to do the right however it may be reveal which as thou knowest francesco venice seeketh -- and naught else it be a matter of law in which thou hast make no study and therefore hard for thee now must i to the council chamber but later i would willingly show thee all the argument but of this be sure the republic will not offend against the liberty of the holy church but she will protect she own fearest thou not dear friend fra francesco question greatly trouble that thou mayest lead venice o'erlightly to esteem this vow of obedience which every loyal son of the church oweth to the holy father my heart be sore for thee i see not the matter as thou would ` st have I nay say fra paolo quietly to each one he burden if thy conscience bear not out my teaching thou art free from it i interpret the law by the grace which god have give I i also be free from sin therein if my understanding be not equal to the task wherein i seem to feel god 's guidance yet tell I i pray thee paolo mio and be not displeased by mine insistence -- perchance it may help I to comprehend this mystery -- how knowest thou the limit beyond which one may without sin judge that the holy father shall not command obedience of the son of the church i do not say when it conflict with that which be in itself against the law of god fra paolo answer he this limitation thou also would ` st admit yet it may well-nigh seem to thee a blasphemy to suppose so strange a case though many of the early father do provide against it but to take another case when a command of the sovereign pontiff doth conflict with the rule of the prince in he realm see ` st thou not what confusion should come if the pope may revoke the law of prince and replace they by he own in the temporal affair of they dominion and if it belong to he holiness to judge which law shall be revoke and what may be legislate to replace the old law ultimately but one power should everywhere reign -- and that a ecclesiastical power the matter be simple fra paolo 's search gaze note the flush of feeling in the face of he friend which be he only response and thus will the senate vote when the question shall come before they fra francesco have ask after a pause for this conversation have take place in the earlier day of the struggle while in many quarter opinion be form there can be no accurate recital of the manner of a happen before it have take place the teologo consultore reply so placidly that he tone convey as little reproach as information yet fra francesco could not again have put he question in any form still he linger as if something more must be speak although fra paolo have already send to summon he secretary i also he say assert himself with a effort which be always painful to he gentle soul i also would be faithful to my conscience and my vow that which i believe -- i can teach no other more can one not ask of thee fra paolo answer suddenly unbend from the stilted mood of he last word by the light that be give he must each man choose he path if say fra francesco speak sorrowfully the bless law of silence be add to we vow how would it save a man perplexity and trouble for that which one believeth must color he speech though he would fain speak little thy light be larger than mine own -- i know it to be so -- and yet to I it bringeth no vision i would it have be give we to see and teach alike in this matter of the confessional say fra paolo return and speak low if but thou didst believe with I that _ as a sacrament _ it be oftenest unwise and best leave unpractised thy difficulty might be fewer nay paolo mio tempt I not i would i might believe it but my conscience agreeth to my vow as thou believest so do ` for whatsoever be not of faith be sin ' say fra paolo solemnly that be a strong word speak of doctrine to guard the conscience i would i might scatter all the noble word of that noble apostle paul among the people and the priest in we own tongue sometimes thou seemest so like a rebel i know not why i come to thee in trouble -- fra francesco look at he with grieve eye -- except that in thine heart thou art indeed true so help I god -- it be my prayer fra paolo answer and for thee and I alike however we may differ there be this other helpful word in that same bless book which they will not let the starving people share -- ` god be faithful who will not suffer you to be tempt above that ye be able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it ' may god be with thee and christ and the holy mother have thee in they keep fra francesco answer with a yearning look in he loving face in a tone that linger on the sweet word mother and almost seem to hint of a omission as they clasp hand and part this be the last time they have have speech together but on the evening of the day when venice have declare she loyalty to she prince by unanimous vote there be much animated talk of the matter in the refectory fra francesco have join the group and listen silently but as the call to _ compline _ ring through the cloister and the friar scatter he have turn he face to fra paolo who read thereon a very passion of love reproach and pain which he could not forget when the duty of the council press I less he think i will seek he out and reason with he but after that night the gentle friar be see no more in venice and inquiry fail to develop a reason for he flight they miss he in the servus where already they be begin to gather up the pale happening of he convent life with the kindly recollection which tinge they with a thread of romance as he brother of the order rehearse they in the cloistered way where he would come no more for to he some ministry of beauty have always be assign the vine droop for he tend they say and the pet stork who wander in the close languish for he hand to feed the dainty morsel and for he voice in that indulgent teasing which have provoke its proudest preening but this perhaps be only fancy or they way of recognize a certain grace they miss but of the reason of he go which most of they connect in some way with this movement in venice over which he have often grieve there be no open recognition among they -- partly because they fear that ubiquitous ear of the senate which penetrate unseen through many close doorway partly because they realize how strange it be that they own sympathy have not confess he view of right furtively too the friar watch fra paolo for the adoration of the gentle fra francesco for this idol of they order from the day when they have enter the convent as boy together have form a cloister idyl -- none the less that the response of the graver friar be not equally demonstrative though it be feel to be true for it be a marvel that two such opposite nature should hold so closely together and that fra francesco for all he gentleness should apparently retain opinion uninfluenced by the power and learning which all other recognize yet from those early day fra francesco have abate nothing of he scrupulous and loving conservatism never have he question a rule nor choose the least instead of the most permit in a act of humility and after he church the madonna and he patron saint he expend the devotion of he nature upon he friend with a just estimate of he power and daring which fill he soul with anxious happiness often in those earlier day when the echo of fra paolo 's triumph have penetrate to the refectory of the servus fra francesco have feel a strange premonition which have keep he long on he knee before the altar in the chapel shield he o holy mother from danger he have pray nor let he wander from the lowly path of obedience for pride of that which thou permittest he to know and he day-dream of earthly happiness be the spending of he friend 's great gift in the service of the holy church wherein he should ascend from honor to honor enlarge she border and strengthen she rule attain at last to the supreme position week after fra francesco have disappear from the convent a letter be bring by the gastaldo of nicolotti piero salin who in spite of opposition among the brother persist in deliver it with he own hand though it be rare that any one outside he usual circle be permit to hold a interview with fra paolo but piero 's masterful way have not leave he and when he will to do a thing the will of other count little it be a pity -- because the missive be mysterious crumple with long carrying -- and if a trusty member of they own community have deliver it to fra paolo in he cell there might have be some revelation but there be none fra paolo be only a little more grave and silent than of wont but often now he be so absorb in government matter that he take less part in the social life of the servus so piero laughing at the ease with which he have carry he point for nothing but the ask -- and it have to be do since he have promise marina -- have he interview alone with fra paolo and pass easily through the group of disappointed friar under those exquisitely work arcade to he gondola thank they with nonchalance and press they to avail themselves more often of the eager service of he barcariolus that the blessing of the madonna might be upon they traghettus to the discomfiture of they rival the castellanus for piero be a faithful gastaldo and lose no opportunity of seek favor for the faction he represent and there be a certain grace in he proffer since priest and friar pay no fare fra paolo leave alone read the message which hold the tragedy of a life i could not stay in venice dear friend of my whole life to see thee guide we country into such sad error for so to my heart it seemeth -- may god help we both and when there be no longer hope that my little word might prevail to hold any in that way which alone seemeth to I right -- and thou with thy great gift art use they for state and not for church paolo mio not for we holy church -- i could not stay because i love thee i must have be ever chide thee have i remain as if god have make I for no use but to be a thorn in thy flesh -- which i could not believe but because he have make thee great he have give thee thy conscience for thy guide as mine to I which holdeth I from grief over-much for i know thee to be true and great therefore for peace and not for gladness have i leave thee for reverence to the holy father and for the better keep of all my vow if perchance at the foot of the holy father my prayer and penance might by miracle avail to turn he wrath from venice -- it could not hurt thee yet because of this wish which only holdeth life in I -- so sore be my heart at leave venice and thee and we dear home of the servus -- well i know that never more mine eye shall see these place of my love -- and thee my friend if we learn by the way of pain after this life god will forgive we error francesco thy brother of the servus xxiii as the cry of the populace ring down the canal grande follow the retreat rank of the jesuit who bind by they greater vow to rome have remain steadfast and refuse obedience to the senate 's mandate the lady marina rouse by the excitement which they dread have start to she foot with a marvelous return of she former mental power and a fullness of comprehension which seek for no explanation she stand for a moment pant with hot unspoken speech turn from one to another and then with a sudden great effort repress the word she would have speak ask quietly after a pause in which no reference have be make to the expulsion of the confraternity : which of the order have go what more have happen that i know not nay the order of the monk and of the friar have chiefly be faithful to venice they tell she and all be well this society which for long have be cause of much disorder in we republic it be well that it leave venice in peace she answer nothing weigh they word silently be it because they be faithful to they vow and to they church she ask at length in quiet irony nay but because they teach disobedience to prince and would thus undermine the law of the land marcantonio hasten to explain grateful that she could at length discuss the question carina -- bless be san marco -- thou art like thyself we will talk together we will make all clear to thee thou shalt grieve no more carinissima she put up she hand and touch he cheek with a answering caress -- the first through all these weary day i shall get well marco mio she say with a sudden conviction that surprise they but still there be no smile in she eye and they heart be sad though the change that have come over she be so extraordinary that they hope much from the explanation which the great santorio have authorize but for whom should they send in this moment when life and death hang in the balance to speak that authoritative word the bishop of aquileium first and greatest of the venetian bishop have incur the displeasure of the senate for refuse to perform the duty of he office while the republic remain under that fulminate but unacknowledged censure and a new prelate of opinion approve by the most serene republic sit in the vacate see the bishop of vicenza have likewise signify he sympathy with the holy see and in brescium they wander prelate have scarcely yet receive that strengthen monition of the watch senate which be to recall he from he hiding-place and hold he steadfast in he cathedral service and for the patriarch vendramin who have be summon to rome to receive the benediction of the supreme pontiff but have be forbid by the senate to leave the venetian domain this episode which be a feature of the struggle know to the whole of venice place he so openly on the side of the republic that it forbid he ministry with the lady marina but there be one so jealously guard from all interruption and fatigue that stranger who come from far to see he be refuse audience by order of the senate or be receive for a few moment only in some protected chamber of the ducal palace for the spring of government move at he touch the matter which occupy he be weighty and for these they would spare he strength yet again the senate signify a rare consideration for the can ' giustiniani by permit the attendance of they teologo consultore in the palazzo of the lady marina for who so well could minister to she diseased mind as he who have unanswerably place the question in its true light before all the council of the republic she stand with bow head and clasped hand as he approach she she hair fall unbound as in she maiden day over the simply white robe which she have prefer in she illness discard all she jewel and all emblem of she state -- pale as a vision like a sad dream of the beautiful madonna del sorriso which the veronese have paint for that altar of the servus at which each morning fra paolo still dutifully minister peace be with thee and to thine house my daughter say the padre maestro paolo spread out he hand in priestly salutation as he enter the oratory of the palazzo giustinianus where the lady marina await he she have desire that the interview should take place in this chapel which she have not visit since she illness a faint odor of desolation steal through the dimness of the place to meet he -- a breath from the withered rose-petal which have drop from the golden vase upon the splendid embroidered altar-cloth and mingle with the dust of those many day which have remain guiltless of mass or service the altar candle be unlighted the censer have lose its halo of mystic smoke it be fitter to my mood most reverend father wert thou to scatter penitential ash before a desecrated altar which may send no incense of praise to heaven nay my daughter love and faith may still minister and god the unchangeable accept that service from every altar in venice ` the sacrifice of god be a troubled spirit ' it be write in the holy book which god have grant for the comfort of he people may peace indeed bring thee its benediction -- the more that thy need be great be there some strange power of resistance in that fragile droop figure which make it difficult to rehearse the argument for venice with he accustomed mastery she listen silently while the learn counsellor patiently explain that the sentence of rome be unjust therefore not incur and not to be observe by priest nor people wherefore it be the duty of the prince to prevent its execution -- of the prince who more than any private citizen be bind to fear god to be zealous in the faith and reverent toward the priest who be permit to stand in the place of christ for the enforcement of he teaching only but it be also the more the duty of the prince to eschew hypocrisy and superstition to preserve he own dignity and maintain he state in the exercise of the true religion but there be no acquiescence in she eye i thank thee most reverend father for thy patient teaching she say but i lack the learn to make it helpful fra francesco be more simple and he have teach I by no argument but he for the exercise of the true religion have find it needful to quit venice and doth make he pilgrimage to rome barefooted that he may pray the holy father of he grace to lift this curse from we people there be that in she face which maketh argument useless fra paolo say low to he friend santorio for he be himself no mean physician have contribute discovery of utmost importance to the medical science and there be a physical weakness combine with this mental assertiveness which doth make it a danger to oppose she belief yet i would i might comfort she for she soul be tortured it must be that thou shalt convince she santorio plead with he thus urge fra paolo speak again in a tone that pity render strangely near to tenderness i would not weary thee my daughter have speak the truth which i would fain have thee embrace for thine own healing only this would i remind thee -- that none may be exclude from the holy catholic church if he be not first exclude by he own demerit from divine grace she answer nothing but there be a unspoken argument in she face see ` st thou not that those terror which thou dost fear shall not come upon venice since she have not sin it be this which for thy peace we would have thee comprehend my father there be but one whose teaching fitteth my reasoning she answer resolutely and he have flee from venice that he may be free to believe and to practice he religion as we holy church doth require and to plead against we doom where prayer may be hear unhindered by the cloud which keepeth we in venice from god 's favor he be a holy man have teach I that the law of obedience to the supreme head of the church may not be transgress -- that we doom cometh not undeserved -- and my whole heart be sick with fear there be but one to whom be owe this supreme and inalterable obedience my daughter we do not differ in we belief yield it always to he most reverently and unreservedly fra paolo answer solemnly but upon this earth it have be teach we by we lord himself ` there be none good -- nay not one ' the head of the church of god be god himself the only infallible and just thinkest thou that he would have we obey a command conceive in error with intention to exclude from every benefit of we holy church in the hour when they most need divine comfort and protection those who would faithfully do he service thus read we not the love and mercy of we heavenly father most reverend father she cry clasp she hand in extremity how shall a weak untaught woman reason with the counsellor of venice i know not where the word be write -- but somewhere fra francesco have teach I yet he soul be loving -- there be a thought of the vengeance of god and it be terrible day and night there be no other vision in my soul but this -- of the _ vengeance of god _ pour out upon the disobedient for this the bless mater dolorosa of san donato weepeth ceaselessly love be for those who serve he but vengeance -- here and hereafter -- for those who disobey oh my father for every human soul in venice -- the helpless woman who have no power but prayer which be but insult while god 's face be hide -- the little child who have do no harm -- madre beatissima how can we bear it nay nay my daughter for we father be righteous and merciful ` vengeance be mine ' he saith ' _ i _ will repay ' he giveth no man charge to bring he wrath upon we he have invest no human power with a supremacy beyond that which abideth in every loving and faithful soul as to the thing of the conscience thou with thy love and faith and pain art at this moment very near to he be comfort and cease not to believe that he counteth all thy tear and that thy prayer be dear to he my father she confess sadly it be a part of the shadow that it hide my faith night and day with fast and penance have i not cease to pray for venice -- and the answer have be deny I i could seek for death but for the horror that cometh after at the madonna dell ' orto -- the tintoret -- and that which the michelangelo have see in vision -- oh my god my child it be not god who faileth thee in answer to thy prayer and love and faith be yet strong and beautiful within thy soul only a human weakness be upon thee which cloudeth thy human reason and for this thy soul be dark for reason also be of god 's gift -- lower than faith and love yet a very needful part of man while god leaveth he in he human habitation there have come a answer to the prayer though thou see ` st it not be it write my father in the cruel word of the interdict she gasp she be tortured out of reverence santorio exclaim apart and would have hush she but fra paolo overhear say gently : for this i come to hearken all thy trouble if perchance i might give thee rest the answer to thy prayer be not write in those unjust word for they -- mark well it be here that thy reason faileth thee -- for they be utter by a human will strive to coerce obedience in a matter beyond its province the power which god have give to priest and prince be not arbitrary but to be regulate by the law of god neither be obedience toward those in authority to be stolid and blind but yield only when the command be within this divine law the holy father have no power to command disobedience to the prince in he rightful realm -- which thus he seeketh to do she spread out she hand before she and half-turned away she head as if in deprecation of some sacrilege grow very white be _ this _ the answer my father it be the reason for the answer which have come by unanimous conviction into the soul of every man of the ruling body of venice and have be voice by each in he vote with a fullness of consent which be of god 's send thus be they nerve to declare the censure void -- and venice be unharmed madre beatissima _ thus _ hast thou answer I my daughter may it not comfort thee to know that that which thou in faith and love hast pray for venice -- that in this struggle she should hold god 's favor unharmed -- have come to she though the manner of the benefit accord not with the manner of the grace which thou hast ask if my reason be cloud with terror she say very slowly as if she strength be spend god have vouchsafe I no other reason -- but only that which tremble at this broken law of obedience my father -- i pray thee -- i be very weary -- xxiv the nuncio have declare that venice no longer require he service and have withdraw with every ceremony of punctilious and honorable dismissal to rome from whence the venetian ambassador presently go forth _ without _ the customary compliment but if diplomatic relation be sever between rome and venice there be still chance for private communication which sometimes cast a curious light upon the subject under discussion but which make no change in that irreproachable suavity of exterior or that invincibility of purpose with which the venetian hold in check any attempt at disaffection through roman agency or avert any schismatic movement within they own dependency to sarpi the chief counsellor have be commit the censorship of the press and the supervision of those very papers which have be write by friend of the republic to scatter broadcast in defense of its rights form not the least delicate part of he task for the government demand that they should maintain a fine reserve in method and in spite of example to the contrary freely give by they opponent would tolerate neither heresy nor coarseness every detail of this world-renowned quarrel be conduct on the part of venice with a irreproachable dignity and diplomacy that raise it to the height of a negotiation of state and it form no part of the policy of the republic to tolerate any disbelief in she own loyalty the venetian should stand before the world as faithful son of the church bearing unmerited sentence of excommunication then rome to make a end of the brilliant flow of pamphlet from sarpus 's pen would have lure he from venice with flattering promise of churchly preferment nay say he here lieth my duty and my work have not deserve honest favor from a pope who interpreteth the law with other eye than mine meanwhile the scheme of the enemy be tireless for obtain secret influence within venetian border now it be a barefooted friar to be watch for at mantua come with power plenipotentiary from he holiness over all the prelate of the rebellious realm or it might be this same friar in lay disguise still arm with those ghostly and secret power for whom the trust servant of venice be to be on guard or there be disaffected brother who have leave they convent and be roam through the land incite to rebellion to whom it be needful to teach the value of quiet however summary the process but venice by a broad training in intrigue and cunning join to she mastery of the finer principle of statesmanship still remain mistress of the spring of action and wear she outward dignity and the disappointment be for she adversary but this training be a costly one for it put a prize on daring confuse the color of right and invariably laureled success -- if it do no more specific harm to the state piero salin have be secretly summon by the ten and give a indefinite leave of absence from venice together with a large discretionary power in the direction of he wanderings with certain other pass and perquisite which bespeak a curious confidence in one who have be know for a successful and much dreaded bandit gondolier but if the government in its complicated labor have need of tool of various temper it have also the wisdom to discern legitimate use for certain wild and lawless spirit when they be like piero full of daring and resource in the day when they have be dweller under the same roof piero have never be able to disregard marina 's will often as he have chafe under the necessity of yield to it and now since she be lady of the giustinianus it have not be otherwise in the rare instance when it have please she to require anything of he yet it would have be incongruous to charge piero with over-sensitiveness on the side of chivalry though marina 's power over he be still as great as in those old day when be unable to shake himself free from she influence he have wish to marry she to make it less piero be not introspective but he doubtless know that he ruling passion be to achieve whatever purpose he might choose to set himself the nicolottus know it well when a few month before they have unanimously elect he to rule over they -- as they chief officer have realize it when they have nominate he without a dissenting voice to this position of gastaldo grande -- a position of great honor fully recognize by the government so the rival faction of the castellanus bear marvelous testimony to he mastery when they go over in surprising number from along the _ giudecca _ and undergo the strange ceremonial of baptism into the opposition party yet when the rival faction of the people have thus conspire to make he they chief it be marina who have alone induce he to accept the honor to all he objection she answer have be ready : nay piero it be meet for thee they need one strong and brave of whom they stand in dread who knoweth they way -- as much bad as good piero have interpose frankly and not without asseveration well know to gondolier it be well say she have answer with the comprehension bear of she intimate knowledge of the class and to keep they in order -- verily none but thou canst do it piero give a expressive shrug have have enough of compliment _ en avantus -- c ' è altro _ he say laugh the tax be heavy and they excellency the tax-gatherer have less patience than the poor gondolier bring of _ zecchinus _ to the purse of the nicolottus but the gastaldo have as little liberty of delay as they excellency leave he to decline the burden -- i might better make shipwreck in the canale orfano it be in this canal that the victim of the inquisition mysteriously disappear and marina have repress a shudder while she answer thou wilt come to I piero if the purse of the nicolottus weigh little thou shalt not fail for this of wear the honor of gastaldo grande nay she have add quickly dispose of he awkward attempt at thanks think not of it again it be for my pleasure to see thee great among the people for i also and my father be of they it be this that i have always wish for thee so chiefly because it have be marina 's will piero have waive he unwillingness and become the central figure in the impose ceremony of the election of the gastaldo grande of the nicolottus who be indeed almost nobles by antiquity and prestige not only claim among themselves the coveted title of _ nobilus _ but under the sanction of the government elect they gastaldo with a degree of ceremonial grant only to high official and prescribe in very ancient book of the law of the traghettus one of the ducal secretary have receive official notice of the vacancy of the office carry in person before the senate by the oldest man of the nicolottus come in purple state to preside over the election when the bell of san nicolò have toll forth the call -- take he seat among the twelve electoral president who already choose by the people await he have swear the inevitable oath of impartiality and fealty to the republic they sit behind lock door until the election be bring to a close -- in that solemn semblance of a ducal election which could not fail to impress the people -- with complicated time-using balloting and coming and going of candidate from adjoining chamber to express they view of the responsibility of the office or to defend themselves against the freely invite attack of opponent or malcontent and for once piero have utter opinion however clumsily upon government and reform from the pulpit of san nicolò in the dignified and interested presence of a ducal secretary the bancalus and the disconcerting throng of gondolier who be intolerant of speech and impatient for they vote and he have retire shamefacedly like a awkward boy while he jejune remark be elaborately discuss by the judge and because he view -- if he have any -- have not be over-luminously set forth in this he maiden oration a party of zealous advocate have nearly cause a uproar by they irrepressible shout of non c ' e da parlar ' ma da fare which be in truth too sure a indication of the temper of the people to be ignore we do not want talk -- but do and for once he have experience a curious sensation which cowardly man call fear but for which piero have neither name nor tolerance when all the people who have be worry he lead he in triumph to the altar and force he down on he stubborn knee to take a solemn oath of allegiance he great bronzed hand all unaccustomed to restraint rest meanwhile in the slippery silken clasp of the ducal secretary here also have the gastaldo receive from those same patrician hand the unfurled banner of the nicolottus with the sacramental word : we consign to you the standard of san nicolò in the name of the most serene prince and as proof that you be the chief gastaldo and head of the people of san nicolò and san raffaele and after that have come freedom of breath with the te deum without which no ceremonial be ever complete in venice chant by all those full-throated gondolier -- a jubilant chorus of man 's voice ring the more heartily through the church for those unwonted hour of repression but when the door have at last be throw wide to the sunshine and the babel of life which rise from the eager thronging populace who have no right of entrance on this solemn occasion -- man who have no vote woman and child who have all they life be nicolottus of the nicolottus -- a venetian must indeed have be stolid to feel no thrill of pride as the procession with great pomp pass out of the church to a chorus of bell and cannon and shout of the people proclaim he they choose chief piero salin be a splendid specimen of the people -- tall broad-shouldered gifted by nature and train by wind and wave to the very perfection of he craft positive nonchalant and masterful affable when not thwart of fewer word than most venetian a adept at all the intricacy of gondolier intrigue and fit by intimate knowledge to circumvent the _ tosus _ moreover he be in favor with the government a crowning grace to other quality not valueless in one of this commanding position no wonder that the enthusiasm of the populace be wild enough to bring the frankest delight to he handsome sun-bronzed face as they rush upon he in a frenzy of appreciation and bear he aloft on they shoulder around the piazza san nicolò almost dizzy with they haste and the smallness of the circle open to they in the little square by the throng who press eagerly around he to grasp he hand -- to wave they banner to shout themselves hoarse for the nicolottus for san nicolò and san raffaele for _ piero gastaldo grande _ for venezium for san marco with bravus felicitazionus and every possible childish demonstration of delight should not the nicolottus -- bless be the madonna -- always overcome the castellanus with piero at they head in those party battle on the bridge which have now grow to be as serious a factor in the life of the gondolier of venice as they be disturb to the citizen at large and therefore the more to the glory of the combatant be he not they own representative -- elect by the very voice of the people as in those lose day of they freedom the doge have be and do not the rival faction so stand in awe of the new gastaldo that from the moment of he nomination there have be disaffection in they rank and now as they shout around he many a sturdy red cap toss he badge disdainfully into the throng and snatch a black bonnet from the nearest head to wave it aloft with cry of the black cap the nicolotti viva san nicolò and again when piero essay to prove himself equal to he honor he few word drop without sound upon the storm of viva -- we do not want talk for we gastaldo -- but do since this happen piero have be indeed a great man among the people -- a popular idol with a degree of power difficult to estimate by one unfamiliar with the custom and tradition of venice hold the key practically to all the traghettus of venice since even before this sweeping disaffection of the castellanus the nicolottus be invariably acknowledge to be the more powerful faction so that now it be a trifling matter to coerce a rival offend traghetto and gondolier private and public be to say the least courteous toward these noble of the nicolottus who be deal with tosus as never before in the history of venice in truth but for those unknown _ observor _ in secret service to the terrible inquisition -- a army sixty thousand strong one third of the entire population of venice -- impressed from noble gondolier ecclesiastic and people of every grade and profession from every quarter of the city and charge to lose nothing of any detail that might aid the dreaded chief of the inquisition in they silent and fearful work -- the power of piero would have be virtually limitless these three terrible unknown chief of the inquisition be never name among the people except with bated breath as i tre di sopra _ the three above _ lest some echo should condemn the speaker but the unsought favor of the government be as much a check as a assistance to piero 's scheme bring he so frequently into requisition for official intrigue that he have less opportunity for counterplot while he knowledge of state secret which he might not compromise of the far-reaching vision of inquisitorial eye and of the swift and relentless execution of those unknown _ osservatorus _ who have be unfaithful to they primal duty as spy make he dare less where other be concerned than he would have foretell before he have be admit to these unexpected official confidence while for himself he have absolutely no fear -- have but one life to order or to lose and care less for its length than for the freedom of its ruling while it remain to he and still marina be as she have always be the gentlest influence in he reckless life -- to some slight extent a inspiring one -- steadying he daring yet generous instinct into a course that be occasionally nearer to nobility than he could ever have chance upon without she yet never able to instil a higher motive power than come from please she it be piero who have escort fra francesco to the border of the roman dominion guard he from pitfall and discovery until he be free to undertake he barefooted penitential pilgrimage upon roman soil and from no faith nor sympathy in the gentle friar 's view but only because he be dear to marina and through piero 's agent establish under threat as terrible as those of the ten themselves have come the news which from time to time he unfold to she while the same secret agent bring perhaps a rumor which the gastaldo grande confide to the ten wherewith some convent plot be unmask or other news so greatly to the keep of the peace of the serene republic that piero might have buy therewith propitiation for all those sin against it of which the government be happily in ignorance now it be a hint of a plot in embryo to seize the arsenal involve some member of distinction in the household of resident ambassador or word of the whereabouts of that wander barefooted emissary with plenary power who have hitherto elude venetian vigilance it be piero also -- although he never confess to it -- who out of compassion for marina 's priestly proclivity when she lay critically ill have make it possible for the jesuit to remove those coffer of treasure which in spite of strictest order to the contrary accompany they on they flight from venice it be not that he take part against venice in the quarrel but that the penalty of exile seem to he sufficient especially as marina have a weakness for priest and he could be generous in he use of power though a man less daring would not have risk the freak but there be a masterful pleasure in outwit the signorium and the ten lessen only by the consciousness that he must keep this triumph to himself and piero also know how to hold he tongue -- for discretion be a needful grace in that strange time of barbaric lawlessness shroud in a more than eastern splendor but even piero sometimes quicken he step as he pass the beautiful sea façade of the ducal palace whose rose-tinted wall seem make only to reflect sunshine for perchance he guess the name of that victim who hang with covered face between the column bear in bold letter on he breast by way of warn the nature of the crime for which he pay such awful penalty -- some crime against the state to-day say piero to himself it be this poor devil who cry to I to shield he when i be force to denounce he to the signorium to-morrow for some caprice of they excellency -- it may be piero salin but the gastaldo relapse easily into such philosophy as he know by the bless san marco and san teodoro themselves he be ready to cry as he reach he gondola there must always be a last ` to-morrow ' xxv life have begin to move again with slow clogged wheel in the can ' giustiniani since that sudden favorable change have come to the lady marina she husband be no longer excuse from attendance in the council hall of the republic and whether to quicken he interest in the affair of the government or because in due course the time have come when a young noble so full of promise should take a prominent place in she council he be now constantly call upon to fill important office in transient committee certainly there be some strange ubiquitous power in that watchful governmental eye and in the broglio it have be whisper that if the young senator be not hold constant by multiply honor and responsibility the home influence might be fateful to the house of giustinianus -- a house too princely and too important to venice to be suffer to tolerate any sympathy with rome giustinian the elder be pronounce in he patriotic partizanship have replace the ambassador to he most catholic majesty of spain whose attempt at conciliation be so ludicrously inadequate that a court of less astute diplomacy than venice might have be tempt to withdraw its embassy spain and venice have be step through a stately dance as it be decorous and princely -- though scarcely misleading -- a interminable round of bow and dignified advance lead no whither since for a forward step there be a corresponding backward motion to complete the _ chassé _ and all in that gracious circle which flatter the actor and the onlooker with a pleasurable sense of progress but the suspense as to the issue of this minuet be all on the side of spain and venice have patience to spare for these pretty time-filling pace which present such semblance of careless ease to the watch embassy england with a understanding quicken by she own experience take a serious interest in the quarrel but he most christian majesty of france be foremost among the prince in effort to hasten the conciliation of the disputant and when henry of france offer to mediate between the power venice say he not nay for if she would take no personal step toward conciliation she yet hold no code by which the intercession of a monarch might seem to lessen she dignity and the come of so princely a envoy as the cardinal di gioiosa be celebrate with fêtes meet to grace the reception of so high a dignitary of the church of rome hence venice under the ban suggest rather a lively tourney in some field of cloth of gold than a excommunicate nation in its time of mourning there be frequent interchange of diplomatic courtesy -- reception to special embassy which have lose nothing of they punctilious splendor there have always be time in venice for absolute decorum and now there be not less than usual since she conduct have be denounce -- though venice and she prestige be untarnished and the world be look on marcantonio in spite of he deep home anxiety be become more and more absorb in the affair of a government which make such claim upon he and for the honor of he house by all venetian tradition he must give to the full that which be exact of he but he work without the brilliancy and enthusiasm of a few month past -- as a man steady by some great sorrow strive more strenuously to give of he best where honor be concern because he be conscious that the heaviness of he heart make all duty irksome for marina with return health -- the physician speak of she thus since they have pronounce she out of danger -- have not fully return to he it be less she whiteness and wanness that oppress he than that nameless change in the face and eye which suggest a ceaseless passionate suppression of the deep impassioned self under the listless exterior there be a immeasurable loss in the sweetness of life to they both though never since the early day of they love have he be so tender and patient so eager to gladden she in little way but she answer he love more often with a mute caress of she hand upon he cheek than with smile or word -- yet with a touch that linger as if to assure he that she love be not less though she herself be change something terribly real lay between they of which it seem better not to speak since all he effort to change she point of view have fail it be utterly sad to have she so nearly herself again and yet so far from he life be hard for this young senator with he multiply honor he wealth and prestige marina have always give impetus to he life now it be he who watch and care for she while she seem to have no will for anything yet have lose that old charming ingenuousness which have underlie she power he have promise himself out of he new pathetic yearning when she have begin to improve that never again should she know a ungratified wish yet now he fear that she would give he no opportunity of grant a request so apathetic have she grow but one day when he be try to rouse she to express a desire she lay she hand eagerly on he ask a thing so strange that unconsciously he start away from she marco mio take I to rome for a moment in spite of all that have go before the young senator be betray into a forgetfulness of he tender mood -- it be so strange this request of a lady of the giustinianus to choose rome rather than venice at a time of contest but she face and manner and speech be luminous with hope she be radiant again as she have not be for many month yet the word escape from he unintentionally and sternly : _ to rome _ yes marco thou and i and the little one we should be so happy again in the palazzo donatello where baby come to we marina a giustinian abide by venice from the day when every man of the can ' giustinianus -- save only the priest who might not take up arm -- lay down he life before lepanto none have ever forsake venice it be not to forsake we venice marco mio she cry with grow eagerness but to serve she -- to plead with the holy father that he will remove the curse and let all the prayer of venice ascend again to the madre beatissima who listen no more it be a service for a giustinian to render she whole soul plead in face and gesture beautiful and compelling he feel she old power reassert itself he almost groan aloud as he put up he hand to shut out this beseech vision of the wife whom he love before all thing but honor -- lest he be among the trust ruler of he country should fail to venice out of the great joy of grant to marina the happiness she crave not for a instant do the young venetian noble question he duty while with head avert lest marina should guess he struggle he invoke that ever-present image of venetium regnant which all she child recognize to stay he from forget it until this temptation be past and he could be strong again but now he know that he be weak from a irrepressible yearning to clasp marina in he arm and grant she heart 's desire -- at whatever cost he dare not touch she lest he should yield the moment 's silence intensify she eagerness and hope he feel they burn in she eye and would not meet they prayer again but she could not wait and she hand flutter restlessly upon he shoulder creep up to touch he cheek thrill he unbearably as if each sensitive finger-tip repeat she urgency he must yield if she keep it there he snatch she hand to he lip and drop it quickly nerve himself to speak steadily lest he should betray irresolution -- so cover the tenderness which would have atone for the positive refusal marina a venetian may not demean himself to ask forgiveness of the holy father in a matter wherein venice have not sin -- but rome marco my beloved if venice be mistake if thou and i might save she she voice break in a sob of agony and she husband gather she in he arm struggle not to weep with she carina -- carinissima he repeat soothingly yet as she grow calmer bring despair again nay marina no loyal senator may question the decision of he government thou presumest too far but thine illness and thy suffering have make thee irresponsible then grieve so to cross she in she weakness and pain with all he tenderness in he voice he hasten to atone for the firmness of the declaration which have sufficiently prove he staunchness marina thou and i -- be we not giustinianus -- more than all other venetian owe we loyalty in time of stress and for love of thee beloved shall venice find I faithful in she need -- i and all my household true and all my fortune hers in service if need should be -- as thus i vow before they all on that day when the senate give thee to I and make thee the sweetest patrician lady in all the land we will not fail they beloved he clasp she close hold she firmly as if to infuse she with he faith all blessing be for those who do the right marina we need not fear never have she see he face so inspire so masterful so tender it be a revelation the whole of they beautiful love story be write on it master all the tradition of venice yet bind he more closely to the service of he country for a moment she look at he awestruck longing to give the submission which would bring she rest it be not strange that she love he so oh if she might but acquiesce in he view of right madre beatissima life be hard and the way of right be the way of the cross -- how many holy woman have find it so one hand steal to the little crucifix beneath she robe and press its roughened surface into she breast for she must not place the sweetness of this earthly love before the duty of the heavenly one santa marium save I she pray while only for one moment she droop she head to he shoulder and nestle close that he should know she heart be he whatever come -- _ whatever come _ be it strange that she agony threaten she reason in that one little moment of comfort which she yearn to hold free from suffer that its remembrance might uphold she the powerful vision of the tintoretto 's awful _ judgment _ rise beckoningly before she it be the doom of venice and she alone -- so impotent -- recognize the danger the vision pursue she night and day the river of the wrath of god leap up to meet those frown sky of he most just anger and venice -- superb disdainful -- overwhelm between the cloud of innumerable soul tortured and writhe flee from before the face of the holy one no more than a mere film of whirling atom fall -- fall into a abyss of horror -- the dim doom shape wear face that have smile into hers -- with a inarticulate moan she hide she face on she husband 's shoulder marco she whisper with a effort for she strength be spend not though it be a vision reveal by the madonna san donato thou wouldest take I to rome not though i could make thee comprehend what it mean for I -- and thee she wait breathlessly for he answer with pulse that seem to pause for the momentous decision not daring to look at he lest she should falter and retract for never again would she ask this question which even now she have put in the form of a assertion nay marina the madonna asketh naught of thee but that which gracious woman must give -- submission to they prince -- in which beloved thou seemest to fail and duty to thy church in which thou have ever be before all other art now neglectful for from the altar of you home no mass ascend no fragrance of flower nor praise venice be more faithful in that which she command and we carina may not longer disregard she will without suspicion of disloyalty since fra francesco be no longer here i will apply for some new ministrant hast thou a wish in this choice of a priest for the service of we oratory she have start away from he almost resentfully that he could charge she -- whose fealty to she church be kill she -- with neglect of any duty it impose but out of she larger love she understand he better than he know she and she forgive he and nestle back again he have not be bring up to place the requirement of the church before the command of venice -- few patrician be in those day -- she could not make he realize the awful restriction of that ban which by she strict teaching make it impossible for the faithful to worship in venice while it remain unwithdrawn yet he could count it as non-existent she be glad that she have feel the tumult of he heart while he answer she so calmly it make she realize what it cost he to deny she prayer it assure she that a staunch sense of duty underlie he strength pitilessly it assure she also that he would not change and the very firmness which come between they make she love and admire he the more in the midst of she pain she be proud that he also have conscience on he side however misguided it seem to she why do the good madonna permit these difference how be it possible for marco with he quick intellectual grasp not to comprehend the truth -- not to see the terror that venice have bring upon herself he be suffer also but only because she suffer never would he understand she agony the rudest crudest weight of the cross she must lift alone weary and spend with the bitter struggle she summon all she strength to answer he as though the word be easily speak since it be not fra francesco whom we love she say i know no other choose thou my marco he face flush with pleasure that she resistance seem conquer and when we have find we confessor shall we go together -- thou and the little one and i he ask brightly to the island of sant ' elenà which thou lovest and we ourselves bring flower to deck we chapel for it have be long since mass be say therein yes marco mio she answer to the love in he voice struggle to repress every accent of dissent for in she heart she tell herself that the chapel of the palazzo giustinianus be he not hers since they faith be divide and for I only not for he to worship there be sin and the beautiful day together alone on the island with the flower -- it be the gift of the holy mother to help I endure and she husband as he leave she carry with he a smile that satisfy he but turn in the doorway for another glance -- so sweet it be to have she all he own again -- a pang shot through he for the glory be go from she face -- or be it the shadow that make it so wan and gray -- and no smile hide the question anguish of she eye nay he himself be fanciful for it be too far to see and he could not shake off the sadness of the day that be past but he must teach himself to forget they for marina have smile at he radiantly as in the sweet old day and together they would deck the chapel for a benediction xxvi fra paolo be fast become a center of romance so many be the attempt from suspicious quarter to manage private interview which the senate have think necessary to frustrate and the fact that he be know to have decline the escort of guard which the senate urge upon he as means of safety endow he with a sort of heroic halo in the eye of the lesser multitude fate largo a fra paolo they call in the mercerium if the people press he too closely -- make way for fra paolo -- and a strange youthfulness as of satisfied affection be begin to grow upon he calm face he have have no craving feel that duty suffice yet through this absolute yielding of himself to express the message with which he life be charge he heart have warm within he and now unsought the people love he magnify the interest of every minor happen of he life and zealously gather anecdote of the day before he be great a group of he brother friar be stroll back and forth under the fret colonnade of the greater court of the servus one evening before vespers a glow of relish on they genial cowled face rehearse the tale of fra paolo 's unconventional slipper for it be the hour of small gossip and the day have be warm they be scarlet like a eminence 's explain fra giulio who have secure this choice bit for the entertainment of he special crony for all color be one to fra paolo who have no distinction for trifle because he spendeth himself in scheming for honor that belong elsewhere interpose a disaffected brother who have stroll up and join the group uninvited he belong to another chapter of the servus and have but recently come among they honor have pass he by and duty attract he less and he have make no friend within the convent though he profess great interest in all that concerned fra paolo and have even offer to wait upon he in chapel or in he cell thou fra antonio seek thine own friend fra giulio retort with unusual asperity for this tale be too good for thine hearing be another triumph for fra paolo in the day when he be only a frate of the servus _ ebbene _ and then urge the eager auditor crowd around the speaker for the incongruity of the grave padre in he fray and rusty gown attempt to usurp a decoration lend interest to the petty happen _ ebbene _ and then he eminence of borromeo -- for it seemeth that only the illustrious play part in this farce -- fra giulio continue with keen enjoyment he eminence of borromeo have explain at rome that fra paolo be innocent of contempt of rule verily the fault might have be count to one who have no sin of the body to atone for sneer fra antonio who could not be convert to the prevail tone of admiration for this abnormal be who walk among they not as other man and toward whom he own attitude be a singular compound of obsequiousness and cynicism even the slipper of you saint can do no wrong he add venomously but thou in canonize shoe couldst walk but wearily fra antonio lest they should lead thee in unwonted way one of the party retort maliciously fra paolo have fear of no man and that which he declareth he knoweth say another of the fratus lower he voice and glance about he furtively and it have chance to he more than once to be wiser than the serenissimo and the ten themselves -- may san marco have other use for he ear but the day that we famous signor bragadin be summon from he palace on the giudecca to make he promise gold for the signorium i stand with the crowd in the mercerium to see he pass with he two black dog and they golden collar look for all the world like power of evil and we gold-maker himself go to the senate like a noble with he friend the cornaro and the dandolo in crimson robe -- the people throng to see he pass ay bragadin be a saintly man one of they retort mockingly dost remember the tale how that he fool the worshipful signorium to leave he a week in peace that he might take the bless sacrament quietly find therein ' a holy joy ' that should fit he to proceed to the service of venice -- look meanwhile for means of escape _ davvero _ but this be the hour of he highest favor and i follow with the rest of the crowd till there be scarce breathing space under the clock tower where the _ magi _ be just come forth to salute the madonna and the bambino at the stroke of the day and the people be shout so one could not hear the bell for cry of ` gold gold bragadin ' we surge back against the doorway of the ` nave d'oro ' the people struggle with each other lest they should lose the sight as he pass through the piazza and suddenly there come a voice -- cold and scornful and low but no man lose the word -- ` thou art weary in the multitude of thy counsel let now the astrologer the star-gazer the monthly prognosticator stand up and save thee from these thing that shall come upon thee ' the people stop they push and look aghast to see who speak but i could have swear it be fra paolo 's voice i catch a glimpse of he stand quietly just inside the ` nave d'oro ' while the other signor who go there to ridotto be out in the mercerium to see the show and i make haste away lest the crowd should object to my habit for be like fra paolo 's -- they be so crazy for bragadin follow in the footstep of the signorium like good venetian who tell the say to the signorium when it might have crush fra paolo fra giulio question jealously it may well have be he excellency the signor donato who be of the council in those day but a man too strong to have a mind to the folly of the other and who walk about the chamber give sign of much displeasure while bragadin make he gold and the next day fra paolo be command before the signorium to meet the provveditor of the mint -- be the only man who have dare speak he mind before the signorium have prove the worthlessness of bragadin 's promise and we fine gold-maker exchangeth he palace for a prison for the test of the crucible be all too easy for fra paolo who speaketh naught that he knoweth not santa marium here cometh the ` bride ' some one exclaimed warningly for none of fra paolo 's friend have the courage for frivolity in he grave presence harmless as it might appear in he absence and this watchword be often hear in the cloister as he approach he be converse earnestly with he secretary fra fulgenzio evidently on business of the senate have remain in the convent all day contrary to he usual custom fra fulgenzio have be to and fro with message and once have return from the ducal palace escort several grave personage who have go to fra paolo 's cell for some conference which give rise to pleasant comment in the convent -- since the serenissimo could not dispense with the personal service of its consultore for a single day and every honor show to fra paolo be dear to the heart of the servus fra paolo pause only for a moment as he pass the group to exchange a greet but he keen quiet glance take in every expression from the affectionate smile of old fra giulio to the jealous discontent of fra antonio whose gaze droop before he while he hasten to give the accustomed sign of reverence due to one so high in authority fra paolo consider he seriously for a moment before resume he stroll fra antonio he say in he passionless voice the head of the roman chapter have make inquiry for thee and know naught of thy presence here thou wilt soon be recall that thou doest -- do quickly a sudden pallor overspread the feature of fra antonio who stagger and would have fall as he make a effort to steal away unobserved have not the other come to he assistance what be thy sudden ailment one of they ask he roughly for he be no favorite but before the tremble friar could steady he voice or choose he word he be forget for the evening bell begin to chime for vespers and as the brother come flock through the cloister the great bell at the entrance gate on the fondamenta dei servi send back the special deep-toned call which take precedence of every order within the convent those who have already reach the chapel stream back in wild confusion to answer the summons which fill the court with clang echo while the silvery note of the chapel chime sound faintly in the pause of the deeper reverberation -- like the voice of a timid child cry to be comfort when it do not understand in the excitement that follow fra antonio be forget by all but fra giulio who have be watch he closely as he make he way with difficulty toward the low arched passage which lead in the direction of the dormitory lean on I say fra giulio who stand bar the way nay reply the other who seem scarcely able to stand i must need reach my cell a sudden illness have overtaken I but fra giulio usually so compassionate that he be call woman heart do not move later a remedy shall be bring thee he answer coldly thou hearest the great summons which none of we order may disobey it be rare and solemn to hear that call something of moment have chance _ ecco _ now we shall know he add in a tone of relief as fra gianmarium appear from under the convent entrance whither he have go to receive the chief of the ten who now enter the great court with he in formal state with a secretary and attendant and a officer of the guard the tumultuous crowd begin to range itself in orderly group at the command of the superior and fra antonio control himself with a supreme effort as a body of palace guard in brilliant uniform scatter themselves among the black-robed friar the heavy gate close behind they and the dismal toll of the bell end in a silence through which the heart-beat of fra antonio sound in he ear louder and more ominous than the harsh tone of the summons have do a moment before who be those two terrible gondolier all in black who stand by the water-entrance on the fondamenta be it the shadow of they great black hat that darken they feature like mask why be they there he glance stealthily at the face of the friar they be more full of interest than dread while the eye of the little chorister who stand robe for chapel service shone with delight evidently to all that community the interruption be a event fill with possibility of excitement that be welcome as break the monotony of the daily round perhaps no one have notice those gondolier only father gianmarium the superior and the senator giustinian giustinianus the chief of the ten be stern and angry and fra paolo stand between they -- calm and inscrutable as ever now think fra antonio before the curiosity of the friar have be satisfy -- while no one be think of he -- he must escape but at every passage lead out of the court a scarlet coat stand guard save only before the low doorway of the dormitory stair fra giulio 's eye be fix earnestly adoringly upon he beloved fra paolo and he have move a little way from the wall fra antonio steal softly in behind he breathlessly anxious he be already under the archway when he unsteady foot stumble in a hollow of the worn brick pavement just within the opening -- in another moment he should be safe but a voice mean for he alone leap through all that crowd and petrified he with horror it be fill with a sarcastic grace as it offer the courtesy whoever have need to leave this cloister before the inquiry of venice be satisfied shall be serve by the gondola of the _ piombus _ -- which wait i piombi those prison under the lead where the heat be slow torture -- this be the meaning of the mask gondolier surely it be the chief of the ten who have speak fra antonio tremble from head to foot but be he not already far enough within the narrow wind passage to be hide from the cruel gaze of that man of power half a inch might make the difference between life and death he fold he black gown closer about he -- stealthily -- so that it might not rustle watch the faint shadow on the pavement in agony -- what if he hand have be see as he pass it behind he to gather up the fold those word could not be mean for he they be merely a general order there be twenty man -- forty man in that company more wicked than he he could not turn back and face they to glide into he place again it would be certain death but when the chief of the ten or father gianmarium should begin to speak he must go on he lift one foot to be ready a great sweat break out on he forehead -- would this silence never end he dare not stir until there should be word to hold the crowd for if he should be catch -- be they speak -- he heart thump so that he could not hear santa marium -- death could not be worse thou art summon they be call thee say fra giulio close beside he in a low hard voice that change to one more compassionate as the friar turn he livid face toward he i know not thy fault but fra paolo will plead for thee for thou art ill verily fra paolo be no man of mercy nay but of justice he will not remember thy discourtesy _ discourtesy _ ay it be true fra giulio do not know -- nobody know he would take courage and plead to be forgive he manifold discourtesy toward this idol of the servus it be for this that he be summon the palace guard be approach the low passage and the extremity of he need steady he he rally all he power for a last effort and shake off they touch advance into the court -- he face wither and pain-stricken might have plead for he but for the strange hardness of the line it be a sudden malady that bid I seek my cell he gasp i know not that you excellency have need of I he be a ghastly thing in he fear the inexorable chief of the ten survey he in silence for a brief moment that seem unending ay fra antonio we _ have _ need of thee -- more than another for word have reach venice privately from special friendly source in rome that thou art come hither charge with a message of vital import to a trust servant of the republic thou hast leave of the signorium to declare it in this presence fra antonio open he dry lip and frame some word of which he hear no echo the inquiry of venice be satisfy say the chief thou art the man whom we seek conduct he to the gondola of the piombus fra antonio fall upon he knee in wild supplication as the guard gather around he but the father superior detain they with a prohibitory motion i crave you excellency 's pardon for the better ruling of this community and the clearing of all the innocent among we brotherhood i have summon hither every soul under my rule that no scandal may arise you excellency will permit that the charge under which this arrest be make be declare assent be give by a impatient gesture fra antonio while he have be a recipient of we hospitality say the superior be describe by trustworthy advice from we chapter in rome but just receive as a person who have design upon the life of a member of this community it be a false scandal cry fra antonio who have find he voice at last i shall not be condemn without proof the truth be know say fra paolo lean toward he and speak low it be better for thee to confess -- or depart in silence but the man be beside himself with fear he catch at he last desperate chance of favor drag himself to the foot of fra paolo and pour out a abject tale of petty jealousy and offens for which he obsequiously crave pardon of this idol of the convent protest with horrible oath that he be guilty of nothing more the rare shade of compassion that have soften fra paolo 's face when he give he warning deepen to a glory and he eye shine with a grace that be like love as he raise the wretched man and strove to arrest he torrent of word _ god _ heareth thee my brother he say pleadingly have pity on thine own soul kneel to he alone in thy great need but spend not thy strength with trifle that demean we both if thine heart have aught against I i forgive it then turn to the chief he beseech that the trial should be short -- for the man be ill and i would have quiet speech with he for the honor of the servus let the matter be dispatch and let proof be bring the superior demand surprised and displeased at any softness in fra paolo whose dominant note be justice rather than mercy we will grant he the favor of a farewell collation ere he taketh leave of he entertainer say the giustinian let the refection be bring the friar exchange glance of astonishment and dismay as a dish of fruit and of white bread be bring forward by two of the ducal guard on a costly salver work with the arm of venice it be like the simple refreshment they have often carry to fra paolo 's cell when he have be absorb by some train of thought which accord to he wont he would not suspend for any hour of sleep or meal until the problem have be conquer fra giulio tremble he would have say those be the very grape he have choose to tempt fra paolo 's slender appetite -- white with the vein of purple -- all as he have leave they on he desk that day with the plate of fine white bread when the midday meal be serve -- but in no lordly dish a faint cry escape fra antonio and he put he hand before he face there be a moment of breathless silence but no compassion anywhere upon all those strain and eager face except in the eye of fra paolo which seem divine in pity as he draw nearer the guilty man and put he arm about he to steady he these say the chief of the ten fine grape and wheaten bread exquisitely flavored with a most precious powder thou shalt presently enjoy in this presence -- with the compliment of the signorium who have most carefully consider this repast -- unless thou dost instantly make frank and full confession of thy deed and thine accomplice and if more be to thy taste the cruel voice go on for no answer come since in these matter thou hast a consummate knowledge -- thou art permit by grace of the signorium to use the contents of this packet which have be find within the lining of thy cassock this powder have a marvelous power to still the blood which floweth over-swiftly -- we have proof more than sufficient for the arrest you excellency interpose the officer of the guard as he give the signal and no deposition can be take here for the man have faint from he fright but almost unnoticed the guard bear they burden from the cloister to the gondola of the prison of the piombus for it have take but a moment to complete the unfinished tale in the mind of the listener and with one accord they be gather about fra paolo eager to express they loyalty they indignation they gratitude for he escape the court be in a tumult fra paolo _ we _ fra paolo mingle with burst of vehement condemnation and rapid question we consultore and because he be necessary to venice the chime of the chapel sound joyously break in upon these demonstration and two little chorister come run back to tell they that by order of fra gianmarium a te deum for the safety of fra paolo would be sing in lieu of the interrupted vesper service the signorium have have warning without end the chief of the ten be explain hastily to father gianmarium as they stroll toward the chapel the holy father wanteth he out of venice since he have be consultore -- for the man be a marvel but he would rather have he alive than dead -- as the learn scioppius have explain not long since to fra paolo himself and this whole plot have be unveil to we by one who watcheth secretly in rome for the interest of venice since there have be no open communication it be hatch in the orsinus palace in that holy city not unknown to some of they eminence the chief accomplice be friar -- we have the name of the other two and piero salin be on the watch the stake be high for the friar ' game -- five thousand _ scudus _ apiece and a promise of church preferment but piero salin have way of do he duty the senate will send order for the better protection of its consultore meanwhile let he not venture forth without two ducal guard you excellency knoweth that fra paolo will have no state a cowl over they saintly face if it please he fancy it be the order of the senate wait better plan of safety -- a suite in the ducal palace or a house connect therewith by some guard passage warning have be send we most urgently by friend of the republic of a great price and absolution for he who may bring fra paolo to rome -- alive or dead xxvii these day have be important in the senate in the deliberation prior to the departure of di gioiosa the concession which rome have persistently ask have be so persistently and diplomatically decline that even the wily cardinal dare no longer press they and it seem at last that there be to be truce to the cautious and subtle word-weighing of month past as di gioiosa suddenly realize that he hold the ultimatum of the republic have take he departure for rome in the night -- conceive it easier perhaps to confess he partial defeat to the dignified signorium by proxy so he make the announcement through a gentleman of he household the next morning while he be already journey toward the expectant pope to whom he carry bitter disappointment and the heart of the cardinal himself have be scarcely less set upon those point of amelioration which he have not obtain it be a blow to he diplomacy and to he churchman 's pride for the term which the cardinal be empower to offer be scarcely less haughty than be the attitude which venice have assume throughout the quarrel he holiness have wish that venice as a first step should cancel the protest which she have widely publish declare the interdict invalid but venice with cool logic have decline to accede to this since the protest be base upon the censure be practically annul by they withdrawal -- which must therefore first take place and although by this same logic she be lead to declare that no act on the part of the republic would then be necessary to void she protest she consent to give a write to that effect so soon as the censure should have be withdraw the pope request that all who have leave venice on account of the interdict should upon its withdrawal return and be reinstate in they former privilege -- make a special point of include the jesuit but here also venice make and keep to she amendment all should return with full privilege and favor -- save only the jesuit who have in various way render themselves obnoxious to the government the revocation of those law which the pope demand be not to be think of since this would be question the right of venice to make law neither be they suspension possible for the law be just but he holiness might rest assure that they would be use in moderation and christian piety only -- as they have ever be the real concession -- the only one -- be in the case of the ecclesiastical prisoner -- the abbot of nervessa and the canon of vicenza -- whom he holiness persist in claim but monsieur du fresne the french ambassador suggest that the republic should without prejudice to she right of jurisdiction over criminal ecclesiastic _ give _ these prisoner to the ambassador as a mark of special favor to he king the mediator who might then consign they to the pope if he choose -- they be he to deal with venice with she power of subtle reasoning gladly embrace this way out of the difficulty which have first appear insuperable so to _ give _ they she say appease confirm rather than question we authority since no one may ` give ' to another that over which he exercise no dominion it be not venice but france who be to request that the interdict be withdraw that she might not seem to other nation to be under the ban for the republic do not acknowledge that this condition of disfavor have go into effect she could not therefore personally request the pope to change a attitude which put only himself in the wrong but when there be a hint of absolution which the cardinal in he zeal would also ask the holy father to pronounce venice be silent from displeasure she have do no wrong she would neither ask nor accept absolution the senate might indeed be weary of these interminable discussion and unending compliment and glad of a respite in which to turn to other matter but there be no idle hour in that August assembly though it might chance that some whimsical phase of statesmanship lighten by way of entr ` acte the severity of they deliberation they be possibly not unpleasantly aware of the irony of the situation when a letter from they governor in constantinople announce the extreme solicitude of the turkish government for the life and welfare of the holy father who have so furthered they interest by widely incite discord among the nation of christianity that see therein a mark of the special favor of allah the sultan have order prayer and procession for the continue welfare of he holiness the singular jealousy of the venetian for the solidarity of they government with they no less singular jealousy of individual aggrandizement together with the rare perception of mental characteristic that be foster by the daily culture of the council in which every noble take he part lead they constantly to ignore they selfish hope in order to choose the right man for the place these sentiment act and react upon each other have secure they political prosperity but a disaffection be begin to make itself feel in the senate which lead ultimately to over-limitation of power and such multiply check and suspicion that noble living and wise ruling become impossible it be a time of suppress excitement and there have be a grave discussion as to the grow power of the ten against which some of the senator have dare to express themselves openly for many of these strong man be begin to feel that they government weigh upon they like a fate crush all liberty and individuality and of secret trial without defense there be tragic memory haunt the annals of that grave tribunal but so great be the complication of the involve venetian machine -- so many be the mystery and fear environ the daily life of these patrician -- that each feel the actual to be safer than the untried unknown and surrender the hope of change tighten the cord that uphold the government as they only means of safety for there be a under side to all this gold-tissued splendor that be sometimes lay bare to the people in spite of the deftness with which the signorium stand tirelessly ready to cover up the flaw and a recent sad travesty of justice be one of the weird happening of this time not long since a formal _ decree of pardon _ have be solemnly declare and publish throughout venetium at which the people stand aghast for the man to whom this clemency be graciously extend have be condemn and execute between the column of san marco and san teodoro ten year before -- standing accuse of conspiracy against the state there have be many murmuring when the name of this old patrician hold honorable office in service of the republic have be erase from the golden book and he have suffer he ignominious death protest that the charge be false and that all who have aid in he condemnation should die before the year be out he die word have prove a grim prophecy which encourage by the pressure of the senator induce the signorium to order a re-investigation of he case whereby the _ mane _ of this dishonored servant of the state be re-instate in that serene favor now so worthless and to-day the people gather in gloomy silence while the great bell of the campanile toll the call to the solemn funeral pageant by which the republic offer reparation over the exhume body of the victim the senator wrap in mourning cloak surround the bust of the man they desire to honor as it be carry in triumph to the church where the tomb be prepare and the three _ avvogadorus _ who have the keep of the golden book bear it on a great cushion behind the marble effigy the leaf bind open where the name be re-inscribed here also walk the domestic of the re-habilitated noble of venice -- the hatchment that have be doom to oblivion freshly embroidered upon they sleeve above they token of crêpe the doge and the signorium all take part in this tragic confession of wrong do penance unflinchingly for the sin of they predecessor for venice could be munificent in reparation not shrink from she own humiliation to appease outraged justice and confirm she power and there be nothing lack that might add impressiveness to the pageant but the people look on gloomy and unappeased fill with a horror which the funeral pomp do little to quiet they do not follow as the _ cortège _ descend the step of the piazzetta to embark in the wait gondola that have be lavishly provide by the republic santissima marium they want to get back to they own quarter on the giudecca and breathe a little sunshine what do one noble matter less or more but it be a gloomy barcarolle that a dead man sing and one that have not die he own death a woman answer under she breath as she cross herself with a shudder the wind inflate the empty fold of the crimson robe that drape the bier carry it almost into the water as the gondola glide away from the piazzetta san marco save we he want none of they pomp say a onlooker scornfully the ten good year of he life and a quiet grave in san michele -- the signorium would buy they dear to give they to _ he _ to-day yet if some have die unjustly there be not less need of ceaseless vigilance against unceasing intrigue within and without that body which hold the power and one morning the senate be throw into a state of great agitation by disclosure from one of the brother of the frarus indubitably confirm by the papers which he deliver into the hand of the doge it be beyond belief giustinian giustinianus exclaim to the lady laura how spain findeth method to make traitor in venice itself it be a nation treacherous to the core and it be beyond the diplomacy of any government -- save only ours -- to maintain relation on such a basis of fraud what be there of new to chide they for she ask with keen interest be not the old enough to make one wrathful boastful threat of arm against the republic if she yield not obedience to the holy father with secret promise of armed assistance to he holiness to keep he firm in he course at the very moment of she cringing attempt at mediation lest france should carry off the glory -- and because spain have neither man to spare for rome nor courage to declare against the republic nor diplomacy to bring anything to a issue nay now they art return to venice forget the disturbing way of spain the lady laura answer with a attempt at conciliation i be glad that thy mission in that strange land have come to a end ay but the way of spain do make traitor of we all giustinian exclaimed hotly when a senator of the republic have such amity for the ambassador of he most catholic majesty forsooth that at vespers and at matins in the frarus they must use the self-same kneel stool -- a tenderness and devotion beautiful to see in man so great for it be aye one and aye the other and never both who tell they bead at once -- that verily some brother of the frari doth take cognizance of a thing so rare and saintly and bringeth word thereof to the serenissimo _ with matter of much interest find within the prie-dieu _ giustinian ay these minute of the noble senator who acteth so well the spy for favor of spain would do honor to a ducal secretary for accuracy of information concern weighty private matter before the council and due acknowledgment of so rare a courtesy doth not fail we in the very hand of the ambassador himself for this letter also be intercept this frate who have bring the information verily deserveth honor for so great a service and the other be there more than one treatment for a traitor giustinian exclaim with increase temper and for the ambassador -- it have already be courteously signify to he that the air of venice agreeth not well with one of he devotional tendency tell I the name of the traitor the lady laura urge come close and lay she hand upon he shoulder nay say she husband shake off she touch impatiently my anger doth unlock my speech to a point i have not dream for the matter may be hold before the inquisition but it be a name unknown to thee and new to this dignity which he weareth like a clown the freedom be still too great for this entry to the senate the serra have do its work too lightly if it leave space for one parvenu to-morrow when thou takest the air in thy gondola my lady laura thou shalt look between the column of the ducal palace and know whatever the state will declare to thee of that which concerneth the government alone the time be perilous they will be better when the interdict be remove -- ay -- no -- one know not it be a matter too grave for woman and too little for the republic to grieve about he holiness would have we on we knee weep like naughty infant and abjectly craving he pardon for daring to make we own law and uphold we prince giustinian there be more to it than that ay there _ be _ more if it setteth the woman up to preach to we and to expound the law of the republic -- a knowledge in which i know not that they hold the mastery take not the tone of marina who have come near to kill herself and make half a fool of marcantonio nay marco be true to venice and swerveth not and for we daughter -- she have suffer till it break my heart to look into she face poor child and thou giustinian wert little like thyself when she lay almost die the signor nanus have confess to I that in rome there be much intriguing for she favor -- of which she suspect naught it be a harm to they that they go to rome i would not have have it so ay thou would ` st not have have it so thou would ` st have have it all thine own way retort giustinian who be become impossible to please now that the path of government be grow more thorny and exacting and the lion show no sign of climb to he portal that father confessor of hers have much to answer for keep the little one well out of the way of they craft -- dost thou hear he be to be train for venice after the way of the can ' giustinianus and marcantonio -- who know he have drift into he favorite reverie and wander abstractedly out upon the balcony look longingly toward the rose-colored palace where he every ambition centre but he feel the glitter jeweled eye of the patron saint of venice glare upon he mockingly from he vantage point upon the column while the very twist of the out-thrust tongue insinuate a personal message of malice and defeat xxviii venice be flood with moonlight the long line of palace down the canal grande shine back from the breast of the water star with light repeat again and again in the ripple surface a ceaseless melody fill the air braid of sound familiar only to this magic city -- echo of laughter from balcony high in air silvery tintinnabulation fall like dripping of water from speed oar franker burst of merriment from the open window of the palace low murmured tone of lover in content from glide gondola hoarse shout of quick imperious order from gondolier to offend gondolier as they pass -- apostrophe to liquid name of guardian saint too melodious for denunciation hurl back with triple expletive and forget the next moment in friendly parsiflage here and there a strain of order music in serenade from a group of friendly gondola sway only with the tranquil movement of the water or the mysterious tone of a violin utter a soul prayer mean for some single listener which yet steal tremblingly forth upon the night air -- more passionate more beautiful and true than that other human voice which break the quiet of a neighbor calle with some monotonous love song of the people and far away perhaps in the quainter square of the more primitive island village -- in burano or chioggium -- before the duomo some reader lie at full length in the brilliant moonlight under the banner of san marco he boccaccio open before he repeat in a half-chant monotonous and drone some favorite tale from the well-worn page to listener who pause in group in they evening stroll and linger until another story be begin this time it be some strophe from the gerusalemme to which a pass gondolier may chant the answering strain -- for this be the very poem of the people echo familiarly from lip to lip and tale from the tasso be not seldom work into the ebony carving of they bark meanwhile the younger man and maiden on a neighbor fondamenta keep step to the music of some stroll player who live content on the trifling harvest of these moonlight festivity in the great piazza of san marco with its hundred of light and its hurry throng life be gayer than in the day crowd come and go under the arcade loiter at the table closely set before the brilliant cafe or stroll with laughter and snatch of song and free venetian banter where there be less restraint up and down the broad space of the piazza between the colonnade and the burnish eastern magnificence of san marco beyond the reach of the yellow lamp flame -- they laughing face grotesque and weird in the white glare of the moon but under the shadow of the broglio and those great column of the ducal palace there be only slow-moving figure here and there wrap in cloak and dark under the low unlighted arch talk in undertone which even the watchful lion -- so near so cunning -- do not always overhear but in the calle half in moonlight and half in shadow night wear a more poetic air of mystery and quiet and if a fear but come in pass some dread spot of tragic memory a gentle virgin at every turn with a dingy flickering flame beneath she image be wait to grant she grace -- for be not venice the virgin city and on the splendid palace in the broad canal the watch madonna stand glorified in exquisite sculpture and cunningest blending of color -- ofttime a crown of light above she or ray of star symbolic beneath she foot -- cast she benediction far out on the water which ever in motion repeat it in shimmering widening circle -- all-embracing -- in which the star of heaven shine tangle and confuse with these star of a paradise in which earth have so large a part yet in the glory and charm of this venetian night how should there be space for sorrow or thought of care or cause for the tear which brim the eye of the lady marina as she sit in she sculptured balcony at the bend of the canal grande watch for the come of marcantonio who linger late at the senate when every moment be precious to she ever since she husband have leave she she have sit with she little one gather convulsively in she arm shower upon he a tenderness so passionate and so unlike herself in its uncontrolled expression that the child wonder and afraid be but half-beguile by the rare treat of the music and the light of the canal grande and clamor for he nurse and now he be go with a kiss upon he sweet round baby-mouth that be like a benediction and a dirge in which a whole heart of wild mother love sob itself out in renunciation -- but to he it be only strange and she herself have hush the grieving quiver of he lip and quickly fill he dimpled hand with flower to win the farewell caress of that dancing smile which irradiate he face like a April sunbeam parting the pink lip over a vision of pearly infant tooth below in the chapel she maiden be deck it as for a festa with vine and blossom which she and marco have bring that day -- that heavenly day -- from the beautiful island of sant ' elenà wander alone like rustic lover over the luxuriant flower-starred meadow and through the cloistered garden of its ancient convent linger awhile in the chapel of the giustinianus while he rehearse the deed of those of he own name who sleep there so tranquilly under they marble effigy -- primate ambassador statesman and general ay and more than these -- lover mother and little one and now while she sit alone in this holy moonlight the voice of she maiden come in sound of merriment through the fret stonework of the great window and a sweet odor of altar candle and incense mingle with the breath of the blossom that be waft up to she for to-morrow for the first time since she illness there would be matins in the chapel of the palazzo and marcantonio have assure she that the new father confessor be much like fra francesco -- come also from the convent of the servus that he might seem nearer to she who have so love the gentle confessor ay she have love he with a holy reverence for he goodness and gentleness and faith for he inflexible grasp of duty accord to he view of right for he teaching which she could understand and which she believe the holy mother have teach he -- for he self-denial and suffering and now for a few moment she forget herself -- forget to watch for marco she thought busy with the sad tale of fra francesco which piero always _ in viaggio _ for business of the senate have tell she but a few day before -- news that have reach he from the frontier the gentle confessor have indeed complete he pilgrimage barefoot to rome but have gain no favor with the holy father have at first be welcome as a deserter from the enemy 's camp flatter and ply with question to which fra francesco give no answer -- wish no harm to venice nor to any who sit in the council of the republic whereupon he lodgings have be change and all communication with the brother of the servite chapel in rome have be forbid and again and more than once he have be bring forth to be question and again there have be nothing tell of that which they seek for they ask he of he friend and he heart be true but it be tell that he have use strange word each man be answerable to he own soul and to god for that which he believeth he answereth not for the faith of another man -- nor shall he bring danger upon he friend -- who have also he conscience and god for judge of he faith and action but what of fra paolo he have be ask how doth he defend himself for lead thus the cause of venice against rome be i my brother 's keeper the gentle fra francesco have answer and have say no more thou shalt at least show we how one may obtain speech with he for the furtherance of he soul 's salvation -- apart from the vigilance of the senate and without suspicion in the convent that the message cometh from rome else be it not receive in that unholy city and in this also fra francesco be obdurate and then for disobedience to authority acknowledge lawful by he own submission come prison -- wherein he languish always obdurate -- and death -- perhaps from discontent or homesickness one know not or from failure of he plan or -- there be a question of torture but one know not if it be true no no it be not true marina have exclaim quiver when piero have tell she the story it be wicked to say these thing -- and they be not true but now alone -- apart from all the brightness about she from every hope of happiness except those few brief hour with marco -- she do not know if it might not be true she heart be too sad to deny any pain that have be or that might be but fra francesco 's sad and gentle eye seem to smile upon she through whatever distance might be between they -- of this or of any other world -- without reproach for those who have bid he suffer and charge she to keep she faith if it be true she say the end of pain be reach and he have win he happiness -- why cometh not my marco a gondola of the nicolottus detach itself from a group of serenader just above the palace be catch for a few moment among the _ palus _ before the can ' giustinianus and then float leisurely down toward the piazzetta she note it idly while she sit wait for marco for in the gondola there be a graceful figure closely wrap clasp she mantle yet more closely with a hand that be white and slender enough for one of the nobility yet the gondolier wear the black sash of the nicolottus with the great hat of a bravo shade he face it be some intrigue she say almost unconsciously in the midst of she sad dream oh marco thou art come it have be long without thee the senate be but just dismiss he answer smile fondly at the eagerness which give to she pale face a pass flush of health but why be the lady bea not with thee he question abruptly she be in the chapel make it fair with flower thou knowest it marina she come to I with a question but a little while ago when marconino be with I -- and i wish to be alone marco he be so beautiful and the day have be a dream i wish for no one but for thee alone he hold she hand in a mute caress but with preoccupation while he eye wander back to the piazzetta searchingly it be strange he mutter to himself still watch from the end of the balcony it be a echo of the lady bea 's voice that startle I cross the piazzetta say two word only -- ` in padua ' then rouse himself he turn brightly to he wife carina i have news for thee for the time have be momentous for we in venice di gioiosa have go forward these many day with term from venice and soon it be think there will be peace _ term _ from venice to rome -- but the word do not move she from she resolve to let no shadow of they difference mar the beauty of this night she look at he wearily it be ever the same she say through this long dreary year -- ever the same let we forget it all for this one night let we talk together of we marconino and as if there have be no question -- no interdict -- no pain -- while the night sound die into silence and the moon withdraw she glamor and leave they alone to the solemn mystery of the starlight they sit and talk together of love and they little one and they hope for he and of thing that lie too deep for utterance -- save by one to one -- far into that beautiful venetian night with the odor of flower and incense blow up to they on the breath of the sea xxix the yellow lamp flame be burn late in the cabinet of girolamo magagnatus who take less note of the difference between evening hour and those of early dawn since there be no longer in he household a beloved one to guard from weariness nay the night be rather the time in which he might forget himself and plunge more whole-heartedly into he scheme of work -- financial or creative for the world be surely on the eve of discovery important to he art and it would be well if he might secure they before he work day should pass for the stabilimento magagnatus piero salin stand in the doorway as he glance up from the drawing that litter he table -- the dark oak table which have seem a center of cheer to girolamo when in this very chamber he child have make a radiance for he in which the line of he life shone large and satisfying girolamo never seem to remember that this son-in-law be a great man among the people to he he be only piero salin barcariol the single token of the old man 's favor be that in he thought he no longer add the despicable word _ toso _ and it be a proof that he be mellow with the year for girolamo never forget this unwelcome and dishonorable past and piero be always ill at ease in he presence messer magagnatus he begin awkwardly twirl he black cap in he hand rather after the fashion of a gondolier than of the chief of the nicolottus i must crave by dawn of the morrow the blessing of san nicolò -- of holy memory enter say girolamo with a reluctance not wholly conceal by he attempt at courtesy for he feel the moment to be the more precious that the dawn be near but the invocation of the sailor 's patron saint portend a journey verily piero thy coming and going have be of late so frequent that one learn the wisdom of not mourn over-much when thou dost crave a ave at the shrine of san nicolò may he grant thee favor breeze thou art in favor with the ten they tell I piero shrug he shoulder favor or disfavor he say it be but the turning of the head -- and both may lead to that place of unsought distinction between san marco and san teodoro if the order of they excellency bring not the end they seek but it matter little -- a candle flame be better blow out than die spend and whither art thou bent on the morrow nay messer girolamo that be not mine own secret but this word would i leave with thee if perchance i return not before many day seek I on the border-land -- at the point nearest roman dominion he have come close to the old merchant and utter the last word in a tone very low and full of mean girolamo start on the border-land of rome he echo this mission of thine be then weighty and thou fearest -- nay i fear naught say piero haughtily but the time be perilous and later if thou would ` st seek I thou hast the clew but of the mission to which i be swear in secrecy let it not be know that i have so much as name it -- it would argue ill for I and thee and the clew be for thy use only meanwhile forget that i have speak the ave marium will soon waken the fisher of murano _ addio _ but he still wait as if he have not utter all he mind girolamo study he face closely there be more he say speak by the holy madonna of san donato say piero casting off he restraint with a sudden impulse if i come not back i would have thee know that if ever there come a chance to I to serve marina -- the lady marina of the giustinianus -- i piero barcariol or gastaldo would serve she as a soldier may serve a saint for she have be good to the zuanino ay though it cost I my life i would serve she like a saint in heaven he repeat then flush with the shame of such unwonted speech and confession he hasten to the door and he step be already resounding on the stone floor of the passage when girolamo recover from he astonishment sufficiently to follow he into the shadow and command he to stop thou hast see my daughter -- thou hast news of she ay yestere'en at the ave marium i speak with she in santa marium dell ' orto come upon she kneeling before the great picture of jacopo robustus -- she saint enough already to wear a glorium and look as if the heart of she be worn away from grief she have need of thee daily for she love for thee be great and death not far tell it plainly command girolamo hasten after the retreat figure and violently grasp he arm to detain he have i fail to she in aught she be soul of my soul maledetto why dost thou break my heart look to thine other son-in-law piero retort wrathfully he of the crimson robe who sit in the council of venice and findeth no cure for thy daughter -- die of terror beside he it be a base slander cry old girolamo tremble with anger and fear never be wife more beloved and petted marcantonio have no thought save for marina and venice ay ` for marina and venice ' be the scornful answer _ but venice first _ splendor and gift and the pleasing of every whim if he could but guess it -- gold for she asking and she palace no better than a cross for she dwelling for the one thing she needeth for she peace and life he giveth not what meanest thou cry girolamo furiously have he not spend a fortune on physician -- spare nothing save to torment she no more since they skill be but weariness to she she be eat she heart out for this quarrel with rome -- which no man may help and it be but foolishness for woman to meddle with and she have ever be too much under priestly sway why earnest thou hither this night for this cause and for no other say piero solemnly that thou mightest find I if need should be for any service to she and to swear to thee by the madonna and every saint of venice that i would give my life for she but old girolamo grow the angrier for piero 's profession of loyalty shall she father do less than thou he question wrathfully on the morrow will i go to she and leave she no more until she forget by all the saint in heaven and every madonna in venice and we lady of every traghetto piero exclaim as he wrench himself away from girolamo 's angry grasp while the old man stagger against the wall still hold a bit of cloth from the gondolier 's cloak in he closed hand i be vow to my mission before this dawn what i have speak be for duty to thine house and not in anger -- though i could color my stiletto in good patrician blood and die for it gaily if that would help she but girolamo could not yet find he voice and piero with he hand on the latch of the great iron gate of the water-story turn and call back : woman be not like man and marina be like no other woman that ever be bear in venice whether it be the priest that have bewitch she -- may the holy madonna have mercy and curse they for it -- or whether she be truly the bless virgin of san donato come to earth again one know not but messer magagnatus -- and the voice come solemnly from the dark figure dimly outline against the gray darkness beyond the iron bar -- thy daughter be die for this curse of the most holy father -- ` il mal anno che dio le dia ' -lrb- may heaven make he suffer for it -rrb- -- and she have no peace in venice _ she will never forget nor change _ if thy love be great as thou hast say thou wilt find some way to help she _ for in venice she have no peace _ the old merchant daze by piero 's hot word be a pitiful figure standing desolate behind the closed bar of he gate the night wind lift he long beard and parting the thin gray lock that flow from under he cap while he call and beckon impotently to piero to return repeat meanwhile mechanically with no perception of they meaning those strange word of piero 's -- _ in venice she have no peace _ he stand peer out into the gray gloom and listen to the lessen plash of the oar until the gondola of the gastaldo be already far on the way to san marco where sit the ten but it be not of piero 's mission he be think but of he child -- say over and over again those fateful word in venice she have no peace have piero say that suddenly the entire speech recur to he -- insistent tense with mean she could not live in venice marina have no peace in venice she would never forget nor change she have need of he -- of she father 's love and if he love enough _ he would find a way _ chill and heart-sick he turn and with no torch and miss the voice which have guide he through the long dark passage he grope he way to he cabinet and sit down to confront a graver problem than any he have ever conquer with marina 's aid he _ would _ find a way -- but it must not be in venice how could they leave venice be they not venetian bear and be not venice in trouble to leave she now be to deny she _ it could not be _ he put the argument many time feverishly at first then more calmly -- coming always to the same conclusion it could not be it be a comfort to reach so sensible and positive a decision to-morrow he would go to he daughter and meanwhile he must continue he work he need to reassert he power for he have be strangely shake he draw the scatter papers together but the line blur and confuse carry no mean the fragment of broken glass in the little tray beside he be a dull untranslucent gray and write all over papers and fragment in vivid letter that burn into he brain be those other terrible word of piero 's which he have try in vain to forget -- thy daughter be die for this curse _ marina -- die _ how should piero know more about marina than she own father know do he profess to be a physician that one should credit he every word what do he mean by he impudent boast of die for she if need should be have she not she husband and father to care for she she husband who be deny she the only thing that could give she life and peace piero have say -- what be the matter with he insulting word that he could not forget they -- have she not she father who be go to she on the morrow when he have mature he plan and would do whatever she wish -- in venice she father who love she as he own soul -- that be what he have say to piero with the memory of all those dear year when they have be all in all to each other in this home be it for hour or moment only that he sit in torture -- endure reasoning place love against pride marina against venice venice against a father 's weakness duty to the republic before the need of this only child who be soul of he soul the last of he race -- inherit the tradition and passionate attachment of that long line of loyal man who have found and build up the stabilimento which be the pride of murano of the people yet ennoble by the proffer of the senate and grandsire to the son of one of the highest noble of the republic -- what be there leave in life for he away from venice how should he bear to die dishonored and disinherit by the country which he have desert in she hour of struggle for never any more might one return who should desert venice for rome and those pane of brilliant crystal clarity which he have dream of add to the honor of the stabilimento magagnatus -- so strong that a single sheet might be frame in the great space of the window of the palace and show neither curve nor flaw -- so pure that they only trace of color should come from a chance reflection which would but lend add charm -- these might not be the discovery of he later day though the time be near in which this gift _ must _ come to venice he have not dream that he could ever say while strength yet remain to think and plan the house of magagnatus have touch its height and other may come forward to do the rest for venice and the secret lay so near -- scarcely elude he it be no mere empty jealousy nor trivial wish for fame nor greed of recompense -- of which he have enough -- that force the vein out on the strong forehead of this master-worker as he struggle with this question of surrender all for he daughter 's peace it be the art in which he ancestor have take the lead from the earliest industrial triumph of the republic -- a art in which venice stand first -- and in he simple belief it be not less to they glory than the work of a titian or a sansovino in this field he work whole-hearted with the passion of a artist who have achieve and he place and part in the republic as in life be bound for he by he art to stand with fold hand -- always hereafter to be unnecessary to venice how should one who have not be bear in venice ever guess the strange fascination of that magic city for she son or dream with what a passion the blood of generation of venetian ancestry surge in one 's vein compelling patriotism so that it be not possible to do aught with one 's gift and life that do not enhance the greatness of so fair a kingdom it be the wonderful secret of the empire of venice that here the pride of self be count only as a factor in the superior pride of she dominion marina have be proud of he cabinet and he take the little antique lamp she use to hold for he and unlock the door with a tremulous hand standing unsteadily before it and try to hearten himself as he ruthlessly flash the light so that each fantastic bit come out in perfect beauty glowing with the wonderful coloring of transparent gem but suddenly those fearful word of piero 's play riot among they obliterate every trace of beauty every claim of venice every question as to he own judgment or marina 's reasoning -- even the ignominy of the secret flight _ thy daughter die _ the letter blaze like star gleam among he papers -- glitter around the chair where marina use to sit climb up into the air closing nearer to he -- waver writhe line of live fire trace those awful word he could not forget -- my god he cry be not marina more than all there be no longer anything in life that he will to do but to win peace for she accord to she whim stino he shriek with a voice louder than the clang of the rude iron bell whose rope have break in he impetuous hand light I a fire in the brazier and burn I this rubbish he command of the foreman who enter aghast at the imperious summons and yet more amaze at the destruction of those precious page over which he master have spend day of brooding but he venture no protest and here say girolamo with a look of relief as the last paper shrivel and curl into smoke be the key of these cabinet -- thou knowest they contents and that they be precious and here shalt thou remain as master until my return -- keep all in order as thou knowest how and loyally serve the interest of the stabilimento all money which i may send for thou shalt instantly remit by trusty messenger how long doth the master remain away so long as it may please the lady marina who have need of change and if i return not girolamo resume after a moment 's pause which give solemnity to he word my will shall be find file with the avvogadorus del commun and thou stino shalt answer to the summons they will send thee -- if i come no more master cry the faithful stino greatly trouble for these preparation fill he with dread and be strange indeed for so old a man who have never yet leave venice for a night life be other than we know it away from venice and the heart of we go mourn for the sight and sound of the sea and the color of we sky nay stino i have say it he master answer unmoved by he implore eye when goest thou -- that all may be ready now ere the dawn girolamo cry with sudden resolution i would say my ave maria in the chapel of the lady marina rouse the gondolier and lift the curtain that i may see how soon the day cometh master dear master say stino tenderly as he draw the heavy drapery aside already the sun be high and the household have be these many hour awake so girolamo answer with deep gravity for the battle have be longer than he have dream yet with he habitual control i know not the time -- my thought hold I stino if i return not may the saint bless thee for all thou hast be to I since the lady marina have dwelt in the palazzo giustinianus and in my will thou art not forget as girolamo issue from he own portal closely follow by stino and the other superintendent of the great stabilimento who be fill with foreboding at this sudden and surprising decision of they good master several gondola wear the color of the giustinianus float into the waterway from the broad lagoon and with they like a flock of sea-bird in they habit of gray and they cowl of white come the sister of san donato return from that early chant mass at the palazzo giustinianus which have be a dream of the lady marina 's happier day the young senator have urge he boatman to feverish speed and he own gondola be far in advance of the train he bound from he bark the moment it near the step and rush blindly toward the dwelling encounter he father-in-law on the threshold she be here -- marina he question half craze with grief and forgetful of the usual courtesy would have push he aside to enter i have come with she maiden and she child to take she home let I go to she and as girolamo stand dumb and dazed i beseech thee -- conceal she not look into each other 's face for one anguished moment they know without need of further speech that she have go from they both girolamo give a great and bitter cry my son folding he arm about the younger man in measureless grief and compassion and when they could trust they footstep they go desolately into the house together \* \* \* \* \* nay girolamo have answer to every argument it be for thee to remain in venice with she child that the signorium be not wroth with the can ' giustinianus and for I to seek and care for she -- mayhap if heaven be merciful to bring she to thee again she can not be far to seek in padua cry marcantonio with sudden conviction they will sleep in padua to-night it _ be _ the voice of the lady bea xxx art thou sure marina ay piero though it be death to I and death be sweeter -- she hair lay like a wreath of snow across she forehead from stress of the night 's vigil she lip tremble like a grieved child 's but in she exquisite face there be the grace of a spirit strong and tender he help she silently into the gondola and steer it carefully between the palus which rise like a scatter sheaf glowing with the color of the giustinianus in the water before she palace and thus in the early dawn -- unattended with the sadness of death in she pallid face -- the lady of the giustinianus float away from she beautiful home -- away from happiness and love -- into a future cheerless and dim as the dawn light that be faintly tinge the sea for the day be break full of gloom under a sky of cloud and the wind blow chill from across the lido she sit with she gray mantle shroud she face and neither of they speak while the gondola under piero 's deft guidance quickly gain the step of the piazzetta and pass on to san giorgio then she touch he arm entreatingly oh let we wait one moment before we lose sight of the palazzo madre beatissima have they in thy keep she stretch out she hand unconsciously with a gesture of petition and she mantle slip back expose she pallid pain-stricken face and she whitened tress piero be startle at the havoc the night have make for he have see she only the day before in answer to she summons when she have be far more like herself santa marium he exclaim cross himself and awkward under the unaccustomed sense of a overwhelming compassion the holy mother must shrive I for break my vow for if san marco and san teodoro would give I a place between they before the matins ring again -- mistake I for a traitor -- i can not take thee from venice we will return and already the gondola be yield to he stroke let marcantonio bring thee himself to rome piero thou hast swear to I thou shalt abide by thy promise she cry seize the oar in she tremble hand ay marina i have swear to thee he answer with slow pause and by we holy mother of san giorgio i will serve thee like a saint in heaven yet i would thou wert in thy home again -- already thou hast break thy heart for love of it the gondola of the people be gather about the step of the palace bring they burden for the day 's ongoing in those luxurious home the bell be call to early mass the stir of life be begin in the city soon in she own palace she little one would wake and marco -- she stand with strain eye yearning for the chance of a face in she palace window -- the bare last chance of another sight of he dear face she do not know that piero be watch she -- compassionate and comprehend -- while she be struggle to outlive the agony for the very love 's sake which make it so keen it be the only sweetness leave in life for she that this cruel parting be yet for marco 's sake that she might still plead with the holy father for this desperate need of which marco seem unconscious -- since in a vision never to be forget the bless madre of san donato have confide this mission to she she could bear everything to win such a blessing for she beloved one only she must reach rome -- surely the madre beatissima would let she live to reach the holy city the tide be brim the canal rise over the water step the grow light gleam coldly on the polished marble of she palace burnish the rich gold fretwork of frieze and tracery -- but not any face of any dear one respond to she hungry longing watch for she in the deep space of the window in token of the love from which she be flee this also -- this last longing -- she must surrender she white face grow brave again she sit down and draw she veil -- the ample _ fazzuolo _ of the muranese -- more closely about she i be ready she say and turn she face resolutely forward as they round san giorgio turn into the broad giudecca a shoal of little boat come over the water from murano they be the nun of san donato she say in amazement and draw she veil closer piero canst thou not ask they whither it be so strange on this morning of all other to see they turn in the direction of can ' giustiniani there come a vision of she chapel which she maiden be deck -- of the dear altar at which she should kneel no more -- and she hold she breath to hear the answer will the most reverend mother bless the boat of a gondolier of the people and he sister who have be ill and craveth the morning air piero who have discard every emblem of he office and wear only the simple dress of the nicolottus put the question easily without fear of recognition and there be no great trouble in the city which calleth these illustrious lady so early from murano nay but the senator giustinianus have pray we for a grace to he sweet lady for the chapel have be close while she have be too ill for service and to-day it will be open dress with flower and we -- because she loveth greatly we madonna of san donato and have show bounty with munificent gift to all the parish -- will chant the matins in she oratory they give the benediction and pass while marcantonio with he tender thought for marina fresh in he heart be wake to find only she note of farewell only because i love thee marco mio i have the strength to leave thee and it be the madonna who have call I forgive and forget not thy sad marina marina -- piero begin awkwardly for argument be not he forte and marina have always conquer he ` chus troppo abbraccium nullum stringe ' one gain nothing who grasp too much thou wast ever one for duty and if the senator marcantonio will not take thee to rome -- no piero he can not he be one of the ruler of venice thou then -- he wife -- how could he venture to counsel she of whose will and wisdom he have always stand in awe it seem to piero that he have already deliver a oration yet he feel that there be more to say but he thought grow confuse in seek for expression and it be a relief to he to communicate he uncertainty to the motion of he gondola the unsteady movement say more to she than word for piero be a unfailing stroke it be the man only of whom the republic have need she explain unflinchingly but for the woman there be no conflict of duty -- the holy church be first ` prayer for the woman and deed for the man ' -- thou hast see it written and thy father piero question unconvinced recall the interview of a few hour before a quick tender light flash and pass in she eye a ray of color tremble on she cheek i shall grieve he she say but he will forgive for ever have he bid I choose the right she voice break and she be silent while she seek for some token in the fold of she robe thou wilt take he this when thou returnest that he may know i hold he dear marina he plead grow eloquent with a last desperate effort thou wast ever a angel to the zuanino -- thou canst not leave thine own bimbo she do not answer immediately but she clasp and unclasp she hand passionately he be safe she say at last very low and struggle for control he have the blessing of the holy father give when it might avail and the little one be ever in the care of the bless mother it be not for my baby that i need must go -- but for marco and my father and for venice santissima marium because thou sendest I shalt thou not grant the strength there be a silence between they while they float on for piero have many thing to think of he be accustom to accomplish whatever he undertake for he be not a man to fail from lack of resource nor to be overcome by fear and scruple by means of he pass and he favor with the government he could reach the border of the venetian dominion without suspicion from whence he would escort marina to the nearest convent and place she in safety with the mother superior to whom he would confide the story of she distinguished guest and secure for she the treatment due to a venetian princess which under the circumstance would be a easy matter as no member of a noble venetian house espouse the side of rome would be meet with any but the most flattering reception to provide marina with companionship piero have confide she intended flight to the lady bea tagliapietra be sure of she devotion and she would be wait for they at padua with two trust gondolier and whatever might be needful from the wardrobe of the lady of the giustinianus the fact that he have break he promise of secrecy do not trouble he since it be in marina 's service which make the action honorable and be it not so the little perjury be well atone for by a keg of oil anonymously send to the traghetto of san nicolò è san raffaele pel luminar al madonna -lrb- 8 -rrb- and piero have much faith in anonymous gift for confession be not always convenient for a officer of he dignity but it be perhaps too much to expect that these poor little traghetto lamp should be more than dimly luminous since the oil be so largely provide by fine for delinquency -lrb- 8 -rrb- to light the madonna with a easy conscience also he have help himself to the requisite fund for they journey amply estimate from the treasury of the nicolottus which be in he keep and he reasoning savor of venetian subtlety with a hint of he toso training have not the lady of the giustinianus offer to guarantee the fund necessary for the assessment of the state when piero doubtful of they resource would have decline the position of gastaldo grande cumber as it be with the uncomfortable requirement that the chief should be personally responsible for all due and tax levy upon the traghettus piero be not the first gastaldo who have wish to escape a honor that weigh so heavily and a very serious penalty be already decree for such contempt of office by that tribunal tireless in vigilance so without compunction piero have take the needful sure that when he return marina 's husband or she father would repay it _ could _ he return -- after help a patrician to escape from venice into the heart of the country with which the republic be at war it look doubtful even to piero with he indomitable temperament but he waste no sentiment upon this question for if he might not return there be other country in which a man could live or should he be pursue and light upon by the far-seeing eye of the ten he could die but once and get into trouble no more he cross himself decorously as he dismiss the matter but it be not a event that he could change by ponder there be another question that interest he more keenly at this moment when messer girolamo should know that he daughter be not in venice could he fail to comprehend the hint he have give a few hour before and would he not follow they to rome as piero devoutly hope for he wish to leave marina in she father 's care it be not easy to predict what messer girolamo might do -- the case have be too doubtful for a more explicit confession and piero have be wise in he generation he turn now to marina with the question : if thou hadst tell thy father of thy wish mayhap he might have come with thee she shake she head sadly and make no answer but after awhile she say he be like the other they can not understand the need for to they the madonna have not reveal the desperate state of venice yet thou knowest marina that already the great cardinal -- but lately come from france -- have start for rome to make up this quarrel that be what the senate will not understand she cry with flash eye the holy father will have submission and penance in place of embassy and pomp one must go to he quite simply from the people say ` we have sin have mercy upon venice ' piero thou knowest that awful vision of the tintoret it be venice that he have paint in she doom -- the great flood burst in upon she -- all the agony and the anguish and the desolation of god 's wrath santa marium i can not bear it she close she eye shudder and sick with terror it be the way with jacopo say pietro irreverently he be full of freak and some demon have tormented he he be a man like other -- not one for a revelation hush piero she implore it break my heart this also may be count against venice for it be the holy madonna who have grant I the vision if piero be silent he be only restrain by deference to marina from invoke the aid of every saint in the calendar in copious malediction on this miserable jacopo who have so increase the trouble in marina 's eye -- since woman have such foolish faith in picture jacopo robustus pose for a seer and foretell the end of the world like a prophet or a saint _ goffone _ -lrb- 9 -rrb- piero be paddle furiously jacopo of the fondamenta del mori -- not better than other -- with that boastful sentence blazon on he door -- ` the coloring of titian with the drawing of angelo ' -lrb- 9 -rrb- great fool but he forget even he resentment against jacopo in he anxiety as he watch marina ask himself if it would be possible for she to pray herself back into healthful life again even in the dominion of the holy father for he realize that nothing could help she but this one thing on which she heart be set -- while he be yet if possible more utterly without sympathy for the fear that move she than she father or marcantonio have be but if the one woman in venice have but one desire however desperate and incomprehensible -- _ basta _ it be enough say piero to himself -- she should not die with it unfulfilled if he could compass it yet at the thought of death he heart sink it be the madonna which thou beheldest in thy vision -- not the cross he ask she quickly make the fateful sign as he speak to avert this dread presage of death and afraid of she answer for marina be fail before he eye and doubtless in she vision there have be some apparition of a cross and even the less devout among the gondolier be still dominate by some of the superstition which give a picturesque color to the habit of the people but she too earnest in she faith to take any note of a less serious mood answer simply : it be the very madonna herself as thou knowest she in san donato who come to I in the palazzo one night when i sleep not and give I the mission to save venice -- scarce able to speak for she great sadness and the tear drop as thou knowest she in san donato -- commanding I to go before the holy father and pray for mercy to venice she it be who tell I that we prayer pass not up beyond the cloud which hang above a city under doom of interdict oh piero hasten for my strength be little and rome be far when the lady of the giustinianus have send for piero to meet she in santa marium dell ' orto to ask he to manage she escape to rome it have not be possible to refuse she all he attempt at reasoning be in vain i must go she say with that invincible persistence which he never could combat if thou wilt not help I i go alone she be kneel before the terrible judgment of the tintoret and the face she have lift to he in appeal be white with agonized comprehension the journey have be long and wearisome all day they have be slowly toiling against the tide and long since piero have summon to he aid a trust gondolier who have be order to follow they at a little distance and who at a sign from the gastaldo have silently leave he bark to drift and take he place at the other end of the gondola in which the fugitive be make they way to padua they have pass the domain of the laguna morta weird and half-forbidding with tangle of sea-plant and upspringing wild fowl call to each other with hoarse cry across the marsh -- with army of water beetle zigzag in the shallows and crab and lizard crawl upon the scatter sand heap among the coarse sea-grass while small fish bring unexpected dimple to the deeper pool that lay between and the mingled odor of water fresh and salt be break into a breath now pungent and pleasant now almost noisome as the light breeze stir the shallows of this strange domain which be neither land nor sea yet even here the pale sea-holly and the evening primrose make redeeming spot of beauty with they faint hue of violet and yellow and a distant water-meadow shimmer like the sea with the tender blue of the spreading lavender they have pass fusina and the lagoon lay silvery like a trail of moonlight behind they -- venice in the distance opalesque radiant a city of dream the cloud above they beautiful with change sunset light be no longer mirror on a still lagoon but mottle the broken surface of the river with hue of bronze and purple between the leaf of the creep water-plant which clog the movement of the oar for they have exchange the liquid azure pavement of they città nobilissima for the brown tide of the brenta on the river 's brink the rush be star with lily and iris and ranunculus and the fragrance of sheeted flower from the water-meadow come to they fresh and delicious mingle with the salt breath of the sea while swallow -- dusky violet-winged -- circle about they bow tease they progress with mystic eliptical flight -- like persistent problem perpetually recur yet to be solve by fate alone it be the hour of the ave marium and marina rouse herself from she sad reverie the cloud pile themselves in luminous mass and drift into the hollow of the wonderful euganean hill and a crimson sunset tinge peak and cloud with glory as padua with its low arcaded street and san antonio -- cousin to san marco in minaret and eastern splendor -- and the lion of saint mark upon he lofty column close the vista of they weary day the chime of venice be too far for sound but from every campanile of this quaint city the vesper bell solemn and sweet peal forth they call to prayer -- as if no threat of rome 's displeasure make a discord in they harmony xxxi piero have watch all night before the little inn of the buon pesce impatient to meet and conquer he fate while above in a upper room the lady marina and bea try to sleep but before the dawn they be off again down by the way of the brown rolling river take the weary length to brondolo and the sea there be two gondola now and the man in each pull as if the prize of a great regatta await they -- nicolottus against castellanus -- and silently save voice and strength for a great need it might have seem a pleasure party save for the stress of they speed as they sweep by the grove of poplar and catalpa which border the broad flood to the sound of the water only and the song of the bird in the wood water-lily float in the pool along the shore current of fragrance be blow out to they on wander wind and in the felze as they be near brondolo marina and the lady bea soothe by the glide motion and the monotonous plash of the oar into the need sleep which the night have fail to bring they be unaware of the colloquy between piero and he gondolier antonio piero call cautiously to the man who be rowing behind the felze i have somewhat to say to thee be there those within thy vision who may hear we speech padrone no but the time be short for speak much for we reach the lock with another turn of the brenta may the bless san nicolò send sunshine to dazzle the jewel in the eye of messer san marco till we be safe beyond it and out of chioggium piero exclaim fervently and thou antonio swear I again thy faith -- or swear it not as thou wilt but thou shalt choose this moment whom thou wilt serve and it shall go ill with thee if thou keep not thy troth by san marco and san teodoro antonio respond readily cross himself devoutly as he speak i swear to do thy bidding messer gastaldo and thou wilt die for the people against the noble if need should be if thou leadest gastaldo grande hast thou a pouch beneath thy stiletto where thou mayest defend with thy life what i shall give thee antonio display it silently this for the need of the cause in thy hand say piero pass he a purse of gold but gold be worthless to this token which shall win thee the hearing of the bancalus and the aid of every loyal son of san nicolò and shall be proof that thou bearest my order and my trust the trust be great -- the bancalus be the govern board of the traghettus antonio unfasten he doublet and secure the precious token under he belt command then caro padrone slacken thy pace for this may be we last speech together be those who follow true as thou messer gastaldo antonio answer with reluctance by sign which be but trifle to relate -- by a word drop in padua and not for mine ear -- one of they -- i know not which -- have perchance affair with a master mightier than thou he make the usual gesture which indicate the three of that terrible inquisition whose name be better leave unsaid -- a sign much use in venice where the very wall have ear it be a blow to piero but he waste no word they then -- both -- be apart from this and all my counsel it shall be for thee alone antonio so safer messer gastaldo i listen -- and forget save as it shall serve thee first then antonio i have swear to escort the lady of the giustinianus in safety to rome from which naught shall keep I -- save if the ten have other plan the madonna doth forgive the broken vow it be a strange admission from a man stalwart and fearless like piero but he make it without shame as a soldier acquiesce in destiny santissima marium antonio ejaculate with unusual fervor and cross himself in full realization of the meaning at brondolo a brig be wait -- orange and yellow of sail device of a blaze sun a hunchback with doublet of orange above the mast for luck and a fine figure of a _ gobbo _ upon the deck -- a living hunchback -- by which thou shalt know it for mine and bind to my order whether it come by I or by my token if we reach and board she it shall be well -- and rome so will it heaven before we all but if the dreaded one be on the search and overtake we -- again the sign the tragedy of the situation be in he face as he look steadily at antonio who do not flinch thy duty then antonio shall lie elsewhere thou must escape unseen while they lay hand upon the lady and I whom first they will secure before they give thee a thought antonio instantly touch he stiletto and look he question with a fearless glance nay say the gastaldo scornfully and draw a line quickly about he own throat thou wilt serve I better with thy head in its place thou shalt return to venice -- by fusina or brondolo as thy wit shall serve thee -- leave the precious gondolierus to prove whether they silken sash be badge of man or traitor art thou listen command I padrone within two day if i be free the bancalus shall have news of I listen well antonio -- again the hand and eye go up with the dreaded unmistakable sign -- if thou seest they seize I before thou takest leave wait no longer than to plan with the bancalus to come and demand my release thou shalt tell the bancalus that i send thee thou shalt tell they there be affair of moment for the nicolottus which shall go hard for the traghettus if i be not there to work they -- art listen antonio he question feverishly antonio 's eye be fasten upon he padrone yes he answer breathlessly with my token thou canst command the loyalty of every nicolotto -- be it thine oar that make that rustle -- and perchance if there be a rising of the traghettus to demand aught of the signorium -- come nearer antonio -- the castellanus also if they will to join with they traghettus in ask for justice -- would not serve under my token the less heartily for the word confide low to they bancalus -- dost understand -- _ that if they tax and they fine oppress they _ these also i be free will pay this year to the maledetto avvogadoro del commun antonio gravely bow he head in assent this at thy discretion -- thou understandest antonio -- and so that no violence come from the massing of the people but only the proof of its will and of the number who make the demand only -- if it be not grant they shall make a stand at the traghettus and _ fight _ -- padrone yes for -- thou dost mark I antonio -- this lady of the giustinianus have be a saint among the people she have give they much in gift -- she have give almost she life in prayer and penance that heaven may avert its wrath from venice which she in truth believeth the holy father -- may the saint make he suffer for it -- have bring upon the people by he curse -- may heaven forbid and she be now noble have prefer the cause of the _ people _ to the cause of the _ noble _ and bringeth upon she the displeasure of the signorium by she flight to rome for -- see it well antonio -- if the senate hold the lady of the giustinianus for fault in this -- piero pause and utter the last word with a slow mysterious emphasis while antonio listen with a intensity that miss no shading of meaning -- _ it will be the cause of the people against the noble _ if they harm she not he resume in he usual tone after a moment 's pause my fate shall be avenge in the judgment and command of the bancalus of the nicolottus only they shall not risk the people 's good for the poor life of one leader padrone antonio cry with flash eye commandi altro -lrb- hast thou other command -rrb- none save that if i return not -- and not otherwise -- thou shalt seek with my token the master girolamo magagnatus thou shalt tell he of this my confidence hold nothing back and thou shalt pray he of he honor to discharge the debt which may be find lack in the treasury of the nicolottus -- since the money have be take for the need of the lady on she journey -- the which if i return i have means and more to repay the two man grasp hand and look into each other 's eye for a brief recording moment have each touch that _ best _ in the other which be not show to all man and so begotten trust each in each by the holy madonna and san nicolò i will not fail antonio promise and in a moment have seize he oar again and be spring forward on the bridge of he gondola as if he thought be light and rhythmic as he motion they speed on with a few swift silent stroke -- then brondolo he cry brightly but a sudden desperate steadying of resolution be feel in the fierce stroke which send the gondola forward with a jerk the fishing-skiff of chioggium flutter like gaudy butterfly before they dip they wing of orange and crimson and every conceivable sunset tint to catch the breeze and the air be suddenly vibrant with sound of traffic and busy life man call to each other with song and jest from heavily laden bark while they wait the hour of sailing or lay at ease on the top of they wares smoking luxurious draught of content from they comrade pipe -- lord of they craft though they couch be but a pile of cabbage or market produce -- exchange some whimsical comment upon the affair of busier neighbor which brim these frequent hour of _ dolce far niente _ with unflagging interest and there among the lighter shipping be the brig bind to the order of the gastaldo grande with the yellow sail and device of the rise sun -- with the gobbo in orange doublet on the masthead for good luck and the gobbo on the deck to make it sure piero turn and look for it as they pass the lock and there too -- _ corpo di san marco _ ejaculate antonio under he breath for he stand higher than piero upon the bridge of the gondola and face forward there full in sight and ride proudly at anchor the beautiful curve of she swan-like prow make cannon proof with plate of shine steel -- and below in lieu of figurehead to promise victory those letter of dread omen cdx -- with thirty oars-man from the arsenal of venice to ensure she speed each ready at he oar-lock to wield he oar with a band of marksman train to finest temper arm to quell the resistance which no venetian would dare offer with those letter on the prow the gold and scarlet banner of san marco for good fortune at she masthead the wind swell she impatient sail as the curb but fret the steed -- _ the galley of the ten be not wait without a purpose _ the shock of the boat as they pass through the lock have rouse the sleeper rudely and piero have time but for a swift glance of command to antonio bidding he escape when a gondola bear the ducal color float out from the sea of small wait craft and salute they courteously the dignified signor who address they wear the violet robe and steal of a secretary of the doge and he face be the face of that secretary in whose silken hand the gastaldo 's have lie prison when he take the oath of office resistance be impossible messer gastaldo say the secretary suavely it have pleased those who have ever the welfare of venice at heart to provide for the most noble lady of the giustinianus a escort which better fitteth she rank than the size of thy _ barchetta _ permitteth and a dwelling more honorable than the ` osteria del buon pesce ' where in company of the lady beata tagliapietra she have pass the night the secretary pause and placidly note the effect of he word upon piero who could have gnash he tooth for anger at those talk wall of venice which have betray he -- so cautiously have he tell he secret to the lady bea only in that short moonlight stroll at a sign from the secretary a second gondola wear the ducal livery and fill with the gorgeous costume of the palace guard come out from the float mass and approach the gondola of the people where the lady marina sit tremble like a frightened fawn there be a struggle among the lesser craft to draw closer to this dramatic center they jostle each other unceremoniously a splash like a fall oar be hear but scarce note in the absorb interest of the moment only a bare-legged boy jump off from a tiny fishing-skiff near which the oar have float and swam with it to to the gondola from which it have fall -- since it be this boat which be make the carnival for they piero alone have slightly turn he head and note that no one now stand on the _ ponte piede _ behind the felze of he gondola the galley wait to receive the noble lady to whom i be commission _ by those who have send I _ to offer my respectful homage say the secretary bow low before the felze the noble lady will proceed thither in the ducal gondola which attend they and thou messer gastaldo wilt graciously aid I in they escort -- since verily they owe much to thy chivalry it be a pleasant scene for the onlooker but the lady marina sit motionless and give neither word nor sign in response to the invitation of the ducal secretary shall the pleasure of the lady of this noble house not be consult piero question struggle to cover he defiance under a tone of deference but he answer be only in the secretary 's eye -- smile imperious -- more defiant than he own impotent will and in the courtly wait attitude which have not change and which seem unbearably to lengthen out the pass seconds the lady bea wind compassionate arm around she friend have raise she veil whisper word of tenderness but there be no recognition in the glance that meet hers -- only the immeasurable pathos of a hopeless surrender the fervent passion of marina 's will and faith have make all thing seem possible of achievement though venice be against she for have not the mission be give she in a vision by the holy madonna of san donato -- mother of sorrow -- and be not the issue sure and yield all thought of self she have brace every faculty to accomplish the holy task of which she alone feel the urgency but the overtax heart and brain could endure no longer thwart they activity and unquestioning purpose have be she only power and the moment she cease to struggle will and reason flee together pitifully acquiescent she go with they unresist \* \* \* \* \* a haze that be not luminous hang in the sky night be creep on without a sunset as they battle they way up the giudecca against the current which rush like a boiling torrent around san giorgio -- the blue calm of the water turn to a frenzied foam-lashed green the man row fast with tight-furled sail but the storm come faster rank of threaten cloud be hurry from the east gathering like army of vengeful spirit darker closer about they shut off every breath of air a oppression throb with nameless fear be upon they -- a hush as if life have cease then the scorching wither torment of a fierce sirocco and the moan of the wind like a soul in pain marina grow faint and wide-eyed for terror but they could not soothe she by word or touch she sit with clasped hand gasp for breath listen to the low long boom on the shore of the lido like muffle thunder ceaselessly recur -- the terrible noise of the great wave beat against the sea-wall -- beat and break in fury toss they spray high in air and whirling it in cloud like rain mist far across the lagoon would the barrier stand -- or yield and leave they to they doom be the great water of the adriatic uprising in vengeance to overwhelm this city in she sin boom upon boom sound through all the voice of the storm santa marium be it this that the tintoretto have foretell a dazzling frenzied flash of light -- a vast peal of thunder that be like the wrath of a mighty offended god -- then darkness and a torrent of rain -- the water in the shift path of the wind leap up to meet the water from the sky the vesper bell of venice come sob through the storm toss and break by the tornado into a wraith of a dirge and now by some fantastic freak of nature as the wind rise higher the iron tongue from every campanile -- for a brief moment of horror -- come wrangle and discordant as if tortured by some demon of despair _ ave marium gratium plenum _ the woman cry together fall on they knee while the man toil and struggle to hold the invincible galley of the ten outside the whirling path of the storm -- advance and retreat at the will of the element against which they own splendid human strength be like the feeble untaught effort of a helpless infant _ mater dei ora pro nobis peccatoribus nunc et in hora mortis nostrae _ the word rise in a wail between the gust for measureless moment mighty as hour they battle between san marco and san giorgio toss to and fro -- now nearer the haven of the great white dome now -- as a lightning flash unveil san marco -- near enough to see a cloud of frightened dove go whirling over the flood which sweep the piazza from end to end and pour out under the great gate of the ducal palace into the lagoon _ summa paren clementium -- nocte surgente _ -- xxxii a day momentous for venice -- or be it rome -- have come and pass it chronicle the right of the crown to make its own law within its own realm without reference to ecclesiastical claim which have hitherto be find hamper it define the limit of church and state as no protest have hitherto do but venice be calm in she triumph as she have be unmoved in disaster and would not reflect the jubilant tone of the cardinal when he have return from rome empower to withdraw the censure upon the term stipulate by the republic yet at this latest moment the cardinal mediator from lack of discretion have come near to failure for the term be less favorable than he have desire to obtain for the holy father he could not resist attempt to win some little further grace before pronounce the final word when the signorium weary of temporize tell he plainly that he holiness must come at once to a decision or venice would forget that she have so far yield as to listen to any negotiation there be no pageant at the close of this long drama of which the prince of europe have be interested spectator venice sit smile and unruffle under she April sky when the ducal secretary escort the two famous prisoner from the dungeon of the palace to the residence of the french ambassador and there _ without prejudice to the republic 's right of jurisdiction over criminal ecclesiastic _ explicitly stipulate bestow this gift -- so fitting for the gratification of a most christian majesty -- upon the representative of france who must indeed have breathe more freely when this testimonial of favor with its precious burden of nameless crime have be consign by he to one who wait as a appointee of the pope the doge and the signorium sit in they accustomed place in they stately assembly chamber when the cardinal come with congratulation upon the withdrawal of the interdict and the word of the serenissimo as he give the promise parchment be few and dignified i thank the lord we god that he holiness have assure himself of the purity of we intention and the sincerity of we deed and the writing of that parchment seal with the seal of saint mark stand thus : essendo state levate le censure è restate parimente rivocato il protesto -lrb- the censure have be take off the protest remain equally revoke -rrb- it be whisper low that the cardinal under he cape make the sign of the cross and murmur a word of absolution but if the signorium suspect he intention there be no movement of acquiescence only when the short ceremony of the passing of the document be complete they observe the usual form of courtesy with which the audience of so princely a envoy be close when he mission be accomplish if paul v have surrender with reluctance he hope of a sumptuous ceremony in san pietro where delegate of penitent venetian should kneel in public and confess and be graciously absolved -- if the cardinal di gioiosa have indulge flattering vision of a procession of priest and people to the patriarchal church in the piazza with paean of joy-bell and shout of gladness that venice be again free to resume she worship and that she penitent people be pardon son of the church -- he be doom to disappointment the cardinal of spain and france attend only by they household celebrate mass in the ducal chapel of san marco and the people come and go -- as they do before and after through that day and all the day since the interdict have be pronounce in this and all the church of venice -- and scarcely know that they doom be lift as they have hardly realize that the curse have ever penetrate from those distant door of san pietro to the sanctuary of san marco but the world know and never forget how that stately court of venice have meet the thunder of the vatican and lessen its power forever the cause have be win in moderation and dignity upon a basis of civil justice that be none the less accredit because the teologo consultore who sit in chancelor 's robe behind the throne be a zealous advocate of the primitive principle of christianity and defend without fear of obloquy or death the right of the individual conscience to interpret for itself the law of right -- as found upon the word of christ -- because the extraordinary keenness fineness and breadth of he masterly mind enable he to conceive with unusual definiteness the limit of civil and spiritual authority and to ascribe the overgrowth of error upon the church he love to the misconception and weakness of human nature he do not place venice the superb -- with she pride and pomp and power and intellectual astuteness with she fault and worldliness and she magnificent statesmanship -- against the _ spiritual _ kingdom of christ 's church on earth and declare for venice _ against _ the church but he weigh in the clear poise of he brain the book of the divine law -- which none know better than he -- with the law of the prince of this world -- which also few know better -- and declare that _ one _ lowly and great have define the limit of the church 's jurisdiction when he say my kingdom be not of this world but in rome the reasoning be not so simple and threat of vengeance pursue this terrible friar whose bold judgment have rule the council of rebellious venice but though peace be declare with rome the labor of the senate be scarcely lessen there be still adjustment to be make which be not whisper abroad -- there be embassy to be dissolve and appoint gift to be vote honor to be heap upon the head of the man whose counsel have lead to such result and in whose person the senate now unite the three office of the counsellor to the doge make fra paolo sole teologo consultore it be the first time in the history of the republic that such honor have be vote for venice be not wont to be over-generous in recognition of individual service and this friend of statesman scholar and prince temporal and spiritual preserve the greatness of he simplicity unspoiled in prosperity and power -- as be possible only to a spirit rule by inflexible principle and faith when the senate vote he a palace near san marco he prefer he simple quarter among he brethren of the servus when in proof of they appreciation they double he salary and would have treble it again -- nay say he it be but my duty that i have do may the honorable word of the senate 's recognition but hold before I that which by god 's help i may yet accomplish and he would take but so much as he might bestow in charity and gift to he convent have for himself no need nor taste that be not meet by the modest provision of he order and when have refuse to go to rome for reconciliation -- be not penitent -- or for preferment which would not come without penitence fra paolo still pursued unmoved the quiet tenor of he daily round from convent to palace without pause or tremor in spite of continued warning -- my life he say be in the hand of god my duty have he confide to mine own effort \* \* \* \* \* the lady marina be a guest in the ducal palace detain under surveillance yet treat with much honor she friend might see she in the presence of the ducal guard who watch within the door of she sumptuous chamber but she be not free to go to she own who have guard she with such laxity that in strive to reach the court of the enemy she have imperil the dignity of the republic by she silent censure marcantonio have tremble more when the morning after the storm news have reach he that the fugitive be in the keep of the signorium than if the message have announce she death what might he not expect of they jealousy but a ducal secretary have receive he with courtesy and conduct he at once into the audience chamber of the doge who bid he send for she maiden that she might be care for tenderly for she stay at the palace would be indefinite it be a royal command against which plead or rebellion be alike useless most serene

grant she prayer but one in attendance speak quickly for the face of the good leonardo donato be full of compassion and he might not be trust to serve the higher interest of the republic it be of the clemency of the serenissimo say that inflexible voice that the lady marina reap not the penalty of she flight and of she disloyalty to the state since she have seek to place she private judgment beyond the wisdom of the ruler of venice the figure stand motionless in the shadow of a column muffle in a long black mantle a black beretta partially conceal the face there be a icy inflection in the
