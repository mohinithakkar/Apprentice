produce by tom harri the sword of welleran and other story by lord dunsany author of time and the god etc dedicate with deep gratitude to those few know to I or unknown who have care for either of my former book the god of pegana time and the god the sword of welleran where the great plain of tarphet run up as the sea in estuary among the cyresian mountain there stand long since the city of merimna well-nigh among the shadow of the crag i have never see a city in the world so beautiful as merimna seem to I when first i dream of it it be a marvel of spire and figure of bronze and marble fountain and trophy of fabulous war and broad street give over wholly to the beautiful right through the center of the city there go a avenue fifty stride in width and along each side of it stand likeness in bronze of the king of all the country that the people of merimna have ever know at the end of that avenue be a colossal chariot with three bronze horse drive by the winged figure of fame and behind she in the chariot the huge form of welleran merimna 's ancient hero standing with extended sword so urgent be the mien and attitude of fame and so swift the pose of the horse that you have swear that the chariot be instantly upon you and that its dust already veil the face of the king and in the city be a mighty hall wherein be store the trophy of merimna 's hero sculpture it be and dome the glory of the art of mason a long while dead and on the summit of the dome the image of rollory sit gaze across the cyresian mountain towards the wide land beyond the land that know he sword and beside rollory like a old nurse the figure of victory sit hammer into a golden wreath of laurel for he head the crown of fall king such be merimna a city of sculptured victory and warrior of bronze yet in the time of which i write the art of war have be forget in merimna and the people almost sleep to and fro and up and down they would walk through the marble street gaze at memorial of the thing achieve by they country 's sword in the hand of those that long ago have love merimna well almost they sleep and dream of welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine of the land beyond the mountain that lay all round about they they know nothing save that they be the theater of the terrible deed of welleran that he have do with he sword long since these land have fall back into the possession of the nation that have be scourge by merimna 's army nothing now remain to merimna 's man save they inviolate city and the glory of the remembrance of they ancient fame at night they would place sentinel far out in the desert but these always sleep at they post dream of rollory and three time every night a guard would march around the city clothe in purple bearing light and singing song of welleran always the guard go unarmed but as the sound of they song go echo across the plain towards the loom mountain the desert robber would hear the name of welleran and steal away to they haunt often dawn would come across the plain shimmering marvellously upon merimna 's spire abash all the star and find the guard still sing song of welleran and would change the color of they purple robe and pale the light they bear but the guard would go back leave the rampart safe and one by one the sentinel in the plain would awake from dream of rollory and shuffle back into the city quite cold then something of the menace would pass away from the face of the cyresian mountain that from the north and the west and the south lower upon merimna and clear in the morning the statue and the pillar would arise in the old inviolate city you would wonder that a unarmed guard and sentinel that sleep could defend a city that be store with all the glory of art that be rich in gold and bronze a haughty city that have erst oppress its neighbor whose people have forget the art of war now this be the reason that though all she other land have long be take from she merimna 's city be safe a strange thing be believe or fear by the fierce tribe beyond the mountain and it be credit among they that at certain station round merimna 's rampart there still ride welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine yet it be close on a hundred year since iraine the youngest of merimna 's hero fight he last battle with the tribe sometimes indeed there arise among the tribe young man who doubt and say : ` how may a man for ever escape death ' but graver man answer they : ` hear we ye whose wisdom have discern so much and discern for we how a man may escape death when two score horseman assail he with they sword all of they swear to kill he and all of they swear upon they country 's god as often welleran have or discern for we how two man alone may enter a walled city by night and bring away from it that city 's king as do soorenard and mommolek surely man that have escape so many sword and so many sleety arrow shall escape the year and time ' and the young man be humble and become silent still the suspicion grow and often when the sun set on the cyresian mountain man in merimna discern the form of savage tribesman black against the light peer towards the city all know in merimna that the figure round the rampart be only statue of stone yet even there a hope linger among a few that some day they old hero would come again for certainly none have ever see they die now it have be the wont of these six warrior of old as each receive he last wound and know it to be mortal to ride away to a certain deep ravine and cast he body in as somewhere i have read great elephant do hide they bone away from lesser beast it be a ravine steep and narrow even at the end a great cleft into which no man could come by any path there ride welleran alone pant hard and there later ride soorenard and mommolek mommolek with a mortal wound upon he not to return but soorenard be unwounded and ride back alone from leave he dear friend rest among the mighty bone of welleran and there ride soorenard when he day be come with rollory and akanax and rollory ride in the middle and soorenard and akanax on either side and the long ride be a hard and weary thing for soorenard and akanax for they both have mortal wound but the long ride be easy for rollory for he be dead so the bone of these five hero whiten in a enemy 's land and very still they be though they have trouble city and none know where they lay save only iraine the young captain who be but twenty-five when mommolek rollory and akanax ride away and among they be strew they saddle and they bridle and all the accoutrements of they horse lest any man should ever find they afterwards and say in some foreign city : ` lo the bridle or the saddle of merimna 's captain take in war ' but they beloved trusty horse they turn free forty year afterwards in the hour of a great victory he last wound come upon iraine and the wound be terrible and would not close and iraine be the last of the captain and ride away alone it be a long way to the dark ravine and iraine fear that he would never come to the resting-place of the old hero and he urge he horse on swiftly and cling to the saddle with he hand and often as he ride he fall asleep and dream of earlier day and of the time when he first ride forth to the great war of welleran and of the time when welleran first spake to he and of the face of welleran 's comrade when they lead charge in the battle and ever as he awake a great longing arise in he soul as it hover on he body 's brink a longing to lie among the bone of the old hero at last when he see the dark ravine make a scar across the plain the soul of iraine slip out through he great wound and spread its wing and pain depart from the poor hacked body and still urge he horse forward iraine die but the old true horse canter on till suddenly he see before he the dark ravine and put he forefoot out on the very edge of it and stop then the body of iraine come topple forward over the right shoulder of the horse and he bone mingle and rest as the year go by with the bone of merimna 's hero now there be a little boy in merimna name rold i see he first i the dreamer that sit before my fire asleep i see he first as he mother lead he through the great hall where stand the trophy of merimna 's hero he be five year old and they stand before the great glass casket wherein lay the sword of welleran and he mother say : ` the sword of welleran ' and rold say : ` what should a man do with the sword of welleran ' and he mother answer : ` man look at the sword and remember welleran ' and they go on and stand before the great red cloak of welleran and the child say : ` why do welleran wear this great red cloak ' and he mother answer : ` it be the way of welleran ' when rold be a little older he steal out of he mother 's house quite in the middle of the night when all the world be still and merimna asleep dream of welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine and he go down to the rampart to hear the purple guard go by singing of welleran and the purple guard come by with light all singing in the stillness and dark shape out in the desert turn and flee and rold go back again to he mother 's house with a great yearning towards the name of welleran such as man feel for very holy thing and in time rold grow to know the pathway all round the rampart and the six equestrian statue that be there guard merimna still these statue be not like other statue they be so cunningly work of many-coloured marble that none might be quite sure until very close that they be not live man there be a horse of dappled marble the horse of akanax the horse of rollory be of alabaster pure white he armor be work out of a stone that shine and he horseman 's cloak be make of a blue stone very precious he look northwards but the marble horse of welleran be pure black and there sit welleran upon he look solemnly westwards he horse it be whose cold neck rold most love to stroke and it be welleran whom the watcher at sunset on the mountain the most clearly see as they peer towards the city and rold love the red nostril of the great black horse and he rider 's jasper cloak now beyond the cyresian the suspicion grow that merimna 's hero be dead and a plan be devise that a man should go by night and come close to the figure upon the rampart and see whether they be welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine and all be agree upon the plan and many name be mention of those who should go and the plan mature for many year it be during these year that watcher cluster often at sunset upon the mountain but come no nearer finally a better plan be make and it be decide that two man who have be by chance condemn to death should be give a pardon if they go down into the plain by night and discover whether or not merimna 's hero live at first the two prisoner dare not go but after a while one of they seejar say to he companion sajar-ho : ` see now when the king 's axeman smite a man upon the neck that man die ' and the other say that this be so then say seejar : ` and even though welleran smite a man with he sword no more befalleth he than death ' then sajar-ho thought for a while presently he say : ` yet the eye of the king 's axeman might err at the moment of he stroke or he arm fail he and the eye of welleran have never err nor he arm fail it be better to bide here ' then say seejar : ` maybe that welleran be dead and that some other hold he place upon the rampart or even a statue of stone ' but sajar-ho make answer : ` how can welleran be dead when he even escape from two score horseman with sword that be swear to slay he and all swear upon we country 's god ' and seejar say : ` this story he father tell my grandfather concern welleran on the day that the fight be lose on the plain of kurlistan he see a die horse near to the river and the horse look piteously towards the water but could not reach it and the father of my grandfather see welleran go down to the river 's brink and bring water from it with he own hand and give it to the horse now we be in as sore a plight as be that horse and as near to death it may be that welleran will pity we while the king 's axeman can not because of the command of the king ' then say sajar-ho : ` thou wast ever a cunning arguer thou broughtest we into this trouble with thy cunning and thy device we will see if thou canst bring we out of it we will go ' so news be bring to the king that the two prisoner would go down to merimna that evening the watcher lead they to the mountain 's edge and seejar and sajar-ho go down towards the plain by the way of a deep ravine and the watcher watch they go presently they figure be wholly hide in the dusk then night come up huge and holy out of waste marsh to the eastward and low land and the sea and the angel that watch over all man through the day close they great eye and sleep and the angel that watch over all man through the night awake and ruffle they deep blue feather and stand up and watch but the plain become a thing of mystery fill with fear so the two spy go down the deep ravine and come to the plain speed stealthily across it soon they come to the line of sentinel asleep upon the sand and one stir in he sleep call on rollory and a great dread seize upon the spy and they whisper ` rollory life ' but they remember the king 's axeman and go on and next they come to the great bronze statue of fear carve by some sculptor of the old glorious year in the attitude of flight towards the mountain call to she child as she flee and the child of fear be carve in the likeness of the army of all the trans-cyresian tribe with they back towards merimna flock after fear and from where he sit on he horse behind the rampart the sword of welleran be stretch out over they head as ever it be wont and the two spy kneel down in the sand and kiss the huge bronze foot of the statue of fear say : ' o fear fear ' and as they kneel they see light far off along the rampart come nearer and nearer and hear man singing of welleran and the purple guard come nearer and go by with they light and pass on into the distance round the rampart still singing of welleran and all the while the two spy cling to the foot of the statue muttering : ' o fear fear ' but when they could hear the name of welleran no more they arise and come to the rampart and climb over they and come at once upon the figure of welleran and they bow low to the ground and seejar say : ' o welleran we come to see whether thou didst yet live ' and for a long while they wait with they face to the earth at last seejar look up towards welleran 's terrible sword and it be still stretch out point to the carve army that follow after fear and seejar bow to the ground again and touch the horse 's hoof and it seem cold to he and he move he hand higher and touch the leg of the horse and it seem quite cold at last he touch welleran 's foot and the armor on it seem hard and stiff then as welleran move not and speak not seejar climb up at last and touch he hand the terrible hand of welleran and it be marble then seejar laugh aloud and he and sajar-ho speed down the empty pathway and find rollory and he be marble too then they climb down over the rampart and go back across the plain walking contemptuously past the figure of fear and hear the guard return round the rampart for the third time singing of welleran and seejar say : ` ay you may sing of welleran but welleran be dead and a doom be on you city ' and they pass on and find the sentinel still restless in the night and call on rollory and sajar-ho mutter : ` ay you may call on rollory but rollory be dead and naught can save you city ' and the two spy go back alive to they mountain again and as they reach they the first ray of the sun come up red over the desert behind merimna and light merimna 's spire it be the hour when the purple guard be wont to go back into the city with they taper pale and they robe a brighter color when the cold sentinel come shuffling in from dream in the desert it be the hour when the desert robber hide themselves away go back to they mountain cave it be the hour when gauze-winged insect be bear that only live for a day it be the hour when man die that be condemn to death and in this hour a great peril new and terrible arise for merimna and merimna know it not then seejar turning say : ` see how red the dawn be and how red the spire of merimna they be angry with merimna in paradise and they bode its doom ' so the two spy go back and bring the news to they king and for a few day the king of those country be gather they army together and one evening the army of four king be mass together at the top of the deep ravine all crouch below the summit wait for the sun to set all wear resolute and fearless face yet inwardly every man be pray to he god unto each one in turn then the sun set and it be the hour when the bat and the dark creature be abroad and the lion come down from they lair and the desert robber go into the plain again and fever rise up winged and hot out of chill marsh and it be the hour when safety leave the throne of king the hour when dynasty change but in the desert the purple guard come swing out of merimna with they light to sing of welleran and the sentinel lay down to sleep now into paradise no sorrow may ever come but may only beat like rain against its crystal wall yet the soul of merimna 's hero be half aware of some sorrow far away as some sleeper feel that some one be chill and cold yet know not in he sleep that it be he and they fret a little in they starry home then unseen there drift earthward across the setting sun the soul of welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine already when they reach merimna 's rampart it be just dark already the army of the four king have begin to move jingle down the deep ravine but when the six warrior see they city again so little change after so many year they look towards she with a longing that be nearer to tear than any that they soul have know before cry to she : ' o merimna we city : merimna we walled city ` how beautiful thou art with all thy spire merimna for thee we leave the earth its kingdom and little flower for thee we have come away for awhile from paradise ` it be very difficult to draw away from the face of god -- it be like a warm fire it be like dear sleep it be like a great anthem yet there be a stillness all about it a stillness full of light ` we have leave paradise for awhile for thee merimna ` many woman have we love merimna but only one city ` behold now all the people dream all we loved people how beautiful be dream in dream the dead may live even the long dead and the very silent thy light be all sink low they have all go out no sound be in thy street hush thou art like a maiden that shutteth up she eye and be asleep that draweth she breath softly and be quite still be at ease and untroubled ` behold now the battlements the old battlements do man defend they still as we defend they they be wear a little the battlements ' and drift nearer they peer anxiously ` it be not by the hand of man that they be wear we battlements only the year have do it and indomitable time thy battlements be like the girdle of a maiden a girdle that be round about she see now the dew upon they they be like a jewelled girdle ` thou art in great danger merimna because thou art so beautiful must thou perish tonight because we no more defend thee because we cry out and none hear we as the bruised lily cry out and none have know they voice ' thus speak those strong-voiced battle-ordering captain call to they dear city and they voice come no louder than the whisper of little bat that drift across the twilight in the evening then the purple guard come near go round the rampart for the first time in the night and the old warrior call to they ` merimna be in danger already she enemy gather in the darkness ' but they voice be never hear because they be only wander ghost and the guard go by and pass unheeding away still singing of welleran then say welleran to he comrade : ` we hand can hold sword no more we voice can not be hear we be stalwart man no longer we be but dream let we go among dream go all of you and thou too young iraine and trouble the dream of all the man that sleep and urge they to take the old sword of they grandsire that hang upon the wall and to gather at the mouth of the ravine and i will find a leader and make he take my sword ' then they pass up over the rampart and into they dear city and the wind blow about this way and that as he go the soul of welleran who have upon he day withstand the charge of tempestuous army and the soul of he comrade and with they young iraine pass up into the city and trouble the dream of every man who sleep and to every man the soul say in they dream : ` it be hot and still in the city go out now into the desert into the cool under the mountain but take with thee the old sword that hang upon the wall for fear of the desert robber ' and the god of that city send up a fever over it and the fever brood over it and the street be hot and all that sleep awake from dream that it would be cool and pleasant where the breeze come down the ravine out of the mountain and they take the old sword that they grandsire have accord to they dream for fear of the desert robber and in and out of dream pass the soul of welleran 's comrade and with they young iraine in great haste as the night wear on and one by one they trouble the dream of all merimna 's man and cause they to arise and go out arm all save the purple guard who heedless of danger sing of welleran still for wake man can not hear the soul of the dead but welleran drift over the roof of the city till he come to the form of rold lie fast asleep now rold be grow strong and be eighteen year of age and he be fair of hair and tall like welleran and the soul of welleran hover over he and go into he dream as a butterfly flit through trellis-work into a garden of flower and the soul of welleran say to rold in he dream : ` thou wouldst go and see again the sword of welleran the great curved sword of welleran thou wouldst go and look at it in the night with the moonlight shine upon it ' and the longing of rold in he dream to see the sword cause he to walk still sleep from he mother 's house to the hall wherein be the trophy of the hero and the soul of welleran urge the dream of rold cause he to pause before the great red cloak and there the soul say among the dream : ` thou art cold in the night fling now a cloak around thee ' and rold draw round about he the huge red cloak of welleran then rold 's dream take he to the sword and the soul say to the dream : ` thou hast a longing to hold the sword of welleran : take up the sword in thy hand ' but rold say : ` what should a man do with the sword of welleran ' and the soul of the old captain say to the dream : ` it be a good sword to hold : take up the sword of welleran ' and rold still sleep and speak aloud say : ` it be not lawful none may touch the sword ' and rold turn to go then a great and terrible cry arise in the soul of welleran all the more bitter for that he could not utter it and it go round and round he soul find no utterance like a cry evoke long since by some murderous deed in some old haunted chamber that whisper through the age hear by none and the soul of welleran cry out to the dream of rold : ` thy knee be tie thou art fall in a marsh thou canst not move ' and the dream of rold say to he : ` thy knee be tie thou art fall in a marsh ' and rold stand still before the sword then the soul of the warrior wail among rold 's dream as rold stand before the sword ` welleran be cry for he sword he wonderful curved sword poor welleran that once fight for merimna be cry for he sword in the night thou wouldst not keep welleran without he beautiful sword when he be dead and can not come for it poor welleran who fight for merimna ' and rold break the glass casket with he hand and take the sword the great curved sword of welleran and the soul of the warrior say among rold 's dream : ` welleran be wait in the deep ravine that run into the mountain cry for he sword ' and rold go down through the city and climb over the rampart and walk with he eye wide open but still sleep over the desert to the mountain already a great multitude of merimna 's citizen be gather in the desert before the deep ravine with old sword in they hand and rold pass through they as he sleep hold the sword of welleran and the people cry in amaze to one another as he pass : ` rold have the sword of welleran ' and rold come to the mouth of the ravine and there the voice of the people wake he and rold know nothing that he have do in he sleep and look in amazement at the sword in he hand and say : ` what art thou thou beautiful thing light shimmer in thee thou art restless it be the sword of welleran the curved sword of welleran ' and rold kiss the hilt of it and it be salt upon he lip with the battle-sweat of welleran and rold say : ` what should a man do with the sword of welleran ' and all the people wonder at rold as he sit there with the sword in he hand mutter ` what should a man do with the sword of welleran ' presently there come to the ear of rold the noise of a jingle up in the ravine and all the people the people that know naught of war hear the jingle come nearer in the night for the four army be move on merimna and not yet expect a enemy and rold grip upon the hilt of the great curved sword and the sword seem to lift a little and a new thought come into the heart of merimna 's people as they grip they grandsire ' sword nearer and nearer come the heedless army of the four king and old ancestral memory begin to arise in the mind of merimna 's people in the desert with they sword in they hand sit behind rold and all the sentinel be awake hold they spear for rollory have put they dream to flight rollory that once could put to flight army and now be but a dream struggle with other dream and now the army have come very near suddenly rold leap up cry : ` welleran and the sword of welleran ' and the savage lust sword that have thirst for a hundred year go up with the hand of rold and sweep through a tribesman 's rib and with the warm blood all about it there come a joy into the curved soul of that mighty sword like to the joy of a swimmer come up drip out of warm sea after live for long in a dry land when they see the red cloak and that terrible sword a cry run through the tribal army ` welleran life ' and there arise the sound of the exulting of victorious man and the panting of those that flee and the sword singing softly to itself as it whirl drip through the air and the last that i saw of the battle as it pour into the depth and darkness of the ravine be the sword of welleran sweep up and fall gleaming blue in the moonlight whenever it arise and afterwards gleam red and so disappear into the darkness but in the dawn merimna 's man come back and the sun arise to give new life to the world shine instead upon the hideous thing that the sword of welleran have do and rold say : ' o sword sword how horrible thou art thou art a terrible thing to have come among man how many eye shall look upon garden no more because of thee how many field must go empty that might have be fair with cottage white cottage with child all about they how many valley must go desolate that might have nurse warm hamlet because thou hast slay long since the man that might have build they i hear the wind cry against thee thou sword it come from the empty valley it come over the bare field there be child 's voice in it they be never bear death bring a end to cry for those that have life once but these must cry for ever o sword sword why do the god send thee among man ' and the tear of rold fall down upon the proud sword but could not wash it clean and now that the ardor of battle have pass away the spirit of merimna 's people begin to gloom a little like they leader 's with they fatigue and with the cold of the morning and they look at the sword of welleran in rold 's hand and say : ` not any more not any more for ever will welleran now return for he sword be in the hand of another now we know indeed that he be dead o welleran thou wast we sun and moon and all we star now be the sun fall down and the moon break and all the star be scatter as the diamond of a necklace that be snap off one who be slay by violence ' thus weep the people of merimna in the hour of they great victory for man have strange mood while beside they they old inviolate city slumber safe but back from the rampart and beyond the mountain and over the land that they have conquer of old beyond the world and back again to paradise go the soul of welleran soorenard mommolek rollory akanax and young iraine the fall of babbulkund i say : ' i will arise now and see babbulkund city of marvel she be of one age with the earth the star be she sister pharaoh of the old time come conquer from araby first see she a solitary mountain in the desert and cut the mountain into tower and terrace they destroy one of the hill of god but they make babbulkund she be carven not build she palace be one with she terrace there be neither join nor cleft hers be the beauty of the youth of the world she deemeth herself to be the middle of earth and have four gate face outward to the nation there sit outside she eastern gate a colossal god of stone he face flush with the light of dawn when the morning sunlight warm he lip they part a little and he giveth utterance to the word oon oom and the language be long since dead in which he speak and all he worshipper be gather to they tomb so that none knoweth what the word portend that he uttereth at dawn some say that he greet the sun as one god greet another in the language thereof and other say that he proclaim the day and other that he uttereth warning and at every gate be a marvel not credible until beholden ' and i gather three friend and say to they : ` we be what we have see and know let we journey now and behold babbulkund that we mind may be beautify with it and we spirit make holier ' so we take ship and travel over the lifting sea and remember not thing do in the town we know but lay away the thought of they like soil linen and put they by and dream of babbulkund but when we come to the land of which babbulkund be the abide glory we hire a caravan of camel and arab guide and pass southwards in the afternoon on the three day ' journey through the desert that should bring we to the white wall of babbulkund and the heat of the sun shone upon we out of the bright gray sky and the heat of the desert beat up at we from below about sunset we halt and tethered we horse while the arab unloaded the provision from the camel and prepare a fire out of the dry scrub for at sunset the heat of the desert depart from it suddenly like a bird then we see a traveller approach we on a camel come from the south when he be come near we say to he : ` come and encamp among we for in the desert all man be brother and we will give thee meat to eat and wine or if thou art bind by thy faith we will give thee some other drink that be not accurse by the prophet ' the traveller seat himself beside we on the sand and cross he leg and answer : ` hearken and i will tell you of babbulkund city of marvel babbulkund stand just below the meeting of the river where oonrana river of myth flow into the water of fable even the old stream plegáthanees these together enter she northern gate rejoicing of old they flow in the dark through the hill that nehemoth the first of pharaoh carve into the city of marvel sterile and desolate they float far through the desert each in the appoint cleft with life upon neither bank but give birth in babbulkund to the sacred purple garden whereof all nation sing thither all the bee come on a pilgrimage at evening by a secret way of the air once from he twilit kingdom which he rule equally with the sun the moon saw and love babbulkund clothe with she purple garden and the moon woo babbulkund and she send he weep away for she be more beautiful than all she sister the star she sister come to she at night into she maiden chamber even the god speak sometimes of babbulkund clothe with she purple garden listen for i perceive by you eye that ye have not see babbulkund there be a restlessness in they and a unappeased wonder listen in the garden whereof i speak there be a lake that have no twin or fellow in the world there be no companion for it among all the lake the shore of it be of glass and the bottom of it in it be great fish have golden and scarlet scale and they swim to and fro here it be the wont of the eighty-second nehemoth -lrb- who rule in the city today -rrb- to come after the dusk have fall and sit by the lake alone and at this hour eight hundred slave go down by step through cavern into vault beneath the lake four hundred of they carry purple light march one behind the other from east to west and four hundred carry green light march one behind the other from west to east the two line cross and re-cross each other in and out as the slave go round and round and the fearful fish flash up and down and to and fro ' but upon that traveller speak night descend solemn and cold and we wrap ourselves in we blanket and lay down upon the sand in the sight of the astral sister of babbulkund and all that night the desert say many thing softly and in a whisper but i know not what he say only the sand know and arise and be trouble and lay down again and the wind know then as the hour of the night go by these two discover the foot-tracks wherewith we have disturb the holy desert and they trouble over they and cover they up and then the wind lay down and the sand rest then the wind arise again and the sand dance this they do many time and all the while the desert whisper what i shall not know then i sleep awhile and awake just before sunrise very cold suddenly the sun leap up and flame upon we face we all throw off we blanket and stand up then we take food and afterwards start southwards and in the heat of the day rest and afterwards push on again and all the while the desert remain the same like a dream that will not cease to trouble a tired sleeper and often traveller pass we in the desert come from the city of marvel and there be a light and a glory in they eye from have see babbulkund that evening at sunset another traveller near we and we hail he say : ` wilt thou eat and drink with we see that all man be brother in the desert ' and he descend from he camel and sit by we and say : ` when morning shine on the colossus neb and neb speak at once the musician of king nehemoth in babbulkund awake ` at first they finger wander over they golden harp or they stroke idly they violin clearer and clearer the note of each instrument ascend like lark arise from the dew till suddenly they all blend together and a new melody be bear thus every morning the musician of king nehemoth make a new marvel in the city of marvel for these be no common musician but master of melody raid by conquest long since and carry away in ship from the isle of song and at the sound of the music nehemoth awake in the eastern chamber of he palace which be carve in the form of a great crescent four mile long on the northern side of the city full in the window of its eastern chamber the sun rise and full in the window of its western chamber the sun set ` when nehemoth awake he summons slave who bring a palanquin with bell which the king enter have lightly robe then the slave run and bear he to the onyx chamber of the bath with the sound of small bell ring as they run and when nehemoth emerge thence bath and anoint the slave run on with they ringing palanquin and bear he to the orient chamber of banquet where the king take the first meal of the day thence through the great white corridor whose window all face sunwards nehemoth in he palanquin pass on to the audience chamber of embassy from the north which be all deck with northern wares ` all about it be ornament of amber from the north and carven chalice of the dark brown northern crystal and on its floor lie fur from baltic shore ` in adjoining chamber be store the wonted food of the hardy northern man and the strong wine of the north pale but terrible therein the king receive barbarian prince from the frigid land thence the slave bear he swiftly to the audience chamber of embassy from the east where the wall be of turquoise stud with the ruby of ceylon where the god be the god of the east where all the hanging have be devise in the gorgeous heart of ind and where all the carving have be work with the cunning of the isle here if a caravan have chance to have come in from ind or from cathay it be the king 's wont to converse awhile with mogul or mandarin for from the east come the art and knowledge of the world and the converse of they people be polite thus nehemoth pass on through the other audience chamber and receive perhaps some sheikh of the arab folk who have cross the great desert from the west or receive a embassy send to do he homage from the shy jungle people to the south and all the while the slave with the ringing palanquin run westwards follow the sun and ever the sun shine straight into the chamber where nehemoth sit and all the while the music from one or other of he band of musician come tinkle to he ear but when the middle of the day draw near the slave run to the cool grove that lie along the verandah on the northern side of the palace forsake the sun and as the heat overcome the genius of the musician one by one they hand fall from they instrument till at last all melody cease at this moment nehemoth fall asleep and the slave put the palanquin down and lie down beside it at this hour the city become quite still and the palace of nehemoth and the tomb of the pharaoh of old face to the sunlight all alike in silence even the jeweller in the market-place selling gem to prince cease from they bargaining and cease to sing for in babbulkund the vendor of ruby sing the song of the ruby and the vendor of sapphire sing the song of the sapphire and each stone have its song so that a man by he song proclaim and make know he wares ` but all these sound cease at the meridian hour the jeweller in the market-place lie down in what shadow they can find and the prince go back to the cool place in they palace and a great hush in the gleaming air hang over babbulkund but in the cool of the late afternoon one of the king 's musician will awake from dream of he home and will pass he finger perhaps over the string of he harp and with the music some memory may arise of the wind in the glen of the mountain that stand in the isle of song then the musician will wrench great cry out of the soul of he harp for the sake of the old memory and he fellow will awake and all make a song of home weave of saying tell in the harbor when the ship come in and of tale in the cottage about the people of old time one by one the other band of musician will take up the song and babbulkund city of marvel will throb with this marvel anew just now nehemoth awakes the slave leap to they foot and bear the palanquin to the outer side of the great crescent palace between the south and the west to behold the sun again the palanquin with its ringing bell go round once more the voice of the jeweller sing again in the market-place the song of the emerald the song of the sapphire man talk on the housetops beggar wail in the street the musician bend to they work all the sound blend together into one murmur the voice of babbulkund speaking at evening lower and lower sink the sun till nehemoth follow it come with he panting slave to the great purple garden of which surely thine own country have its song from wherever thou art come ` there he alight from he palanquin and go up to a throne of ivory set in the garden 's midst face full westward and sit there alone long regard the sunlight until it be quite go at this hour trouble come into the face of nehemoth man have hear he mutter at the time of sunset : even i too even i too thus do king nehemoth and the sun make they glorious ambit about babbulkund ' a little later when the star come out to envy the beauty of the city of marvel the king walk to another part of the garden and sit in a alcove of opal all alone by the marge of the sacred lake this be the lake whose shore and floor be of glass which be light from beneath by slave with purple light and with green light intermingle and be one of the seven wonder of babbulkund three of the wonder be in the city 's midst and four be at she gate there be the lake of which i tell thee and the purple garden of which i have tell thee and which be a wonder even to the star and there be ong zwarba of which i shall tell thee also and the wonder at the gate be these at the eastern gate neb and at the northern gate the wonder of the river and the arch for the river of myth which become one with the water of fable in the desert outside the city float under a gate of pure gold rejoicing and under many arch fantastically carven that be one with either bank the marvel at the western gate be the marvel of annolith and the dog voth annolith sit outside the western gate face towards the city he be higher than any of the tower or palace for he head be carve from the summit of the old hill he have two eye of sapphire wherewith he regard babbulkund and the wonder of the eye be that they be today in the same socket wherein they glow when first the world begin only the marble that cover they have be carven away and the light of day let in and the sight of the envious star larger than a lion be the dog voth beside he every hair be carven upon the back of voth he war hackles be erect and he tooth be bare all the nehemoth have worship the god annolith but all they people pray to the dog voth for the law of the land be that none but a nehemoth may worship the god annolith the marvel at the southern gate be the marvel of the jungle for he come with all he wild untravelled sea of darkness and tree and tiger and sunward-aspiring orchid right through a marble gate in the city wall and enter the city and there widen and hold a space in its midst of many mile across moreover he be older than the city of marvel for he dwell long since in one of the valley of the mountain which nehemoth first of pharaoh carve into babbulkund ` now the opal alcove in which the king sit at evening by the lake stand at the edge of the jungle and the climb orchid of the jungle have long since creep from they home through cleft of the opal alcove lure by the light of the lake and now bloom there exultingly near to this alcove be the hareem of nehemoth ` the king have four hareem -- one for the stalwart woman from the mountain to the north one for the dark and furtive jungle woman one for the desert woman that have wander soul and pine in babbulkund and one for the princess of he own kith whose brown cheek blush with the blood of ancient pharaoh and who exult with babbulkund in she surpassing beauty and who know nought of the desert or the jungle or the bleak hill to the north quite unadorned and clad in simple garment go all the kith of nehemoth for they know well that he grow weary of pomp unadorned all save one the princess linderith who weareth ong zwarba and the three lesser gem of the sea such a stone be ong zwarba that there be none like it even in the turban of nehemoth nor in all the sanctuary of the sea the same god that make linderith make long ago ong zwarba she and ong zwarba shine together with one light and beside this marvellous stone gleam the three lesser one of the sea ` now when the king sitteth in he opal alcove by the sacred lake with the orchid bloom around he all sound be become still the sound of the tramp of the weary slave as they go round and round never come to the surface long since the musician sleep and they hand have fall dumb upon they instrument and the voice in the city have die away perhaps a sigh of one of the desert woman have become half a song or on a hot night in summer one of the woman of the hill sing softly a song of snow all night long in the midst of the purple garden sing one nightingale all else be still the star that look on babbulkund arise and set the cold unhappy moon drift lonely through they the night wear on at last the dark figure of nehemoth eighty-second of he line rise and move stealthily away ' the traveller cease to speak for a long time the clear star sister of babbulkund have shine upon he speak the desert wind have arise and whisper to the sand and the sand have long go secretly to and fro none of we have move none of we have fall asleep not so much from wonder at he tale as from the thought that we ourselves in two day ' time should see that wondrous city then we wrap we blanket around we and lay down with we foot towards the ember of we fire and instantly be asleep and in we dream we multiply the fame of the city of marvel the sun arise and flame upon we face and all the desert glint with its light then we stand up and prepare the morning meal and when we have eat the traveller depart and we commend he soul to the god of the land whereto he go of the land of he home to the northward and he commend we soul to the god of the people of the land wherefrom we have come then a traveller overtake we go on foot he wear a brown cloak that be all in rag and he seem to have be walk all night and he walk hurriedly but appear weary so we offer he food and drink of which he partake thankfully when we ask he where he be go he answer ` babbulkund ' then we offer he a camel upon which to ride for we say ` we also go to babbulkund ' but he answer strangely : ` nay pass on before I for it be a sore thing never to have see babbulkund have live while yet she stand pass on before I and behold she and then flee away at once return northwards ' then though we understand he not we leave he for he be insistent and pass on we journey southwards through the desert and we come before the middle of the day to a oasis of palm tree stand by a well and there we give water to the haughty camel and replenish we water-bottle and soothe we eye with the sight of green thing and tarry for many hour in the shade some of the man sleep but of those that remain awake each man sing softly the song of he own country tell of babbulkund when the afternoon be far spend we travel a little way southward and go on through the cool evening until the sun fall low and we encamp and as we sit in we encampment the man in rag overtake we have travel all the day and we give he food and drink again and in the twilight he speak say : ' i be the servant of the lord the god of my people and i go to do he work on babbulkund she be the most beautiful city in the world there have be none like she even the star of god go envious of she beauty she be all white yet with streak of pink that pass through she street and house like flame in the white mind of a sculptor like desire in paradise she have be carve of old out of a holy hill no slave work the city of marvel but artist toiling at the work they love they take no pattern from the house of man but each man work what he inner eye have see and carve in marble the vision of he dream all over the roof of one of the palace chamber wing lion flit like bat the size of every one be the size of the lion of god and the wing be larger than any wing create they be one above the other more than a man can number they be all carven out of one block of marble the chamber itself be hollow from it and it be bear aloft upon the carven branch of a grove of cluster tree-fern work by the hand of some jungle mason that love the tall fern well over the river of myth which be one with the water of fable go bridge fashion like the wisteria tree and like the droop laburnum and a hundred other of wonderful device the desire of the soul of mason a long while dead oh very beautiful be white babbulkund very beautiful she be but proud and the lord the god of my people have see she in she pride and look towards she have see the prayer of nehemoth go up to the abomination annolith and all the people follow after voth she be very beautiful babbulkund alas that i may not bless she i could live always on one of she inner terrace look on the mysterious jungle in she midst and the heavenward face of the orchid that clamber from the darkness behold the sun i could love babbulkund with a great love yet be i the servant of the lord the god of my people and the king have sin unto the abomination annolith and the people lust exceedingly for voth alas for thee babbulkund alas that i may not even now turn back for tomorrow i must prophesy against thee and cry out against thee babbulkund but ye traveller that have entreat I hospitably rise and pass on with you camel for i can tarry no longer and i go to do the work on babbulkund of the lord the god of my people go now and see the beauty of babbulkund before i cry out against she and then flee swiftly northwards ' a smoulder fragment fall in upon we camp fire and send a strange light into the eye of the man in rag he rise at once and he tattered cloak swirl up with he like a great wing he say no more but turn round from we instantly southwards and stride away into the darkness towards babbulkund then a hush fell upon we encampment and the smell of the tobacco of those land arise when the last flame die down in we camp fire i fall asleep but my rest be trouble by shift dream of doom morning come and we guide tell we that we should come to the city ere nightfall again we pass southwards through the changeless desert sometimes we meet traveller come from babbulkund with the beauty of its marvel still fresh in they eye when we encamp near the middle of the day we see a great number of people on foot come towards we run from the southward these we hail when they be come near say ` what of babbulkund ' they answer : ` we be not of the race of the people of babbulkund but be capture in youth and take away from the hill that be to the northward now we have all see in vision of the stillness the lord the god of we people call to we from he hill and therefore we all flee northwards but in babbulkund king nehemoth have be trouble in the night by unkingly dream of doom and none may interpret what the dream portend now this be the dream that king nehemoth dream on the first night of he dream he see move through the stillness a bird all black and beneath the beating of he wing babbulkund gloomed and darkened and after he fly a bird all white beneath the beating of whose wing babbulkund gleam and shone and there fly by four more bird alternately black and white and as the black one pass babbulkund darkened and when the white one appear she street and house shine but after the sixth bird there come no more and babbulkund vanish from she place and there be only the empty desert where she have stand and the river oonrana and plegáthanees mourning alone next morning all the prophet of the king gather before they abomination and question they of the dream and the abomination speak not but when the second night step down from the hall of god dower with many star king nehemoth dream again and in this dream king nehemoth see four bird only black and white alternately as before and babbulkund darken again as the black one pass and shine when the white come by only after the four bird come no more and babbulkund vanish from she place leave only the forgetful desert and the mourning river ` still the abomination speak not and none could interpret the dream and when the third night come forth from the divine hall of she home dower like she sister again king nehemoth dream and he see a bird all black go by again beneath whom babbulkund darkened and then a white bird and babbulkund shone and after they come no more and babbulkund pass away and the golden day appear dispel dream and still the abomination be silent and the king 's prophet answer not to portend the omen of the dream one prophet only speak before the king say : the sable bird o king be the night and the white bird be the day this thing the king have fear and he arise and smite the prophet with he sword whose soul go cry away and have to do no more with night and day ` it be last night that the king dream he third dream and this morning we flee away from babbulkund a great heat lie over it and the orchid of the jungle droop they head all night long the woman in the hareem of the north have wail horribly for they hill a fear have fall upon the city and a bode twice have nehemoth go to worship annolith and all the people have prostrate themselves before voth thrice the horologer have look into the great crystal globe wherein be foretell all happening to be and thrice the globe be blank yea though they go a fourth time yet be no vision reveal and the people 's voice be hush in babbulkund ' soon the traveller arise and push on northwards again leave we wonder through the heat of the day we rest as well as we might but the air be motionless and sultry and the camel ill at ease the arab say that it bode a desert storm and that a great wind would arise full of sand so we arise in the afternoon and travel swiftly hope to come to shelter before the storm and the air burn in the stillness between the baked desert and the glare sky suddenly a wind arise out of the south blow from babbulkund and the sand lift and go by in great shape all whispering and the wind blow violently and wail as it blow and hundred of sandy shape go towering by and there be little cry among they and the sound of a pass away soon the wind sink quite suddenly and its cry die and the panic cease among the drive sand and when the storm depart the air be cool and the terrible sultriness and the boding be pass away and the camel have ease among they and the arab say that the storm which be to be have be as be will of old by god the sun set and the gloaming come and we near the junction of oonrana and plegáthanees but in the darkness discern not babbulkund we push on hurriedly to reach the city ere nightfall and come to the junction of the river of myth where he meet with the water of fable and still see not babbulkund all round we lay the sand and rock of the unchanging desert save to the southward where the jungle stand with its orchid face skywards then we perceive that we have arrive too late and that she doom have come to babbulkund and by the river in the empty desert on the sand the man in rag be seat with he face hide in he hand weep bitterly \* \* \* \* \* \* \* thus pass away in the hour of she iniquity before annolith in the two thousand and thirty-second year of she being in the six thousand and fiftieth year of the building of the world babbulkund city of marvel sometime call by those that hate she city of the dog but hourly mourn in araby and ind and wide through jungle and desert leave no memorial in stone to show that she have be but remember with a abide love in spite of the anger of god by all that know she beauty whereof still they sing the kith of the elf folk chapter i the north wind be blow and red and golden the last day of autumn be streaming hence solemn and cold over the marsh arise the evening it become very still then the last pigeon go home to the tree on the dry land in the distance whose shape already have take upon themselves a mystery in the haze then all be still again as the light fade and the haze deepen mystery creep nearer from every side then the green plover come in cry and all alight and again it become still save when one of the plover arise and fly a little way utter the cry of the waste and hushed and silent become the earth expect the first star then the duck come in and the widgeon company by company : and all the light of day fade out of the sky save one red band of light across the light appear black and huge the wing of a flock of goose beat up wind to the marsh these too go down among the rush then the star appear and shine in the stillness and there be silence in the great space of the night suddenly the bell of the cathedral in the marsh break out call to evensong eight century ago on the edge of the marsh man have build the huge cathedral or it may have be seven century ago or perhaps nine -- it be all one to the wild thing so evensong be hold and candle light and the light through the window shine red and green in the water and the sound of the organ go roar over the marsh but from the deep and perilous place edge with bright moss the wild thing come leap up to dance on the reflection of the star and over they head as they dance the marsh-light rise and fall the wild thing be somewhat human in appearance only all brown of skin and barely two foot high they ear be point like the squirrel 's only far larger and they leap to prodigious height they live all day under deep pool in the loneliest marsh but at night they come up and dance each wild thing have over its head a marsh-light which move as the wild thing move they have no soul and can not die and be of the kith of the elf-folk all night they dance over the marsh tread upon the reflection of the star -lrb- for the bare surface of the water will not hold they by itself -rrb- but when the star begin to pale they sink down one by one into the pool of they home or if they tarry longer sit upon the rush they body fade from view as the marsh-fire pale in the light and by daylight none may see the wild thing of the kith of the elf-folk neither may any see they even at night unless they be bear as i be in the hour of dusk just at the moment when the first star appear now on the night that i tell of a little wild thing have go drift over the waste till it come right up to the wall of the cathedral and dance upon the image of the color saint as they lay in the water among the reflection of the star and as it leap in its fantastic dance it see through the paint window to where the people pray and hear the organ roaring over the marsh the sound of the organ roar over the marsh but the song and prayer of the people stream up from the cathedral 's highest tower like thin gold chain and reach to paradise and up and down they go the angel from paradise to the people and from the people to paradise again then something akin to discontent trouble the wild thing for the first time since the making of the marsh and the soft gray ooze and the chill of the deep water seem to be not enough nor the first arrival from northwards of the tumultuous goose nor the wild rejoicing of the wing of the wildfowl when every feather sing nor the wonder of the calm ice that come when the snipe depart and beard the rush with frost and clothes the hushed waste with a mysterious haze where the sun go red and low nor even the dance of the wild thing in the marvellous night and the little wild thing long to have a soul and to go and worship god and when evensong be over and the light be out it go back cry to its kith but on the next night as soon as the image of the star appear in the water it go leap away from star to star to the farthest edge of the marshland where a great wood grow where dwell the oldest of the wild thing and it find the oldest of wild thing sit under a tree shelter itself from the moon and the little wild thing say : ' i want to have a soul to worship god and to know the meaning of music and to see the inner beauty of the marshland and to imagine paradise ' and the oldest of the wild thing say to it : ` what have we to do with god we be only wild thing and of the kith of the elf-folk ' but it only answer ' i want to have a soul ' then the oldest of the wild thing say : ' i have no soul to give you but if you get a soul one day you would have to die and if you know the meaning of music you would learn the meaning of sorrow and it be better to be a wild thing and not to die ' so it go weep away but they that be kin to the elf-folk be sorry for the little wild thing and though the wild thing can not sorrow long have no soul to sorrow with yet they feel for awhile a soreness where they soul should be when they see the grief of they comrade so the kith of the elf-folk go abroad by night to make a soul for the little wild thing and they go over the marsh till they come to the high field among the flower and grass and there they gather a large piece of gossamer that the spider have lay by twilight and the dew be on it into this dew have shine all the light of the long bank of the ribbed sky as all the color change in the restful space of evening and over it the marvellous night have gleam with all its star then the wild thing go with they dew-bespangled gossamer down to the edge of they home and there they gather a piece of the gray mist that lie by night over the marshland and into it they put the melody of the waste that be bear up and down the marsh in the evening on the wing of the golden plover and they put into it too the mournful song that the reed be compel to sing before the presence of the arrogant north wind then each of the wild thing give some treasured memory of the old marsh ` for we can spare it ' they say and to all this they add a few image of the star that they gather out of the water still the soul that the kith of the elf-folk be make have no life then they put into it the low voice of two lover that go walk in the night wander late alone and after that they wait for the dawn and the queenly dawn appear and the marsh-light of the wild thing pale in the glare and they body fade from view and still they wait by the marsh 's edge and to they wait come over field and marsh from the ground and out of the sky the myriad song of the bird this too the wild thing put into the piece of haze that they have gather in the marshland and wrap it all up in they dew-bespangled gossamer then the soul live and there it lay in the hand of the wild thing no larger than a hedgehog and wonderful light be in it green and blue and they change ceaselessly go round and round and in the gray midst of it be a purple flare and the next night they come to the little wild thing and show she the gleaming soul and they say to she : ` if you must have a soul and go and worship god and become a mortal and die place this to you left breast a little above the heart and it will enter and you will become a human but if you take it you can never be rid of it to become immortal again unless you pluck it out and give it to another and we will not take it and most of the human have a soul already and if you can not find a human without a soul you will one day die and you soul can not go to paradise because it be only make in the marsh ' far away the little wild thing see the cathedral window alight for evensong and the song of the people mount up to paradise and all the angel go up and down so it bid farewell with tear and thanks to the wild thing of the kith of elf-folk and go leap away towards the green dry land hold the soul in its hand and the wild thing be sorry that it have go but could not be sorry long because they have no soul at the marsh 's edge the little wild thing gaze for some moment over the water to where the marsh-fire be leap up and down and then press the soul against its left breast a little above the heart instantly it become a young and beautiful woman who be cold and frightened she clothe herself somehow with bundle of reed and go towards the light of a house that stand close by and she push open the door and enter and find a farmer and a farmer 's wife sit over they supper and the farmer 's wife take the little wild thing with the soul of the marsh up to she room and clothe she and braid she hair and bring she down again and give she the first food that she have ever eat then the farmer 's wife ask many question ` where have you come from ' she say ` over the marsh ' ` from what direction ' say the farmer 's wife ` south ' say the little wild thing with the new soul ` but none can come over the marsh from the south ' say the farmer 's wife ` no they can not do that ' say the farmer ' i live in the marsh ' ` who be you ' ask the farmer 's wife ' i be a wild thing and have find a soul in the marsh and we be kin to the elf-folk ' talk it over afterwards the farmer and he wife agree that she must be a gipsy who have be lose and that she be queer with hunger and exposure so that night the little wild thing sleep in the farmer 's house but she new soul stay awake the whole night long dream of the beauty of the marsh as soon as dawn come over the waste and shone on the farmer 's house she look from the window towards the glitter water and see the inner beauty of the marsh for the wild thing only love the marsh and know its haunt but now she perceive the mystery of its distance and the glamour of its perilous pool with they fair and deadly moss and feel the marvel of the north wind who come dominant out of unknown icy land and the wonder of that ebb and flow of life when the wildfowl whirl in at evening to the marshland and at dawn pass out to sea and she know that over she head above the farmer 's house stretch wide paradise where perhaps god be now imagine a sunrise while angel play low on lute and the sun come rise up on the world below to gladden field and marsh and all that heaven think the marsh thought too for the blue of the marsh be as the blue of heaven and the great cloud shape in heaven become the shape in the marsh and through each run momentary river of purple errant between bank of gold and the stalwart army of reed appear out of the gloom with all they pennon wave as far as the eye could see and from another window she see the vast cathedral gather its ponderous strength together and lift it up in tower out of the marshland she say ' i will never never leave the marsh ' a hour later she dress with great difficulty and go down to eat the second meal of she life the farmer and he wife be kindly folk and teach she how to eat ' i suppose the gipsy do not have knife and fork ' one say to the other afterwards after breakfast the farmer go and see the dean who live near he cathedral and presently return and bring back to the dean 's house the little wild thing with the new soul ` this be the lady ' say the farmer ` this be dean murnith ' then he go away ` ah ' say the dean ' i understand you be lose the other night in the marsh it be a terrible night to be lose in the marsh ' ' i love the marsh ' say the little wild thing with the new soul ` indeed how old be you ' say the dean ' i do not know ' she answer ` you must know about how old you be ' he say ` oh about ninety ' she say ` or more ' ` ninety year ' exclaim the dean ` no ninety century ' she say ' i be as old as the marsh ' then she tell she story -- how she have long to be a human and go and worship god and have a soul and see the beauty of the world and how all the wild thing have make she a soul of gossamer and mist and music and strange memory ` but if this be true ' say dean murnith ` this be very wrong god can not have intend you to have a soul ` what be you name ' ' i have no name ' she answer ` we must find a christian name and a surname for you what would you like to be call ' ` song of the rush ' she say ` that will not do at all ' say the dean ` then i would like to be call terrible north wind or star in the water ' she say ` no no no ' say dean murnith ` that be quite impossible we could call you miss rush if you like how would mary rush do perhaps you have better have another name -- say mary jane rush ' so the little wild thing with the soul of the marsh take the name that be offer she and become mary jane rush ` and we must find something for you to do ' say dean murnith ` meanwhile we can give you a room here ' ' i do not want to do anything ' reply mary jane ' i want to worship god in the cathedral and live beside the marsh ' then mr murnith come in and for the rest of that day mary jane stay at the house of the dean and there with she new soul she perceive the beauty of the world for it come gray and level out of misty distance and widen into grassy field and ploughland right up to the edge of a old gabled town and solitary in the field far off a ancient windmill stand and he honest hand-made sail go round and round in the free east anglian wind close by the gabled house lean out over the street plant fair upon sturdy timber that grow in the olden time all glory among themselves upon they beauty and out of they buttress by buttress grow and go upward aspire tower by tower rise the cathedral and she see the people move in the street all leisurely and slow and unseen among they whisper to each other unheard by live man and concern only with bygone thing drift the ghost of very long ago and wherever the street run eastward wherever be gap in the house always there break into view the sight of the great marsh like to some bar of music weird and strange that haunt a melody arise again and again play on the violin by one musician only who play no other bar and he be swart and lank about the hair and beard about the lip and he moustache droop long and low and no one know the land from which he come all these be good thing for a new soul to see then the sun set over green field and ploughland and the night come up one by one the merry light of cheery lamp-lit window take they station in the solemn night then the bell ring far up in a cathedral tower and they melody fall on the roof of the old house and pour over they eaves until the street be full and then flood away over green field and plough till it come to the sturdy mill and bring the miller trudge to evensong and far away eastward and seaward the sound ring out over the remoter marsh and it be all as yesterday to the old ghost in the street then the dean 's wife take mary jane to evening service and she see three hundred candle fill all the aisle with light but sturdy pillar stand there in unlit vastness great colonnade go away into the gloom where evening and morning year in year out they do they work in the dark hold the cathedral roof aloft and it be stiller than the marsh be still when the ice have come and the wind that bring it have fall suddenly into this stillness rush the sound of the organ roaring and presently the people pray and sing no longer could mary jane see they prayer ascend like thin gold chain for that be but a elfin fancy but she imagine clear in she new soul the seraph pass in the way of paradise and the angel change guard to watch the world by night when the dean have finish service a young curate mr milling go up into the pulpit he speak of abana and pharpar river of damascus : and mary jane be glad that there be river have such name and hear with wonder of nineveh that great city and many thing strange and new and the light of the candle shine on the curate 's fair hair and he voice go ring down the aisle and mary jane rejoice that he be there but when he voice stop she feel a sudden loneliness such as she have not feel since the making of the marsh for the wild thing never be lonely and never unhappy but dance all night on the reflection of the star and have no soul desire nothing more after the collection be make before anyone move to go mary jane walk up the aisle to mr milling ' i love you ' she say chapter ii nobody sympathise with mary jane ` so unfortunate for mr milling ' every one say ` such a promising young man ' mary jane be send away to a great manufacturing city of the midland where work have be find for she in a cloth factory and there be nothing in that town that be good for a soul to see for it do not know that beauty be to be desire so it make many thing by machinery and become hurry in all its way and boast its superiority over other city and become richer and richer and there be none to pity it in this city mary jane have have lodgings find for she near the factory at six o'clock on those November morning about the time that far away from the city the wildfowl rise up out of the calm marsh and pass to the troubled space of the sea at six o'clock the factory utter a prolonged howl and gather the worker together and there they work save two hour for food the whole of the daylit hour and into the dark till the bell toll six again there mary jane work with other girl in a long dreary room where giant sit pound wool into a long thread-like strip with iron rasp hand and all day long they roar as they sit at they soulless work but the work of mary jane be not with these only they roar be ever in she ear as they clatter iron limb go to and fro she work be to tend a creature smaller but infinitely more cunning it take the strip of wool that the giant have thresh and whirl it round and round until it have twist it into hard thin thread then it would make a clutch with finger of steel at the thread that it have gather and waddle away about five yard and come back with more it have master all the subtlety of skilled worker and have gradually displace they one thing only it could not do it be unable to pick up the end if a piece of the thread break in order to tie they together again for this a human soul be require and it be mary jane 's business to pick up broken end and the moment she place they together the busy soulless creature tie they for itself all here be ugly even the green wool as it whirl round and round be neither the green of the grass nor yet the green of the rush but a sorry muddy green that befit a sullen city under a murky sky when she look out over the roof of the town there too be ugliness and well the house know it for with hideous stucco they ape in grotesque mimicry the pillar and temple of old greece pretend to one another to be that which they be not and emerge from these house and go in and see the pretence of paint and stucco year after year until it all peel away the soul of the poor owner of those house seek to be other soul until they grow weary of it at evening mary jane go back to she lodgings only then after the dark have fall could the soul of mary jane perceive any beauty in that city when the lamp be light and here and there a star shone through the smoke then she would have go abroad and behold the night but this the old woman to whom she be confide would not let she do and the day multiply themselves by seven and become week and the week pass by and all day be the same and all the while the soul of mary jane be cry for beautiful thing and find not one save on sunday when she go to church and leave it to find the city greyer than before one day she decide that it be better to be a wild thing in the lovely marsh than to have a soul that cry for beautiful thing and find not one from that day she determine to be rid of she soul so she tell she story to one of the factory girl and say to she : ` the other girl be poorly clothe and they do soulless work surely some of they have no soul and would take mine ' but the factory girl say to she : ` all the poor have soul it be all they have ' then mary jane watch the rich whenever she see they and vainly seek for some one without a soul one day at the hour when the machine rest and the human being that tend they rest too the wind be at that time from the direction of the marshland the soul of mary jane lament bitterly then as she stand outside the factory gate the soul irresistibly compel she to sing and a wild song come from she lip hymn the marshland and into she song come cry she yearning for home and for the sound of the shout of the north wind masterful and proud with he lovely lady the snow and she sing of tale that the rush murmured to one another tale that the teal know and the watchful heron and over the crowded street she song go cry away the song of waste place and of wild free land full of wonder and magic for she have in she elf-made soul the song of the bird and the roar of the organ in the marsh at this moment signor thompsonus the well-known english tenor happen to go by with a friend they stop and listen everyone stop and listen ` there have be nothing like this in europe in my time ' say signor thompsonus so a change come into the life of mary jane people be write to and finally it be arrange that she should take a lead part in the covent garden opera in a few week so she go to london to learn london and singing lesson be better than the city of the midland and those terrible machine yet still mary jane be not free to go and live as she like by the edge of the marshland and she be still determine to be rid of she soul but could find no one that have not a soul of they own one day she be tell that the english people would not listen to she as miss rush and be ask what more suitable name she would like to be call by ' i would like to be call terrible north wind ' say mary jane ` or song of the rush ' when she be tell that this be impossible and signorina marium russiano be suggest she acquiesce at once as she have acquiesce when they take she away from she curate she know nothing of the way of human at last the day of the opera come round and it be a cold day of the winter and signorina russiano appear on the stage before a crowded house and signorina russiano sing and into the song go all the longing of she soul the soul that could not go to paradise but could only worship god and know the meaning of music and the longing pervade that italian song as the infinite mystery of the hill be bear along the sound of distant sheep-bell then in the soul that be in that crowd house arise little memory of a great while since that be quite quite dead and live awhile again during that marvellous song and a strange chill go into the blood of all that listen as though they stand on the border of bleak marsh and the north wind blow and some it move to sorrow and some to regret and some to a unearthly joy -- then suddenly the song go wail away like the wind of the winter from the marshland when spring appear from the south so it end and a great silence fall fog-like over all that house breaking in upon the end of a chatty conversation that cecilia countess of birmingham be enjoy with a friend in the dead hush signorina russiano rush from the stage she appear again run among the audience and dash up to lady birmingham ` take my soul ' she say ` it be a beautiful soul it can worship god and know the meaning of music and can imagine paradise and if you go to the marshland with it you will see beautiful thing there be a old town there build of lovely timber with ghost in its street ' lady birmingham stare everyone be stand up ` see ' say signorina russiano ` it be a beautiful soul ' and she clutch at she left breast a little above the heart and there be the soul shine in she hand with the green and blue light go round and round and the purple flare in the midst ` take it ' she say ` and you will love all that be beautiful and know the four wind each one by he name and the song of the bird at dawn i do not want it because i be not free put it to you left breast a little above the heart ' still everybody be stand up and lady birmingham feel uncomfortable ` please offer it to some one else ' she say ` but they all have soul already ' say signorina russiano and everybody go on stand up and lady birmingham take the soul in she hand ` perhaps it be lucky ' she say she feel that she want to pray she half-close she eye and say ' _ unberufen _ ' then she put the soul to she left breast a little above the heart and hope that the people would sit down and the singer go away instantly a heap of clothes collapse before she for a moment in the shadow among the seat those who be bear in the dusk hour might have see a little brown thing leap free from the clothes then it spring into the bright light of the hall and become invisible to any human eye it dash about for a little then find the door and presently be in the lamplit street to those that be bear in the dusk hour it might have be see leap rapidly wherever the street run northwards and eastwards disappear from human sight as it pass under the lamp and appear again beyond they with a marsh-light over its head once a dog perceive it and give chase and be leave far behind the cat of london who be all bear in the dusk hour howl fearfully as it go by presently it come to the meaner street where the house be smaller then it go due north-eastward leap from roof to roof and so in a few minute it come to more open space and then to the desolate land where market garden grow which be neither town nor country till at last the good black tree come into view with they demoniac shape in the night and the grass be cold and wet and the night-mist float over it and a great white owl come by go up and down in the dark and at all these thing the little wild thing rejoice elvishly and it leave london far behind it redden the sky and could distinguish no longer its unlovely roar but hear again the noise of the night and now it would come through a hamlet glowing and comfortable in the night and now to the dark wet open field again and many a owl it overtake as they drift through the night a people friendly to the elf-folk sometimes it cross wide river leap from star to star and choose its way as it go to avoid the hard rough road come before midnight to the east anglian land and it hear there the shout of the north wind who be dominant and angry as he drive southwards he adventurous goose while the rush bent before he chaunt plaintively and low like enslaved rower of some fabulous trireme bend and swing under blow of the lash and singing all the while a doleful song and it feel the good dank air that clothes by night the broad east anglian land and come again to some old perilous pool where the soft green moss grow and there plunge downward and downward into the dear dark water till it feel the homely ooze once more come up between its toe thence out of the lovely chill that be in the heart of the ooze it arise renew and rejoice to dance upon the image of the star i chance to stand that night by the marsh 's edge forget in my mind the affair of man and i see the marsh-fire come leap up from all the perilous place and they come up by flock the whole night long to the number of a great multitude and dance away together over the marsh and i believe that there be a great rejoice all that night among the kith of the elf-folk the highwayman tom o ' the road have ride he last ride and be now alone in the night from where he be a man might see the white recumbent sheep and the black outline of the lonely downs and the gray line of the farther and lonelier downs beyond they or in hollow far below he out of the pitiless wind he might see the gray smoke of hamlet arise from black valley but all alike be black to the eye of tom and all the sound be silence in he ear only he soul struggle to slip from the iron chain and to pass southwards into paradise and the wind blow and blow for tom tonight have nought but the wind to ride they have take he true black horse on the day when they take from he the green field and the sky man 's voice and the laughter of woman and have leave he alone with chain about he neck to swing in the wind for ever and the wind blow and blow but the soul of tom o ' the road be nip by the cruel chain and whenever it struggle to escape it be beat backwards into the iron collar by the wind that blow from paradise from the south and swing there by the neck there fall away old sneer from off he lip and scoff that he have long since scoff at god fall from he tongue and there rot old bad lust out of he heart and from he finger the stain of deed that be evil and they all fall to the ground and grow there in pallid ring and cluster and when these ill thing have all fall away tom 's soul be clean again as he early love have find it a long while since in spring and it swing up there in the wind with the bone of tom and with he old torn coat and rusty chain and the wind blow and blow and ever and anon the soul of the sepulture come from consecrate acre would go by beat up wind to paradise past the gallows tree and past the soul of tom that might not go free night after night tom watch the sheep upon the downs with empty hollow socket till he dead hair grow and cover he poor dead face and hide the shame of it from the sheep and the wind blow and blow sometimes on gust of the wind come someone 's tear and beat and beat against the iron chain but could not rust they through and the wind blow and blow and every evening all the thought that tom have ever utter come flock in from do they work in the world the work that may not cease and sit along the gallows branch and chirrup to the soul of tom the soul that might not go free all the thought that he have ever utter and the evil thought rebuke the soul that bear they because they might not die and all those that he have utter the most furtively chirrup the loudest and the shrillest in the branch all the night and all the thought that tom have ever think about himself now point at the wet bone and mock at the old torn coat but the thought that he have have of other be the only companion that he soul have to soothe it in the night as it swing to and fro and they twitter to the soul and cheer the poor dumb thing that could have dream no more till there come a murderous thought and drive they all away and the wind blow and blow paul archbishop of aloi and vayence lay in he white sepulchre of marble face full to the southward towards paradise and over he tomb be sculpture the cross of christ that he soul might have repose no wind howl here as it howl in lonely tree-top up upon the downs but come with gentle breeze orchard scented over the low land from paradise from the southward and play about forget-me-not and grass in the consecrated land where lay the reposeful round the sepulchre of paul archbishop of aloi and vayence easy it be for a man 's soul to pass from such a sepulchre and flit low over remembered field to come upon the garden land of paradise and find eternal ease and the wind blow and blow in a tavern of foul repute three man be lap gin they name be joe and will and the gypsy puglionus none other name have they for of whom they father be they have no knowledge but only dark suspicion sin have caress and stroke they face often with its paw but the face of puglionus sin have kiss all over the mouth and chin they food be robbery and they pastime murder all of they have incur the sorrow of god and the enmity of man they sit at a table with a pack of card before they all greasy with the mark of cheating thumb and they whisper to one another over they gin but so low that the landlord of the tavern at the other end of the room could hear only muffle oath and know not by whom they swear or what they say these three be the staunchest friend that ever god have give unto a man and he to whom they friendship have be give have nothing else besides save some bone that swing in the wind and rain and a old torn coat and iron chain and a soul that might not go free but as the night wear on the three friend leave they gin and steal away and creep down to that graveyard where rest in he sepulchre paul archbishop of aloi and vayence at the edge of the graveyard but outside the consecrate ground they dig a hasty grave two digging while one watch in the wind and rain and the worm that creep in the unhallowed ground wonder and wait and the terrible hour of midnight come upon they with its fear and find they still beside the place of tomb and the three friend tremble at the horror of such a hour in such a place and shiver in the wind and drenching rain but still work on and the wind blow and blow soon they have finish and at once they leave the hungry grave with all its worm unfed and go away over the wet field stealthily but in haste leave the place of tomb behind they in the midnight and as they go they shiver and each man as he shiver curse the rain aloud and so they come to the spot where they have hide a ladder and a lantern there they hold long debate whether they should light the lantern or whether they should go without it for fear of the king 's man but in the end it seem to they better that they should have the light of they lantern and risk be take by the king 's man and hang than that they should come suddenly face to face in the darkness with whatever one might come face to face with a little after midnight about the gallows tree on three road in england whereon it be not the wont of folk to go they way in safety traveller tonight go unmolested but the three friend walk several pace wide of the king 's highway approach the gallows tree and will carry the lantern and joe the ladder but puglionus carry a great sword wherewith to do the work which must be do when they come close they see how bad be the case with tom for little remain of that fine figure of a man and nothing at all of he great resolute spirit only as they come they think they hear a whimpering cry like the sound of a thing that be cage and unfree to and fro to and fro in the wind swing the bone and the soul of tom for the sin that he have sin on the king 's highway against the law of the king and with shadow and a lantern through the darkness at the peril of they life come the three friend that he soul have win before it swing in chain thus the seed of tom 's own soul that he have sow all he life have grow into a gallows tree that bear in season iron chain in cluster while the careless seed that he have strew here and there a kindly jest and a few merry word have grow into the triple friendship that would not desert he bone then the three set the ladder against the tree and puglionus go up with he sword in he right hand and at the top of it he reach up and begin to hack at the neck below the iron collar presently the bone and the old coat and the soul of tom fall down with a rattle and a moment afterwards he head that have watch so long alone swing clear from the swing chain these thing will and joe gather up and puglionus come run down he ladder and they heap upon its rung the terrible remains of they friend and hasten away wet through with the rain with the fear of phantom in they heart and horror lie before they on the ladder by two o'clock they be down again in the valley out of the bitter wind but they go on past the open grave into the graveyard all among the tomb with they lantern and they ladder and the terrible thing upon it which keep they friendship still then these three that have rob the law of its due and proper victim still sin on for what be still they friend and lever out the marble slab from the sacred sepulchre of paul archbishop of aloi and vayence and from it they take the very bone of the archbishop himself and carry they away to the eager grave that they have leave and put they in and shovel back the earth but all that lay on the ladder they place with a few tear within the great white sepulchre under the cross of christ and put back the marble slab thence the soul of tom arise hallowed out of sacred ground go at dawn down the valley and linger a little about he mother 's cottage and old haunt of childhood pass on and come to the wide land beyond the cluster homestead there there meet with it all the kindly thought that the soul of tom have ever have and they fly and sing beside it all the way southwards until at last with singing all about it it come to paradise but will and joe and the gypsy puglionus go back to they gin and rob and cheat again in the tavern of foul repute and know not that in they sinful life they have sin one sin at which the angel smile in the twilight the lock be quite crowd with boat when we capsize i go down backwards for some few foot before i start to swim then i come splutter upward towards the light but instead of reach the surface i hit my head against the keel of a boat and go down again i strike out almost at once and come up but before i reach the surface my head crash against a boat for the second time and i go right to the bottom i be confuse and thoroughly frightened i be desperately in need of air and know that if i hit a boat for the third time i should never see the surface again drown be a horrible death notwithstanding all that have be say to the contrary my past life never occur to my mind but i think of many trivial thing that i might not do or see again if i be drown i swam up in a slanting direction hope to avoid the boat that i have strike suddenly i see all the boat in the lock quite clearly just above I and every one of they curved varnished plank and the scratch and chip upon they keel i see several gap among the boat where i might have swim up to the surface but it do not seem worthwhile to try and get there and i have forget why i want to then all the people lean over the side of they boat : i see the light flannel suit of the man and the color flower in the woman 's hat and i notice detail of they dress quite distinctly everybody in the boat be look down at I then they all say to one another ` we must leave he now ' and they and the boat go away and there be nothing above I but the river and the sky and on either side of I be the green weed that grow in the mud for i have somehow sink back to the bottom again the river as it flow by murmur not unpleasantly in my ear and the rush seem to be whisper quite softly among themselves presently the murmuring of the river take the form of word and i hear it say ` we must go on to the sea we must leave he now ' then the river go away and both its bank and the rush whisper ` yes we must leave he now ' and they too depart and i be leave in a great emptiness stare up at the blue sky then the great sky bent over I and speak quite softly like a kindly nurse soothing some little foolish child and the sky say ` goodbye all will be well goodbye ' and i be sorry to lose the blue sky but the sky go away then i be alone with nothing round about I i could see no light but it be not dark -- there be just absolutely nothing above I and below I and on every side i think that perhaps i be dead and that this might be eternity when suddenly some great southern hill rise up all round about I and i be lie on the warm grassy slope of a valley in england it be a valley that i have know well when i be young but i have not see it now for many year beside I stand the tall flower of the mint i see the sweet-smelling thyme flower and one or two wild strawberry there come up to I from field below I the beautiful smell of hay and there be a break in the voice of the cuckoo there be a feeling of summer and of evening and of lateness and of sabbath in the air the sky be calm and full of a strange color and the sun be low the bell in the church in the village be all a-ring and the chime go wander with echo up the valley towards the sun and whenever the echo die a new chime be bear and all the people of the village walk up a stone-paved path under a black oak porch and go into the church and the chime stop and the people of the village begin to sing and the level sunlight shone on the white tombstone that stand all round the church then there be a stillness in the village and shout and laughter come up from the valley no more only the occasional sound of the organ and of song and the blue butterfly those that love the chalk come and perch themselves on the tall grass five or six sometimes on a single piece of grass and they close they wing and sleep and the grass bent a little beneath they and from the wood along the top of the hill the rabbit come hop out and nibble the grass and hop a little further and nibble again and the large daisy close they petal up and the bird begin to sing then the hill speak all the great chalk hill that i loved and with a deep and solemn voice they say ` we have come to you to say goodbye ' then they all go away and there be nothing again all round about I upon every side i look everywhere for something on which to rest the eye nothing suddenly a low gray sky sweep over I and a moist air meet my face a great plain rush up to I from the edge of the cloud on two side it touch the sky and on two side between it and the cloud a line of low hill lay one line of hill brood gray in the distance the other stand a patchwork of little square green field with a few white cottage about it the plain be a archipelago of a million island each about a yard square or less and everyone of they be red with heather i be back on the bog of allen again after many year and it be just the same as ever though i have hear that they be drain it i be with a old friend whom i be glad to see again for they have tell I that he die some year ago he seem strangely young but what surprise I most be that he stand upon a piece of bright green moss which i have always learn to think would never bear i be glad too to see the old bog again and all the lovely thing that grow there -- the scarlet moss and the green moss and the firm and friendly heather and the deep silent water i see a little stream that wander vaguely through the bog and little white shell down in the clear depths of it i see a little way off one of the great pool where no island be with rush round its border where the duck love to come i look long at that untroubled world of heather and then i look at the white cottage on the hill and see the gray smoke curl from they chimney and know that they burn turf there and long for the smell of burn turf again and far away there arise and come nearer the weird cry of wild and happy voice and a flock of goose appear that be come from the northward then they cry blended into one great voice of exultation the voice of freedom the voice of ireland the voice of the waste and the voice say ` goodbye to you goodbye ' and pass away into the distance and as it pass the tame goose on the farm cry out to they brother up above they that they be free then the hill go away and the bog and the sky go with they and i be alone again as lose soul be alone then there grow up beside I the red brick building of my first school and the chapel that adjoin it the field a little way off be full of boy in white flannel play cricket on the asphalt playing ground just by the schoolroom window stand agamemnon achille and odysseus with they argive arm behind they but hector step down out of a ground-floor window and in the schoolroom be all priam 's son and the achæans and fair helen and a little farther away the ten thousand drift across the playground go up into the heart of persium to place cyrus on he brother 's throne and the boy that i know call to I from the field and say ` goodbye ' and they and the field go away and the ten thousand say ` goodbye ' each file as they pass I march swiftly and they too disappear and hector and agamemnon say ` goodbye ' and the host of the argive and of the achæans and they all go away and the old school with they and i be alone again the next scene that fill the emptiness be rather dim : i be be lead by my nurse along a little footpath over a common in surrey she be quite young close by a band of gypsy have light they fire near they they romantic caravan stand unhorsed and the horse crop grass beside it it be evening and the gypsy mutter round they fire in a tongue unknown and strange then they all say in english ` goodbye ' and the evening and the common and the campfire go away and instead of this a white highway with darkness and star below it that lead into darkness and star but at the near end of the road be common field and garden and there i stand close to a large number of people man and woman and i see a man walking alone down the road away from I towards the darkness and the star and all the people call he by he name and the man would not hear they but walk on down the road and the people go on call he by he name but i become irritated with the man because he would not stop or turn round when so many people call he by he name and it be a very strange name and i become weary of hear the strange name so very often repeat so that i make a great effort to call he that he might listen and that the people might stop repeat this strange name and with the effort i open my eye wide and the name that the people call be my own name and i lay on the river 's bank with man and woman bend over I and my hair be wet the ghost the argument that i have with my brother in he great lonely house will scarcely interest my reader not those at least whom i hope may be attract by the experiment that i undertake and by the strange thing that befall I in that hazardous region into which so lightly and so ignorantly i allow my fancy to enter it be at oneleigh that i have visit he now oneleigh stand in a wide isolation in the midst of a dark gathering of old whispering cedar they nod they head together when the north wind come and nod again and agree and furtively grow still again and say no more awhile the north wind be to they like a nice problem among wise old man they nod they head over it and mutter about it all together they know much those cedar they have be there so long they grandsire know lebanon and the grandsire of these be the servant of the king of tyre and come to solomon 's court and amidst these black-haired child of grey-headed time stand the old house of oneleigh i know not how many century have lash against it they evanescent foam of year but it be still unshattered and all about it be the thing of long ago as cling strange growth to some sea-defying rock here like the shell of long-dead limpet be armor that man encase themselves in long ago here too be tapestry of many color beautiful as seaweed no modern flotsam ever drift hither no early victorian furniture no electric light the great trade route that litter the year with empty meat tin and cheap novel be far from here well well the century will shatter it and drive its fragment on to distant shore meanwhile while it yet stand i go on a visit there to my brother and we argue about ghost my brother 's intelligence on this subject seem to I to be in need of correction he mistake thing imagine for thing have a actual existence he argue that second-hand evidence of person have see ghost prove ghost to exist i say that even if they have see ghost this be no proof at all nobody believe that there be red rat though there be plenty of first-hand evidence of man have see they in delirium finally i say i would see ghost myself and continue to argue against they actual existence so i collect a handful of cigar and drink several cup of very strong tea and go without my dinner and retire into a room where there be dark oak and all the chair be cover with tapestry and my brother go to bed bore with we argument and try hard to dissuade I from make myself uncomfortable all the way up the old stair as i stand at the bottom of they and as he candle go wind up and up i hear he still try to persuade I to have supper and go to bed it be a windy winter and outside the cedar be mutter i know not what about but i think that they be tory of a school long dead and be trouble about something new within a great damp log upon the fireplace begin to squeak and sing and strike up a whine tune and a tall flame stand up over it and beat time and all the shadow crowd round and begin to dance in distant corner old mass of darkness sit still like chaperone and never move over there in the darkest part of the room stand a door that be always lock it lead into the hall but no one ever use it near that door something have happen once of which the family be not proud we do not speak of it there in the firelight stand the venerable form of the old chair the hand that have make they tapestry lay far beneath the soil the needle with which they work be many separate flake of rust no one weave now in that old room -- no one but the assiduous ancient spider who watch by the deathbed of the thing of yore work shroud to hold they dust in shroud about the cornice already lay the heart of the oak wainscot that the worm have eat out surely at such a hour in such a room a fancy already excite by hunger and strong tea might see the ghost of former occupant i expect nothing less the fire flicker and the shadow dance memory of strange historic thing rise vividly in my mind but midnight chime solemnly from a seven-foot clock and nothing happen my imagination would not be hurry and the chill that be with the small hour have come upon I and i have nearly abandon myself to sleep when in the hall adjoining there arise the rustling of silk dress that i have wait for and expect then there enter two by two the high-born lady and they gallant of jacobean time they be little more than shadow -- very dignified shadow and almost indistinct but you have all read ghost story before you have all see in museum the dress of those time -- there be little need to describe they they enter several of they and sit down on the old chair perhaps a little carelessly consider the value of the tapestry then the rustling of they dress cease well -- i have see ghost and be neither frighten nor convinced that ghost exist i be about to get up out of my chair and go to bed when there come a sound of pattering in the hall a sound of bare foot come over the polished floor and every now and then a foot would slip and i hear claw scratch along the wood as some four-footed thing lose and regain its balance i be not frightened but uneasy the pattering come straight towards the room that i be in then i hear the sniff of expectant nostril perhaps ` uneasy ' be not the most suitable word to describe my feeling then suddenly a herd of black creature larger than bloodhound come gallop in they have large pendulous ear they nose be to the ground sniff they go up to the lord and lady of long ago and fawn about they disgustingly they eye be horribly bright and run down to great depths when i look into they i know suddenly what these creature be and i be afraid they be the sin the filthy immortal sin of those courtly man and woman how demure she be the lady that sit near I on a old-world chair -- how demure she be and how fair to have beside she with its jowl upon she lap a sin with such cavernous red eye a clear case of murder and you yonder lady with the golden hair surely not you -- and yet that fearful beast with the yellow eye slink from you to yonder courtier there and whenever one drive it away it slink back to the other over there a lady try to smile as she stroke the loathsome furry head of another 's sin but one of she own be jealous and intrude itself under she hand here sit a old nobleman with he grandson on he knee and one of the great black sin of the grandfather be lick the child 's face and have make the child its own sometimes a ghost would move and seek another chair but always he pack of sin would move behind he poor ghost poor ghost how many flight they must have attempt for two hundred year from they hate sin how many excuse they must have give for they presence and the sin be with they still -- and still unexplained suddenly one of they seem to scent my live blood and bay horribly and all the other leave they ghost at once and dash up to the sin that have give tongue the brute have pick up my scent near the door by which i have enter and they move slowly nearer to I sniff along the floor and utter every now and then they fearful cry i see that the whole thing have go too far but now they have see I now they be all about I they spring up try to reach my throat and whenever they claw touch I horrible thought come into my mind and unutterable desire dominate my heart i plan bestial thing as these creature leap around I and plan they with a masterly cunning a great red-eyed murder be among the foremost of those furry thing from whom i feebly strive to defend my throat suddenly it seem to I good that i should kill my brother it seem important to I that i should not risk be punish i know where a revolver be keep after i have shoot he i would dress the body up and put flour on the face like a man that have be act as a ghost it would be very simple i would say that he have frighten I -- and the servant have hear we talk about ghost there be one or two triviality that would have to be arrange but nothing escape my mind yes it seem to I very good that i should kill my brother as i look into the red depths of this creature 's eye but one last effort as they drag I down -- ` if two straight line cut one another ' i say ` the opposite angle be equal let ab cd cut one another at e then the angle cea ceb equal two right angle -lrb- prop xiii -rrb- also cea ae equal two right angle ' i move towards the door to get the revolver a hideous exultation arise among the beast ` but the angle cea be common therefore ae equal ceb in the same way cea equal deb _ qed _ ' it be prove logic and reason re-establish themselves in my mind there be no dark hound of sin the tapestried chair be empty it seem to I a inconceivable thought that a man should murder he brother the whirlpool once go down to the shore of the great sea i come upon the whirlpool lie prone upon the sand and stretch he huge limb in the sun i say to he : ` who art thou ' and he say : ' i be name nooz wana the whelmer of ship and from the strait of pondar obe i be come wherein it be my wont to vex the sea there i chase leviathan with my hand when he be young and strong often he slip through my finger and away into the weed forest that grow below the storm in the dusk on the floor of the sea but at last i catch and tame he for there i lurk upon the ocean 's floor midway between the knee of either cliff to guard the passage of the strait from all the ship that seek the further sea and whenever the white sail of the tall ship come swell round the corner of the crag out of the sunlit space of the known sea and into the dark of the strait then stand firm upon the ocean 's floor with my knee a little bent i take the water of the strait in both my hand and whirl they round my head but the ship come glide on with the sound of the sailor singing on she deck all singing song of the island and carry the rumor of they city to the lonely sea till they see I suddenly astride athwart they course and be catch in the water as i whirl they round my head then i draw in the water of the strait towards I and downward nearer and nearer to my terrible foot and hear in my ear above the roar of my water the ultimate cry of the ship for just before i drag they to the floor of ocean and stamp they asunder with my wreck foot ship utter they ultimate cry and with it go the life of all the sailor and pass the soul of the ship and in the ultimate cry of ship be the song the sailor sing and they hope and all they love and the song of the wind among the mast and timber when they stand in the forest long ago and the whisper of the rain that make they grow and the soul of the tall pine-tree or the oak all this a ship give up in one cry which she make at the last and at that moment i would pity the tall ship if i might but a man may feel pity who sit in comfort by he fireside tell tale in the winter -- no pity be they permit ever to feel who do the work of the god and so when i have bring she circling from round my shoulder to my waist and thence with she mast all sloping inwards to my knee and lower still and downwards till she topmast pennant flutter against my ankle then i nooz wana whelmer of ship lift up my foot and trample she beam asunder and there go up again to the surface of the strait only a few broken timber and the memory of the sailor and of they early love to drift for ever down the empty sea ` once in every hundred year for one day only i go to rest myself along the shore and to sun my limb on the sand that the tall ship may go through the unguarded strait and find the happy isle and the happy isle stand midmost among the smile of the sunny further sea and there the sailor may come upon content and long for nothing or if they long for aught they shall possess it ` there come not time with he devour hour nor any of the evil of the god or man these be the island whereto the soul of the sailor every night put in from all the world to rest from go up and down the sea to behold again the vision of far-off intimate hill that lift they orchard high above the field face the sunlight and for a while again to speak with the soul of old but about the dawn dream twitter and arise and circle thrice around the happy isle set out again to find the world of man then follow the soul of the sailor as at evening with slow stroke of stately wing the heron follow behind the flight of multitudinous rook but the soul return find awakening body and endure the toil of the day such be the happy isle whereunto few have come save but as roaming shadow in the night and for only a little while ` but longer than be need to make I strong and fierce again i may not stay and at set of sun when my arm be strong again and when i feel in my leg that i can plant they fair and bent upon the floor of ocean then i go back to take a new grip upon the water of the strait and to guard the further sea again for a hundred year because the god be jealous lest too many man shall pass to the happy isle and find content _ for the god have not content _ ' the hurricane one night i sit alone on the great down look over the edge of it at a murky sullen city all day long with its smoke it have trouble the holy sky and now it sit there roar in the distance and glare at I with its furnace and light factory window suddenly i become aware that i be not the only enemy of that city for i perceive the colossal form of the hurricane walk over the down towards I play idly with the flower as he pass and near I he stop and speak to the earthquake who have come up mole-like but vast out of a cleft in the earth ` old friend ' say the hurricane ` rememberest when we wreck the nation and drave the herd of the sea into new pasturage ' ` yes ' say the earthquake drowsily ` yes yes ' ` old friend ' say the hurricane ` there be city everywhere over thy head while thou didst sleep they have build they constantly my four child the wind suffocate with the fume of they the valley be desolate of flower and the lovely forest be cut down since last we go abroad together ' the earthquake lay there with he snout towards the city blinking at the light while the tall hurricane stand beside he point fiercely at it ` come ' say the hurricane ` let we fare forth again and destroy they that all the lovely forest may come back and the furry creep thing thou shalt whelm these city utterly and drive the people forth and i will smite they in the shelterless place and sweep they desecration from the sea wilt thou come forth with I and do this thing for the glory of it wilt thou wreck the world again as we do thou and i or ever man have come wilt thou come forth to this place at this hour tomorrow night ' ` yes ' say the earthquake ` yes ' and he creep to he cleft again and head foremost waddle down into the abyss when the hurricane stride away i get up quietly and depart but at that hour of the next night i come up cautiously to the same spot there i find the huge gray form of the hurricane alone with he head bow in he hand weep for the earthquake sleep long and heavily in the abyss and he would not wake the fortress unvanquishable save for sacnoth in a wood older than record a foster brother of the hill stand the village of allathurion and there be peace between the people of that village and all the folk who walk in the dark way of the wood whether they be human or of the tribe of the beast or of the race of the fairy and the elf and the little sacred spirit of tree and stream moreover the village people have peace among themselves and between they and they lord lorendiac in front of the village be a wide and grassy space and beyond this the great wood again but at the back the tree come right up to the house which with they great beam and wooden framework and thatched roof green with moss seem almost to be a part of the forest now in the time i tell of there be trouble in allathurion for of a evening fall dream be wont to come slip through the tree trunk and into the peaceful village and they assume dominion of man 's mind and lead they in watch of the night through the cindery plain of hell then the magician of that village make spell against those fall dream yet still the dream come flit through the tree as soon as the dark have fall and lead man 's mind by night into terrible place and cause they to praise satan openly with they lip and man grow afraid of sleep in allathurion and they grow worn and pale some through the want of rest and other from fear of the thing they see on the cindery plain of hell then the magician of the village go up into the tower of he house and all night long those whom fear keep awake could see he window high up in the night glowing softly alone the next day when the twilight be far go and night be gather fast the magician go away to the forest 's edge and utter there the spell that he have make and the spell be a compulsive terrible thing have a power over evil dream and over spirit of ill for it be a verse of forty line in many language both living and dead and have in it the word wherewith the people of the plain be wont to curse they camel and the shout wherewith the whaler of the north lure the whale shoreward to be kill and a word that cause elephant to trumpet and every one of the forty line close with a rhyme for ` wasp ' and still the dream come flit through the forest and lead man 's soul into the plain of hell then the magician know that the dream be from gaznak therefore he gather the people of the village and tell they that he have utter he mightiest spell -- a spell have power over all that be human or of the tribe of the beast and that since it have not avail the dream must come from gaznak the greatest magician among the space of the star and he read to the people out of the book of magician which tell the coming of the comet and foretell he come again and he tell they how gaznak ride upon the comet and how he visit earth once in every two hundred and thirty year and make for himself a vast invincible fortress and send out dream to feed on the mind of man and may never be vanquish but by the sword sacnoth and a cold fear fall on the heart of the villager when they find that they magician have fail they then speak leothric son of the lord lorendiac and twenty year old be he : ` good master what of the sword sacnoth ' and the village magician answer : ` fair lord no such sword as yet be work for it lie as yet in the hide of tharagavverug protect he spine ' then say leothric : ` who be tharagavverug and where may he be encounter ' and the magician of allathurion answer : ` he be the dragon-crocodile who haunt the northern marsh and ravages the homestead by they marge and the hide of he back be of steel and he under part be of iron but along the midst of he back over he spine there lie a narrow strip of unearthly steel this strip of steel be sacnoth and it may be neither cleft nor molten and there be nothing in the world that may avail to break it nor even leave a scratch upon its surface it be of the length of a good sword and of the breadth thereof shouldst thou prevail against tharagavverug he hide may be melt away from sacnoth in a furnace but there be only one thing that may sharpen sacnoth 's edge and this be one of tharagavverug 's own steel eye and the other eye thou must fasten to sacnoth 's hilt and it will watch for thee but it be a hard task to vanquish tharagavverug for no sword can pierce he hide he back can not be break and he can neither burn nor drown in one way only can tharagavverug die and that be by starve ' then sorrow fall upon leothric but the magician speak on : ` if a man drive tharagavverug away from he food with a stick for three day he will starve on the third day at sunset and though he be not vulnerable yet in one spot he may take hurt for he nose be only of lead a sword would merely lay bare the uncleavable bronze beneath but if he nose be smitten constantly with a stick he will always recoil from the pain and thus may tharagavverug to left and right be drive away from he food ' then leothric say : ` what be tharagavverug 's food ' and the magician of allathurion say : ` he food be man ' but leothric go straightway thence and cut a great staff from a hazel tree and sleep early that evening but the next morning awake from troubled dream he arise before the dawn and take with he provision for five day set out through the forest northwards towards the marsh for some hour he move through the gloom of the forest and when he emerge from it the sun be above the horizon shine on pool of water in the waste land presently he see the claw-mark of tharagavverug deep in the soil and the track of he tail between they like a furrow in a field then leothric follow the track till he hear the bronze heart of tharagavverug before he boom like a bell and tharagavverug it be the hour when he take the first meal of the day be move towards a village with he heart toll and all the people of the village be come out to meet he as it be they wont to do for they abide not the suspense of await tharagavverug and of hear he sniff brazenly as he go from door to door ponder slowly in he metal mind what habitant he should choose and none dare to flee for in the day when the villager flee from tharagavverug he have choose he victim would track he tirelessly like a doom nothing avail they against tharagavverug once they climb the tree when he come but tharagavverug go up to one arch he back and lean over slightly and rasp against the trunk until it fall and when leothric come near tharagavverug see he out of one of he small steel eye and come towards he leisurely and the echo of he heart swirl up through he open mouth and leothric step sideways from he onset and come between he and the village and smite he on the nose and the blow of the stick make a dint in the soft lead and tharagavverug swing clumsily away utter one fearful cry like the sound of a great church bell that have become possess of a soul that flutter upward from the tomb at night -- a evil soul give the bell a voice then he attack leothric snarl and again leothric leap aside and smite he on the nose with he stick tharagavverug utter like a bell howl and whenever the dragon-crocodile attack he or turn towards the village leothric smite he again so all day long leothric drive the monster with a stick and he drive he farther and farther from he prey with he heart toll angrily and he voice cry out for pain towards evening tharagavverug cease to snap at leothric but run before he to avoid the stick for he nose be sore and shine and in the gloam the villager come out and dance to cymbal and psaltery when tharagavverug hear the cymbal and psaltery hunger and anger come upon he and he feel as some lord might feel who be hold by force from the banquet in he own castle and hear the creaking spit go round and round and the good meat crackle on it and all that night he attack leothric fiercely and oft-time nearly catch he in the darkness for he gleaming eye of steel could see as well by night as by day and leothric give ground slowly till the dawn and when the light come they be near the village again yet not so near to it as they have be when they encounter for leothric drive tharagavverug farther in the day than tharagavverug have force he back in the night then leothric drive he again with he stick till the hour come when it be the custom of the dragon-crocodile to find he man one third of he man he would eat at the time he find he and the rest at noon and evening but when the hour come for find he man a great fierceness come on tharagavverug and he grab rapidly at leothric but could not seize he and for a long while neither of they would retire but at last the pain of the stick on he leaden nose overcome the hunger of the dragon-crocodile and he turn from it howl from that moment tharagavverug weaken all that day leothric drive he with he stick and at night both hold they ground and when the dawn of the third day be come the heart of tharagavverug beat slower and fainter it be as though a tired man be ring a bell once tharagavverug nearly seize a frog but leothric snatch it away just in time towards noon the dragon-crocodile lay still for a long while and leothric stand near he and lean on he trusty stick he be very tired and sleepless but have more leisure now for eat he provision with tharagavverug the end be come fast and in the afternoon he breath come hoarsely rasp in he throat it be as the sound of many huntsman blow blast on horn and towards evening he breath come faster but fainter like the sound of a hunt go furious to the distance and die away and he make desperate rush towards the village but leothric still leap about he batter he leaden nose scarce audible now at all be the sound of he heart : it be like a church bell toll beyond hill for the death of some one unknown and far away then the sun set and flame in the village window and a chill go over the world and in some small garden a woman sing and tharagavverug lift up he head and starve and he life go from he invulnerable body and leothric lay down beside he and sleep and later in the starlight the villager come out and carry leothric sleep to the village all praise he in whisper as they go they lay he down upon a couch in a house and dance outside in silence without psaltery or cymbal and the next day rejoice to allathurion they haul the dragon-crocodile and leothric go with they hold he battered staff and a tall broad man who be smith of allathurion make a great furnace and melted tharagavverug away till only sacnoth be leave gleam among the ash then he take one of the small eye that have be chisel out and file a edge on sacnoth and gradually the steel eye wear away facet by facet but ere it be quite go it have sharpen redoubtably sacnoth but the other eye they set in the butt of the hilt and it gleam there bluely and that night leothric arise in the dark and take the sword and go westwards to find gaznak and he go through the dark forest till the dawn and all the morning and till the afternoon but in the afternoon he come into the open and see in the midst of the land where no man goeth the fortress of gaznak mountainous before he little more than a mile away and leothric saw that the land be marsh and desolate and the fortress go up all white out of it with many buttress and be broad below but narrow higher up and be full of gleaming window with the light upon they and near the top of it a few white cloud be float but above they some of its pinnacle reappear then leothric advance into the marsh and the eye of tharagavverug look out warily from the hilt of sacnoth for tharagavverug have know the marsh well and the sword nudge leothric to the right or pull he to the leave away from the dangerous place and so bring he safely to the fortress wall and in the wall stand door like precipice of steel all stud with boulder of iron and above every window be terrible gargoyle of stone and the name of the fortress shone on the wall writ large in letter of brass : ` the fortress unvanquishable save for sacnoth ' then leothric draw and reveal sacnoth and all the gargoyle grin and the grin go flicker from face to face right up into the cloud-abiding gable and when sacnoth be reveal and all the gargoyle grin it be like the moonlight emerge from a cloud to look for the first time upon a field of blood and pass swiftly over the wet face of the slay that lie together in the horrible night then leothric advanced towards a door and it be mightier than the marble quarry sacremona from which of old man cut enormous slab to build the abbey of the holy tear day after day they wrench out the very rib of the hill until the abbey be build and it be more beautiful than anything in stone then the priest bless sacremona and it have rest and no more stone be ever take from it to build the house of man and the hill stand look southwards lonely in the sunlight deface by that mighty scar so vast be the door of steel and the name of the door be the porte resonant the way of egress for war then leothric smote upon the porte resonant with sacnoth and the echo of sacnoth go ring through the hall and all the dragon in the fortress bark and when the baying of the remotest dragon have faintly join in the tumult a window open far up among the cloud below the twilit gable and a woman scream and far away in hell she father hear she and know that she doom be come and leothric go on smite terribly with sacnoth and the gray steel of the porte resonant the way of egress for war that be temper to resist the sword of the world come away in ring slice then leothric hold sacnoth in he hand go in through the hole that he have hew in the door and come into the unlit cavernous hall a elephant flee trumpet and leothric stand still hold sacnoth when the sound of the foot of the elephant have die away in the remoter corridor nothing more stir and the cavernous hall be still presently the darkness of the distant hall become musical with the sound of bell all come nearer and nearer still leothric wait in the dark and the bell ring louder and louder echo through the hall and there appear a procession of man on camel ride two by two from the interior of the fortress and they be arm with scimitar of assyrian make and be all clothe with mail and chain-mail hung from they helmet about they face and flap as the camel move and they all halt before leothric in the cavernous hall and the camel bell clang and stop and the leader say to leothric : ` the lord gaznak have desire to see you die before he be please to come with we and we can discourse by the way of the manner in which the lord gaznak have desire to see you die ' and as he say this he unwind a chain of iron that be coil upon he saddle and leothric answer : ' i would fain go with you for i be come to slay gaznak ' then all the camel-guard of gaznak laugh hideously disturb the vampire that be asleep in the measureless vault of the roof and the leader say : ` the lord gaznak be immortal save for sacnoth and weareth armor that be proof even against sacnoth himself and have a sword the second most terrible in the world ' then leothric say : ' i be the lord of the sword sacnoth ' and he advance towards the camel-guard of gaznak and sacnoth lift up and down in he hand as though stir by a exultant pulse then the camel-guard of gaznak flee and the rider lean forward and smite they camel with whip and they go away with a great clamor of bell through colonnade and corridor and vaulted hall and scatter into the inner darkness of the fortress when the last sound of they have die away leothric be in doubt which way to go for the camel-guard be disperse in many direction so he go straight on till he come to a great stairway in the midst of the hall then leothric set he foot in the middle of a wide step and climb steadily up the stairway for five minute little light be there in the great hall through which leothric ascend for it only enter through arrow slit here and there and in the world outside evening be wane fast the stairway lead up to two folding door and they stand a little ajar and through the crack leothric enter and try to continue straight on but could get no farther for the whole room seem to be full of festoon of rope which swing from wall to wall and be loop and drape from the ceiling the whole chamber be thick and black with they they be soft and light to the touch like fine silk but leothric be unable to break any one of they and though they swing away from he as he press forward yet by the time he have go three yard they be all about he like a heavy cloak then leothric step back and draw sacnoth and sacnoth divide the rope without a sound and without a sound the sever piece fall to the floor leothric go forward slowly move sacnoth in front of he up and down as he go when he be come into the middle of the chamber suddenly as he part with sacnoth a great hammock of strand he see a spider before he that be larger than a ram and the spider look at he with eye that be little but in which there be much sin and say : ` who be you that spoil the labor of year all do to the honor of satan ' and leothric answer : ' i be leothric son of lorendiac ' and the spider say : ' i will make a rope at once to hang you with ' then leothric part another bunch of strand and come nearer to the spider as he sit make he rope and the spider look up from he work say : ` what be that sword which be able to sever my rope ' and leothric say : ` it be sacnoth ' thereat the black hair that hang over the face of the spider part to leave and right and the spider frowned then the hair fall back into its place and hide everything except the sin of the little eye which go on gleam lustfully in the dark but before leothric could reach he he climb away with he hand go up by one of he rope to a lofty rafter and there sit growl but clear he way with sacnoth leothric pass through the chamber and come to the farther door and the door be shut and the handle far up out of he reach he hew he way through it with sacnoth in the same way as he have through the porte resonant the way of egress for war and so leothric come into a well-lit chamber where queen and prince be banquet together all at a great table and thousand of candle be glowing all about and they light shone in the wine that the prince drink and on the huge gold candelabrum and the royal face be irradiant with the glow and the white table-cloth and the silver plate and the jewel in the hair of the queen each jewel have a historian all to itself who write no other chronicle all he day between the table and the door there stand two hundred footman in two row of one hundred face one another nobody look at leothric as he enter through the hole in the door but one of the prince ask a question of a footman and the question be pass from mouth to mouth by all the hundred footman till it come to the last one nearest leothric and he say to leothric without look at he : ` what do you seek here ' and leothric answer : ' i seek to slay gaznak ' and footman to footman repeat all the way to the table : ` he seek to slay gaznak ' and another question come down the line of footman : ` what be you name ' and the line that stand opposite take he answer back then one of the prince say : ` take he away where we shall not hear he scream ' and footman repeat it to footman till it come to the last two and they advance to seize leothric then leothric show to they he sword say ` this be sacnoth ' and both of they say to the man nearest : ` it be sacnoth ' then scream and flee away and two by two all up the double line footman to footman repeat ` it be sacnoth ' then scream and flee till the last two give the message to the table and all the rest have go hurriedly then arise the queen and prince and flee out of the chamber and the goodly table when they be all go look small and disorderly and awry and to leothric ponder in the desolate chamber by what door he should pass onwards there come from far away the sound of music and he know that it be the magical musician play to gaznak while he sleep then leothric walk towards the distant music pass out by the door opposite to the one through which he have cleave he entrance and so pass into a chamber vast as the other in which be many woman weirdly beautiful and they all ask he of he quest and when they hear that it be to slay gaznak they all besought he to tarry among they say that gaznak be immortal save for sacnoth and also that they have need of a knight to protect they from the wolf that rush round and round the wainscot all the night and sometimes break in upon they through the moulder oak perhaps leothric have be tempt to tarry have they be human woman for theirs be a strange beauty but he perceive that instead of eye they have little flame that flicker in they socket and know they to be the fevered dream of gaznak therefore he say : ' i have a business with gaznak and with sacnoth ' and pass on through the chamber and at the name of sacnoth those woman scream and the flame of they eye sink low and dwindle to spark and leothric leave they and hew with sacnoth pass through the farther door outside he feel the night air on he face and find that he stand upon a narrow way between two abyss to left and right of he as far as he could see the wall of the fortress end in a profound precipice though the roof still stretch above he and before he lay the two abyss full of star for they cut they way through the whole earth and reveal the under sky and thread its course between they go the way and it slope upward and its side be sheer and beyond the abyss where the way lead up to the farther chamber of the fortress leothric hear the musician play they magical tune so he step on to the way which be scarcely a stride in width and move along it hold sacnoth naked and to and fro beneath he in each abyss whir the wing of vampire pass up and down all give praise to satan as they fly presently he perceive the dragon thok lie upon the way pretend to sleep and he tail hang down into one of the abyss and leothric go towards he and when he be quite close thok rush at leothric and he smite deep with sacnoth and thok tumble into the abyss scream and he limb make a whir in the darkness as he fall and he fall till he scream sound no louder than a whistle and then could be hear no more once or twice leothric see a star blink for a instant and reappear again and this momentary eclipse of a few star be all that remain in the world of the body of thok and lunk the brother of thok who have lie a little behind he see that this must be sacnoth and flee lumber away and all the while that he walk between the abyss the mighty vault of the roof of the fortress still stretch over leothric 's head all fill with gloom now when the further side of the abyss come into view leothric see a chamber that open with innumerable arch upon the twin abyss and the pillar of the arch go away into the distance and vanish in the gloom to left and right far down the dim precipice on which the pillar stand he could see window small and closely bar and between the bar there show at moment and disappear again thing that i shall not speak of there be no light here except for the great southern star that shine below the abyss and here and there in the chamber through the arch light that move furtively without the sound of footfall then leothric step from the way and enter the great chamber even to himself he seem but a tiny dwarf as he walk under one of those colossal arch the last faint light of evening flicker through a window paint in sombre color commemorate the achievement of satan upon earth high up in the wall the window stand and the streaming light of candle lower down move stealthily away other light there be none save for a faint blue glow from the steel eye of tharagavverug that peer restlessly about it from the hilt of sacnoth heavily in the chamber hang the clammy odour of a large and deadly beast leothric move forward slowly with the blade of sacnoth in front of he feel for a foe and the eye in the hilt of it look out behind nothing stir if anything lurk behind the pillar of the colonnade that hold aloft the roof it neither breathe nor move the music of the magical musician sound from very near suddenly the great door on the far side of the chamber open to left and right for some moment leothric saw nothing move and wait clutch sacnoth then wong bongerok come towards he breathe this be the last and faithfullest guard of gaznak and come from slobber just now he master 's hand more as a child than a dragon be gaznak wont to treat he give he often in he finger tender piece of man all smoking from he table long and low be wong bongerok and subtle about the eye and he come breathing malice against leothric out of he faithful breast and behind he roar the armoury of he tail as when sailor drag the cable of the anchor all rattle down the deck and well wong bongerok know that he now face sacnoth for it have be he wont to prophesy quietly to himself for many year as he lay curl at the foot of gaznak and leothric step forward into the blast of he breath and lift sacnoth to strike but when sacnoth be lift up the eye of tharagavverug in the butt of the hilt behold the dragon and perceive he subtlety for he open he mouth wide and reveal to leothric the rank of he sabre tooth and he leather gum flap upward but while leothric make to smite at he head he shoot forward scorpion-wise over he head the length of he armored tail all this the eye perceive in the hilt of sacnoth who smite suddenly sideways not with the edge smite sacnoth for have he do so the sever end of the tail have still come hurtle on as some pine tree that the avalanche have hurl point foremost from the cliff right through the broad breast of some mountaineer so have leothric be transfix but sacnoth smote sideways with the flat of he blade and send the tail whiz over leothric 's left shoulder and it rasp upon he armor as it go and leave a groove upon it sideways then at leothric smite the foiled tail of wong bongerok and sacnoth parry and the tail go shriek up the blade and over leothric 's head then leothric and wong bongerok fight sword to tooth and the sword smite as only sacnoth can and the evil faithful life of wong bongerok the dragon go out through the wide wound then leothric walk on past that dead monster and the armored body still quiver a little and for a while it be like all the ploughshare in a county work together in one field behind tired and struggle horse then the quiver cease and wong bongerok lay still to rust and leothric go on to the open gate and sacnoth drip quietly along the floor by the open gate through which wong bongerok have enter leothric come into a corridor echo with music this be the first place from which leothric could see anything above he head for hitherto the roof have ascend to mountainous height and have stretch indistinct in the gloom but along the narrow corridor hang huge bell low and near to he head and the width of each brazen bell be from wall to wall and they be one behind the other and as he pass under each the bell utter and its voice be mournful and deep like to the voice of a bell speak to a man for the last time when he be newly dead each bell utter once as leothric come under it and they voice sound solemnly and wide apart at ceremonious interval for if he walk slow these bell come closer together and when he walk swiftly they move farther apart and the echo of each bell toll above he head go on before he whisper to the other once when he stop they all jangle angrily till he go on again between these slow and boding note come the sound of the magical musician they be play a dirge now very mournfully and at last leothric come to the end of the corridor of the bell and behold there a small black door and all the corridor behind he be full of the echo of the toll and they all mutter to one another about the ceremony and the dirge of the musician come float slowly through they like a procession of foreign elaborate guest and all of they bode ill to leothric the black door open at once to the hand of leothric and he find himself in the open air in a wide court pave with marble high over it shine the moon summon there by the hand of gaznak there gaznak sleep and around he sit he magical musician all playing upon string and even sleep gaznak be clothe in armor and only he wrist and face and neck be bare but the marvel of that place be the dream of gaznak for beyond the wide court sleep a dark abyss and into the abyss there pour a white cascade of marble stairway and widen out below into terrace and balcony with fair white statue on they and descend again in a wide stairway and come to lower terrace in the dark where swart uncertain shape go to and fro all these be the dream of gaznak and issue from he mind and become gleaming marble pass over the edge of the abyss as the musician play and all the while out of the mind of gaznak lull by that strange music go spire and pinnacle beautiful and slender ever ascend skywards and the marble dream move slow in time to the music when the bell toll and the musician play they dirge ugly gargoyle come out suddenly all over the spire and pinnacle and great shadow pass swiftly down the step and terrace and there be hurry whisper in the abyss when leothric step from the black door gaznak open he eye he look neither to leave nor right but stand up at once face leothric then the magician play a deathspell on they string and there arise a hum along the blade of sacnoth as he turn the spell aside when leothric drop not down and they hear the humming of sacnoth the magician arise and flee all wail as they go upon they string then gaznak draw out scream from its sheath the sword that be the mightiest in the world except for sacnoth and slowly walk towards leothric and he smile as he walk although he own dream have foretell he doom and when leothric and gaznak come together each look at each and neither speak a word but they smite both at once and they sword meet and each sword know the other and from whence he come and whenever the sword of gaznak smote on the blade of sacnoth it rebound gleam as hail from off slate roof but whenever it fall upon the armor of leothric it strip it off in sheet and upon gaznak 's armor sacnoth fall oft and furiously but ever he come back snarl leave no mark behind and as gaznak fight he hold he left hand hover close over he head presently leothric smote fair and fiercely at he enemy 's neck but gaznak clutch he own head by the hair lift it high aloft and sacnoth go cleave through a empty space then gaznak replace he head upon he neck and all the while fight nimbly with he sword and again and again leothric sweep with sacnoth at gaznak 's bearded neck and ever the left hand of gaznak be quicker than the stroke and the head go up and the sword rush vainly under it and the ringing fight go on till leothric 's armor lay all round he on the floor and the marble be splash with he blood and the sword of gaznak be notch like a saw from meet the blade of sacnoth still gaznak stand unwounded and smile still at last leothric look at the throat of gaznak and aim with sacnoth and again gaznak lift he head by the hair but not at he throat fly sacnoth for leothric strike instead at the lift hand and through the wrist of it go sacnoth whir as a scythe go through the stem of a single flower and bleed the sever hand fall to the floor and at once blood spurt from the shoulder of gaznak and drip from the fall head and the tall pinnacle go down into the earth and the wide fair terrace all roll away and the court be go like the dew and a wind come and the colonnade drift thence and all the colossal hall of gaznak fall and the abyss close up suddenly as the mouth of a man who have tell a tale will for ever speak no more then leothric look around he in the marsh where the night mist be pass away and there be no fortress nor sound of dragon or mortal only beside he lay a old man wizen and evil and dead whose head and hand be sever from he body and gradually over the wide land the dawn be come up and ever grow in beauty as it come like to the peal of a organ play by a master 's hand grow louder and lovelier as the soul of the master warm and at last give praise with all its mighty voice then the bird sing and leothric go homeward and leave the marsh and come to the dark wood and the light of the dawn ascend light he upon he way and into allathurion he come ere noon and with he bring the evil wizened head and the people rejoice and they night of trouble cease \* \* \* \* \* \* \* this be the tale of the vanquishing of the fortress unvanquishable save for sacnoth and of its pass away as it be tell and believe by those who love the mystic day of old other have say and vainly claim to prove that a fever come to allathurion and go away and that this same fever drive leothric into the marsh by night and make he dream there and act violently with a sword and other again say that there have be no town of allathurion and that leothric never live peace to they the gardener have gather up this autumn 's leaf who shall see they again or who wot of they and who shall say what have befall in the day of long ago the lord of city i come one day upon a road that wander so aimlessly that it be suit to my mood so i follow it and it lead I presently among deep wood somewhere in the midst of they autumn hold he court sit wreathe with gorgeous garland and it be the day before he annual festival of the dance of leave the courtly festival upon which hungry winter rush mob-like and there arise the furious cry of the north wind triumph and all the splendor and grace of the wood be go and autumn flee away discrowned and forget and never again return other autumn arise other autumn and fall before other winter a road lead away to the left but my road go straight on the road to the left have a trodden appearance there be wheel track on it and it seem the correct way to take it look as if no one could have any business with the road that lead straight on and up the hill therefore i go straight on and up the hill and here and there on the road grow blade of grass undisturbed in the repose and hush that the road have earn from go up and down the world for you can go by this road as you can go by all road to london to lincoln to the north of scotland to the west of wale and to wrellisford where road end presently the wood end and i come to the open field and at the same moment to the top of the hill and see the high place of somerset and the downs of wilt spread out along the horizon suddenly i see underneath I the village of wrellisford with no sound in its street but the voice of the wrelli roaring as he tumble over a weir above the village so i follow my road down over the crest of the hill and the road become more languid as i descend and less and less concerned with the care of a highway here a spring break out in the middle of it and here another the road never heed a stream run right across it still it straggle on suddenly it give up the minimum property that a road should possess and renounce its connection with high street its lineage of piccadilly shrink to one side and become a unpretentious footpath then it lead I to the old bridge over the stream and thus i come to wrellisford and find after travel in many land a village with no wheel track in its street on the other side of the bridge my friend the road struggle a few yard up a grassy slope and there cease over all the village hang a great stillness with the roar of the wrelli cut right across it and there come occasionally the bark of a dog that keep watch over the broken stillness and over the sanctity of that untravelled road that terrible and waste fever that unlike so many plague come not from the east but from the west the fever of hurry have not come here -- only the wrelli hurry on he eternal quest but it be a calm and placid hurry that give one time for song it be in the early afternoon and nobody be about either they work beyond the mysterious valley that nurse wrellisford and hide it from the world or else they seclude themselves within they old-time house that be roof with tile of stone i sit down upon the old stone bridge and watch the wrelli who seem to I to be the only traveller that come from far away into this village where road end and pass on beyond it and yet the wrelli come singing out of eternity and tarry for a very little while in the village where road end and pass on into eternity again and so surely do all that dwell in wrellisford i wonder as i lean upon the bridge in what place the wrelli would first find the sea whether as he wind idly through meadow on he long quest he would suddenly behold he and leap down over some rocky cliff take to he at once the message of the hill or whether widen slowly into some grand and tidal estuary he would take he waste of water to the sea and the might of the river should meet with the might of the wave like to two emperor clothe in gleaming mail meeting midway between two host of war and the little wrelli would become a haven for return ship and a setting-out place for adventurous man a little beyond the bridge there stand a old mill with a ruin roof and a small branch of the wrelli rush through its emptiness shout like a boy playing alone in a corridor of some desolate house the mill-wheel be go but there lay there still great bar and wheel and cog the bone of some dead industry i know not what industry be once lord in that house i know not what retinue of worker mourn he now i only know who be lord there today in all those empty chamber for as soon as i enter i see a whole wall drape with he marvellous black tapestry without price because inimitable and too delicate to pass from hand to hand among merchant i look at the wonderful complexity of its infinite thread my finger sink into it for more than a inch without feel the touch so black it be and so carefully work sombrely cover the whole of the wall that it might have be work to commemorate the death of all that ever live there as indeed it be i look through a hole in the wall into a inner chamber where a worn-out drive band go among many wheel and there this priceless inimitable stuff not merely clothe the wall but hang from bar and ceiling in beautiful drapery in marvellous festoon nothing be ugly in this desolate house for the busy artist 's soul of its present lord have beautify everything in its desolation it be the unmistakable work of the spider in whose house i be and the house be utterly desolate but for he and silent but for the roar of the wrelli and the shout of the little stream then i turn homewards and as i go up and over the hill and lose the sight of the village i see the road whiten and harden and gradually broaden out till the track of wheel appear and it go afar to take the young man of wrellisford into the wide way of the earth -- to the new west and the mysterious east and into the troubled south and that night when the house be still and sleep be far off hush hamlet and give ease to city my fancy wander up that aimless road and come suddenly to wrellisford and it seem to I that the travel of so many people for so many year between wrellisford and john o ' groat 's talk to one another as they go or mutter alone have give the road a voice and it seem to I that night that the road speak to the river by wrellisford bridge speak with the voice of many pilgrim and the road say to the river : ' i rest here how be it with you ' and the river who be always speak say : ' i rest nowhere from do the work of the world i carry the murmur of inner land to the sea and to the abyss voice of the hill ' ` it be i ' say the road ` that do the work of the world and take from city to city the rumor of each there be nothing higher than man and the making of city what do you do for man ' and the river say : ` beauty and song be higher than man i carry the news seaward of the first song of the thrush after the furious retreat of winter northward and the first timid anemone learn from I that she be safe and that spring have truly come oh but the song of all the bird in spring be more beautiful than man and the first come of the hyacinth more delectable than he face when spring be fall upon the day of summer i carry away with mournful joy at night petal by petal the rhododendron 's bloom no light procession of purple king be nigh so fair as that no beautiful death of well-beloved man have such a glory of forlornness and i bear far away the pink and white petal of the apple-blossom 's youth when the laborious time come for he work in the world and for the bearing of apple and i be robed each day and every night anew with the beauty of heaven and i make lovely vision of the tree but man what be man in the ancient parliament of the elder hill when the gray one speak together they say nought of man but concern themselves only with they brethren the star or when they wrap themselves in purple cloak at evening they lament some old irreparable wrong or utter some mountain hymn all mourn the set of sun ' ` you beauty ' say the road ` and the beauty of the sky and of the rhododendron blossom and of spring live only in the mind of man and except in the mind of man the mountain have no voice nothing be beautiful that have not be see by man 's eye or if you rhododendron blossom be beautiful for a moment it soon wither and be drown and spring soon pass away beauty can only live on in the mind of man i bring think into the mind of man swiftly from distant place every day i know the telegraph -- i know he well he and i have walk for hundred of mile together there be no work in the world except for man and the making of he city i take wares to and fro from city to city ' ` my little stream in the field there ' say the river ` use to make wares in that house for awhile once ' ` ah ' say the road ' i remember but i bring cheaper one from distant city nothing be of any importance but make city for man ' ' i know so little about he ' say the river ` but i have a great deal of work to do -- i have all this water to send down to the sea and then tomorrow or next day all the leaf of autumn will be come this way it will be very beautiful the sea be a very very wonderful place i know all about it i have hear shepherd boy singing of it and sometimes before a storm the gull come up it be a place all blue and shine and full of pearl and have in it coral island and isle of spice and storm and galleon and the bone of drake the sea be much greater than man when i come to the sea he will know that i have work well for he but i must hurry for i have much to do this bridge delay I a little some day i will carry it away ' ` oh you must not do that ' say the road ` oh not for a long time ' say the river ` some century perhaps -- and i have much to do besides there be my song to sing for instance and that alone be more beautiful than any noise that man make ' ` all work be for man ' say the road ` and for the building of city there be no beauty or romance or mystery in the sea except for the man that sail abroad upon it and for those that stay at home and dream of they as for you song it ring night and morning year in year out in the ear of man that be bear in wrellisford at night it be part of they dream at morning it be the voice of day and so it become part of they soul but the song be not beautiful in itself i take these man with you song in they soul up over the edge of the valley and a long way off beyond and i be a strong and dusty road up there and they go with you song in they soul and turn it into music and gladden city but nothing be the work of the world except work for man ' ' i wish i be quite sure about the work of the world ' say the stream ' i wish i know for certain for whom we work i feel almost sure that it be for the sea he be very great and beautiful i think that there can be no greater master than the sea i think that some day he may be so full of romance and mystery and sound of sheep bell and murmur of mist-hidden hill which we stream shall have bring he that there will be no more music or beauty leave in the world and all the world will end and perhaps the stream shall gather at the last we all together to the sea or perhaps the sea will give we at the last unto each one he own again give back all that he have garner in the year -- the little petal of the apple-blossom and the mourn one of the rhododendron and we old vision of the tree and sky so many memory have leave the hill but who may say for who know the tide of the sea ' ` be sure that it be all for man ' say the road ` for man and the making of city ' something have come near on utterly silent foot ` peace peace ' it say ` you disturb the queenly night who have come into this valley be a guest in my dark hall let we have a end to this discussion ' it be the spider who speak ` the work of the world be the making of city and palace but it be not for man what be man he only prepare my city for I and mellow they all he work be ugly he richest tapestry be coarse and clumsy he be a noisy idler he only protect I from mine enemy the wind and the beautiful work in my city the curving outline and the delicate weaving be all mine ten year to a hundred it take to build a city for five or six hundred more it mellow and be prepare for I then i inhabit it and hide away all that be ugly and draw beautiful line about it to and fro there be nothing so beautiful as city and palace they be the loveliest place in the world because they be the stillest and so most like the star they be noisy at first for a little before i come to they they have ugly corner not yet round off and coarse tapestry and then they become ready for I and my exquisite work and be quite silent and beautiful and there i entertain the regal night when they come there jewel with star and all they train of silence and regale they with costly dust already nod in a city that i wot of a lonely sentinel whose lord be dead who grow too old and sleepy to drive away the gathering silence that infest the street tomorrow i go to see if he be still at he post for I babylon be build and rocky tyre and still man build my city all the work of the world be the making of city and all of they i inherit ' the doom of la traviata evening steal up out of mysterious land and come down on the street of pari and the thing of the day withdraw themselves and hide away and the beautiful city be strangely altered and with it the heart of man and with light and music and in silence and in the dark the other life arise the life that know the night and dark cat creep from the house and move to silent place and dim street become haunt with dusk shape at this hour in a mean house near to the moulin rouge la traviata die and she death be bring to she by she own sin and not by the year of god but the soul of la traviata drift blindly about the street where she have sin till it strike against the wall of notre dame de paris thence it rush upwards as the sea mist when it beat against a cliff and stream away to paradise and be there judge and it seem to I as i watch from my place of dream when la travia come and stand before the seat of judgment that cloud come rush up from the far paradisal hill and gather together over the head of god and become one black cloud and the cloud move swiftly as shadow of the night when a lantern be swing in the hand and more and more cloud rush up and ever more and more and as they gather the cloud a little above the head of god become no larger but only grow blacker and blacker and the halo of the saint settle lower upon they head and narrow and become pale and the singing of the choir of the seraph falter and sink low and the converse of the bless suddenly cease then a stern look come into the face of god so that the seraph turn away and leave he and the saint then god command and seven great angel rise up slowly through the cloud that carpet paradise and there be pity on they face and they eye be close then god pronounced judgment and the light of paradise go out and the azure crystal window that look towards the world and the window rouge and verd become dark and colourless and i see no more presently the seven great angel come out by one of heaven 's gate and set they face hellward and four of they carry the young soul of la traviata and one of they go on before and one of they follow behind these six trod with mighty stride the long and dusty road that be name the way of the damned but the seventh fly above they all the way and the light of the fire of hell that be hide from the six by the dust of that dreadful road flare on the feather of he breast presently the seven angel as they sweep hellward utter speech ` she be very young ' they say and ` she be very beautiful ' they say and they look long at the soul of la traviata look not at the stain of sin but at that portion of she soul wherewith she have love she sister a long while dead who flit now about a orchard on one of heaven 's hill with a low sunlight ever on she face who commune daily with the saint when they pass that way go to bless the dead from heaven 's utmost edge and as they look long at the beauty of all that remain beautiful in she soul they say : ` it be but a young soul ' and they would have take she to one of heaven 's hill and would there have give she a cymbal and a dulcimer but they know that the paradisal gate be clamp and bar against la travia and they would have take she to a valley in the world where there be a great many flower and a loud sound of stream where bird be sing always and church bell ring on sabbath only this they dare not do so they sweep onward nearer and nearer hell but when they be come quite close and the glare be on they face and they see the gate already divide and prepare to open outwards they say : ` hell be a terrible city and she be tire of city ' then suddenly they drop she by the side of the road and wheel and fly away but into a great pink flower that be horrible and lovely grow the soul of la traviata and it have in it two eye but no eyelid and it stare constantly into the face of all the passer-by that go along the dusty road to hell and the flower grow in the glare of the light of hell and withered but could not die only one petal turn back towards the heavenly hill as a ivy leaf turn outwards to the day and in the soft and silvery light of paradise it wither not nor fade but hear at time the commune of the saint come murmur from the distance and sometimes catch the scent of orchard waft from the heavenly hill and feel a faint breeze cool it every evening at the hour when the saint to heaven 's edge go forth to bless the dead but the lord arise with he sword and scatter he disobedient angel as a thresher scatter chaff on the dry land over the marsh hang the gorgeous night with all he wander band of nomad star and he whole host of still one blink and watch over the safe dry land to eastward gray and cold the first clear pallor of dawn be come up above the head of the immortal god then as they near at last the safety of the dry land love look at the man whom he have lead for so long through the marsh and see that he hair be white for it be shine in the pallor of the dawn then they step together on to the land and the old man sit down weary on the grass for they have wander in the marsh for many year and the light of the gray dawn widen above the head of the god and love say to the old man ' i will leave you now ' and the old man make no answer but weep softly then love be grieve in he little careless heart and he say : ` you must not be sorry that i go nor yet regret I nor care for I at all ' i be a very foolish child and be never kind to you nor friendly i never care for you great thought or for what be good in you but perplexed you by lead you up and down the perilous marsh and i be so heartless that have you perish where i lead you it would have be nought to I and i only stay with you because you be good to play with ` and i be cruel and altogether worthless and not such a one as any should be sorry for when i go or one to be regret or even care for at all ' and still the old man speak not but weep softly and love grieved bitterly in he kindly heart and love say : ` because i be so small my strength have be conceal from you and the evil that i have do but my strength be great and i have use it unjustly often i push you from the causeway through the marsh and care not if you drown often i mocked you and cause other to mock you and often i lead you among those that hate I and laugh when they revenge themselves upon you ` so weep not for there be no kindness in my heart but only murder and foolishness and i be no companion for one so wise as you but be so frivolous and silly that i laugh at you noble dream and hinder all you deed see now you have find I out and now you will send I away and here you will live at ease and undisturbed have noble dream of the immortal god ` see now here be dawn and safety and _ there _ be darkness and peril ' still the old man weep softly then love say : ` be it thus with you ' and he voice be grave now and quiet ` be you so troubled old friend of so many year there be grief in my heart for you old friend of perilous venture i must leave you now but i will send my brother soon to you -- my little brother death and he will come up out of the marsh to you and will not forsake you but will be true to you as i have not be true ' and dawn grow brighter over the immortal god and the old man smile through he tear which glisten wondrously in the increase light but love go down to the night and to the marsh look backward over he shoulder as he go and smile beautifully about he eye and in the marsh whereunto he go in the midst of the gorgeous night and under the wander band of nomad star rise shout of laughter and the sound of the dance and after a while with he face towards the morning death out of the marsh come up tall and beautiful and with a faint smile shadowy on he lip and lift in he arm the lonely man be gentle with he and murmur with he low deep voice a ancient song carry he to the morning to the god end of the project gutenberg ebook of the sword of welleran and other story by lord
