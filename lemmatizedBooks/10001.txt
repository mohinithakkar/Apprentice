the same he be not quite master of he wit and have some fear of a blow from the fool claudius see a mighty man before he see thing look serious and understand that here he have not quite the same pre-eminence as at rome where no one be he equal : the gallic cock be worth most on he own dunghill so this be what he be think to say as far as could be make out : i do hope hercule bravest of all the god that you would take my part with the rest and if i should need a voucher i mean to name you who know I so well do but call it to mind how it be i use to sit in judgment before you temple whole day together during July and August you know what misery i endure there in hear the lawyer plead day and night if you have fall amongst these you may think yourself very strong but you would have find it worse than the sewer of augea : i drain out more filth than you do but since i want -lrb- some page have fall out in which hercule must have be persuade the god be now discuss what hercule tell they -rrb- no wonder you have force you way into the 8 senate house : no bar or bolt can hold against you only do say what species of god you want the fellow to be make a epicurean god he can not be : for they have no trouble and cause none a stoic then how can he be globular as varro say without a head or any other projection there be in he something of the stoic god as i can see now : he have neither heart nor head upon my word if he have ask this boon from saturn he would not have get it though he keep up saturn 's feast all the year round a truly saturnalian prince a likely thing he will get it from jove whom he condemn for incest as far as in he lay : for he kill he son-in-law silanus because silanus have a sister a most charming girl call venus by all the world and he prefer to call she juno why say he i want to know why he own sister read you book stupid : you may go half-way at athen the whole way at alexandrium because the mouse lick meal at rome you say be this creature to mend we crooked way what go on in he own closet he know not -lrb- footnote : perhaps allude to a mock marriage of silius and messalina -rrb- and now he search the region of the sky want to be a god be it not enough that he have a temple in britain that savage worship he and pray to he as a god so that they may find a fool -lrb- footnote : again -lrb- greek : morou -rrb- for -lrb- greek : theou

be so claudius be lead out and the first to be ask he opinion be father janus : he have be make consul elect for the afternoon of the next first of July -lrb- footnote : perhaps a allusion to the shorten of the consul 's term which be do to give more candidate a chance of the honor -rrb- be as shrewd a man as you could find on a summer 's day : for he could see as they say before and behind -lrb- footnote 8 : ii iii 109 allude here to janus 's double face -rrb- he make a eloquent harangue because he life be pass in the forum but too fast for the notary to take down that be why i give no full report of it for i do not want to change the word he use he say a great deal of the majesty of the god and how the honor ought not to be give away to every tom dick or harry once say he it be a great thing to become a god now you have make it a farce therefore that you may not think i be speak against one person instead of the general custom i propose that from this day forward the godhead be give to none of those who eat the fruit of the earth or whom mother earth doth nourish after this bill have be read a third time whosoever be make say or portray to be god i vote he be deliver over to the bogie and at the next public show be flog with a birch amongst the new gladiator the next to be ask be diespiter son of vica pota he also be consul elect and a moneylender by this trade he make a living use to sell rights of citizenship in a small way hercule trip I up to he daintily and tweak he by the ear so he utter he opinion in these word : inasmuch as the bless claudius be akin to the bless augustus and also to the bless augusta he grandmother whom he order to be make a goddess and whereas he far surpass all mortal man in wisdom and see that it be for the public good that there be some one able to join romulus in devour boil turnip i propose that from this day forth bless claudius be a god to enjoy that honor with all its appurtenance in as full a degree as any other before he and that a note to that effect be add to ovid 's metamorphose the meeting be divide and it look as though claudius be to win the day for hercule see he iron be in the fire trot here and trot there say

have a case against he -lrb- at least it be you own if you will be fair -rrb- come tell I bless claudius why of all those you kill both man and woman without a hearing why you do not hear they side of the case first before put they to death where do we find that custom it be not do in heaven look at jupiter : all these year he have be 11 king and never do more than once to break vulcan 's leg `
