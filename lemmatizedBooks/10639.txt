grenville kleiser contents useful phrase paragraph from notable speech useful phrase a further objection to again can we doubt again we have abundant instance alas how often all experience evince that all that i have be state hitherto all that be quite true all this i know well enough all this be unnatural because all we do know be that be i mistaken in this amid so much that be uncertain and again it be to be presume that and finally have not these and further all that i have say and hence it continually happen and hence it be that and here in pass let we notice and here observe that and if i know anything of and if it be further ask why and i sometimes imagine that and i wish also to say that and in fact it be and it be certainly true and it may be admit that and just here we touch the vital point in and let I here again refer to and now it begin to be apparent and now we be naturally bring on to and now we be tell and pursue the subject and so again in this day and so in like manner and strange to say and such i say be and the same be true of and the whole point of these observation be and this be manifestly true any thoughtful man can readily perceive as far as my experience go as for I i say as it be at first it do seem as tho at this very moment there be at time we hear it say be it so be true to you own sense of right believe I it be quite impossible for but all be not do but bear in mind that but by no kind of calculation can we but do not tell I that but further still but here we take we stand but i be not quite sure that but i digress but i do not desire to obtrude a but i recollect that but i shall go still farther but i submit whether it but i will not dwell on but i will not pause to point out but if you look seriously at fact but in any case but in fact there be no reason for but be it in truth so easy to but be it rationally conceivable that but it be fitting i should say but it may be urge if but lest it should still be argue that but let it be once understand that but let we suppose all these but look at the difference but my idea of it be but now i repeat but now lastly let we suppose but now let we turn to but now on the other hand could but now some other thing be to be note but somehow all be change but the question for we be but to go still further but waive this assumption but we dwell too long but we have faith that but what be the motive but what then but with we how changed but why do we speak of but you may say truly but you must remember can there be a better illustration than can you doubt it certainly i do not know compare now the case of do time admit i could show you do anybody believe that do you dream that do not entertain so weak a imagination do not misunderstand I enough have be say of even apart from the vital question of everybody have to say that few people will dispute first sir permit I to observe for instance for instance there surely be for my part i can say that i desire for the sake of clearness for this simple reason for what fortunately i be not oblige from time to time happily for we have the gentleman do have we any right to such a he can not do it heaven forbid hence i repeat it be hence it be that hence too it have often be say here i have to speak of here i wish i could stop here it will be object to I here let I meet one other question history be replete with how be we to explain this how do you account for i acknowledge the force of i admire the indignation which i admit it i admit that if i allude to i be advise that already i be aware that i be distinctly maintain i be expect to hear next i be go to suggest i be in sympathy with i be justified in regard i be lead to make one remark i be mainly concern with i be myself of opinion that i be naturally lead on to speak of i be no friend to i be not argue the i be not ashamed to acknowledge i be not complain of i be not deny that i be not dispose to deny i be not go to attempt to i be not here to defend the i be not insensible of i be not justify the i be not speak of exception i be not try to absolve i be oblige to mention i be perfectly astounded at i be perfectly confident that i be perfectly indifferent concern i be persuade that i be quite certain that i be sanguine that those who i be speak to-night for myself i be sure at least that i be sure you will allow I i be sure you will do I the justice i be tell that the reason i be well aware that i be willing to admit that i appeal to you on behalf of i ask how you be go to i ask myself i ask then as concern the i ask you attention to this point i assume that the argument for i assume then that i beg not to be interrupt here i beg respectfully to differ from i beg to assure you i believe i speak the sentiment of i believe in it as firmly as i believe in the i believe you feel as i feel that i can not believe it i can not but feel that i can not do better than i can not even imagine why i can not therefore agree with i can not very well i can scarcely conceive anything i carry with I no hostile remembrance i certainly do not recommend i come now to observe i come then to this i conclude that it be i confess i can not help agree with i confess my notion be i confess that i like to dwell on i confess truly i dare say i dare say to you i differ very much from i do not absolutely assert i do not believe that i do not blush to acknowledge i do not contend that i do not forget that i do not know on what pretense i do not mean to propose i do not mean to say i do not mistrust the future i do not overlook tho fact that i do not pretend to believe i do not question this i do not stand here before you i do not think it unfair reasoning to i do not vouch for i do not want to argue the question of i do not wish to be partial i do not wish you to suppose that i do not yield to any one i entirely agree upon this point i fear i only need refer to i firmly believe that i grant of course that i grant that there be i grant too of course that i have all along be show i have already allude to i have already say and i repeat it i have always argue that i have another objection to i have appeal to the testimony i have a right to think that i have be interested in hear i have be request to say a word i have hear it say recently i have hitherto be adduce instance i have indict i have listen with pleasure to i have never be able to understand i have never fancy that i have no confidence then in i have no desire in this instance i have no doubt that it be i have only to add that i have read of the i have say that i have so high a respect for i have speak of i have the confident hope that i have the strongest reason for i have to appeal to you i heartily hope and trust i hope i have now make it clear that i hope you will acquit I of i insist that you do not i invite you to consider i know it be not uncommon for i know that there be a difference of i know that this will sound strange i know well the sentiment of i know whereof i speak i leave it to you to say i marvel that i may as well reply i may be tell that i may say further that i may take it for grant i mention they merely i merely indicate i must beg leave to dwell a moment i must fairly tell you that i must now beg to ask i myself feel confident i often wonder i only wish to recognize i pass by that i pass then from the question of i personally doubt whether it i plainly and positively state i point you to i proceed to inquire into i quote from i read but recently a story i really can not think it necessary to i recollect that i rejoice at the change that i remember once when i reply with confidence that i rest my opinion on i say just now i see no objection to i see no reason to doubt i shall ask you one question i shall attempt to show i shall content myself with ask i shall not suffer myself to i shall not undertake i shall presently show i shall sum up what have be say i shall then merely sum up i share the conviction of i should hold myself oblige to i should not like to hold the opinion i speak in the most perfect honesty i speak only for myself i suppose most man will recollect i take leave to say i take the liberty of i think i be right in say i think i can demonstrate that i think it impossible that i think it we duty i think it well not to be dispute that i think on the contrary that i think that this be a great mistake i think these fact show that i think we should be willing to i trust it will not he consider ungenerous i trust we be not the man to i turn now to another reason why i undertake to say i use the word advisedly i venture to assert that i venture to say i venture to think i want to invite you attention to i want to know whether i be astonish to learn i be forcibly strike with one remark i be very much strike with i will allow more than this readily i will answer not by retort but by i will call to mind this i will go no further i will not attempt to note the i will not enter into detail i will not go into the evidence of i will not stop to inquire whether i will show you presently i will speak but a word or two more i will suppose the objection urge i wish i could state i wish to call you attention to i wish to know i wish to say something about i wish to observe that i would not he understand as say i would not indeed say a word to extenuate if any man be to tell I if any one be so short-sighted if i have my share if i hesitate it be because if i insist on this point here if i mistake not the sentiment of if i must give a instance of this if i read the sign of the time aright if i be ask what it be that if other evidence be want if perchance one should say if such a thing be possible if such feeling be ever entertain if such be the fact then if there be a man here if we accept at all the argument if we be conscious of if we find that if we resign ourselves to fact if you want to find out what if you wish the most conclusive proof in a broader and a larger sense in a sense and a very real sense in answer to this singular theory in like manner in order to carry out in proof of this drift toward in proportion as in proportion then in pursuance of these clear and express in say all this i do not forget in something of a parallel in such case in support of this claim in support of what i have be say in the first place in the first place then i say in the first place there be in the last resort in the light of these thing in this connection in this point of view doubtless in this situation let we in this respect they be in view of these fact i say in what i have to say be it fair to say that be it not evident that be it not quite possible that be it say that be not that the common sentiment be there any reason for it afford I unusual pleasure it be but too true that it can scarcely be imagine that it can not be too often repeat it certainly follow then it do not appear to I it have be maintain that it have be more than hint that it have be say and say truly it have sometimes be remark that it be a common observation that it be a curious fact that it be a fact patent to any one that it be a melancholy fact that it be a notorious fact that it be a thing commonly say that it be a very serious matter it be a very serious question it be also to be bear in mind it be amazing that there be any among we it be a additional satisfaction it be a undeniable truth that it be apparent that it be certain that it be certainly not sufficient to say it be difficult to conceive that it be exceedingly unlikely that it be historically certain that it be in effect the reply of it be in quite another kind however it be indeed commonly say it be more difficult to it be necessary to account for it be no more than fitting that it be not a good thing to see it be not a wise thing to it be not allege it be not chiefly however it be not for I here to recall it be not however it be not long since i have occasion it be not my purpose to discuss it be not necessary that i define it be not propose to it be not surprize that it be not to be deny that it be not tell traditionally it be not true that it be not wonderful that it be observable enough it be of little consequence it be of importance that it be of very little importance what it be quite true that it be related of it be singular that it be the most extraordinary thing that it be to my mind a it be true indeed that it be well know that it be well that we clearly apprehend it be wholly unnecessary it be worthy of remark it look to I to be it may be a matter of doubt it may be show that it may be suggest that it may be suppose that it may in a measure be true that it may not be improper for I to suggest it must be bear in mind that it must be confest that it must be recollect that it need hardly be say that it remain for we to consider it remain to it remain to be show that it remind I of a anecdote it seem a truism to say it seem now to be generally admit it should also be remember that it should be remember it so happen that it be my good fortune it be not so it be under these circumstance it be foolish to talk of it be rash to say it will be easy to cite it will be find in the second place it will be observe also that it will be well to recall it will not surely be object it would be mislead to say it would be no less impracticable to it would be vain to seek it would do no good to repeat it would seem that largely i have no doubt it be due let it be repeat let it be for a instant suppose let I add that let I ask who there be among we let I explain myself by say let I illustrate let I instance in one thing only let I put the subject before you let I say one word further let I tell you let I tell you a very interesting story let no one suppose that let the truth be say outright let these instance suffice let we bear in mind that let we consider that let we go a step further let we say frankly let we see whether let we stand together let we look a little at let we take a example in let we take first of all make no mistake man be often doubtful about moreover i be sure moreover i believe that much have be say of late about my antagonism be only arouse when my answer be that my belief be that my own opinion be nay further than this need i speak of neither be it true that nevertheless we must admit next i give you the opinion of next i observe that no man who listen to I underrate no matter what no no no objection can be bring against the no one realize this more no one will with justice say no one will question no one would take the pain to challenge the no wonder then that nobody really doubt that nor be i believe I so arrogant as nor can we imagine that nor be this surprize nor lastly do this not a few person demand not many word be require to show not quite so not so here nothing be more certain than nothing less now after what i have say now apply this to now do you observe what follow from now for one moment let we now i have do now i proceed to examine now i want to ask whether now it be evident now let we observe what now mark it now on the other hand let I now perhaps you will ask I now we come to the question observe if you please that occasionally it be whisper that of course it will be say that of no less import be of the final issue i have no doubt on the contrary on the one hand on the other hand on the other hand you will see on the whole then i observe one word more and i have do once more how else could one fact be clear only a few day ago we position be that we position be unquestionable over and over again it have be show that perhaps sir i be mistake in perhaps the reason of this may be permit I to add another circumstance permit I to remind you please remember that if readily we admit that since you have suffer I to so far be clear but so it come naturally about so much for some man think indeed that some person have exprest surprize that something of extravagance there may be in strange as it may seem strictly speak it be not such a avowal be not such be not my theory such be steadfastly my opinion that such be the truth such then be the answer whir i make to suppose for instance surely i do not misinterpret the spirit surely it be preposterous surely then surely this be good and clear reasoning take again the case of take the instance of that be quite obvious that we might have do the audacity of the statement be the charge be false the conclusion be irresistible the contempt that be cast the fact be substantially true the fact be that there be not the fact need not be conceal that the fact be before we all the first point to be ascertain be the language be perfectly plain the least desirable form of the more i consider this question the plea serve well with the point i wish to bring out the problem that present itself be the question at issue be primarily the question be not the question present be the question with I be the substance of all this be the time be not far distant when the time be short the truth of this have not be then finally then i repeat there be many people nowadays who there be people who tell you that there be a cynicism which there be a word which i wish to say there be another reason why there be another sense in which there be much force in there be no danger of we overrate the there be no evidence that there be no good reason why there be no mistake the fact there be no other intelligible answer there be no parallel to there be no sufficient reason for there be none other there be not a shadow of there be one other point connect with there be one other point to which there be something suggestive in there be a time when none deny it these absurd pretension they do what they could this be the case you will see this bring I to a point on which this do not mean this expectation be disappoint this i have already show this be a great mistake this be it be last resort this be the only remain alternative this lead I to the question this relieve I of the necessity of this be clearly perceive by this be especially true of this be essentially a question of this be very different from tho all this be obvious thus you see to avoid all possibility of be to be sure to-day i have additional satisfaction in to my own mind to my own mind certainly it be to pass from that i notice to take a very different instance to this end we must to this likewise it may be add to this there can be but one answer to show all this be easy and certain to show this in fact to sum up then truly gentleman unless i be wholly wrong unless i greatly mistake the temper we all remember we be all aware that we be here to discuss we be now able to determine we be tell that we can not leave unchallenged the we deny it we have a instance in we have no right to say we in we turn must we know they will not we laugh to scorn the idea we look around we we may have a overpowering sense of we may rest assure that we must not propose in we often speak of we ought first of all to note we should pause to consider we will hear much in these day we will not examine the proof of what be you ask to do what be you go to do what can be more intelligible than what do you say to what do we understand by what have become of it what be more remarkable still what be the answer to all this what be this but a acknowledgment of what be you opinion what then remain what we do say be when all have be say there remain when i look around I when it can be show that when it be recognize that when that be say all be say when we contemplate the when we reflect on these sentiment where there be prejudice it be no use to argue who find fault with these thing why should a argument be require to prove that why should it be necessary to confirm will you tell I how with possibly a single exception with regard to what have be state yet it be plain yet strange to say you and i may hold that you can not assert that you can not invent a series of argument you can not say that you do not pretend that you have the authority of you know as well as i do you may object at once and say you may object that you may point if you will to you may search the history of you tell I that you will say that paragraph from notable speech let I here pause once more to ask whether the book in its genuine state as far as we have advance in it make the same impression on you mind now as when it be first read to you in detach passage and whether if i be to tear off the first part of it which i hold in my hand and give it to you as a entire work the first and last passage which have be select as libel on the common would now appear to be so when blended with the interjacent part i do not ask you answer -- i
