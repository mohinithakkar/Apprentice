beside the marsh on the beach at daytona along the hillsborough a morning at the old sugar mill on the upper st john 's on the st augustine road ornithology on a cotton plantation a florida shrine walk about tallahassee a florida sketch-book in the flat-wood in approach jacksonville by rail the traveler ride hour after hour through seemingly endless pine barren otherwise know as low pine-wood and flat-wood till he weary of the sight it would be hard he think to imagine a region more unwholesome look and uninterest more poverty-stricken and god-forsaken in its entire aspect surely man who would risk life in behalf of such a country deserve to win they cause monotonous as the flat-wood be however and malarious as they look -- arid waste and stretch of stagnant water fly past the car window in perpetual alternation i be impatient to get into they they be a world the like of which i have never see and wherever i go in eastern florida i make it one of my earliest concern to seek they out my first impression be one of disappointment or perhaps i should rather say of bewilderment in fact i return from my first visit to the flat-wood under the delusion that i have not be into they at all this be at st augustine whither i have go after a night only in jacksonville i look about the quaint little city of course and go to the south beach on st anastasium island then i wish to see the pine land they be to be find i be tell on the other side of the san sebastian the sun be hot -lrb- or so it seem to a man fresh from the rigor of a new england winter -rrb- and the sand be deep but i saunter through new augustine and push on up the road toward moultrie -lrb- i believe it be -rrb- till the last house be pass and i come to the edge of the pine-wood here presently the road begin to fork in a very confusing manner the first man i meet -- a kindly cracker -- caution I against get lose but i have no thought of take the slightest risk of that kind i be not go to _ explore _ the wood but only to enter they sit down look about I and listen the difficulty be to get into they as i advance they recede it be still only the beginning of a wood the tree far apart and comparatively small the ground cover thickly with saw palmetto intersperse here and there with patch of brown grass or sedge in many place the road be under water and as i seem to be make little progress i pretty soon sit down in a pleasantly shaded spot wagon come along at interval all go toward the city most of they with load of wood ridiculously small load such as a yankee boy would put upon a wheelbarrow a fine day say i to the driver of such a cart yes sir he answer it be a _ pretty _ day he speak with a emphasis which seem to imply that he accept my remark as well mean but hardly adequate to the occasion perhaps if the day have be a few shades brighter he would have call it handsome or even good look expression of this kind however be matter of local or individual taste and as such be not to be dispute about thus a man stop I in tallahassee to inquire what time it be i tell he and he say ah a little sooner than i think and why not sooner as well as earlier but when on the same road two white girl in a ox-cart hail I with the question what time ' t be i think the interrogative idiom a little queer almost as queer shall we say as how do you do may have sound to the first man who hear it -- if the reader be able to imagine such a person meanwhile let the morning be fine or pretty it be all one to the bird the wood be vocal with the cackling of robin the warble of bluebird and the trill of pine warbler flicker be shout -- or laugh if one pleased to hear it so -- with true flickerish prolixity and a single downy woodpecker call sharply again and again a mocking-bird near I -lrb- there be _ always _ a mocking-bird near you in florida -rrb- add he voice for a time but soon relapse into silence the fact be characteristic for wherever i go i find it true that the mocker grow less musical as the place grow wilder by instinct he be a public performer he demand a audience and it be only in city like st augustine and tallahassee that he be hear at he freest and best a loggerhead shrike -- now close at my elbow now farther away -- be practice he extensive vocabulary with perseverance if not with enthusiasm like he relative the great northern though perhaps in a less degree the loggerhead be commonly at a extreme either loquacious or dumb as if he could not let he moderation be know unto any man sometimes i fancy he possess with a insane ambition to match the mocking-bird in song as well as in personal appearance if so it be not surprising that he should be subject to fit of discouragement and silence aim at the sun though a good and virtuous exercise as we have all hear be apt to prove dispiriting to sensible marksman crow -lrb- fish crow in all probability but at the time i do not know it -rrb- utter strange hoarse flat-sounding caw everv bird of they must have be bear without a palate it seem to I white-eyed chewink be at home in the dense palmetto scrub whence they announce themselves unmistakably by sharp whistle now and then one of they mount a leaf and allow I to see he pale yellow iris except for this mark recognizable almost as far as the bird could be distinguish at all he look exactly like we common new england towhee somewhere behind I be a kingfisher 's rattle and from a savanna in the same direction come the song of meadow lark familiar but with something unfamiliar about they at the same time unless my ear deceive I more interesting than any of the bird yet name because more strictly characteristic of the place as well as more strictly new to I be the brown-headed nuthatch i be on the watch for they : they be one of the three novelty which i know be to be find in the pine land and nowhere else -- the other two be the red-cockaded woodpecker and the pine-wood sparrow and be thus on the lookout i do not expect to be take by surprise if such a paradox -lrb- it be nothing worse -rrb- maybe allow to pass but when i hear they twitter in the distance as i do almost immediately i have no suspicion of what they be the voice have nothing of that nasal quality that yankee twang as some people would call it which i have always associate with the nuthatch family on the contrary it be decidedly finchlike -- so much so that some of the note take by themselves would have be ascribe without hesitation to the goldfinch or the pine finch have i hear they in new england and even as thing be i be more than once deceive for the moment as for the bird themselves they be evidently a cheerful and thrifty race much more numerous than the red-cockaded woodpecker and much less easily overlook than the pine-wood sparrow i seldom enter the flat-wood anywhere without find they they seek they food largely about the leafy end of the pine branch resemble the canadian nuthatch in this respect so that it be only on rare occasion that one see they creep about the trunk or larger limb unlike they two northern relative they be eminently social often travel in small flock even in the breed season and keep up a almost incessant chorus of shrill twitter as they flit hither and thither through the wood the first one to come near I be full of inquisitiveness he fly back and forth past my head exactly as chickadee do in a similar mood and once seem almost ready to alight on my hat let we have a look at this stranger he appear to be say possibly he nest be not far off but i make no search for it afterwards i find two nest one in a low stump and one in the trunk of a pine fifteen or twenty foot from the ground both of they contain young one -lrb- march 31 and April 2 -rrb- as i know by the continual goings-in-and-out of the father and mother in dress the brown-head be dingy with little or nothing of the neat and attractive appearance of we new england nuthatch in this pine-wood on the road to moultrie i find no sign of the new woodpecker or the new sparrow nor be i greatly disappoint the place itself be a sufficient novelty -- the place and the summer weather the pine murmur overhead and the palmetto rustle all about now a butterfly flutter past I and now a dragonfly more than one little flock of tree swallow go over the wood and once a pair of phoebe amuse I by a uncommonly pretty lover 's quarrel truly it be a pleasant hour in the midst of it there come along a man in a cart with a load of wood we exchange the time of day and i remark upon the smallness of he load yes he say but it be a pretty heavy load to drag seven or eight mile over such road possibly he understand I as imply that he seem to be in rather small business although i have no such purpose for he go on to say : in 1861 when this beautiful war break out between we country my father own nigger we do not have to do _ this _ but i do not complain if i have not get a bullet in I i should do pretty well then you be in the war i say oh yes yes sir i be in the confederate service yes sir i be a southerner to the backbone my grandfather be a -- -lrb- i miss the patronymic -rrb- and command st augustine the name have a foreign sound and the man 's complexion be swarthy and in all simplicity i ask if he be a minorcan i might as well have touch a light match to powder he eye flash and he come round the tail of the cart gesticulate with he stick minorcan he break out spain and the island of minorca be two place be not they i admit meekly that they be you be english be not you he go on you be english -- yankee bear -- be not you i own it well i be spanish that be not minorcan my grandfather be a -- and command st augustine he could not have do that if he have be minorcan by this time he be quiet down a bit he father remember the indian war the son have hear he tell about it those be dangerous time he remark you could not have be stand out here in the wood then there be no danger here now be there say i no no not now but as he drive along he turn to say that _ he _ be not afraid of _ any _ thing he be not that kind of a man then with a final turn he add what i could not dispute a man 's life be always in danger after he be go i regret that i have offer no apology for my unintentionally offensive question but i be so take by surprise and so much interested in the man as a specimen that i quite forget my manners till it be too late one thing i learn : that it be not prudent in these day to judge a southern man 's blood in either sense of the word by he dress or occupation this man have bring seven or eight mile a load of wood that might possibly be worth seventy-five cent -lrb- i question the owner of what look like just such a load afterward and find he ask price half a dollar -rrb- and for clothing have on a pair of trousers and a blue cotton shirt the latter full of hole through which the skin be visible yet he father be a -- and have own nigger a still more picturesque figure in this procession of wood-carter be a boy of perhaps ten or eleven he ride he horse and be barefoot and bareleg but he have a cigarette in he mouth and to each brown heel be fasten a enormous spur who be it that infect the world with the foolish and disastrous notion that work and play be two different thing and be it emerson or some other wise man who say that a boy be the true philosopher when it come time to think of return to st augustine for dinner i appreciate my cracker 's friendly warning against lose my way for though i have hardly so much as enter the wood and have take as i think good heed to my step i be almost at once in a quandary as to my road there be no occasion for worry -- with the sun out and my general course perfectly plain but here be a fork in the road and whether to bear to the left or to the right be a simple matter of guess-work i make the best guess i could and guess wrong as be apparent after a while when i find the road under deep water for several rod i object to wade and there be no ready way of go round since the oak and palmetto scrub crowd close up to the roadside and just here be all but impenetrable what be still more conclusive the road be the wrong one as the inundation prove and for aught i could tell might carry I far out of my course i turn back therefore under the midday sun and by good luck a second attempt bring I out of the wood very near where i have enter they i visit this particular piece of country but once afterward have in the mean time discover a better place of the same sort along the railroad in the direction of palatka there on a Sunday morning i hear my first pine-wood sparrow time and tune could hardly have be in truer accord the hour be of the quietest the strain be of the simplest and the bird sing as if he be dream for a long time i let he go on without attempt to make certain who he be he seem to be rather far off : if i wait he pleasure he would perhaps move toward I if i disturb he he would probably become silent so i sit on the end of a sleeper and listen it be not great music it make I think of the swamp sparrow and the swamp sparrow be far from be a great singer a single prolonged drawling note -lrb- in that respect unlike the swamp sparrow of course -rrb- follow by a succession of softer and sweeter one -- that be all when i come to analyze it but that be no fair description of what i hear the quality of the song be not there and it be the quality the feel the soul of it if i may say what i mean that make it in the true sense of a much-abused word charming there could be little doubt that the bird be a pine-wood sparrow but such thing be not to be take for grant once or twice indeed the thought of some unfamiliar warbler have cross my mind at last therefore as the singer still keep out of sight i leap the ditch and push into the scrub happily i have not far to go he have be much nearer than i think a small bird fly up before I and drop almost immediately into a clump of palmetto i edge toward the spot and wait then the song begin again this time directly in front of I but still far-away-sounding and dreamy i find that last word in my hasty note pencil at the time and can think of no other that express the effect half so well i look and look and all at once there sit the bird on a palmetto leaf once again he sing put up he head then he drop out of sight and i hear nothing more i have see only he head and neck -- enough to show he a sparrow and almost of necessity the pine-wood sparrow no other strange member of the finch family be to be look for in such a place on further acquaintance let I say at once _ pucaea aestivali _ prove to be a more versatile singer than the performance of my first bird would have lead I to suppose he vary he tune freely but always within a pretty narrow compass as be true also of the field sparrow with whom as i soon come to feel he have not a little in common it be in musical form only that he suggest the swamp sparrow in tone and spirit in the quality of sweetness and expressiveness he be nearly akin to _ spizellum pusillum _ one do for the southern pine barren what the other do for the northern berry pasture and this be high praise for though in new england we have many singer more brilliant than the field sparrow we have none that be sweeter and few that in the long run give more pleasure to sensitive hearer i find the pine-wood sparrow afterward in new smyrna port orange sanford and tallahassee so far as i could tell it be always the same bird but i shoot no specimen and speak with no authority -lrb- 1 -rrb- live always in the pine land and haunt the dense undergrowth it be hear a hundred time where it be see once -- a point greatly in favor of its effectiveness as a musician mr brewster speak of it as singing always from a elevated perch while the bird that i saw in the act of song a very limited number be invariably perch low one that i watch in new smyrna -lrb- one of a small chorus the other be invisible -rrb- sing for a quarter of a hour from a stake or stump which rise perhaps a foot above the dwarf palmetto it be the same song that i have hear in st augustine only the bird here be in a livelier mood and sing _ out _ instead of _ sotto voce _ the long introductory note sound sometimes as if it be indrawn and often if not always have a considerable burr in it once in a while the strain be catch up at the end and sing over again after the manner of the field sparrow -- one of that bird 's prettiest trick at other time the song be deliver with full voice and then repeat almost under the singer 's breath this be do beautifully in the port orange flat-wood the bird be almost at my foot i have see he a moment before and see he again half a minute later but at that instant he be out of sight in the scrub and seemingly on the ground this feature of the song one of its chief merit and its most striking peculiarity be well describe by mr brewster now he say it have a full bell-like ring that seem to fill the air around next it be soft and low and inexpressibly tender now it be clear again but so modulate that the sound seem to come from a great distance -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : two race of the pine-wood sparrow be recognize by ornithologist _ pucaea aestivali _ and _ p aestivali bachmanius _ and both of they have be find in florida but if i understand the matter right _ pucaea aestivali _ be the common and typical florida bird -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ bulletin on the nuttall ornithological club _ vol vii p 98 -rrb- not many other bird i think -lrb- i can not recall any -rrb- habitually vary they song in this manner other bird sing almost inaudibly at time especially in the autumnal season even the brown thrasher whose ordinary performance be so full-voiced not to say boisterous will sometimes soliloquize or seem to soliloquize in the faintest of undertone the formless autumnal warble of the song sparrow be familiar to every one and in this connection i remember and be not likely ever to forget a winter wren who favor I with what i think the most bewitching bit of vocalism to which i have ever listen he be in the bush close at my side in the franconium notch and deliver he whole song with all its customary length intricacy and speed in a tone -- a whisper i may almost say -- that run along the very edge of silence the unexpected proximity of a stranger may have have something to do with he conduct as it often appear to have with the thrasher 's but however that may be the case be not parallel with that of the pine-wood sparrow inasmuch as the latter bird not merely sing under he breath on special occasion whether on account of the nearness of a listener or for any other reason but in he ordinary singing use louder and softer tone interchangeably almost exactly as human singer and player do as if in the practice of he art he have learn to appreciate consciously or unconsciously -lrb- and practice naturally go before theory -rrb- the expressive value of what i believe be call musical dynamics i spend many half-day in the pine land -lrb- how gladly now would i spend another -rrb- but never get far into they -lrb- into they depths my pen be on the point of make I say but that would have be a false note the flat-wood have no depths -rrb- whether i follow the railway -- in many respects a pretty satisfactory method -- or some roundabout aimless carriage road a mile or two be generally enough the country offer no temptation to pedestrian feat nor do the imagination find its account in go farther and farther for the reader be not to think of the flat-wood as in the least resemble a northern forest which at every turn open before the visitor and beckon he forward beyond and behind and on either side the pine-wood be ever the same it be this monotony by the bye this utter absence of landmark that make it so unsafe for the stranger to wander far from the beaten track the sand be deep the sun be hot one place be as good as another what use then to tire yourself and so unless the traveler be go somewhere as i seldom be he be continually stop by the way now a shady spot entice he to put down he umbrella -- for there _ be _ a shady spot here and there even in a florida pine-wood or blossom be to be pluck or a butterfly some gorgeous and nameless creature brighten the wood as it pass or a bird be singing or a eagle be soar far overhead and must be watch out of sight or a buzzard with upturned wing float suspiciously near the wanderer as if with sinister intent -lrb- buzzard shadow be a regular feature of the flat-wood landscape just as cloud shadow be in a mountainous country -rrb- or a snake lie stretch out in the sun -- a whip snake perhaps that frighten the unwary stroller by the amazing swiftness with which it run away from he or some strange invisible insect be make uncanny noise in the underbrush one of my recollection of the railway wood at st augustine be of a cricket or locust or something else -- i never see it -- that amuse I often with a formless rattle or drum sound i could think of nothing but a boy 's first lesson upon the bone the rhythm of the beat be so comically mistime and bungle one fine morning -- it be the 18th of February -- i have go down the railroad a little farther than usual attract by the encouraging appearance of a swampy patch of rather large deciduous tree some of they i remember be red maple already full of handsome high-colored fruit as i draw near i hear indistinctly from among they what might have be the song of a black-throated green warbler a bird that would have make a value addition to my florida list especially at that early date -lrb- 1 -rrb- no sooner be the song repeat however than i see that i have be deceive it be something i have never hear before but it certainly have much of the black-throated green 's quality and without question be the note of a warbler of some kind what a shame if the bird should give I the slip meanwhile it keep on singing at brief interval and be not so far away but that with my glass i should be well able to make it out if only i could once get my eye on it that be the difficulty something stir among the branch yes a yellow-throated warbler -lrb- _ dendroica dominica _ -rrb- a bird of which i have see my first specimen all of they silent during the last eight day probably he be the singer i hope so at any rate that would be a ideal case of a beautiful bird with a song to match i keep he under my glass and presently the strain be repeat but not by he then it cease and i be none the wiser perhaps i never should be it be indeed a shame such a _ take _ song so simple and yet so pretty and so thoroughly distinctive i write it down thus : _ tee-koi tee-koo _ -- two couplet the first syllable of each a little emphasize and dwell upon not drawl and a little higher in pitch than its fellow perhaps it might be express thus : -- -lrb- illustration -rrb- i can not profess to be sure of that however nor have i unqualified confidence in the adequacy of musical notation no matter how skillfully employ to convey a truthful idea of any bird song -lrb- footnote 1 : as it be i do not find _ dendroica viren _ in florida on my way home in atlanta April 20 i see one bird in a dooryard shade-tree -rrb- the affair remain a mystery till in daytona nine day afterward the same note be hear again this time in lower tree that do not stand in deep water then it transpire that my mysterious warbler be not a warbler at all but the carolina chickadee that be a outcome quite unexpected although i now remember that chickadee be in or near the st augustine swamp and what be more to the purpose i could now discern some relationship between the _ tee-koi tee-koo _ -lrb- or as i now write it _ see-toi see-too _ -rrb- and the familiar so-called phoebe whistle of the black-capped titmouse the southern bird i be bind to acknowledge be much the more accomplished singer of the two sometimes he repeat the second dissyllable make six note in all at other time he break out with a characteristic volley of fine chickadee note and run without a break into the _ see-toi see-too _ with a highly please effect then if on the top of this he double the _ see-too _ we have a really prolonged and elaborate musical effort quite put into the shade we new england bird 's _ hear hear I _ sweet and welcome as that always be the southern chickadee it should be say be not to be distinguish from its northern relative -- in the bush i mean -- except by its note it be slightly smaller like southern bird in general but be practically identical in plumage apart from its song what most impressed I be its scarcity it be find sooner or later wherever i go i believe but always in surprisingly small number and i see only one nest that be build in a roadside china-tree in tallahassee and contain young one -lrb- April 17 -rrb- as be clear from the conduct of its owner it must not be suppose that i leave st augustine without another search for my unknown warbler the very next morning find I again at the swamp where for at least a hour i sit and listen i hear no _ tee-koi tee-koo _ but be reward twice over for my walk in the first place before reach the swamp i find the third of my flat-wood novelty the red-cockaded woodpecker as have happen with the nuthatch and the sparrow i hear he before see he : first some note which by themselves would hardly have suggest a woodpecker origin and then a noise of hammer take together the two sound leave little doubt as to they author and presently i see he -- or rather they for there be two bird i learn nothing about they either then or afterwards -lrb- i see perhaps eight individual during my ten week ' visit -rrb- but it be worth something barely to see and hear they henceforth _ dryobate boreali _ be a bird and not merely a name this as i have say be among the pine before reach the swamp in the swamp itself there suddenly appear from somewhere as if by magic -lrb- a dramatic entrance be not without its value even out-of-doors -rrb- a less novel but far more impressive figure a pileated woodpecker a truly splendid fellow with the scarlet cheek-patch when i catch sight of he he stand on one of the upper branch of a tall pine look wonderfully alert and wide-awake now stretch out he scrawny neck and now draw it in again he long crest all the while erect and flame after a little he drop into the underbrush out of which come at interval a succession of rap i would have give something to have have he under my glass just then for i have long feel curious to see he in the act of chisel out those big oblong clean-cut sharp-angled peck-hole which close to the base of the tree make so common and notable a feature of vermont and new hampshire forest but though i do my best i could not find he till all at once he come up again and take to a tall pine -- the tallest in the wood -- where he prance about for a while striking sundry picturesque but seemingly aimless attitude and then make off for good all in all he be a wild-looking bird if ever i see one i be no sooner in st augustine of course than my eye be open for wild flower perhaps i feel a little disappointed certainly the land be not ablaze with color in the grass about the old fort fhere be plenty of the yellow oxali and the creep white houstonium and from a crevice in the wall out of reach lean a stalk of goldenrod in full bloom the reader may smile if he will but this last flower be a surprise and a stumbling-block a vernal goldenrod dr chapman 's flora make no mention of such a anomaly sow thistle too look strangely anachronistic i have never think of they as harbinger of springtime the truth do not break upon I till a week or so afterward then on the way to the beach at daytona where the pleasant peninsula road traverse a thick forest of short-leaved pine every tree of which lean heavily inland at the same angle -lrb- the lean pine of daytona i always say to myself as i pass -rrb- i come upon some white beggar 's - tick -- like daisy and as i stop to see what they be i notice the presence of ripe seed the plant have be in flower a long time and then i laugh at my own dullness it fairly deserve a medal as if even in massachusett autumnal flower -- the groundsel at least -- do not sometimes persist in blossom far into the winter a day or two after this i see a mullein stalk still present arm as it be -lrb- the mullein always look the soldier to I -rrb- with one bright flower if i have find _ that _ in st augustine i flatter myself i should have be less easily fool there be no such last-year relic in the flat-wood so far as i remember but spring blossom be begin to make they appearance there by the middle of February particularly along the railroad -- violet in abundance -lrb- _ viola cuculla _ -rrb- dwarf orange-colored dandelion -lrb- _ krigium _ -rrb- the judas-tree or redbud st peter 's - wort blackberry the yellow star-flower -lrb- _ hypoxi juncea _ -rrb- and butterwort i recall too in a swampy spot a fine fresh tuft of the golden club with its gorgeous yellow spadix -- a plant that i have never see in bloom before although i have once admire a cape cod hollow full of the rank tropical leaf st peter 's - wort a low shrub thrive everywhere in the pine barren and without be especially attractive its rather sparse yellow flower -- not unlike the st john 's - wort -- do something to enliven the general waste the butterwort be beauty and true child of the spring i pick my first one which by chance be of the smaller purple species -lrb- _ pinguiculum pumilum _ -rrb- on my way down from the wood on a moist bank at that moment a white man come up the road what do you call this flower say i valentine 's flower he answer at once ah say i because it be in bloom on st valentine 's day i suppose no sir he say do you speak spanish i have to shake my head because i could explain it better in spanish he continue as if by way of apology but he go on in perfectly good english : if you put one of they under you pillow and think of some one you would like very much to see -- some one who have be dead a long time -- you will be likely to dream of he it be a very pretty flower he add and so it be hardly prettier however to my thinking than the blossom of the early creep blackberry -lrb- _ rubus triviali _ -rrb- with they i fairly fall in love : true white rose i call they each with its central ring of dark purplish stamen as beautiful as the cloudberry which once ten year before i have find on the summit of mount clinton in new hampshire and refuse to believe a _ rubus _ though dr gray 's key lead I to that genus again and again there _ be _ something in a name say what you will some week later and a little farther south -- in the flat-wood behind new smyrna -- i see other flower but never anything of that tropical exuberance at which the average northern tourist expect to find himself stare boggy place be full of blue iris -lrb- the common _ iris versicolor _ of new england but of ranker growth -rrb- and here and there a pool be yellow with bladderwort i be take also with the larger and taller -lrb- yellow -rrb- butterwort which i use never to see as i go through the wood in the morning but be sure to find standing in the tall dry grass along the border of the sandy road here one and there one on my return at noon in similar place grow a yellow daisy -lrb- _ leptopoda _ -rrb- a single big head of a deep color at the top of a leafless stem it seem to be one of the most abundant of florida spring flower but i could not learn that it go by any distinctive vernacular name beside the railway track be blue-eyed grass and pipewort and a dainty blue lobelium -lrb- _ l feayana _ -rrb- with once in a while a extremely pretty coreopsis have a purple center and scarcely to be distinguish from one that be common in garden no doubt the advance season bring a increase wealth of such beauty to the flat-wood no doubt too i miss the larger half of what might have be find even at the time of my visit for i make no pretense of do any real botanical work have neither the time nor the equipment the bird keep I busy for the most part when the country itself do not absorb my attention more interesting and a thousand time more memorable than any flower or bird be the pine barren itself i have give no true idea of it i be perfectly aware : open parklike flood with sunshine level as a floor what heartache lanier break out poor exile die of consumption -- what heartache ne'er a hill a dreary country to ride through hour after hour a impossible country to live in but most pleasant for a half-day winter stroll notwithstanding i never go far into it as i have already say i have always a profound sensation of remoteness as if i might go on forever and be no farther away yet even here i have more than one reminder that the world be a small place i meet a burly negro in a cart and fall into talk with he about the florida climate a endless topic out of which a cynical traveler may easily extract almost endless amusement how abput the summer here i inquire be they really as paradisaical -lrb- i do not use that word -rrb- as some report would lead one to suppose the man smile as if he have hear something like that before he do not think the florida summer a dream of delight even on the east coast i be tellin ' you the truth sah the mosquiter a ' sandfly be awful be he bear here i ask no he come from b -- alabama everybody in eastern florida come from somewhere as well as i could make out oh from b -- say i do you know mr w -- of the -- iron work he smile again yes sah i use to work for he he be a nice man he speak the truth that time beyond a peradventure he be healthier here than in the other place he think and wages be higher but he like the other place better for pleasure it be a odd coincidence be it not that i should meet in this solitude a man who know the only citizen of alabama with whom i be ever acquaint at another time i fall in with a oldish color man who like myself have take to the wood for a quiet Sunday stroll _ he _ be from mississippus he tell I oh yes he remember the war he be a slave twenty-one year old when it break out to he mind the present generation of nigger be a pretty poor lot for all they edication he have see they crowd folk off the sidewalk and puff smoke in they face all of which be nothing new i have find that story more or less common among negro of he age he do not believe much in edication but when i ask if he think the black be better off in slavery time he answer quickly i would rather be a free man _ i _ have he be not marry he have plenty to do to take care of himself we separate he go one way and i the other but he turn to ask with much seriousness -lrb- the reader must remember that this be only three month after a national election -rrb- do you think they 'll get free trade truly say i to myself ` the world be too much with we ' even in the flat-wood there be no escape the tariff question but i answer in what be mean to be a reassuring tone not yet awhile some time i hope not he say -- as if liberty to buy and sell would be a dreadful blow to a man living in a shanty in a florida pine barren he be take the matter rather too much to heart perhaps but surely it be encourage to see such a man interest in broad economical question and i realize as never before the truth of what the newspaper so continually tell we that political campaign be educational beside the marsh i be sit upon the upland bank of a narrow wind creek before I be a sea of grass brown and green of many shades to the north the marsh be bound by live-oak wood -- a line with numberless indentation -- beyond which run the matanza river as i know by the passing and repassing of sail behind the tree eastward be sand-hill dazzling white in the sun with a ragged green fringe along they top then come a stretch of the open sea and then more to the south st anastasium island with its tall black-and-white lighthouse and the cluster of lower building at its base small sailboat and now and then a tiny steamer pass up and down the river to and from st augustine a delicious south wind be blow -lrb- it be the 15th of February -rrb- and i sit in the shade of a cedar-tree and enjoy the air and the scene a contrast this to the frozen world i be live in less than a week ago as i approach the creek a single spotted sandpiper be teeter along the edge of the water and the next moment a big blue heron rise just beyond he and go flap away to the middle of the marsh now a hour afterward he be still stand there tower above the tall grass once when i turn that way i see as i think a stake and then something move upon it -- a bird of some kind and what a enormous beak i raise my field-glass it be the heron he body be the post and he head be the bird meanwhile the sandpiper have steal away i know not when or where he must have omit the _ tweet tweet _ with which ordinarily he signalize he flight he be the first of he kind that i have see during my brief stay in these part now a multitude of crow pass over fish crow i think they must be from they small size and they strange ridiculous voice and now a second great blue heron come in sight and keep on over the marsh and over the live-oak wood on he way to the san sebastian marsh or some point still more remote a fine show he make with he wide expanse of wing and he foot draw up and stand out behind he next a marsh hawk in brown plumage come skim over the grass this way and that he swerve in ever graceful line for one to whom ease and grace come by nature even the chase of meadow mouse be a act of beauty while another go awkwardly though in pursuit of a goddess several time i have notice a kingfisher hover above the grass -lrb- so it look but no doubt he be over a arm of the creek -rrb- striking the air with quick stroke and keep he head point downward after the manner of a tern then he disappear while i be look at something else now i remark he sit motionless upon the top of a post in the midst of the marsh a third blue heron appear and he too fly over without stop number one still keep he place through the glass i can see he dress he feather with he clumsy beak the lively strain of a white-eyed vireo pertest of songster come to I from somewhere on my right and the soft chip of myrtle warbler be all but incessant i look up from my paper to see a turkey buzzard sailing majestically northward i watch he till he fade in the distance not once do he flap he wing but sail and sail go with the wind yet turn again and again to rise against it -- help himself thus to its adverse uplifting pressure in the place of wing-stroke perhaps -- and pass onward all the while in beautiful circle he too scavenger though he be have a genius for be graceful one might almost be willing to be a buzzard to fly like that the kingfisher and the heron be still at they post a exquisite yellow butterfly of a sort strange to my yankee eye flit past follow by a red admiral the marsh hawk be on the wing again and while look at he i descry a second hawk too far away to be make out now the air behind I be dark with crow -- a hundred or two at least circling over the low cedar some motive they have for all they clamor but it pass my owlish wisdom to guess what it can be a fourth blue heron appear and drop into the grass out of sight between my foot be a single blossom of the yellow oxali the only flower to be see and very pretty it be each petal with a orange spot at the base another buzzard another marsh hawk another yellow butterfly and then a smaller one darker almost orange it pass too quickly over the creek and away the marsh hawk come nearer and i see the strong yellow tinge of he plumage especially underneath he will grow handsomer as he grow older a pity the same could not be true of man behind I be sharp cry of titlark from the direction of the river come frequent report of gun somebody be do he best to be happy all at once i prick up my ear from the grass just across the creek rise the brief hurry song of a long-billed marsh wren so _ he _ be in florida be he already i have hear confused noise which i feel sure be the work of rail of some kind no doubt there be abundant life conceal in those acre on acre of close grass the heron and the kingfisher be still quiet they morning hunt be successful and for to-day fate can not harm they a buzzard with nervous rustling beat go directly above the low cedar under which i be rest at last after a siesta of two hour the heron have change he place i look up just in season to see he sweep over the grass into which he drop the next instant the tide be fall the distant sand-hill be wink in the heat but the breeze be deliciously cool the very perfection of temperature if a man be to sit still in the shade it be eleven o'clock i have a mile to go in the hot sun and turn away but first i sweep the line once more with my glass yonder to the south be two more blue heron stand in the grass perhaps there be more still i sweep the line yes far far away i can see four head in a row head and neck rise above the grass but so far away be they bird or only post make alive by my imagination i look again i believe i be deceive they be nothing but stake see how in a row they stand i smile at myself just then one of they move and another be pull down suddenly into the grass i smile again ten great blue heron i say to myself all this have detain I and meantime the kingfisher have take wing and go noisily up the creek the marsh hawk appear once more a killdeer 's sharp rasping note -- a familiar sound in st augustine -- come from i know not where a procession of more than twenty black vulture pass over my head i can see they foot draw up under they my own i must use in plod homeward on the beach at daytona the first eight day of my stay in daytona be so delightful that i feel as if i have never before see fine weather even in my dream my east window look across the halifax river to the peninsula wood beyond they be the ocean immediately after breakfast therefore i make toward the north bridge and in half a hour or less be on the beach beach be much the same the world over and there be no need to describe this one -- silver beach i think i hear it call -- except to say that it be broad hard and for a pleasure-seeker 's purpose endless it be back by low sand-hill cover with impenetrable scrub -- oak and palmetto -- beyond which be a dense growth of short-leaved pine perfect weather a perfect beach and no throng of people : here be the condition of happiness and here for eight day i find it the ocean itself be a solitude day after day not a sail be in sight look up and down the beach i could usually see somewhere in the distance a carriage or two and as many foot passenger but i often walk a mile or sit for half a hour without be within hail of any one never be air more gentle or color more exquisite as for bird they be surprisingly scarce but never want altogether if everything else fail a few fish-hawk be sure to be in sight i watch they at first with eager interest up and down the beach they go each by himself with head point downward scanning the shallow water often they stop in they course and by means of laborious flapping hold themselves poise over a certain spot then perhaps they set they wing and shot downward clean under water if the plunge be unsuccessful they shake they feather dry and be ready to begin again they have the fisherman 's gift the second and even the third attempt might fail but no matter it be simply a question of time and patience if the fish be catch they first concern seem to be to shift they hold upon it till its head point to the front that do they shake themselves vigorously and start landward the shine white victim wriggle vainly in the clutch of the talon i take it for grant that they retire with they quarry to some secluded spot on the peninsula till one day i happen to be stand upon a sand-hill as one pass overhead then i perceive that he keep on straight across the peninsula and the river more than once however i see one of they in no haste to go inland on my second visit a hawk come circle about my head carry a fish i be surprise at the action but give it no second thought nor once imagine that he be make I he protector till suddenly a large bird drop rather awkwardly upon the sand not far before I he stand for a instant on he long ungainly leg and then show a white head and a white tail rise with a fish in he talon and sweep away landward out of sight here be the osprey 's parasite the bald eagle for which i have be on the watch meantime the hawk too have disappear whether it be he fish which the eagle have pick up -lrb- have miss it in the air -rrb- i can not say i do not see it fall and know nothing of the eagle 's presence until he flutter to the beach some day later i see the big thief -- emblem of american liberty -- play he sharp game to the finish i be cross the bridge and by accident turn and look upward -lrb- by accident i say but i be always do it -rrb- high in the air be two bird one chase the other -- a fish-hawk and a young eagle with dark head and tail the hawk mean to save he dinner if he could round and round he go ascend at every turn he pursuer after he hotly for aught i could see he stand a good chance of escape till all at once another pair of wing sweep into the field of my glass a third be in the race who be the third speeding away swift as the eagle bird it _ be _ a eagle a adult with head and tail white only once more the osprey circle the odds be against he and he let go the fish as it fall the old eagle swoop after it miss it swoop again and this time long before it could reach the water have it fast in he claw then off he go the younger one in pursuit they pass out of sight behind the tree of a island one close upon the other and i do not know how the controversy end but i would have wager a trifle on the old white-head the bird of washington the scene remind I of one i have witness in georgium a fortnight before on my way south the train stop at a backwoods station some of the passenger gather upon the step of the car and the usual bevy of young negro come alongside stand on my head for a nickel say one a passenger put he hand into he pocket the boy do as he have promise -- in no very professional style be it say -- and with a grin stretch out he hand the nickel glisten in the sun and on the instant a second boy spring forward snatch it out of the sand and make off in triumph amid the hilarious applause of he fellow the acrobat 's countenance indicate a sense of injustice and i have no doubt that my younger eagle be similarly affect where be we boast honor among thief i imagine he ask the bird of freedom be a great bird and the land of the free be a great country here let we hope the parallel end whether on the bank of newfoundland or elsewhere it can not be that the great republic would ever snatch a fish that do not belong to it i admire the address of the fish-hawk until i see the gannet then i perceive that the hawk with all they practice be no better than landlubber the gannet keep farther out at sea sometimes a scatter flock remain in sight for the greater part of a forenoon with they long sharp wing and they outstretched neck -- like loon but with a different flight -- they be rakish-looking customer sometimes from a great height sometimes from a lower sometimes at a incline and sometimes vertically they plunge into the water and after a absence of some seconds as it seem come up and rest upon the surface they be too far away to be closely observe and for a time i do not feel certain what they be the larger number be in dark plumage and it be not till a white one appear that i say with assurance gannet with the bright sun on he he be indeed a splendid bird snowy white with the tip of he wing jet black if he would have come inshore like the osprey i think i should never have tire of he evolution the gannet show themselves only now and then but the brown pelican be a every-day sight i have find they first on the beach at st augustine here at daytona they never alight on the sand and seldom in the water they be always fly up or down the beach and unless turn from they course by the presence of some suspicious object they keep straight on just above the breaker rise and fall with the wave now appear above they and now out of sight in the trough of the sea sometimes a single bird pass but commonly they be in small flock once i see seventeen together -- a pretty long procession for whatever they number they go always in indian file evidently some dreadful thing would happen if two pelican should ever travel abreast it be partly this unusual order of march i suspect which give such a air of preternatural gravity to they movement it be impossible to see even two of they go by without feel almost as if i be in church first both bird fly a rod or two with slow and stately flapping then as if at some preconcerted signal both set they wing and scale for about the same distance then they resume they wing stroke and so on till they pass out of sight i never hear they utter a sound or see they make a movement of any sort -lrb- i speak of what i see at daytona -rrb- except to fly straight on one behind another if church ceremonial be still open to amendment i would suggest in no spirit of irreverence that a study of pelican processional would be certain to yield edifying result nothing do in any cathedral could be more solemn indeed they solemnity be so great that i come at last to find it almost ridiculous but that of course be only from a want of faith on the part of the beholder the bird as i say be _ brown _ pelican have they be of the other species in churchly white and black the ecclesiastical effect would perhaps have be heighten though such a thing be hardly conceivable some beautiful little gull peculiarly dainty in they appearance -lrb- bonaparte 's gull they be call in book but surf gull would be a prettier and apter name -rrb- be also give to fly along the breaker but in a manner very different from the pelican ' as different i may say as the bird themselves they too move steadily onward north or south as the case might be but feed as they go drop into the shallow water between the incoming wave and rise again to escape the next breaker the action be characteristic and graceful though often somewhat nervous and hurry i notice that the bird commonly go by two but that may have be nothing more than a coincidence beside these small surf gull never at all numerous i usually see a few tern and now and then one or two rather large gull which as well as i could make out must have be the ring-billed it be a strange beach i think where fish-hawks invariably outnumber both gull and tern of beach bird properly so call i see none but sanderling they be no novelty but i always stop to look at they busy as ant run in a body down the beach after a recede wave and the next moment scamper back again with all speed before a incoming one they tolerate no near approach but be at once on the wing for a long flight up or down the coast look like a flock of snow-white bird as they turn they under part to the sun in rise above the breaker they manner of feed with the head pitch forward and a quick eager movement as if they have eat nothing for day and be fearful that they present bit of good fortune would not last be strongly characteristic so that they can be recognize a long way off as i have say they be the only true beach bird but i rarely fail to see one or two great blue heron play that rle the first one fill I with surprise i have never think of find he in such a place but there he stand and before i be do with florida beach i have come to look upon he as one of they most constant _ habitus _ in truth this largest of the heron be well-nigh omnipresent in florida wherever there be water fresh or salt he be certain to be meet with sooner or later and even in the driest place if you stay there long enough you will be likely to see he pass overhead on he way to the water which be nowhere far off on the beach as everywhere else he be a model of patience to the best of my recollection i never see he catch a fish there and i really come to think it pathetic the persistency with which he would stand with the water half way to he knee lean forward expectantly toward the breaker as if he feel that this great and generous ocean which have so many fish to spare could not fail to send he at last the morsel for which he be wait but indeed i be not long in perceive that the southern climate make patience a comparatively easy virtue and fishing by a natural consequence a favorite avocation day after day as i cross the bridge on my way to and from the beach the same man stand against the rail hold they pole over the river they have a air of have be there all winter i come to recognize they though i know none of they name one be peculiarly happy look almost radiant with a educate face and only one hand he disability hinder he no doubt i never see so much as a sheep-head or a drum lie at he foot but inwardly i feel sure he luck be good another be older fifty at least sleek and well dress he speak pleasantly enough if i address he otherwise he attend strictly to business every day he be there morning and afternoon he i think have better fortune than any of the other once i see he land a large and handsome speckled trout to the unmistakable envy of he brother angler still a third be a younger man with a broad-brimmed straw hat and a taciturn habit no less persevere than number two perhaps but far less successful i marvel a little at they enthusiasm -lrb- there be many beside these -rrb- and they in they turn do not altogether conceal they amusement at the foible of a man still out of bedlam who walk and walk and walk always with a field-glass protruding from he side pocket which now and then he pull out suddenly and level at nothing it be one of the merciful amelioration of this present evil world that man be thus mutually entertaining these angler be to be congratulate order south by they physician -- as most of they undoubtedly be -- compel to spend the winter away from friend and business amid all the discomfort of southern hotel they be happy in have at least one thing which they love to do bless be the invalid who have a outdoor hobby one man whom i meet more than once in my beach ramble seem to devote himself to bathing running and walk he look like a athlete i hear he tell how far he could run without get winded and as he sprint up and down the sand in he scanty bathing costume i always find he a please spectacle another runner there give I a half-hour of amusement that turn at the last to a feeling of almost painful sympathy he be not in bathing costume nor do he look particularly athletic he be teach he young lady to ride a bicycle and he pupil be at that most interesting stage of a learner 's career when the machine be begin to steady itself with a very little assistance she go bravely while at the same time the young man feel it necessary not to let go he hold upon she for more than a few moment at once at all event he must be with she at the turn she ply the pedal with vigor and he run alongside or behind as best he could she excite and he out of breath back and forth they go and it be a relief to I when finally he take off he coat i leave he still pant in he fair one 's wake and hope it would not turn out a case of love 's labor 's lose let we hope too that he be not a invalid while speak of these my companion in idleness i may as well mention a older man -- a rural philosopher he seem -- whom i meet again and again always in search of shell he be from indiana he tell I with agreeable garrulity he grandchild would like the shell he have perhaps make a mistake in come so far south it be pretty warm he think and he fear the change would be too great when he go home again if a man 's lung be bad he ought to go to a warm place of course _ he _ come for he stomach which be now pretty well -- a capital proof of the superior value of fresh air over proper food in dyspeptic trouble for if there be anywhere in the world a place in which a delicate stomach would fare worse than in a southern hotel -- of the second or third class -- may none but my enemy ever find it seashell collect be not a panacea for a disease like old age for instance it might prove to be a alleviation rather than a cure but take long enough and with a sufficient mixture of enthusiasm -- a true _ sine qua non _ -- it will be find efficacious i believe in all ordinary case of dyspepsia my indiana man be far from be alone in he cheerful pursuit if stranger man or woman meet I on the beach and wish to say something more than good-morning they be sure to ask have you find any pretty shell one woman be a collector of a more businesslike turn she have bring a camp-stool and when i first see she in the distance be remove she shoe and put on rubber boot then she move she stool into the surf sit upon it with a tin pail beside she and lean forward over the water fall to do something -- i could not tell what she be so industrious that i do not venture to disturb she as i pass but a hour or two afterward i overtake she go homeward across the peninsula with she invalid husband and she show I she pail full of the tiny coquina clam which she say be very nice for soup as indeed i know some day later i find a man collect they for the market with the help of a horse and a cylindrical wire roller with he trousers roll to he knee he wade in the surf and shovel the incoming water and sand into the wire roller through a aperture leave for that purpose then he close the aperture and drive the horse back and forth through the breaker till the clam be wash clear of the sand after which he pour they out into a shallow tray like a long bread-pan and transfer they from that to a big bag i come up just in time to see they in the tray bright with all the color of the rainbow will you hold the bag open he say i be glad to help -lrb- it be perhaps the only useful ten minute that i pass in florida -rrb- and so count quart by quart he dish they into it there be thirty odd quart but he want a bushel and a quarter and again take up the shovel the clam themselves be not can and ship he say but only the juice many rudely build cottage stand on the sand-hill just behind the beach especially at the point a mile or so apart where the two daytona bridge road come out of the scrub and one day while walk up the beach to ormond i see before I a much more elaborate queen anne house fancifully but rather neatly paint and with a stable to match it look like a exotic as i draw near its venerable owner be at work in front of it shovel a path through the sand -- just as at that moment -lrb- February 24 -rrb- thousand of yankee householder be shovel path through the snow which then be report by the newspaper to be seventeen inch deep in the street of boston he reverend air and he long black coat proclaim he a clergyman past all possibility of doubt he seem to have get to heaven before death the place be so attractive but be still in a body terrestrial he may have find the meat market rather distant and mosquito and sand-fly sometimes a plague as i walk up the beach he drive by I in a open wagon with a hire man they keep on till they come to a log which have be cast up by the sea and evidently have be sight from the house the hire man lift it into the wagon and they drive back -- quite a stir adventure i imagine a event to date from at the very least the smaller cottage be nearly all empty at that season at different time i make use of many of they when the sun be hot or i have be long afoot once i be rest thus on a flight of front step when a three-seated carriage come down the beach and pull up opposite the driver wish to ask I a question i think no doubt i look very much at home from the day i have enter florida every one i meet have seem to know I intuitively for a new englander and most of they -- i could not imagine how -- have divine that i come from boston it gratify I to believe that i be lose a little of my provincial manner under the influence of more extended travel but my pride have a sudden fall the carriage stop as i say but instead of inquire the way the driver alight and all the occupant of the carriage proceed to do the same -- eight woman with basket and sundry it be time for I to be start i descend the step and pull off my hat to the first comer who turn out to be the proprietor of the establishment with a gracious smile she hope they be not frightening I away she and she friend have come for a day 's picnic at the cottage thing be as they be -lrb- eight woman -rrb- she could hardly invite I to share the festivity and with my best apology for the intrusion i withdraw of one building on the sand-hill i have peculiarly pleasant recollection it be not a cottage but have evidently be put up as a public resort especially as i infer for sunday-school or parish picnic it be furnish with a platform for speech-making -lrb- be there any foolishness that man will not commit on sea beach and mountain top -rrb- and what be more to my purpose be open on three side i pass a good deal of time there first and last and once it sheltered I from a drenching shower of a hour or two the lightning be vivid and the rain fall in sheet in the midst of the blackness and commotion a single tern ghostly white fly past and toward the close a bunch of sanderling come down the edge of the breaker still look for something to eat the only other live thing in sight be two young fellow who have improve the opportunity to try a dip in the surf they color indicate that they be not yet harden to open-air bathing and from they action it be evident that they find the ocean cool they be wet enough before they be do but it be mostly with fresh water probably they take no harm but i be move to remark in pass that i sometimes wonder how generally physician who order patient to florida for the winter caution they against imprudent exposure to I who be no doctor it seem none too safe for young woman with consumptive tendency to be out sailing in open boat on winter evening no matter how warm the afternoon have be while i see one case where a surf bath take by such a invalid be follow by a day of prostration and fever we who live here say a resident do not think the water be warm enough yet but for these northern folk it be a great thing to go into the surf in February and you can not keep they out the row of cottage of which i have speak be in one sense a detriment to the beach but on the whole and in they present desert condition i find they a advantage it be easy enough to walk away from they if a man want the feeling of utter solitude -lrb- the beach extend from matanzas inlet to mosquito inlet thirty-five mile more or less -rrb- while at other time they not only furnished shadow and a seat but with the path and little clearing behind they be a attraction to many bird here i find my first florida jay they sit on the chimney-top and ridgepole and i be rejoice to discover that these unique and interesting creature one of the special object of my journey south be not only common but to a extraordinary degree approachable they extreme confidence in man be one of they oddest characteristic i hear from more than one person how easily and in almost no time they could be tame if indeed they need tame a resident of hawk park tell I that they use to come into he house and stand upon the corner of the dinner table wait for they share of the meal when he be hoe in the garden they would perch on he hat and stay there by the hour unless he drive they off he never do anything to tame they except to treat they kindly when a brood be old enough to leave the nest the parent bring the youngster up to the doorstep as a matter of course the florida jay a bird of the scrub be not to be confound with the florida _ blue _ jay -lrb- a smaller and less conspicuously crest duplicate of we common northern bird -rrb- to which it bear little resemblance either in personal appearance or in voice see from behind its aspect be peculiarly strike the head wing rump and tail be dark blue with a almost rectangular patch of gray set in the midst its beak be very stout and its tail very long and though it would attract attention anywhere it be hardly to be call handsome or graceful its note -- such of they as i hear that be -- be mostly guttural with little or nothing of the scream quality which distinguish the blue jay 's voice to my ear they be often suggestive of the northern shrike on the 23d of February i be stand on the rear piazza of one of the cottage when a jay fly into the oak and palmetto scrub close by a second glance and i see that she be busy upon a nest when she have go i move nearer and wait she do not return and i descend the step and go to the edge of the thicket to inspect she work : a bulky affair -- nearly do i think -- loosely construct of pretty large twig i have barely return to the veranda before the bird appear again this time i be in a position to look squarely in upon she she have some difficulty in edge she way through the dense bush with a long branch stick in she bill but she accomplish the feat fit the new material into its place readjust the other twig a bit here and there and then as she rise to depart she look I suddenly in the face and stop as much as to say well well here be a pretty go a man spy upon I i wonder whether she would throw up the work but in another minute she be back again with another twig the nest i should have say be about four foot from the ground and perhaps twenty foot from the cottage four day later i find she sit upon it she fly off as i come up and i push into the scrub far enough to thrust my hand into the nest which to my disappointment be empty in fact it be still far from complete for on the 3d of march when i pay it a farewell visit its owner be still at work lining it with fine grass at that time it be a comfortable-looking and really elaborate structure both the bird come to look at I as i stand on the piazza they perch together on the top of a stake so narrow that there be scarcely room for they foot and as they stand thus side by side one of they strike its beak several time against the beak of the other as if in play i wish they joy of they expect progeny and be the more ready to believe they would have it for this little display of sportive sentimentality it be a distinguished company that frequent that row of narrow back yard on the edge of the sand-hill as a new-comer i find the jay -lrb- sometimes there be ten under my eye at once -rrb- the most entertaining member of it but if i have be a dweller there for the summer i should perhaps have alter my opinion for the group contain four of the finest of floridian songster -- the mocking-bird the brown thrasher the cardinal grosbeak and the carolina wren rare morning and evening concert those cottager must have and besides these there be catbird ground dove red-eyed chewink white-eyed chewink a song sparrow -lrb- one of the few that i saw in florida -rrb- savanna sparrow myrtle bird redpoll warbler a phoebe and two flicker the last-named bird by the way be never backward about display they tender feeling a treetop flirtation be they special delight -lrb- i hope my reader have all see one few thing of the sort be better worth look at -rrb- and here in the absence of tree they have take to the ridgepole of a house more than once i remark white-breasted swallow straggle northward along the line of sand-hill they be in loose order but the movement be plainly concerted with all the look of a vernal migration this swallow the first of its family to arrive in new england remain in florida throughout the winter but be know also to go as far south as central america the purple martin -- which so far as i be aware do not winter in florida -- have already begin to make they appearance while cross the bridge February 22 i be surprise to notice two of they sit upon a bird-box over the draw which just then stand open for the passage of a tug-boat the toll-gatherer tell I they have come from some place eight or ten day before he attention have be call to they by he cat who be try to get up to the box to bid they welcome he believe that she discover they within three minute of they arrival it seem not unlikely in its own way a cat be a pretty sharp ornithologist one or two cormorant be almost always about the river sometimes they sit upon stake in a patriotic spread-eagle -lrb- american eagle -rrb- attitude as if dry they wing -- a curious sight till one become accustomed to it snakebird and buzzard resort to the same device but i can not recall ever see any northern bird thus engage from the south bridge i one morning see to my great satisfaction a couple of white pelican the only one that i find in florida though i be assure that within twenty year they have be common along the halifax and hillsborough river my bird be fly up the river at a good height the brown pelican on the other hand make they daily pilgrimage just above the level of the water as have be already describe and be never over the river but off the beach all in all there be few pleasanter walk in florida i believe than the beach-round at daytona out by one bridge and back by the other a old hotel-keeper -- a rural yankee if one could tell anything by he look and speech -- say to I in a burst of confidence yes we have get a climate and that be about all we have get -- climate and sand i could not entirely agree with he for myself i find not only fine day but fine prospects but there be no deny the sand along the hillsborough wherever a walker live he find sooner or later one favorite road so it be with I at new smyrna where i live for three week i have go there for the sake of the river and my first impulse be to take the road that run southerly along its bank at the time i think it the most beautiful road i have find in florida nor have i see any great cause since to alter that opinion with many pleasant winding -lrb- beautiful road be never straight nor unnecessarily wide which be perhaps the reason why we rural authority devote themselves so madly to the work of straighten and widen -rrb- -- with many pleasant winding i say the grace of god make manifest in curve it follow the edge of the hammock have the river on one side and the forest on the other it be afternoon when i first see it then it be shaded from the sun while the river and its opposite bank have on they a light more beautiful than can be describe or imagine a light -- with reverence for the poet of nature be it speak -- a light that never be _ except _ on sea or land the poet 's dream be never equal to it in a flat country stretch of water be doubly welcome they take the place of hill and give the eye what it crave -- distance which soften angle conceal detail and heighten color -- in short transfigure the world with its romancer 's touch and bless we with illusion so as i loiter along the south road i never tire of look across the river to the long wooded island and over that to the line of sand-hill that mark the eastern rim of the east peninsula beyond which be the atlantic the white crest of the hill make the sharper point of the horizon line elsewhere clump of nearer pine-tree intervene while here and there a tall palmetto stand or seem to stand on the highest and farthest ridge look seaward but particulars matter little the blue water the pale changeable grayish-green of the low island wood the deeper green of the pine the unnamable hue of the sky the sunshine that flood it all these be beauty enough -- beauty all the more keenly enjoy because for much of the way it be see only by glimpse through vista of palmetto and live-oak sometimes the road come quite out of the wood as it round a turn of the hammock then i stop to gaze long at the scene elsewhere i push through the hedge at favorable point and sit or stand look up and down the river a favorite seat be the prow of a old row-boat which lay fall to piece high and dry upon the sand it have make its last cruise but i find it still useful the river be shallow at low tide sandbar and oyster-bed occupy much of its breadth and even when it look full a great blue heron would very likely be wade in the middle of it that be a sight to which i have grow accustomed in florida where this bird familiarly know as the major be apparently ubiquitous too big to be easily hide it be also as a general thing too wary to be approach within gunshot i be not sure that i ever come within sight of one no matter how suddenly or how far away that it do not give evidence of have see I first long leg long wing a long bill -- and long sight and long patience : such be the tall bird 's dowry good and useful quality all of they long may they avail to put off the day of they owner 's extermination the major be scarcely a bird of which you can make a pet in you mind as you may of the chickadee for instance or the bluebird or the hermit thrush he do not lend himself naturally to such imaginary endearment but it be pleasant to have he on one 's daily beat i should count it one compensation for have to live in florida instead of in massachusett -lrb- but i might require a good many other -rrb- that i should see he a hundred time as often in walk down the river road i seldom see less than half a dozen not together -lrb- the major like fisherman in general be of a unsocial turn -rrb- but here one and there one -- on a sand-bar far out in the river or in some shallow bay or on the submerged edge of a oyster-flat wherever he be he always look as if he might be go to do something presently even now perhaps the matter be on he mind but at this moment -- well there be time when a heron 's strength be to stand still certainly he seem in no danger of overeat a cracker tell I that the major make a excellent dish if kill on the full of the moon i wonder at that qualification but my informant explain himself the bird he say feed mostly at night and fare best with the moon to help he if the reader would dine off roast blue heron therefore as i hope i never shall let he mind the lunar phase but think of the gastronomic up and downs of a bird that be fat and lean by turn twelve time a year possibly my informant overstate the case but in any event i would trust the major to bear himself like a philosopher if there be any one of god 's creature that can wait for what he want it must be the great blue heron i have speak of he caution if he be patrolling a shallow on one side of a oyster-bar -- at the rate let we say of two step a minute -- and take it into he head -lrb- a inappropriate phrase as convey a idea of something like suddenness -rrb- to try the water on the other side he do not spread he wing as a matter of course and fly over first he put up he head -- a operation that make another bird of he -- and look in all direction how could he tell what enemy might be lie in wait and have alight on the other side -lrb- he manner of alighting be one of he prettiest characteristic -rrb- he do not at once draw in he neck till he bill protrude on a level with he body and resume he labor but first he look once more all about he it be a good _ habit _ to do that anyhow and he mean to run no risk if the race of bird be create out of innocent light-minded man whose thought be direct toward heaven accord to the word of plato then _ ardea herodia _ must long ago have fall from grace i imagine he state of mind to be always like that of we pilgrim father in time of indian massacre when they go after the cow or to hoe the corn they take they gun with they and turn no corner without a sharp lookout against ambush no doubt such a condition of affair have this advantage that it make ennui impossible there be always something to live for if it be only to avoid get kill after this manner do the hillsborough river major all behave themselves until my very last walk beside it then i find the exception -- the exception that be as good as inevitable in the case of any bird if the observation be carry far enough he -lrb- or she there be no tell which it be -rrb- stand on the sandy beach a splendid creature in full nuptial garb two black plume nod jauntily from its crown and mass of soft elongate feather drape its back and lower neck nearer and nearer i approach till i must have be within a hundred foot but it stand as if on dress parade exult to be look at let we hope it never carry itself thus gayly when the wrong man come along near the major -- not keep he company but feed in the same shallows and along the same oyster-bar -- be constantly to be see two smaller relative of he the little blue heron and the louisiana the former be what be call a dichromatic species some of the bird be blue and other white on the hillsborough it seem to I that white specimen predominate but possibly that be because they be so much more conspicuous sunlight favor the white feather no other color show so quickly or so far if you be on the beach and catch sight of a bird far out at sea -- a gull or a tern a gannet or a loon -- it be invariably the white part that be see first and so the little white heron might stand never so closely against the grass or the bush on the further shore of the river and the eye could not miss he if he have be a blue one at that distance ten to one he would have escape I besides i be more on the alert for white one because i be always hope to find one of they with black leg in other word i be look for the little white egret a bird concern which thanks to the murderous work of plume-hunter -- thanks also to those good woman who pay for have the work do -- i must confess that i go to florida and come home again without certainly see it the heron with which i find myself especially take be the louisiana a bird of about the same size as the little blue but with a air of daintiness and lightness that be quite its own and quite indescribable when it rise upon the wing indeed it seem almost _ too _ light almost unsteady as if it lack ballast like a butterfly it be the most numerous bird of its tribe along the river i think and with one exception the most approachable that exception be the green heron which frequent the flat along the village front and might well have be mistake for a domesticated bird let you walk across a plank directly over its head while it squat upon the mud and when disturbed fly into a fig-tree before the hotel piazza just as the dear little ground dove be in the habit of do to I who have hitherto see the green heron in the wildest of place this tameness be a astonishing sight it would be hard to say which surprise I more the new smyrna green heron or the st augustine sparrow-hawk -- which latter treated I very much as i be accustom to be treat by village-bred robin in massachusett the louisiana heron be my favorite as i say but incomparably the handsomest member of the family -lrb- i speak of such as i saw -rrb- be the great white egret in truth the epithet handsome seem almost a vulgarism as apply to a creature so superb so utterly and transcendently splendid i see it -- in a way to be sure of it -- only once then on a island in the hillsborough two bird stand in the dead top of low shrubby tree fully expose in the most favorable of light they long dorsal train droop behind they and sway gently in the wind i have never see anything so magnificent and when i return two or three hour afterward from a jaunt up the beach to mosquito inlet there they still be as if they have not stir in all that time the reader should understand that this egret be between four and five foot in length and measure nearly five foot from wing tip to wing tip and that its plumage throughout be of spotless white it be pitiful to think how constantly a bird of that size and color must be in danger of its life happily the lawmaker of the state have do something of recent year for the protection of such defenseless beauty happily too shooting from the river boat be no longer permit -- on the regular line that be i myself see a young gentleman stand on the deck of a excursion steamer with a rifle and do he worst to kill or maim every living thing that come in sight from a spotted sandpiper to a turkey buzzard i call he a gentleman he be in gentle company and the fact that he chew gum industriously would i fear hardly invalidate he claim to that title the narrow river wound in and out between low densely wood bank and the beauty of the shift scene be enough almost to take one 's breath away but the crack of the rifle be not the less frequent on that account perhaps the sportsman be a southerner to whom river scenery of that enchant kind be a old story more likely he be a northerner one of the man who thank heaven they be not sentimental in my ramble up and down the river road i see few water bird beside the heron two or three solitary cormorant would be shoot back and forth at a furious rate or swimming in midstream and sometimes a few spotted sandpiper and killdeer plover be feed along the shore once in a great while a single gull or tern make its appearance -- just often enough to keep I wonder why they be not there oftener -- and one day a water turkey go suddenly over my head and drop into the river on the farther side of the island i be glad to see this interesting creature for once in salt water for the hillsborough like the halifax and the indian river be a river in name only -- a river by brevet -- be in fact a salt-water lagoon or sound between the mainland and the eastern peninsula fish-hawk be always in sight and bald eagle be seldom absent altogether sometimes a eagle stand perch on a dead tree on a island oftener i hear a scream and look up to see one sailing far overhead or chase a osprey on one such occasion when the hawk seem to be make a lose fight a third bird suddenly intervene and the eagle as i thought be drive away good for the brotherhood of fish-hawk i exclaimed but at that moment i put my glass on the new-comer and behold he be not a hawk but another eagle meanwhile the hawk have disappear with he fish and i be leave to ponder the mystery as for the wood the edge of the hammock through which the road pass there be no bird in it it be one of those place -lrb- i fancy every bird-gazer must have have experience of such -rrb- where it be a waste of time to seek they i could walk down the road for two mile and back again and then sit in my room at the hotel for fifteen minute and see more wood bird and more kind of they in one small live-oak before the window than i have see in the whole four mile and that not once and by accident but again and again in affair of this kind it be useless to contend the spot look favorable you say and nobody can deny it there must be bird there plenty of they you miss they to-day be a matter of chance you will try again and you try again -- and again -- and yet again but in the end you have to acknowledge that for some reason unknown to you the bird have agree to give that place the go-by one bird it be true i find in this hammock and not elsewhere : a single oven-bird which with one northern water thrush and one louisiana water thrush complete my set of florida _ seiurus _ besides he i recall one hermit thrush a few cedar-bird a house wren chatter at a great rate among the bootjack -lrb- leaf-stalk -rrb- of a overturn palmetto-tree with a occasional mocking-bird cardinal grosbeak prairie warbler yellow redpoll myrtle bird ruby-crowned kinglet phoebe and flicker in short there be no bird at all except now and then a accidental straggler of a kind that could be find almost anywhere else in indefinite number and as it be not the presence of bird that make the river road attractive so neither be it any unwonted display of blossom beside a similar road along the bank of the halifax in daytona grow multitude of violet and goodly patch of purple verbena -lrb- garden plant go wild perhaps -rrb- and a fine profusion of spiderwort -- a pretty flower the bluest of the blue thrice welcome to I as have be one of the treasure of the very first garden of which i have any remembrance indigo plant we call it then here however on the way from new smyrna to hawk park i recall no violet nor any verbena or spiderwort yellow wood-sorrel -lrb- oxali -rrb- be here of course as it be everywhere it dot the grass in florida very much as five-finger do in massachusett i sometimes think and the creep round-leaved houstonium be here with a superfluity of a weedy blue sage -lrb- _ salvia lyra _ -rrb- here also as in daytona i find a strikingly handsome tufted plant a highly varnished evergreen which i persist in take for a fern -- the sterile frond -- in spite of repeat failure to find it describe by dr chapman under that head until at last a excellent woman come to my help with the information that it be coontie -lrb- _ zamium integrifolium _ -rrb- famous as a plant out of which the southern people make bread in war time this confession of botanical amateurishness and incompetency will be take i hope as rather to my credit than otherwise but it would be morally worthless if i do not add the story of another plant which in this same new smyrna hammock i frequently notice hang in loose bunch like blade of flaccid deep green grass from the trunk of cabbage palmetto the tuft be always out of reach and i give they no particular thought and it be not until i get home to massachusett and then almost by accident that i learn what they be they it turn out _ be _ fern -lrb- _ vittarium linea _ -- grass fern -rrb- and my discomfiture be complete this comparative dearth of bird and flower be not in all respects a disadvantage on the contrary to a naturalist bless now and then with a supernaturalistic mood it make the place on occasion a welcome retreat thus one afternoon as i remember i have be read keat the only book i have bring with I -- not count manual of course which come under another head -- and by and by start once more for the pine land by the way of the cotton-shed hammock to see what i could see but poetry have spoil I just then for anything like scientific research and as i wade through the ankle-deep sand i say to myself all at once no no what do i care for another new bird i want to see the beauty of the world with that i face about and take a side track make as directly as possible for the river road there i should have a mind at ease with no unfamiliar tantalizing bird note to set my curiosity on edge nor any sand through which to be pick my step the river road be pave with oyster-shell if any reader think that statement prosaic or unimportant then he have never live in southern florida in that part of the world all new-comer have to take walking-lesson unless indeed they have already serve a apprenticeship on cape cod or in some other place equally arenarious my own lesson i get at second hand and on a Sunday it be at new smyrna in the village two woman be behind I on they way home from church and one of they be complain of the sand to which she be not yet use yes say the other i find it pretty hard walk at first but i learn after a while that the best way be to set the heel down hard as hard as you can then the sand do not give under you so much and you get along more comfortably i wonder whether she notice just in front of she a man who begin forthwith to bury he boot heel at every step in such a country -lrb- the soil be say to be good for orange-tree but they do not have to walk -rrb- road of powdered shell be veritable luxury and land agent be quite right in lay all stress upon they as inducement to possible settler if the author of the apocalypse have be raise in florida we should never have have the street of the new jerusalem pave with gold he idea of heaven would have be different from that more personal and home-felt we may be certain the river road then as i have say and be glad to say again be shell-paved and well it might be for the hammock along the edge of which it meander seem in some place at least to be little more than a pile of oyster-shell on which soil have somehow be deposit and over which a forest be grow florida indian have leave a evil memory i hear a philanthropic visitor lament that she have talk with many of the people about they and have yet to hear a single word say in they favor somebody might have be good enough to say that with all they fault they have give to eastern florida a few hill such as they be and at present be supply it indirectly with comfortable highway how they must have feast to leave such heap of shell behind they they come to the coast on purpose we may suppose well the red-man be go but the oyster-bed remain and if winter refugee continue to pour in this direction as doubtless they will they too will eat a heap of oyster -lrb- it be easy to see how the vulgar southern use of that word may have originate -rrb- and in the course of time probably the shore of the halifax and the hillsborough will be a fine mountainous country and then if this ancient nineteenth-century prediction be remember the highest peak of the range will perhaps be name in a way which the innate modesty of the prophet restrain he from specify with greater particularity meanwhile it be long to wait and tourist and resident alike must find what comfort they can in the lesser hill which thanks to the good appetite of they predecessor be already theirs for my own part there be one such eminence of which i cherish the most grateful recollection it stand -lrb- or stand the road-maker have begin cart it away -rrb- at a bend in the road just south of one of the turnbull canal i climb it often -lrb- it can hardly be less than fifteen or twenty foot above the level of the sea -rrb- and spend more than one pleasant hour upon its grassy summit northward be new smyrna a village in the wood and farther away tower the lighthouse of mosquito inlet along the eastern sky stretch the long line of the peninsula sand-hill between the white crest of which could be see the rude cottage of coronado beach to the south and west be the forest and in front at my foot lay the river with its woody island many time have i climb a mountain and feel myself abundantly repay by a off-look less beautiful this be the spot to which i turn when i have be read keat and want to see the beauty of the world here be a grassy seat the shadow of orange-tree and a wide prospect in florida i find no better place in which a man who wish to be both a naturalist and a nature-lover who feel himself heir to a double inheritance the clear eye 's moiety and the dear heart 's part could for the time sit still and be happy the orange-tree yield other thing beside shadow though perhaps nothing better than that they be resplendent with fruit and on my earlier visit be also in bloom one do not need to climb the hill to learn the fact for a out-of-door sweetness it would be hard i think to improve upon the scent of orange blossom as for the orange themselves they seem to be in little demand large and handsome as they be southern people in general i fancy look upon wild fruit of this kind as not exactly edible i remember ask two color man in tallahassee whether the orange still hang conspicuously from a tree just over the wall -lrb- a sight not so very common in that part of the state -rrb- be sweet or sour i have forget just what they say but i remember how they _ look _ i mean the inquiry as a mild bit of humor but to they it be a thousandfold better than that : it be wit ineffable what shakespeare say about the prosperity of a jest be never more strikingly exemplify in new smyrna with orange grove on every hand the wild fruit go beg with native and tourist alike so that i feel a little hesitancy about confess my own relish for it lest i should be accuse of affectation not that i devour wild orange by the dozen or in place of sweet one one sour orange go a good way as the common say be but i eat they nevertheless or rather drink they and find they in a thirsty hour decidedly refresh the unusual coldness of the past season -lrb- florida winter from what i hear about they must have fall of late into a queer habit of be regularly exceptional -rrb- have make it difficult to buy sweet orange that be not dry and punky -lrb- 1 -rrb- toward the stem but the hardier wild fruit have weather the frost and be so juicy that as i say you do not so much eat one as drink it as for the taste it be a wholesome bitter-sour as if a lemon have be flavor with quinine not quite so sour as a lemon perhaps nor _ quite _ so bitter as peruvian bark but as it be a agreeable compromise between the two when i drink one i not only quench my thirst but feel that i have take a infallible prophylactic against the malarial fever better still i have surprise myself for one who have feel a lifelong distaste unsocial and almost unmanly for the bitter drink which humanity in general esteem so essential to its health and comfort i be develop new and unexpected capability than which few thing can be more encouraging as year increase upon a man 's head and the world seem to be close in about he -lrb- footnote 1 : i have hear this useful word all my life and now be surprise to find it want in the dictionary -rrb- later in the season on this same shell mound i might have regale myself with fresh fig here at any rate be a thrifty-looking fig-tree though its crop if it bear one would perhaps not have wait my come so patiently as the orange have do here too be a red cedar and to I who in my ignorance have always think of this tough little evergreen as especially at home on my own bleak and stony hillside it seem a incongruous trio -- fig-tree orange-tree and savin in truth the cedar of florida be one of my liveliest surprise at first i refuse to believe that they be red cedar so strangely exuberant be they so disdainful of the set cone-shaped toy-tree pattern on which i have be use to see red cedar build and when at last a study of the flora compel I to admit they identity -lrb- 1 -rrb- i turn about and protest that i have never see red cedar before one in st augustine near san marco avenue i have the curiosity to measure the girth of the trunk at the smallest place be six foot five inch and the spread of the branch be not less than fifty foot -lrb- footnote 1 : i speak as if i have accept my own study of the manual as conclusive i do for the time be but while write this paragraph i bethought myself that i might be in error after all i refer the question therefore to a friend a botanist of authority no wonder the red cedar of florida puzzle you he reply no one would suppose at first that they be of the same species as we new england savin the habit be entirely different but botanist have find no character by which to separate they and you be safe in consider they as _ juniperus virginiana _ -rrb- the stroller in this road suffer few distraction the house two or three to the mile stand well back in the wood with little or no clear land about they picnic establishment they seem to a northern eye rather than permanent dwelling at one point in the hammock a rude camp be occupy by a group of rough-looking man and several small child who seem to be get on as best they could -- none too well to judge from appearance -- without feminine ministration what they be there for i never make out they fish i think but whether by way of amusement or as a serious occupation i do not learn perhaps like the indian of old they have come to the river for the oyster season they might have do worse they never pay the slightest attention to I nor once give I any decent excuse for engage they in talk the best thing i remember about they be a tableau catch in pass a norther have descend upon we unexpectedly -lrb- florida be not a whit behind the rest of the world in sudden change of temperature -rrb- and while hasten homeward toward nightfall hug myself to keep warm i saw in the wood this group of camper dispose about a lively blaze let we be thankful say i that memory be so little the servant of the will chance impression of this kind unforeseen involuntary and inexplicable make one of the chief delight of travel or rather of have travel in the present case indeed the permanence of the impression be perhaps not altogether beyond the reach of a plausible conjecture we have not always live in house and if we love the sight of a fire out-of-door -- a camp-fire that be to say -- as we all do so that the burning of a brush-heap in a neighbor 's yard will draw we to the window the feeling be but part of a ancestral inheritance we have come by it honestly as the phrase be and so i need not scruple to set down another reminiscence of the same kind -- a early morning street scene of no importance in itself in the village of new smyrna it may have be on the morning next after the norther just mention i can not say we have two or three such touch of winter in early march none of they at all distressing be it understand to person in ordinary health one night water freeze -- as thick as a silver dollar -- and orange grower be alarm for the next season 's crop the tree be just ready to blossom some man keep fire burn in they orchard overnight a pretty spectacle i should think especially where the fruit be still ungathered on one of these frosty morning then i see a solitary horseman not wend he way but warm he hand over a fire that he have build for that purpose in the village street one might live and die in a new england village without see such a sight a yankee would have betake himself to the corner grocery but here though that adjunct of civilization be directly across the way most likely it have never have a stove in it the sun would give warmth enough in a hour -- by nine o'clock one would probably be glad of a sunshade but the man be chilly after he ride it be still a bit early to go about the business that have bring he into town : what more natural than to hitch he horse get together a few stick and kindle a blaze what a insane idea it would have seem to he that a pass stranger might remember he and he fire three month afterward and think they worth talk about in print but then as be long ago say it be the fate of some man to have greatness thrust upon they this main street of the village by the way with its hotel and shop be no other than my river road itself in its more civilized estate as i now remember with a sense of surprise in my mind the two have never any connection it be in this thoroughfare that one saw now and then a group of cavalier stroll about under broad-brimmed hat with big spur at they heel accost passer-by with hearty familiarity first name and hand-shake while they horse stand hitch to the branch of roadside tree -- a typical southern picture here on a Sunday afternoon be two young fellow who have bring to town a mother coon and three young one hope to find a purchaser the guest at the hotel manifest no eagerness for such pet but the color bell-boy and waiter gather about and after a little good-humored dickering buy the entire lot box and all for a dollar and a half first have pull the little one out between the slat -- not without some risk to both party -- to look at they and pass they round the vender walk off with grin of ill-concealed triumph the fate have be kind to they and they have three silver half-dollar in they pocket i hear one of they say something about give part of the money to a third man who have tell they where the nest be but he companion would listen to no such folly he would not come with we he say and we will not tell he a damned thing i fear there be nothing distinctively southern about _ that _ here too in the heart of the town be a magnificent cluster of live-oak worth come to florida to see far-spreading full of fern and air plant and heavy with hang moss day after day i go out to admire they under they be a neglect orange grove and in one of the orange-tree amid the glossy foliage appear my first summer tanager it be a royal setting and the splendid vermilion-red bird be worthy of it among the oak i walk in the evening listen to the strange low chant of the chuck-will 's - widow -- a name which the owner himself pronounce with a rest after the first syllable once for two or three day the tree be amazingly full of blue yellow-backed warbler number of they a dozen at least could be hear singing at once directly over one 's head run up the scale not one after another but literally in unison here the tufted titmouse the very soul of monotony pipe and pipe and pipe as if he diapason stop be pull out and stick and could not be push in again he be a odd genius with plenty of note he weary you almost to distraction harping on one string for half a hour together he be the one southern bird that i should perhaps be sorry to see common in massachusett but that perhaps be a large word many yellow-throated warbler silent as yet be commonly in the live-oak and innumerable myrtle bird also silent with prairie warbler black-and-white creeper solitary vireo a occasional chickadee and many more it be a birdy spot and just across the way on the shrubby island be red-winged blackbird who pique my curiosity by add to the familiar _ conkaree _ a final syllable -- the florida termination i call it -- which make I wonder whether as have be the case with so many other florida bird they might not turn out to be a distinct race worthy of a name -lrb- _ agelaius phoeniceus something-or-other _ -rrb- as well as of a local habitation i suggest the question to those whose business it be to be learn in such matter -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : my suggestion i now discover -- since this paper be first print -- be some year too late mr ridgway in he _ manual of north american bird _ -lrb- 1887 -rrb- have already describe a subspecy of florida redwing under the name of _ agelaius phoeniceus bryantus _ whether my new smyrna bird should come under that title can not be tell of course in the absence of specimen but on the strength of the song i venture to think it highly probable -rrb- the tall grass about the border of the island be alive with clapper rail before i rise in the morning i hear they cry in full chorus and now and then during the day something would happen and all at once they would break out with one sharp volley and then instantly all would be silent again theirs be a apt name -- _ rallus crepitan _ once i watch two of they in the act of crepitating and ever after that when the sudden uproar burst forth i seem to see the reed full of bird each with he bill point skyward bear he part in the salvo so far as i could perceive they have nothing to fear from human enemy they run about the mud on the edge of the grass especially in the morning look like half-grown pullet they specialty be crab-fishing at which they be highly expert plunge into the water up to the depth of they leg and handle and swallow pretty large specimen with surprising dexterity i be greatly please with they as well as with they local name everybody 's chicken once i fear we have hear the last of they on a day follow a sudden fall of the mercury a gale from the north set in at noon with thunder and lightning hail and torrent of rain the river be quickly lash into foam and the gale drive the ocean into it through the inlet till the shrubbery of the rail ' island barely show above the breaker the street be deep under water and fear be entertain for the new bridge and the road to the beach all night the gale continue and all the next day till late in the afternoon and when the river should have be at low tide the island be still flood gravitation be overmatch for the time be and where be the rail i ask myself they could swim no doubt when put to it but it seem impossible that they could survive so fierce a inundation well the wind cease the tide go out at last and behold the rail be in full cry not a voice miss how they have manage it be beyond my ken another island farther out than that of the rail -lrb- but the rail like the long-billed marsh wren appear to be present in force all up and down the river in suitable place -rrb- be occupy nightly as a crow-roost judge by the morning clamor which like that of the rail i hear from my bed its population must have be enormous one evening i happen to come up the street just in time to see the hinder part of the procession -- some hundred of bird -- fly across the river they come from the direction of the pine land in larger and smaller squad and with but a moderate amount of noise move straight to they destination all but one of they so move that be to say the performance of that one exception be a mystery he rise high in the air over the river and remain soar all by himself act sometimes as if he be catch insect till the flight have pass even to the last scattering detachment what could be the meaning of he eccentric behavior some momentary caprice have take he perhaps or be he as i could not help ask some duly appoint officer of the day -- grand marshal if you please -- with a commission to see all hand in before retire himself he wait at any rate till the final straggler have pass then he come down out of the air and follow they i mean to watch the ingather a second time to see whether this feature of it would be repeat but i be never there at the right moment one can not do everything now alas florida seem very far off i be never likely to walk again under those new smyrna live-oak nor to see again all that beauty of the hillsborough and yet in a truer and better sense of the word i do see it and shall what a heavenly light fall at this moment on the river and the island wood perhaps we must come back to wordsworth after all -- the light that never be on sea or land a morning at the old sugar mill -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : i have call the ruin here speak of a sugar mill for no better reason than because that be the name commonly apply to it by the resident of the town when this sketch be write i have never hear of a theory since broach in some of we northern newspaper -- i know not by whom -- that the edifice in question be build as a chapel perhaps by columbus himself i should be glad to believe it and can only add my hope that he will be show to have build also the so-called sugar mill a few mile north of new smyrna in the dunlawton hammock behind port orange in that to be sure there be still much old machinery but perhaps its presence would prove no insuperable objection to a theory so please in matter of this kind much depend upon subjective consideration in one sense at least all thing be possible to he that believeth for my own part i profess no opinion i be neither a archaeologist nor a ecclesiastic and speak simply as a chance observer -rrb- on the third or fourth day of my sojourn at the live oak inn the lady of the house notice my peripatetic habit i suppose ask whether i have be to the old sugar mill the ruin be mention in the guide-book as one of the historic feature of the ancient settlement of new smyrna but i have forget the fact and be thankful to receive a description of the place as well as of the road thither -- a rather blind road my informant say with no house at which to inquire the way two or three morning afterward i set out in the direction indicate if the route prove to be half as vague as my good lady 's account of it have sound i should probably never find the mill but the walk would be pleasant and that after all be the principal consideration especially to a man who just then care more or think he do for a new bird or a new song than for a indefinite number of eighteenth-century relic for the first half-mile the road follow one of the old turnbull canal dig through the coquina stone which underlie the soil hereabout then after cross the railway it strike to the leave through a piece of truly magnificent wood know as the cotton-shed hammock because during the war cotton be store here in readiness for the blockade runner of mosquito inlet better than anything i have yet see this wood answer to my idea of a semi-tropical forest : live-oak magnolia palmetto sweet gum maple and hickory with here and there a long-leaved pine overtop all the rest the palmetto most distinctively southern of they all have be badly use by they hardier neighbor they look stunt and almost without exception have be force out of they normal perpendicular attitude the live-oak on the other hand be noble specimen lofty and wide-spreading elm-like in habit it seem to I though not without the sturdiness which belong as by right to all oak and seldom or never to the american elm what give its peculiar tropical character to the wood however be not so much the tree as the profusion of plant that cover they and depend from they : air-plant -lrb- _ tillandsium _ -rrb- large and small -- like pineapple with which they claim a family relationship -- the exuberant hanging moss itself another air-plant fern and vine the fern a species of polypody -lrb- resurrection fern i hear they call -rrb- completely cover the upper surface of many of the larger branch while the huge vine twist about the trunk or quite as often drop straight from the treetop to the ground in the very heart of this dense dark forest -lrb- a forest primeval i should have say but i be assure that the ground have be under cultivation so recently that to a practice eye the cotton-row be still visible -rrb- stand a grove of wild orange-tree the handsome fruit glowing like lamp amid the deep green foliage there be little other brightness here and there in the undergrowth be yellow jessamine vine but already -- march 11 -- they be past flowering almost or quite the only blossom just now in sight be the faithful round-leaved houstonium grow in small flat patch in the sand on the edge of the road with bud partridge-berry -- a yankee in florida -- to keep it company warbler and titmouse twitter in the leafy treetop and butterfly of several kind notably one gorgeous creature in yellow and black like a larger and more resplendent turnus go flutter through the underwood i could have believe myself in the heart of a limitless forest but florida hammock so far as i have see be seldom of great extent and the road presently cross another railway track and then in a few rod more come out into the sunny pine-wood as one might emerge from a cathedral into the open day two man be approach in a wagon -lrb- except on Sunday i be not certain that i ever meet a foot passenger in the flat-wood -rrb- and i improve the opportunity to make sure of my course go about fifty yard say one of they and turn to the right then about fifty yard more and turn to the left _ that _ road will take you to the mill here be a man who have travel in the pine land -- where of all place it be easy to get lose and hard to find yourself -- and not only appreciate the value of explicit instruction but be a southerner have leisure enough and politeness enough to give they i thank he and saunter on the day be before I and the place be lively with bird pine-wood sparrow pine warbler and red-winged blackbird be in song two red-shouldered hawk be scream a flicker be shout a red-bellied woodpecker cry _ kur-r-r-r _ brown-headed nuthatch be gossip in the distance and suddenly i hear what i never think to hear in a pinery the croak of a green heron i turn quickly and see he it be indeed he what a friend be ignorance mother of all those happy surprise which brighten existence as they pass like the butterfly of the wood the heron be at home and i be the stranger for there be water near as there be everywhere in florida and subsequently in this very place i meet not only the green heron but three of he relative -- the great blue the little blue and the dainty louisiana more poetically know -lrb- and worthy to wear the name -rrb- as the lady of the water on this first occasion however the green heron be speedily forget for just then i hear another note unlike anything i have ever hear before -- as if a great northern shrike have be strike with preternatural hoarseness and like so many other victim of the northern winter have betake himself to a sunnier clime i look up in the leafy top of a pine sit a boat-tailed grackle splendidly iridescent engage in a musical performance which afterward become almost too familiar to I but which now as a novelty be as interesting as it be grotesque this as well as i can describe it be what the bird be do he open he bill -- _ set _ it as it be wide apart -- and hold it thus emit four or five rather long and very loud grate shrikish note then instantly shake he wing with a extraordinary flap noise and follow that with several highly curious and startling cry the conclude one of which sometimes suggest the cackle of a robin all this he repeat again and again with the utmost fervor he could not have be more enthusiastic if he have be make the sweetest music in the world and i confess that i think he have reason to be proud of he work the introduction of wing-made sound in the middle of a vocal performance be of itself a stroke of something like genius it put I in mind of the firing of cannon as a accompaniment to the anvil chorus why should a creature of such gift be name for he bodily dimension or the shape of he tail why not _ quiscalus gilmorius _ gilmore 's grackle that the sound _ be _ wing-made i have no thought of question i have see the thing do -- see it and hear it and what shall a man trust if not he own eye and ear especially when each confirm the other two day afterward nevertheless i begin to doubt i hear a grackle sing in the manner just describe wing-beat and all while fly from one tree to another and later still in a country where boat-tailed grackle be a every-day sight near the heart of the village i more than once see they produce the sound in question without any perceptible movement of the wing and furthermore they mandible could be see move in time with the beat so hard be it to be sure of a thing even when you see it and hear it oh yes some sharp-witted reader will say you see the wing flap -- beat time -- and so you imagine that the sound be like wing-beat but for once the sharp-witted reader be in the wrong the resemblance be not imaginary mr fm chapman in a list of bird observe at gainesville florida -lrb- 1 -rrb- say of the boat-tailed grackle -lrb- _ quiscalus major _ -rrb- : a singular note of this species greatly resemble the flap of wing as of a coot tripping over the water this sound be very familiar to I but so excellent be the imitation that for a long time i attribute it to one of the numerous coot which abound in most place favor by _ q major _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the auk _ vol v p 273 -rrb- if the sound be not produce by the wing the question return of course why the wing be shake just at the right instant to that i must respond with the time-honored formulum not prepare the reader may believe if he will that the bird be aware of the imitative quality of the note and amuse itself by heighten the delusion of the looker-on my own more commonplace conjecture be that the sound be produce by snapping and grating of the big mandible -lrb- he be grit he tooth say a shrewd unornithological yankee whose opinion i have solicit -rrb- and that the wing movement may be nothing but involuntary accompaniment of this almost convulsive action of the beak but perhaps the sound _ be _ wing-made after all on the day of which i be write at any rate i be trouble by no misgiving i have see something new and be only desirous to see more of it who do not love a original character for at least half a hour the old mill be forget while i chase the grackle about as he fly hither and thither sometimes with a loggerhead shrike in furious pursuit once i have go a few rod into the palmetto scrub partly to be nearer the bird but still more to enjoy the shadow of a pine and be stand under the tree motionless when a man come along the road in a gig survey he ask rein in he horse no sir i be look at a bird in the tree yonder i wish he to go on and think it best to gratify he curiosity at once he be silent a moment then he say look at the old sugar house from there that be too preposterous and i answer with more voice and perhaps with a touch of impatience no no i be try to see a bird in that pine-tree he be silent again then he gather up the rein i be so deaf i can not hear you he say and drive on good-by i remark in a needless undertone you be a good man i have no doubt but deaf people should not be inquisitive at long range the advice be sound enough in itself consider properly understand it might be hold to contain or at least to suggest one of the profoundest and at the same time one of the most practical truth of all devout philosophy but the testiness of its tone be little to my credit he _ be _ a good man -- and the village doctor -- and more than once afterward put I under obligation one of he best appreciate favor be unintended and indirect i be drive with he through the hammock and we pass a bit of swamp there be some pretty flower he exclaim i think i must get they at the word he jump out of the gig bid I do the same hitch he horse a half-broken stallion to a sapling and plunge into the thicket i stroll elsewhere and by and by he come back a bunch of common blue iris in one hand and he shoe and stocking in the other they be very pretty he explain -lrb- he speak of the flower -rrb- and it be early for they after that i have no doubt of he goodness and in case of need would certainly have call he rather than he younger rival at the opposite end of the village when i tire of chase the grackle or the shrike have drive he away -lrb- i do not remember now how the matter end -rrb- i start again toward the old sugar mill presently a lone cabin come into sight the grass-grown road lead straight to it and stop at the gate two woman and a brood of child stand in the door and in answer to my inquiry one of the woman -lrb- the child have already scamper out of sight -rrb- invite I to enter the yard go round the house she say and you will find a road that run right down to the mill the mill as it stand be not much to look at : some fragment of wall build of coquina stone with two or three arched window and a arched door the whole surround by a modern plantation of orange-tree now almost as much a ruin as the mill itself but the mill be build more than a hundred year ago and serve well enough the principal use of abandon and decay thing -- to touch the imagination for myself i be bind to say it be a precious two hour that i pass beside it seat on a crumble stone in the shade of a die orange-tree behind I a redbird be whistle -lrb- cardinal grosbeak i have be accustom to call he but i like the southern name better in spite of its ambiguity -rrb- now in eager rapid tone now slowly and with a die fall now he voice fall almost to a whisper now it ring out again but always it be sweet and golden and always the bird be out of sight in the shrubbery the orange-tree be in bloom the air be full of they fragrance full also of the murmur of bee all at once a deeper note strike in and i turn to look a humming-bird be hover amid the white blossom and glossy leaf i see he flaming throat and the next instant he be go like a flash of light -- the first hummer of the year i be far from home and expectant of new thing that i dare say be the reason why i take the sound at first for the boom of a bumble-bee some strange floridian bee with a deeper and more melodious bass than any northern insect be master of it be good to be here i say to myself and we need no tabernacle all thing be in harmony a crow in the distance say _ caw caw _ in a meditative voice as if he too be think of day past and not even the scream of a hen-hawk off in the pine-wood break the spell that be upon we a quail whistle -- a true yankee bob white to judge he by he voice -- and the white-eyed chewink -lrb- he be _ not _ a yankee -rrb- whistle and sing by turn the bluebird 's warble and the pine warbler 's trill could never be disturb to the quietest mood only one voice seem out of tune : the white-eyed vireo even to-day can not forget he saucy accent but he soon fall silent perhaps after all he feel himself a intruder the morning be cloudless and warm till suddenly as if a door have be open eastward the sea breeze strike I henceforth the temperature be perfect as i sit in the shadow i think neither of heat nor of cold i catch a glimpse of a beautiful leaf-green lizard on the gray trunk of a orange-tree but it be go -lrb- i wonder where -rrb- almost before i can say i see it presently a brown one with light-colored stripe and a bluish tail be see travel over the crumble wall run into cranny and out again now it stop to look at I with its jewel of a eye and there on the rustic arbor be a third one match the unpainted wood in hue its throat be white but when it be inflate as happen every few seconds it turn to the loveliest rise color this inflated membrane should be a vocal sac i think but i hear no sound perhaps the chameleon 's voice be too fine for dull human sense on two side of I beyond the orange-tree be a thicket of small oak and cabbage palmetto -- hammock i suppose it be call in all other direction be the pine-wood with they undergrowth of saw palmetto the cardinal sing from the hammock and so do the carolina wren the chewink the blackbird -lrb- a grackle just now fly over and a fish-hawk also -rrb- with the bluebird and the pine warbler be in the pinery from the same place come the song of a maryland yellow-throat there too the hen-hawk be scream at my foot be blue violet and white houstonium vine thinly cover with fresh leaf straggle over the wall -- virginium creeper poison ivy grapevine and at least one other the name of which i do not know a clump of tall blackberry vine be full of white blossom bramble rose faint and pale and in one corner be a tuft of scarlet bloom -- sage perhaps or something akin to it for the moment i feel no curiosity but withal the place be unkempt as become a ruin winter 's ragged hand have be rather heavy upon it wither palmetto leaf and leaf-stalk litter the ground and of course be in florida there be no lack of orange-peel lie about ever since i enter the state a new scrip-ture text have be run in my head : in the place where the orange-peel falleth there shall it lie the mill as i say be now the center of a orange grove there must be hundred of tree all of they be small but the greater part be already dead and the rest be die those nearest the wall be fullest of leaf as if the wall somehow give they protection the forest be creep into the inclosure here and there the graceful palm-like tassel of a young long-leaved pine rise above the tall winter-killed grass it be not the worst thing about the world that it tend to run wild now the quail sing again this time in two note and now the hummer be again in the orange-tree and all the while the redbird whistle in the shrubbery he feel the beauty of the day if i be a bird i would sing with he from far away come the chant of a pine-wood sparrow i can just hear it this be a place for dream and quietness nothing else seem worth the have let we feel no more the fever of life surely they be the wise who seek nirvana who insist not upon themselves but wait absorption -- reabsorption -- into the infinite the dead have the better part i think of the stir adventurous man who build these wall and dig these canal he life be full of action full of journeying and fighting now he be at peace and he work do follow he -- into the land of forgetfulness bless be the dead bless too be the bee the bird the butterfly and the lizard next to the dead perhaps they be happy and i also be happy for i too be under the spell to I also the sun and the air be sweet and i too for to-day at least be careless of the world and all its doings so i sit dream when suddenly there be a stir in the grass at my foot a snake be come straight toward I only the evening before a cracker have fill my ear with story of rattler and moccasin he seem to have see they everywhere and to have kill they as one kill mosquito i look a second time at the move thing in the grass it be clothe in innocent black but be a son of adam i rise with involuntary politeness to let it pass a instant more and it slip into the masonry at my side and i sit down again it have be out take the sun and have come back to its hole in the wall how like the story of my own day -- of my whole winter vacation nay if we choose to view it so how like the story of human life itself as i start homeward leave the mill and the cabin behind I some cattle be feed in the grassy road at sight of my umbrella -lrb- there be few place where a sunshade be more welcome than in a florida pine-wood -rrb- they scamper away into the scrub poor wild-eyed hungry-looking thing i thought of pharaoh 's lean kine they be like the country itself i be ready to say but perhaps i misjudge both see both as i do in the winter season with the mercury at 80  or thereabout it be hard for the northern tourist to remember that he be look at a winter landscape he compare a florida winter with a new england summer and can hardly find word to tell you how barren and poverty-stricken the country look after this i go more than once to the sugar mill morning and afternoon i visit it but somehow i could never renew the joy of my first visit mood be not to be have for the ask nor earn by a walk the place be still interesting the bird be there the sunshine be pleasant and the sea breeze fan I the orange blossom be still sweet and the bee still hum about they but it be another day or i be another man in memory none the less all my visit blend in one and the ruin mill in the die orchard remain one of the bright spot in that strange southern world which almost from the moment i leave it behind I begin to fade into indistinctness like the landscape of a dream on the upper st john 's the city of sanford be a beautiful and interesting place i hope to those who live in it to the florida tourist it be important as lie at the head of steamboat navigation on the st john 's river which here expand into a lake -- lake monroe -- some five mile in width with sanford on one side and enterprise on the other or as a waggish traveler once express it with enterprise on the north and sanford and enterprise on the south walking naturalist and lover of thing natural have they own point of view individual unconventional whimsical if you please -- very different at all event from that of clearer-witted and more serious-minded man and the inhabitant of sanford will doubtless take it as a compliment and be amuse rather than annoyed when i confess that i find they city a discouragement a widespread desolation of house and shop if there be a pleasant country road lead out of it in any direction i be unlucky enough to miss it my melancholy condition be hit off before my eye in a parable as it be by a crowd of young fellow black and white whom i find one afternoon in a sand-lot just outside the city engage in what be intend for a game of baseball they be do they best -- certainly they make noise enough but circumstance be against they when the ball come to the ground from no matter what height or with what impetus it fall dead in the sand if it have be make of solid rubber it could not have rebound base-running be little better than base-walking slide be safe but by the same token impossible worse yet at every foul strike or wild throw the ball be lose and the barefooted fielder have to pick they way painfully about in the outlying saw-palmetto scrub till they find it i have never see we national game play under condition so untoward none but true patriot would have the heart to try it i think and i meditate write to washington where the quadrennial purification of the civil service be just then in progress -- under a new broom -- to secure if possible a few bit of recognition -lrb- plum be the technical term i believe -rrb- for man so deserving the first baseman certainly who have oftenest to wade into the scrub should have receive a consulate at the very least yet they be a merry crew those national gamester they patriotism be of the noblest type -- the unconscious they have no thought of be hero nor dream of bounty or pension they quarrel with the umpire of course but not with fate and i hope i profit by they example my errand in sanford be to see something of the river in its narrower and better part and have do that i do not regret what otherwise might have seem a profitless week first however i walk about the city here as already at st augustine and afterward at tallahassee i find the mocking-bird in free song they be bird of the town and the same be true of the loggerhead shrike a pair of which have build a nest in a small water-oak at the edge of the sidewalk on a street corner just beyond the reach of passer-by in the roadside tree -- all freshly plant like the city -- be myrtle warbler prairie warbler and blue yellowback the two latter in song once after a shower i watch a myrtle bird bathing on a branch among the wet leave the street gutter be run with sulphur water but he have wait for rain i commend he taste be myself one of those to whom water and brimstone be a combination as malodorous as it seem unscriptural noisy boat-tailed grackle or jackdaw be plentiful about the lakeside monstrously long in the tail and almost as large as the fish crow which be often there with they over the broad lake sweep purple martin and white-breasted swallow and nearer the shore fed peacefully a few pied-billed grebe or dabchick bird that i have see only two or three time before and at which i look more than once before i make out what they be they have every appearance of pass a winter of content at the top of three or four stake which stand above the water at wide interval -- and at long distance from the shore -- sit commonly as many cormorant here as everywhere with plenty of idle time upon they hand on the other side of the city be orange grove large well keep thrifty look the fruit still on the tree -lrb- march 20 or thereabout -rrb- or lie in heap underneath ready for the box one man 's house i remember be surround by a fence overrun with cherokee rosebush a full quarter of a mile of white blossom my best botanical stroll be along one of the railroad -lrb- sanford be a railway center so call -rrb- through a dreary sand waste here i pick a goodly number of novelty include what look like a beautiful pink chicory only the plant itself be much prettier -lrb- _ lygodesmium _ -rrb- a very curious sensitive-leaved plant -lrb- _ schrankium _ -rrb- densely beset throughout with curved prickle and bear globe of tiny pink-purple flower a calopogon quite as pretty as we northern _ pulchellus _ a clemati -lrb- _ baldwinius _ -rrb- which look more like a bluebell than a clemati till i commence pull it to piece and a great profusion of one of the smaller papaw or custard-apple a low shrub just then full of large odd-shaped creamy-white heavy-scented blossom i be carry a sprig of it in my hand when i meet a negro what be this i ask i dunno sir be not it papaw no sir that be not papaw and then as if he have just remembered something he add that be dog banana oftener than anywhere else i resort to the shore of the lake -- to the one small part of it that be to say which be at the same time easily reach and comparatively unfrequented there -- go one day farther than usual -- i find myself in the borderland of a cypress swamp on one side be the lake but between I and it be cypress-tree and on the other side be the swamp itself a dense wood grow in stagnant black water cover here and there with duckweed or some similar growth : a frightful place it seem the very abode of snake and everything evil story of slave hide in cypress swamp come into my mind it must have be cruel treatment that drive they to it buzzard fly about my head and look at I he have come here to die i imagine they say among themselves no one come here for anything else wait a little and we will pick he bone they perch near by and not to lose time employ the interval in dry they wing for the night have be showery once in a while one of they shift he perch with a ominous rustle they be wait for I and be become impatient he be long about it one say to another and i do not wonder the place seem one from which none who enter it could ever go out and there be no go farther in without plunge into that horrible mire i stand still and look and listen some strange noise bird or devil come from the depths of the wood a flock of grackle settle in a tall cypress and for a time make the place loud how still it be after they be go i could hardly withdraw my gaze from the green water full of slimy black root and branch any one of which might suddenly lift its head and open its deadly white mouth once a fish-hawk fall to scream farther down the lake i have see he the day before stand on the rim of he huge nest in the top of a tree and utter the same cry all about I gigantic cypress every one swollen enormously at the base rise straight and branchless into the air dead tree one might have say -- light-colored apparently with no bark to cover they but if i glance up i see that each bear at the top a scanty head of branch just now put forth fresh green leaf while long funereal streamer of dark spanish moss hang thickly from every bough i be not sure how long i could have stay in such a spot if i have not be able to look now and then through the branch of the under-wood out upon the sunny lake swallow innumerable be play over the water many of they soar so high as to be all but invisible wise and happy bird lover of sunlight and air _ they _ would never be find in a cypress swamp along the shore in a weedy shallow the peaceful dabchick be feed far off on a post toward the middle of the lake stand a cormorant but i could not keep my eye long at once in that direction the dismal swamp have I under its spell and meanwhile the patient buzzard look at I it be almost time they say the fever will do its work -- and i begin to believe it it be too bad to come away the stupid town offer no attraction but it seem perilous to remain perhaps i _ could _ not come away i would try it and see it be amazing that i could and no sooner be i out in the sunshine than i wish i have stay where i be for have once leave the place i be never likely to find it again the way be plain enough to be sure and my foot would no doubt serve I but the foot can not do the mind 's part and it be a sad fact one of the saddest in life that sensation can not be repeat with the fascination of the swamp still upon I i hear somewhere in the distance a musical voice and soon come in sight of a garden where a middle-aged negro be hoe -- hoe and singing : a wild minor endless kind of tune a hymn as seem likely from a word catch here and there a true piece of natural melody as artless as any bird 's i walk slowly to get more of it and the happy-sad singer mind I not but keep on with he hoe and he song potato or corn whatever he crop may have be -- i do not notice or if i do i have forget -- it should have prosper under he hand farther along in the highway -- a sandy track with waste of scrub on either side -- boy of eight or nine arm with a double-barreled gun be linger about a patch of dwarf oak and palmetto have not get that rabbit yet eh say i -lrb- i have pass he there on my way out and he have tell I what he be after -rrb- no sir he answer i do not believe there be any rabbit there yes there be sir i see one a little while ago but he get away before i could get pretty near good i think here be a grammarian not one boy in ten in this country but would have say ' i see ' a scholar like this be worth talk with be there many rabbit here i ask yes sir there be a good deal and so by easy mental stage i be clear of the swamp and back in the town -- save from the horrible and deliver to the commonplace and the dreary my best day in sanford be two that i spend on the river above the lake a youthful boatman expert alike with the oar and the gun serve I faithfully and well impossible as it be for he to enter fully into the spirit of a man who want to look at bird but not to kill they i think he have never before see a customer of that breed first he row I up the creek under promise to show I alligator moccasin and no lack of bird include the especially desire purple gallinule the snake be somehow missing -lrb- a loss not irreparable -rrb- and so be the purple gallinule for they the boy think it be still rather early in the season although he have kill one a few day before and for proof have bring I a wing but as we be skirt along the shore i suddenly call hist a alligator lay on the bank just before we the boy turn he head and instantly be all excitement it be a big fellow he say -- one of three big one that inhabit the creek he would get he this time be you sure i ask oh yes i 'll blow the top of he head off he be load for gallinule and i be no sportsman and never have see a alligator before be some shades less confident but it be he game and i leave he to he way he pull the boat noiselessly against the bank in the shelter of tall reed put down the oar with which he could almost have touch the alligator and take up he gun at that moment the creature get wind of we and slip incontinently into the water not a little to my relief one live alligator be worth a dozen dead one to my think he show he back above the surface of the stream for a moment shortly afterward and then disappear for good ornithologically the creek be a disappointment we push into one bay after another among the dense bonnet -- huge leaf of the common yellow pond lily -- but find nothing that i have not see before here and there a florida gallinule put up its head among the leaf or take flight as we press too closely upon it but i see they to no advantage and with a single exception they be dumb one bird as it dash into the rush utter two or three cry that sound familiar the florida gallinule be in general pretty silent i think but he have a noisy season then he be indeed noisy enough a swamp contain a single pair might be suppose to be populous with barn-yard fowl the fellow keep up such a clatter : now loud and terror-stricken like a hen whose head be just go to be cut off as a friend once express it then soft and full of content as if the aforesaid hen have lay a egg ten minute before and be still felicitate herself upon the achievement it be vexatious that here in the very home of florida gallinule i should see and hear less of they than i have more than once do in massachusett where they be esteem a pretty choice rarity and where in spite of what i suppose must be call exceptional good luck my acquaintance with they have be limit to perhaps half a dozen bird but in affair of this kind a direct chase be seldom the best reward at one point the boatman pull up to a thicket of small willow bidding I be prepare to see bird in enormous number but we find only a small company of night heron -- evidently breed there -- and a green heron the latter my boy shot before i know what he be do he take my reproof in good part protest that he have have only a glimpse of the bird and have take it for a possible gallinule in the course of the trip we see besides the species already name great blue and little blue heron pied-billed grebe coot cormorant a flock of small sandpiper -lrb- on the wing -rrb- buzzard vulture fish-hawk and innumerable red-winged blackbird three day afterward we go up the river at the upper end of the lake be many white-billed coot -lrb- _ fulica americana _ -rrb- so many that we do we best to count they as they rise flock after flock drag they foot over the water behind they with a multitudinous splashing noise there be a thousand at least they have a air of be not so very shy but they be nobody 's fool see there my boy would exclaim as a hundred or two of they dash past the boat see how they keep just out of range we be hardly on the river itself before he fall into a state of something like frenzy at the sight of a otter swimming before we show its head and then diving he make after it in hot haste and fire i know not how many time but all for nothing he have kill several before now he say but have never be oblige to chase one in this fashion perhaps there be a jonah in the ship for though i sympathize with the boy i sympathize also and still more warmly with the otter it act as if life be dear to it and for aught i know it have as good a right to live as either the boy or i no such qualm disturb I a few minute later when as the boat be grazing the reed i espied just ahead a snake lie in wait among they i give the alarm and the boy look round yes he say a big one a moccasin -- a cotton-mouth but i 'll fix he he pull a stroke or two nearer then lift he oar and bring it down splash but the reed break the blow and the moccasin slip into the water apparently unharmed that be a case for powder and shot florida people have a poor opinion of a man who meet a venomous snake no matter where without do he best to kill it how strong the feeling be my boatman give I proof within ten minute after he failure with the cotton-mouth he have pull out into the middle of the river when i notice a beautiful snake short and rather stout lie coil on the water whether it be a optical illusion i can not say but it seem to I that the creature lay entirely above the surface -- as if it have be a inflated skin rather than a live snake we pass close by it but it make no offer to move only dart out its tongue as the boat slip past i speak to the boy who at once cease rowing i think i must go back and kill that fellow he say why so i ask with surprise for i have look upon it simply as a curiosity oh i do not like to see it live it be the poisonousest snake there be as he speak he turn the boat : but the snake save he further trouble for just then it uncoil and swim directly toward we as if it mean to come aboard oh you be come this way be you say the boy sarcastically well come on the snake come on and when it get well within range he take up he fishing-rod -lrb- with hook at the end for draw game out of the reed and bonnet -rrb- and the next moment the snake lay dead upon the water he slip the end of the pole under it and sling it ashore there how do you like that say he and he head the boat upstream again it be a copper-bellied moccasin he declare whatever that may be and be worse than a rattlesnake on the river as in the creek we be continually explore bay and inlet each with its promising patch of bonnet nearly every such place contain at least one florida gallinule but where be the purple about which we keep talk -- the royal purple concern whose beauty my boy be so eloquent they be not common yet he would say by and by they will be as thick as florida be now but do not they stay here all winter no sir not the purple be you certain about that oh yes sir i have hunt this river too much they could not be here in the winter without my know it i wonder whether he could be right or partly right notwithstanding the book statement to the contrary i notice that mr chapman writing of he experience with this bird at gainesville say none be see until may 25 when in a part of the lake before unvisited -- a mass of float island and ` bonnet ' -- i find they not uncommon the boy 's assertion may be worth record at any rate in one place he fire suddenly and as he put down the gun he exclaim there i 'll bet i have shoot a bird you never see before it have a bill as long as that with one finger lay crosswise upon another he haul the prize into the boat and sure enough it be a novelty -- a king rail new to both of we we have go a little farther and be pass a prairie on which be pool of water where the boy say he have often see large flock of white ibis feed -lrb- there be none there now alas though we creep up with all cautiousness to peep over the bank -rrb- when all at once i descry some sharp-winged strange-looking bird over we head it show sidewise at the moment but a instant later it turn and i see its long fork tail and almost in the same breath its white head a fork-tailed kite and purple gallinule be for the time forget it be perform the most graceful evolution swoop half-way to the earth from a great height and then sweeping upward again another minute and i see a second bird farther away i watch the nearer one till it fade from sight soar and swoop by turn -- its long scissors-shaped tail all the while fully spread -- but never come down as its habit be say to be to skim over the surface of the water there be nothing more beautiful on wing i believe : a large hawk with a swallow 's grace of form color and motion i see it once more -lrb- four bird -rrb- over the st mark 's river and count the sight one of the chief reward of my southern winter at noon we rest and eat we luncheon in the shade of three or four tall palmetto-tree stand by themselves on a broad prairie a place brighten by bed of blue iris and stretch of golden senecio -- homelike as well as pretty both of they then we set out again the day be intensely hot -lrb- march 24 -rrb- and my oarsman be more than half sick with a sudden cold i begged he to take thing easily but he soon experience a almost miraculous renewal of he force in one of the first of we after-dinner bonnet patch he seize he gun fire and begin to shout a purple a purple he draw the bird in as proud as a prince there sir he say do not i tell you it be handsome it have every color there be and indeed it be handsome worthy to be call the sultana with the most exquisite iridescent bluish-purple plumage the leg yellow or greenish-yellow -lrb- a point by which it may be distinguish from the florida gallinule as the bird fly from you -rrb- the bill red tip with pale green and the shield -lrb- on the forehead like a continuation of the upper mandible -rrb- light blue of a peculiar shade just as if it have be paint from that moment the boy be a new creature again and again he speak of he altered feeling he could pull the boat now anywhere i want to go he be perfectly fresh he declare although i think he have already do a pretty good day 's work under that scorch sun i have not imagine how deeply he heart be set upon show I the bird i be after it make I twice as glad to see it dead though it be within a hour on we way homeward we come upon another it spring out of the lily pad and speed toward the tall grass of the shore look look a purple the boy cry see he yellow leg instinctively he raise he gun but i say no it would be inexcusable to shoot a second one and besides we be at that moment approach a bird about which i feel a stronger curiosity -- a snake-bird or water-turkey sit in a willow shrub at the further end of the bay pull I as near it as it will let we come i say i want to see as much of it as possible at every rod or two i stop the boat and put up my glass till we be within perhaps sixty foot of the bird then it take wing but instead of fly away go sweeping about we on get round to the willow again it make as if it would alight utter at the same time some faint ejaculation like ah ah ah but it keep on for a second sweep of the circle then it perch in its old place but face we a little less directly so that i could see the beautiful silver tracery of its wing like the finest of embroidery as i think after we have eye it for some minute we suddenly perceive a second bird ten foot or so from it in full sight where it come from or how -lrb- transcriber 's note : miss page 142 -rrb- too shape like a narrow wedge be unconscionably long and as the bird show against the sky i could think of nothing but a animated sign of addition a better man -- the emperor constantine shall we say -- might have see in it a nobler symbol while we be loitering down the river later in the afternoon a eagle make its appearance far overhead the first one of the day the boy for some reason refuse to believe that it be a eagle nothing but a sight of its white head and tail through the glass could convince he -lrb- the perfectly square _ set _ of the wing as the bird sail be a pretty strong mark at no matter what distance -rrb- presently a osprey not far from we with a fish in he claw set up a violent scream it be because he have catch a fish say the boy he be call he mate no say i it be because the eagle be after he wait a bit in fact the eagle be already in pursuit and the hawk as he always do have begin struggle upward with all he might that be the fish-hawk 's way of appeal to heaven against he oppressor he be safe for that time three negro shad-fisher be just beyond we -lrb- we have see they there in the morning wade about the river set they net -rrb- and at the sight of they and of we i have no doubt the eagle turn away the boy be not peculiar in he notion about the osprey 's scream some one else have tell I that the bird always scream after catch a fish but i know better have see he catch a hundred more or less without utter a sound the safe rule in such case be to listen to all you hear and believe it -- after you have verify it for yourself it be while we be discuss this question i think that the boy open he heart to I about my method of study he have look through the glass now and then and of course have be astonish at its power why he say finally i never have any idea it could be so much fun just to look at bird in the way you do i like the turn of he phrase it seem to say yes i begin to see through it we be in the same boat this that you call study be only another kind of sport i could have shake hand with he but that he have the oar who do not love to be flatter by a ingenuous boy all in all the day have be one to be remember in addition to the bird already name -- three of they new to I -- we have see great blue heron little blue heron louisiana heron night heron cormorant pied-billed grebe kingfisher red-winged blackbird boat-tailed grackle redpoll and myrtle warbler savanna sparrow tree swallow purple martin a few meadow lark and the ubiquitous turkey buzzard the boat-tail abound along the river bank and with they tameness and they ridiculous outcry keep we amuse whenever there be nothing else to absorb we attention the prairie land through which the river meander prove to be surprisingly dry and passable -lrb- the water be unusually low the boy say -rrb- with many cattle pasture upon they here we find the savanna sparrow here too the meadow lark be sing it be a hard pull across the rough lake against the wind -lrb- a dangerous sheet of water for flat-bottomed rowboat i be tell afterward -rrb- but the boy be equal to it protest that he do not feel tire a bit now we have get the purple and if he do not catch the fever from drink some quart of river water -lrb- a big bottle of coffee have prove to be only a drop in the bucket -rrb- against my urgent remonstrance and he own judgment i be sure he look back upon the labor as on the whole well spend he be go north in the spring he tell I may joy be with he wherever he be the next morning i take the steamer down the river to blue spring a distance of some thirty mile on my way back to new smyrna to a place where there be accessible wood a beach and not least a daily sea breeze the river in that part of its course be comfortably narrow -- a great advantage -- wind through cypress swamp hammock wood stretch of prairie and in one place a pine barren a interesting and in many way beautiful country but so unwholesome look as to lose much of its attractiveness three or four large alligator lay sun themselves in the most obliging manner upon the bank here one and there one to the vociferous delight of the passenger who run from one side of the deck to the other as the captain shout and point one he tell we be thirteen foot long the largest in the river each appear to have its own well-worn sunning-spot and all i believe keep they place as if the passing of the big steamer -- almost too big for the river at some of the sharper turn -- have come to seem a commonplace event heron in the usual variety be present with osprey a eagle kingfisher ground dove carolina dove blackbird -lrb- red-wing and boat-tail -rrb- tree swallow purple martin and a single wild turkey the first one i have ever see it be near the bank of the river on a bushy prairie fully expose and crouch as the steamer pass for a massachusett ornithologist the mere sight of such a bird be enough to make a pretty good thanksgiving day blue yellow-backed warbler be singing here and there and i retain a particular remembrance of one bluebird that warble to we from the pine-wood the captain tell I somewhat to my surprise that he have see two flock of paroquet during the winter -lrb- they have be very abundant along the river within he time he say -rrb- but for I there be no such fortune one bird soar in company with a buzzard at a most extraordinary height straight over the river greatly excited my curiosity the captain declare that it must be a great blue heron but he have never see one thus engage nor so far as i can learn have any one else ever do so its upper part seem to be mostly white and i can only surmise that it may have be a sandhill crane a bird which be say to have such a habit as i leave the boat i have a little experience of the seamy side of southern travel nothing to be angry about perhaps but annoy nevertheless on a hot day i surrender my check to the purser of the boat and the deck hand put my trunk upon the landing at blue spring but there be no one there to receive it and the station be lock we have miss the noon train with which we be advertise to connect by so many hour that i have cease to think about it finally a negro one of several who be fishing thereabout advise I to go up to the house which he point out behind some wood and see the agent this i do and the agent in turn advise I to walk up the track to the junction and be sure to tell the conductor when the evening train arrive as it probably would do some hour later that i have a trunk at the landing otherwise the train would not run down to the river and my baggage would lie there till Monday he would go down presently and put it under cover happily he fulfil he promise for it be already begin to thunder and soon it rain in torrent with a cold wind that make the hot weather all at once a thing of the past it be a long wait in the dreary little station or rather it would have be have not the tedium of it be relieve by the presence of a newly marry couple whose honeymoon be just then at the full they delight in each other be exuberant effervescent beatific -- what shall i say -- quite beyond veil or restraint at first i bestow upon they sidewise and cornerwise glance only hide bashfully behind my spectacles as it be and pretend to see nothing but i soon perceive that i be to they of no more consequence than a fly on the wall if they see I which sometimes seem doubtful -- for love be blind -- they evidently think I too sensible or too old to mind a little billing and cooing and they be right in they opinion what be i in florida for if not for the study of natural history and truly i have seldom see even among bird a pair less sophisticated less cabine and confine by that disastrous knowledge of good and evil which be commonly understand to have result from the eating of forbid fruit and which among prudish people go by the name of modesty it be refreshing charle lamb himself would have enjoy it and i should hope would have add some qualify footnote to a certain unamiable essay of he concern the behavior of married people on the st augustine road one of my first inquiry at tallahassee be for the easiest way to the wood the city be build on a hill with other hill about it these be mostly under cultivation and such wood as lay within sight seem to be pretty far off and with the mercury at ninety in the shade long tramp be almost out of the question take the st augustine road say the man to whom i have speak and he point out its begin nearly opposite the state capitol after breakfast i follow he advice with result so please that i find myself turn that corner again and again as long as i remain in tallahassee the road go abruptly downhill to the railway track first between deep red gulch and then between row of negro cabin each with its garden of rosebush now -lrb- early April -rrb- in full bloom the deep side of the gulch be drape with pendent lantana branch full of purple flower or more beautiful still with a profusion of fragrant white honeysuckle on the roadside between the wheel-track and the gulch grow brilliant mexican poppy with venus 's looking-glass yellow oxali and bed of blackberry vine the wood of which my informant have speak lay a little beyond the railway on the right hand of the road just as it begin another ascent i enter they at once and after a semicircular turn through the pleasant path amid live-oaks water-oak red oak chestnut oak magnolia beech hickory hornbeam sweet gum sweet bay and long-leaved and short-leaved pine come out into the road again a quarter of a mile farther up the hill they be the fairest of wood to stroll in it seem to I with path enough and not too many and good enough but not too good that be to say they be footpath not road though afterwards on a Sunday afternoon i meet two young fellow ride through they on bicycle the wood be delightful also after my two month in eastern florida for lie on a slope and for have a undergrowth of loose shrubbery instead of a jungle of scrub oak and see palmetto blue jay and crested flycatcher be do they best to outscream one another -- with the odds in favor of the flycatcher -- and a few smaller bird be singing especially two or three summer tanager as many yellow-throated warbler and a ruby-crowned kinglet in one part of the wood near what i take to be a old city reservoir i come upon a single white-throated sparrow and a humming-bird -- the latter a strangely uncommon sight in tallahassee where of all the place i have ever see it ought to find itself in clover here too be a pair of carolina wren just now in search of a building-site and conduct themselves exactly in the manner of bluebird intent on such business peep into every hole that offer itself and then after the briefest interchange of opinion -- unfavorable on the female 's part if we may guess -- conclude to look a little farther as i strike the road again a man come along on horseback and we fall into conversation about the country a lovely country he call it and i agree with he he inquire where i be from and i mention that i have lately be in southern florida and find this region a strong contrast yes he return and point to the grass he remark upon the richness of the soil this yere land would fertilize that he say speaking of southern florida i should not wonder say i i mean to be understand as concur in he opinion but such a qualify yankeefied assent seem to he no assent at all oh it will it will he respond as if the point be one about which i must on no account be leave unconvinced he tell I that the fine house at which i have look a little distance back through a long vista of tree be the residence of captain h who own all the land along the road for a good distance i inquire how far the road be pretty like this for forty mile he say that be farther than i be ready to walk and come soon to the top of the hill or more exactly of the plateau i stop in the shade of a china-tree and look at the please prospect behind I be a plantation of young pear-tree and before I among the hill northward lay broad cultivate slope dot here and there with cabin and tall solitary tree on the nearer slope perhaps a sixteenth of a mile away a negro be plough with a single ox harness in some primitive manner -- with piece of wood for the most part as well as i could make out through a opera-glass the soil offer the least possible hindrance and both he and the ox seem to be have a literal walk-over beyond he -- a full half-mile away perhaps -- another man be plough with a mule and in another direction a third be do likewise with a woman follow in he wake a color boy of seventeen -- i guess he age at twenty-three -- come up the road in a cart and i stop he to inquire about the crop and other matter the land in front of I be plant with cotton he say and the man plough in the distance be get ready to plant the same they hire the land and the cabin of captain h pay he so much cotton -lrb- not so much a acre but so much a mule if i understand he rightly -rrb- by way of rent we talk a long time about one thing and another he have be south as far as the indian river country but be glad to be back again in tallahassee where he be bear i ask he about the road how far it go they tell I it go smack to st augustine he reply i be not try it it be a unlikely story it seem to I but i be assure afterward that he be right that the road actually run across the country from tallahassee to st augustine a distance of about two hundred mile with company of my own choosing and in cooler weather i think i should like to walk its whole length -lrb- 1 -rrb- my young man be in no haste with the rein -lrb- make of rope after a fashion much follow in florida -rrb- lie on the forward axle of he cart he seem to have put himself entirely at my service he have to the full that peculiar urbanity which i begin after a while to look upon as characteristic of tallahassee negro -- a gentleness of speech and a kindly deferential air neither forward nor servile such as sit well on any man whatever the color of he skin -lrb- footnote 1 : but let no enthusiast set out to walk from one city to the other on the strength of what be here write after this sketch be first print -- in _ the atlantic monthly _ -- a gentleman who ought to know whereof he speak send I word that my informant be all of they wrong -- that the road do not run to st augustine for myself i assert nothing as my color boy say i be not try it -rrb- in that respect he be like another boy of about he own age who live in the cabin directly before we but whom i do not see till i have be several time over the road then he happen to be at work near the edge of the field and i beckoned he to I he too be serious and manly in he bearing and show no disposition to go back to he hoe till i break off the interview -- as if it be a point of good manners with he to await my pleasure yes the plantation be a good one and easily cultivate he say in response to some remark of my own there be five in the family and they all work we be all big enough to eat he add quite simply he have never be north but have lately decline the offer of a gentleman who wish to take he there -- he and another fellow he once go to jacksonville but could not stay you can get along without you father pretty well but it be another thing to do without you mother he never mean to leave home again as long as he mother live which be likely to be for some year i think if she be still able to do she part in the cotton-field as a general thing the color tenant of the cabin make out pretty well he believe unless something happen to the crop as for the old servant of the h family they do not have to work -- they be provide for captain h 's father leave it so in he testimonial i speak of the purple martin which be fly back and forth over the field with many cheerful noise and of the calabash that hang from a tall pole in one corner of the cabin yard for they accommodation on my way south i tell he i have notice these dangling long-necked squash everywhere and have wonder what they be for i have find out since that they be the color man 's martin-box and be glad to see the people so fond of the bird yes he say there be no danger of hawk carry off the chicken as long as the martin be round twice afterward as i go up the road i find he plough between the cotton row but he be too far away to be accost without shout and i do not feel justified in interrupt he at he work back and forth he go through the long furrow after the patient ox the hen and chicken follow no doubt they think the work be all for they benefit farther away a man and two woman be hoe the family deserve to prosper i say to myself as i lay under a big magnolia-tree -lrb- just begin to open its large white flower -rrb- and idly enjoy the scene and it be just here by the bye that i solve a interesting etymological puzzle to wit the origin and precise meaning of the word baygall -- a word which the visitor often hear upon the lip of florida people a old hunter in smyrna when i question he about it tell I that it mean a swampy piece of wood and take its origin he have always suppose from the fact that bay-tree and gall-bush commonly grow in such place a tallahassee gentleman agree with this explanation and promise to bring home some gall-berry the next time he come across any that i might see what they be but the berry be never forthcoming and i be none the wiser till on one of my last trip up the st augustine road as i stand under the large magnolia just mention a color man come along hat in hand and a bag of grain balance on he head that be a large magnolia say i he assent that be about as large as magnolia ever grow be not it no sir down in the gall there be magnolia a heap bigger 'n that a gall what be that a baygall sir and what be a baygall a big wood and why do you call it a baygall he be stump it be plain to see no doubt he would have scratch he head if that useful organ have be accessible he hesitate but it be not like a uneducated man to confess ignorance 'cause it be a desert he say a thick _ place _ yes yes i answer and he resume he march the road be travel mostly by negro on Sunday afternoon it look quite like a flower garden it be so full of bright dress come home from church now ' - day folk git religion so easy one young woman say to another as they pass I she be a conservative i do not join the procession but on other day i talk first and last with a good many of the people from the preacher who carry a handsome cane and make I a still handsomer bow down to a serious little fellow of six or seven year whom i find standing at the foot of the hill beside a bundle of dead wood he be carry it home for the family stove and have set it down for a minute 's rest i say something about he burden and as i go on he call after I : what kind of bird be you hunting for ricebird i answer that i be look for bird of all sort have he see any ricebird lately yes he say he start a flock the other day up on -lrb- 1 -rrb- the hill how do they look say i they be red blackbird he return this be not the first time i have hear the redwing call the ricebird but how do the boy know I for a bird-gazer that be a mystery it come over I all at once that possibly i have become better know in the community than i have in the least suspect and then i remember my field-glass that as i could not help be aware be a object of continual attention every day i see people old and young black and white look at it with undisguised curiosity often they pass audible comment upon it among themselves how far can you see through the spyglass a bolder spirit would now and then venture to ask and once on the railway track out in the pine land a barefooted happy-faced urchin make a guess that be really admirable for its ingenuity look like you be goin ' over inspectin ' the wire he remark on rare occasion as a act of special grace i offer such a inquirer a peep through the magic lens -- a experiment that never fail to elicit exclamation of wonder thing be so near and the observer look comically incredulous on put down the glass to find how suddenly the landscape have slip away again more than one color man want to know its price and express a fervent desire to possess one like it and probably if i have ever be assault and rob in all my solitary wanderings through the flat-wood and other lonesome place my spyglass rather than my purse -- the lust of the eye rather than the pride of life -- would have be to thank -lrb- footnote 1 : he do not say upon any more than northern white boy do -rrb- here however there could be no thought of such a contingency here be no vagabond -lrb- one inoffensive yankee specimen except -rrb- but hard-working people go into the city or out again each on he own lawful business scarcely one of they man or woman but greet I kindly one a white man on horseback invite and even urge I to mount he horse and let he walk a piece i must be fatigue he be sure -- how could i help it -- and he would as soon walk as not find I obstinate he walk he horse at my side chat about the country the tree and the crop he it be who call my particular attention to the abundance of blackberry vine be the berry sweet i ask he smack he lip sweet as honey and big as that measure off a liberal portion of he thumb i speak of they half a hour later to a middle-aged color man yes he say the blackberry be plenty enough and sweet enough but for he part he do not trouble they a great deal the vine -lrb- and he point at they fringe the roadside indefinitely -rrb- be great place for rattlesnake he like the berry but he like somebody else to pick they he be awfully afraid of snake they be so dangerous yes sir -lrb- this in answer to a inquiry -rrb- there be plenty of rattlesnake here clean up to christmas i like he for he frank avowal of cowardice and still more for he quiet bearing he remember the day of slavery -- before the surrender as the current southern phrase be -- and he face beam when i speak of my joy in think that he people be free no matter what might befall they he too raise cotton on hire land and be bring up he child -- there be eight of they he say -- to habit of industry my second stroll toward st augustine carry I perhaps three mile -- say one sixty-sixth of the entire distance -- and none of my subsequent excursion take I any farther and have just now commend a negro for he candor i be move to acknowledge that between the sand underfoot and the sun overhead i find the six mile which i spend at least four hour in accomplish more fatiguing than twice that distance would have be over new hampshire hill if i be to settle in that country i should probably fall into the way of ride more and walk less i remember think how comfortable a certain ponderous black mammy look whom i meet on one of these same sunny and sandy tramp she sit in the very middle of a tipcart with a old and truly picturesque man 's hat on she head -lrb- quite in the fashion feminine reader will notice -rrb- drive a one-horned ox with a pair of clothes-line rein she be travel slowly just as i like to travel and as i say i be impress by she comfortable appearance why would not a equipage like that be just the thing for a naturalistic idler not far beyond my halting-place of two day before i come to a cherokee rosebush one of the most beautiful of plant -- white fragrant single rose -lrb- _ real _ rose -rrb- set in the midst of the handsomest of glossy green leaf i be delighted to find it still in flower a hundred mile farther south i have see it finish its season a full month earlier i stop of course to pluck a blossom at that moment a female redbird fly out of the bush she mate be beside she instantly and a nameless something in they manner tell I they be try to keep a secret the nest build mainly of pine needle and other leaf be in the middle of the bush a foot or two from the grass and contain two bluish or greenish egg thickly spatter with dark brown i mean to look into it again -lrb- the owner seem to have no great objection -rrb- but somehow miss it every time i pass from that point as far as i go the road be line with cherokee rose -- not continuously but with short intermission and from the number of redbird see almost invariably in pair i feel safe in say that the nest i have find be probably one of fifteen or twenty scatter along the wayside how gloriously the bird sing it be they day for singing i be ready to christen the road anew -- redbird road but the redbird many and conspicuous as they be have no monopoly of the road or of the day house wren be equally numerous and equally at home though they sing more out of sight red-eyed chewink still far from they native berry pasture hop into a bush to cry who be he at the passing of a stranger in whom for aught i know they may have half recognize a old acquaintance a bunch of quail run across the road a little in front of I and in another place fifteen or twenty red-winged blackbird -lrb- not a red wing among they -rrb- sit gossip in a treetop elsewhere even later than this -lrb- it be now April 7 -rrb- i see flock every bird of which wear shoulder-strap -- like the traditional militia company all officer _ they _ do not gossip of course -lrb- it be the male that sport the red -rrb- but they make a lively noise as for the mocking-bird they be at the front here as they be everywhere during my fortnight in tallahassee there be never many consecutive five minute of daylight in which if i stop to listen i could not hear at least one mocker oftener two or three be singing at once in as many different direction and speaking of they i must speak also of they more northern cousin from the day i enter florida i have be say that the mocking-bird save for he occasional mimicry of other bird sing so exactly like the thrasher that i do not believe i could tell one from the other now however on this st augustine road i suddenly become aware of a bird singing somewhere in advance and as i listen again i say aloud with full persuasion there that be a thrasher there be a something of difference : a shade of coarseness in the voice perhaps a tendency to force the tone as we say of human singer -- a _ something _ at all event and the longer i hearken the more confident i feel that the bird be a thrasher and so it be -- the first one i have hear in florida although i have see many probably the two bird have peculiarity of voice and method that with longer familiarity on the listener 's part would render they easily distinguishable on general principle i must believe that to be true of all bird but the experience just describe be not to be take as prove that _ i _ have any such familiarity within a week afterward while walk along the railway i come upon a thrasher and a mocking-bird singing side by side the mocker upon a telegraph pole and the thrasher on the wire halfway between the mocker and the next pole they sing and sing while i stand between they in the cut below and listen and if my life have depend on my see how one song differ from the other i could not have do it with my eye shut the bird might have change place -- if they could have do it quickly enough -- and i should have be none the wiser as i have say i follow the road over the nearly level plateau for what i guess to be about three mile then i find myself in a bit of hollow that seem make for a stopping-place with a plantation road run off to the right and a hillside cornfield of many acre on the leave in the field be a few tall dead tree at the tip of one sit a sparrow-hawk and to the trunk of another clung a red-bellied woodpecker who with characteristic foolishness sit beside he hole call persistently and then as if determine to publish what other bird so carefully conceal go inside thrust out he head and resume he clatter here too be a pair of bluebird noticeable for they rarity and for the wonderful color -- a shade deeper than be ever see at the north i think -- of the male 's blue coat in a small thicket in the hollow beside the road be noisy white-eyed vireo a ruby-crowned kinglet -- a tiny thing that within a month would be singing in canada or beyond -- a unseen wood pewee and -lrb- also unseen -rrb- a hermit thrush one of perhaps twenty solitary individual that i find scatter about the wood in the course of my journeying not one of they sing a note probably they do not know that there be a yankee in florida who -- in some mood at least -- would have give more for a dozen bar of hermit thrush music than for a day and a night of the mocking-bird 's medley not that i mean to disparage the great southern performer as a vocalist he be so far beyond the hermit thrush as to render a comparison absurd but what i love be a _ singer _ a voice to reach the soul a old tallahassee negro near the white norman school -- so he call it -- hit off the mocking-bird pretty well i have call he attention to one singing in a adjacent dooryard yes he say i love to hear 'em they 's very amusin ' very amusin ' my own feeling can hardly be a prejudice conscious or unconscious in favor of what have grow dear to I through early and long-continued association the difference between the music of bird like the mocker the thrasher and the catbird and that of bird like the hermit the veery and the wood thrush be one of kind not of degree and i have hear music of the mocking-bird 's kind -lrb- the thrasher 's that be to say -rrb- as long as i have hear music at all the question be one of taste it be true but it be not a question of familiarity or favoritism all praise to the mocker and the thrasher may they tribe increase but if we be to indulge in comparison give I the wood thrush the hermit and the veery with tone that the mocking-bird can never imitate and a simplicity which the fate -- the wise fate who will have variety -- have put forever beyond he appreciation and he reach florida as i see it -lrb- let the qualification be note -rrb- be no more a land of flower than new england in some respects indeed it be less so flowering shrub and climber there be in abundance i ride in the car through mile on mile of flowering dogwood and pink azalea here on this tallahassee road be mile of cherokee rose with plenty of the climb scarlet honeysuckle -lrb- beloved of humming-birds although i see none here -rrb- and nearer the city as already describe mass of lantana and white honeysuckle in more than one place pink double rose -lrb- vagrant from cultivate grounds no doubt -rrb- offer bud and bloom to all who would have they the cross-vine -lrb- _ bignonium _ -rrb- less freehanded hang its showy bell out of reach in the treetop thorn-bush of several kind be in flower -lrb- a puzzling lot -rrb- and the treelike blueberry -lrb- _ vaccinium arboreum _ -rrb- load with its large flare white corolla be a real spectacle of beauty here likewise i find one tiny crab-apple shrub with a few blossom exquisitely tint with rose-color and most exquisitely fragrant but the new englander when he talk of wild flower have in he eye something different from these he be not think of any bush no matter how beautiful but of trail arbutus hepatica bloodroot anemone saxifrage violet dogtooth violet spring beauty cowslip buttercup corydali columbine dutchman 's breeches clintonia five-finger and all the rest of that bright and fragrant host which ever since he can remember he have see cover he native hill and valley with the return of may it be not mean of course that plant like these be wholly want in florida i remember a abundance of violet blue and white especially in the flat-wood where also i often find pretty butterwort of two or three sort the smaller blue one take very acceptably the place of hepatica and indeed i hear they call by that name but as compare with what one see in new england such ground flower flower which it seem perfectly natural to pluck for a nosegay be very little in evidence i hear northern visitor remark the fact again and again on this pretty road out of tallahassee -- itself a city of flower garden -- i can recall nothing of the kind except half a dozen strawberry blossom and the oxali and specularium before mention probably the round-leaved houstonium grow here as it do everywhere in small scatter patch if there be violet as well i can only say i have forget they be it add however that at the time i do not miss they in a garden of rose one do not begin by sigh for mignonette and lily of the valley violet or no violet there be no lack of beauty the southern highway surveyor if such a personage exist be evidently not consume by that distressing puritanical passion for slick up thing which too often make of he northern brother something scarcely better than a public nuisance at the south you will not find a woman cultivate with pain a few exotic beside the front door while she husband be mow and burn the far more attractive wild garden that nature have plant just outside the fence the st augustine road at any rate after climb the hill and get beyond the wood run between natural hedge -- tree vine and shrub carelessly intermingle -- not dense enough to conceal the prospect or shut out the breeze -lrb- straight from the gulf as the tallahassean be careful to inform you -rrb- but sufficient to afford much welcome protection from the sun here it be good to find the sassafras grow side by side with the persimmon although when for old acquaintance ' sake i put a leaf into my mouth i be half glad to fancy it a thought less savory than some i have taste in yankeeland i take a kind of foolish satisfaction too in the obvious fact that certain plant -- the sumach and the virginium creeper to mention no other -- be less at home here than a thousand mile farther north with the wild-cherry tree i be oblige to confess the case be reverse i have see larger one in massachusett perhaps but none that look half so clean and thrifty in truth they appearance be a puzzle rum-cherry tree as by all token they undoubtedly be till of a sudden it flash upon I that there be no caterpillar ' nest in they then i cease to wonder at they odd look it speak well for my botanical acumen that i have recognize they at all before i have be a week in tallahassee i find that without forethought or plan i have drop into the habit -lrb- and how pleasant it be to think that some good habit _ can _ be drop into -rrb- of make the st augustine road my after-dinner sauntering-place the morning be for a walk : to lake bradford perhaps in search of a mythical ivory-billed woodpecker or westward on the railway for a few mile with a view to rare migratory warbler but in the afternoon i do not walk -- i loiter and though i still mind the bird and flower i for the most part forget my botany and ornithology in the cool of the day then -lrb- the phrase be a innocent euphemism -rrb- i climb the hill and after a hour or two on the plateau stroll back again face the sunset through a vista of moss-covered live-oak and sweet gum those quiet incurious hour be among the pleasantest of all my florida memory a cuckoo would be coo perhaps or a quail with cheerful ambiguity -- such as belong to weather prediction in general -- would be prophesy more wet and no more wet in alternate breath or two or three night-hawk would be sweep back and forth high above the valley or a marsh hawk would be quarter over the big oatfield the martin would be cackle in any event and the kingbird practice they aerial mock somersault and the mocking-bird would be singing and the redbird whistle on the western slope just below the oatfield the northern woman who own the pretty cottage there -lrb- the only one on the road -rrb- be sure to be at work among she flower a laughing color boy who do chore for she -lrb- without injury to he health i could warrant -rrb- tell I that she be a northerner but i know it already i need no witness but she bed of petunia in the valley as i cross the railroad track a loggerhead shrike sit almost of course on the telegraph wire in dignified silence and just beyond among the cabin i have my choice of mocking-bird and orchard oriole and so admire the rose and the pomegranate the lantana and the honeysuckle or chat with some dusky fellow-pilgrim i mount the hill to the city and likely as not saw before I a red-headed woodpecker sit on the roof of the state house call attention to he patriotic self -- in he tri-colored dress -- by occasional vigorous tattoo on the tinned ridgepole i never see he there without gladness the legislature have begin its session in a economical mood -- as be more or less the habit of legislature i believe -- and be even consider a proposition to reduce the salary and mileage of its member under such circumstance it ought not to have be a matter of surprise perhaps that no flag float from the cupola of the capitol the people 's money should not be waste and possibly i should never have remark the omission but for a certain curiosity natural if not inevitable on the part of a northern visitor as to the real feeling of the south toward the national government day after day i have see a portly gentleman -- with a air or with air as the spectator might choose to express it -- go in and out of the state house gate dress ostentatiously in a suit of confederate gray he have worn nothing else since the war i be tell but of course the state of florida be not to be judge by the freak of one man and he only a member of the third house and even when i go into the governor 's office and see the original ordinance of secession hanging in a conspicuous place on the wall as if it be a heirloom to be proud of i feel no stir of sectional animosity thorough-bred massachusett yankee and old-fashioned abolitionist as i be a brave people can hardly be expect or desire to forget its history especially when that history have to do with sacrifice and heroic deed but these thing take together do no doubt prepare I to look upon it as a happy coincidence when one morning i hear the familiar cry of the red-headed woodpecker for the first time in florida and look up to see he fly the national color from the ridgepole of the state house i do not break out with three cheer for the red white and blue i be naturally undemonstrative but i say to myself that _ melanerpe erythrocephalus _ be a very handsome bird ornithology on a cotton plantation on one of my first jaunt into the suburb of tallahassee i notice not far from the road a bit of swamp -- shallow pool with muddy border and flat it be a likely spot for wader and would be worth a visit to reach it indeed i must cross a plant field surround by a lofty barbed-wire fence and placard against trespasser but there be no one in sight or no one who look at all like a land-owner and besides it could hardly be account a trespass -- define by blackstone as a _ unwarranted _ entry on another 's soil -- to step carefully over the cotton row on so legitimate a errand ordinarily i call myself a simple bird-gazer a amateur a field naturalist if you will but on occasion like the present i assume -- with myself that be -- all the rights and title of a ornithologist proper a man of science strictly so call in the interest of science then i climb the fence and pick my way across the field true enough about the edge of the water be two or three solitary sandpiper and at least half a dozen of the smaller yellowleg -- two addition to my florida list -- not to speak of a little blue heron and a green heron the latter in most uncommonly green plumage it be well i have interpret the placard a little generously the letter killeth be a pretty good text in emergency of this kind so i say to myself the heron meanwhile have take french leave but the smaller bird be less suspicious i watch they at my leisure and leave they still feed two day later i be there again but it must be acknowledge that this time i tarry in the road till a man on horseback have disappear round the next turn it would have be manlier without doubt to pay no attention to he but something tell I that he be the cotton-planter himself and for better or worse prudence carry the day with I find nothing new though the sandpiper and yellowleg be still present with a very handsome little blue heron and plenty of blackbird i take the road again and go further and a hour or two afterward on get back to the same place be overtake again by the horseman he pull up he horse and bid I good-afternoon would i lend he my opera-glass which happen to be in my hand at the moment i should like to see how my house look from here he say and he point across the field to a house on the hill some distance beyond ah say i glad to set myself right by a piece of frankness that under the circumstance could hardly work to my disadvantage then it be you land on which i have be trespassing how so he ask with a smile and i explain that i have be across he cotton-field a little while before that be no trespass he answer -lrb- so the reader will perceive that i have be quite correct in my understanding of the law -rrb- and when i go on to explain my object in visit he cane-swamp -lrb- for such it be he say but a unexpected freshet have ruin the crop when it be barely out of the ground -rrb- he assure I that i be welcome to visit it as often as i wish he himself be very fond of natural history and often regret that he have not give time to it in he youth as it be he protect the bird on he plantation and the place be full of they i should find he wood interesting he feel sure florida be extremely rich in bird he believe there be some that have never be classify we have oriole here he add and so far at any rate he be right i have see perhaps twenty that day -lrb- orchard oriole that be -rrb- and one sit in a tree before we at the moment he whole manner be most kindly and hospitable -- as be that of every tallahassean with whom i have occasion to speak -- and i tell he with sincere gratitude that i should certainly avail myself of he courtesy and stroll through he wood i approach they two morning afterward from the opposite side where find no other place of entrance i climb a six-barred tightly lock gate -- feel all the while like a thief and a robber -- in front of a desert cabin then i have only to cross a grassy field in which meadow lark be singing and i be in the wood i wander through they without find anything more unusual or interesting than summer tanager and yellow-throated warbler which be in song there as they be in every such place and after a while come out into a pleasant glade from which different part of the plantation could be see and through which run a plantation road here be a wooden fence -- a most unusual thing -- and i lose no time in mount it to rest and look about I it be one of the mark of a true yankee i suspect to like such a perch my own weakness in that direction be a frequent subject of mirth with chance fellow traveler the attitude be comfortable and conducive to meditation and now that i be seat and at my ease i feel that this be one of the new england luxury which almost without know it i have miss ever since i leave home of my meditation on this particular occasion i remember nothing but that be no sign they be valueless as it be no sign that yesterday 's dinner do I no good because i have forget what it be in the latter case indeed and perhaps in the former as well it would seem more reasonable to draw a exactly opposite inference but quibble apart one thing i do remember : i sit for some time on the fence in the shade of a tree with a eye upon the cane-swamp and a ear open for bird-voice yes and it come to I at this moment that here i hear the first and only bull-frog that i hear anywhere in florida it be like a voice from home and belong with the fence other frog i have hear in other place one chorus bring I out of bed in daytona -- in the evening -- after a succession of February dog-day shower what be that noise outside i inquire of the landlady as i hasten downstairs that say she with a look of amusement that be frog it _ may _ be i thought but i follow the sound till they lead I in the darkness to the edge of a swamp no doubt the creature be frog but of some kind new to I with voice more lugubrious and homesick than i should have suppose could possibly belong to any batrachian a week or two later in the new smyrna flat-wood i hear in the distance a sound which i take for the grunting of pig i make a note of it mentally as a cheerful token indicative of a probable scarcity of rattlesnake but by and by as i draw nearer the truth of the matter begin to break upon I a man be approach and when we meet i ask he what be make that noise yonder frog he say at another time in the flat-wood of port orange -lrb- i hope i be not tax my reader 's credulity too far or make myself out a man of too imaginative a ear -rrb- i hear the bleating of sheep busy with other thing i do not stop to reflect that it be impossible there should be sheep in that quarter and the occurrence have quite pass out of my mind when one day a cracker talk about frog happen to say yes and we have one kind that make a noise exactly like the bleating of sheep that without question be what i have hear in the flat-wood but this frog in the sugar-cane swamp be the same fellow that on summer evening ever and ever so many year ago in sonorous bass that could be hear a quarter of a mile away use to call from reuben loud 's pond pull he in pull he in or sometimes -lrb- the inconsistent amphibian -rrb- jug o ' rum jug o ' rum i dismount from my perch at last and be saunter idly along the path -lrb- idleness like this be often the best of ornithological industry -rrb- when suddenly i have a vision before I in the leafy top of a oak sapling sit a blue grosbeak i know he on the instant but i could see only he head and neck the rest of he body be hide by the leave it be a moment of feverish excitement here be a new bird a bird about which i have feel fifteen year of curiosity and more than that a bird which here and now be quite unexpected since it be not include in either of the two florida list that i have bring with I from home for perhaps five seconds i have my opera-glass on the blue head and the thick-set dark bill with its lighter-colored under mandible then i hear the clatter of a horse 's hoof and lift my eye my friend the owner of the plantation be come down the road at a gallop straight upon I if i be to see the grosbeak and make sure of he it must be do at once i move to bring he fully into view and he fly into the thick of a pine-tree out of sight but the tree be not far off and if mr -- would pass I with a nod the case be still far from hopeless a bright thought come to I i run from the path with a great show of eager absorption level my glass upon the pine-tree and stand fix perhaps mr -- would take the hint alas he have too much courtesy to pass he own guest without speak still after the bird he say as he check he horse i respond as i hope without any symptom of annoyance then of course he wish to know what i be look at and i tell he that a blue grosbeak have just fly into that pine-tree and that i be most distressingly anxious to see more of he he look at the pine-tree i can not see he he say no more could i it be not a blue jay be it he ask and then we talk of one thing and another i have no idea what till he ride away to another part of the plantation where a gang of woman be at work by this time the grosbeak have disappear utterly possibly he have go to a bit of wood on the opposite side of the cane-swamp i scale a barbed-wire fence and make in that direction but to no purpose the grosbeak be go for good probably i should never see another could the planter have read my thought just then he would perhaps have be angry with himself and pretty certainly he would have be angry with I that a yankee should accept he hospitality and then load he with curse and call he all manner of name how should he know that i be so insane a hobbyist as to care more for the sight of a new bird than for all the law and custom of ordinary politeness as my feeling cool i see that i be step over hill or row of some strange-looking plant just out of the ground peanut i guess but to make sure i call to a color woman who be hoe not far off what be these pinder she answer i know she mean peanut -- otherwise ground-pea and goober -- and now that i once more have a dictionary at my elbow i learn that the word like goober be or be suppose to be of african origin i be prepare to surmount the barbed-wire fence again when the planter return and halt for another chat it be evident that he take a genuine and amiable interest in my research there be a great many kind of sparrow in that country he say and also of woodpecker he know the ivory-bill but like other tallahassean he think i should have to go into lafayette county -lrb- all florida people say la_fay_ette -rrb- to find it that bird call now be a bee-bird he say refer to a kingbird and we have a bird that be call the french mocking-bird he catch other bird the last remark be of interest for its bearing upon a point about which i have feel some curiosity and i may say some skepticism as i have see many loggerhead shrike but have observe no indication that other bird fear they or hold any grudge against they as he ride off he call my attention to a great blue heron just then fly over the swamp they be very shy he say then from further away he shout once more to ask if i hear the mocking-bird singing yonder point with he whip in the direction of the singer for some time longer i hang about the glade vainly hope that the grosbeak would again favor my eye then i cross more plant field -- climb more barbed-wire fence and stop on the way to enjoy the sweetly quaint music of a little chorus of white-crowned sparrow -- and skirt once more the muddy shore of the cane-swamp where the yellowleg and sandpiper be still feed that bring I to the road from which i have make my entry to the place some day before but be still unable to forego a splendid possibility i recross the plantation tarry again in the glade sit again on the wooden fence -lrb- if that grosbeak only _ would _ show himself -rrb- and thence go on pick a few head of handsome buffalo clover the first i have ever see and some spray of penstemon till i come again to the six-barred gate and the quincy road at that point as i now remember the air be full of vulture -lrb- carrion crow -rrb- a hundred or more soar over the field in some fit of gregariousness along the road be white-crowned and white-throated sparrow -lrb- it be the 12th of April -rrb- orchard oriole thrasher summer tanager myrtle and paim warbler cardinal grosbeak mocking-birds kingbird logger-head yellow -- throated vireo and sundry other but not the blue grosbeak which would have be worth they all once back at the hotel i open my coue 's key to refresh my memory as to the exact appearance of that bird feather around base of bill black say the book i have not notice that but no matter the bird be a blue grosbeak for the sufficient reason that it could not be anything else a black line between the almost black beak and the dark-blue head would be inconspicuous at the best and quite naturally would escape a glimpse so hasty as mine have be and yet while i reason in this way i foresaw plainly enough that as time pass doubt would get the better of assurance as it always do and i should never be certain that i have not be the victim of some illusion at best the evidence be worth nothing for other if only that excellent mr -- for whose kindness i be unfeignedly thankful -lrb- and whose pardon i most sincerely beg if i seem to have be a bit too free in this rehearsal of the story -rrb- -- if only mr -- could have leave I alone for ten minute longer the worry and the imprecation be waste after all as heaven be thank they so often be for within two or three day i see other blue grosbeak and hear they sing but that be not on a cotton plantation and be part of another story a florida shrine all pilgrim to tallahassee visit the murat place it be one of the most conveniently accessible of those point of interest with which guide-book so anxiously and with so much propriety concern themselves what a tourist pray for be something to see if i have ever be a tourist in boston no doubt i should before now have survey the world from the top of the bunker hill monument in tallahassee at all event i go to the murat estate in fact i go more than once but i remember especially my first visit which have a livelier sentimental interest than the other because i be then under the agreeable delusion that the prince himself have live there the guide-book tell I so vouchsafe also the information that after build the house he interest himself actively in local affair become a naturalized citizen and serve successively as postmaster alderman and mayor -- a model immigrant surely though it be rather the way of immigrant perhaps not to refuse political responsibility naturally i remember these thing as i stand in front of the big house -- a story-and-a-half cottage -- amid the flowering shrub here live once the son of the king of naple himself a prince and -- worthy son of a worthy sire -- alderman and then mayor of the city of tallahassee thus do a uncompromising democrat pay court to the shades of royalty while a mocking-bird sing from a fringe-bush by the gate and a oriole fly madly from tree to tree in pursuit of a fair creature of the reluctant sex the inconsistency if such it be be quickly punish for alas when i speak of my morning 's pilgrimage to a old resident of the town he tell I that murat never live in the house nor anywhere else in tallahassee and of course be never its postmaster alderman or mayor the princess he say build the house after she husband 's death and live there a widow i appeal to the guide-book my informant sneer -- politely -- and bring I a still older tallahassean judge -- whose venerable name i be sorry to have forget and that indisputable citizen confirm all that he neighbor have say for once the guide-book compiler must have be misinform the question happily be one of no great consequence if the prince have never live in the house the princess have and she by all account -lrb- and i make certain she husband would have say the same -rrb- be the worthier person of the two and even if neither of they have live there if my sentiment have be _ all _ waste -lrb- but there be no question of tear -rrb- the place itself be sightly the house be old and the way thither a pleasant one -- first down the hill in a zigzag course to the vicinity of the railway station then by a wind country road through the valley past a few negro cabin and up the slope on the farther side prince murat or no prince murat i should love to travel that road to-day instead of sit before a massachusett fire with the ground deep under snow and the air full of thirty or forty degree of frost in the front yard of one of the cabin opposite the car-wheel foundry and near the station as i now remember a middle-aged negress be cut up a oak log she swing the axe with vigor and precision and the chip fly but i could not help say you ought to make the man do that she answer on the instant i would she say if i have a man to _ make _ i be sure you would i think she tongue be as sharp as she axe ought i to have venture a word in she behalf i wonder when a man of she own color and a pretty near neighbor tell I with admirable _ navet _ the story of he bereavement and he hope he wife have die a year before he say and so far though he have not let the grass grow under he foot he have find no one to take she place he still mean to do so if he could he be only seventy-four year old and it be not good for a man to be alone he seem a gentle spirit and i withhold all mention of the stalwart and manless wood-cutter i hope he go farther and fare better so youthful as he be surely there be no occasion for haste when i have skirt a cotton-field -- the crop just out of the ground -- and a bit of wood on the right and a swamp with a splendid display of white water-lily on the left and have begin to ascend the gentle slope i meet a man of considerably more than seventy-four year can you tell I just where the murat place be i inquire he grin broadly and think he could he be one of the old murat servant as he father have be before he i be born on to he he say speaking of the prince murat be a gentleman sah that be a statement which it seem impossible for he to repeat often enough he speak from a slave 's point of view murat be a good master the old man have hear he say that he keep servant for the like of the thing he do not abuse they he never be for barbarize a poor color person at all whipping oh yes he do not miss you fault no sah he do not miss you fault but he servant never be iron he do not believe in barbarousment the old man be thankful to be free but to he mind emancipation have not make everything heavenly the younger set of negro -lrb- my people be he word -rrb- be on the wrong road they have sell they birthright though exactly what he mean by that remark i do not gather they be not get no sense he declare and what sense they have get do not do 'em no good i tell he finally that i be from the north oh i know it he exclaim i know it and he beam with delight how do he know i inquire oh i know it i can see it _ in _ you anybody would know it that have any jedgment at all you be a perfect gentleman sah he be too old to be quarrel with and i swallow the compliment i tear myself away or he might have run on till night -- about he old master and mistress the division of the estate a abusive overseer -lrb- he be a perfect dog sah -rrb- and sundry other thing he have live a long time and have nothing to do now but to recall the past and tell it over so it will be with we if we live so long may we find once in a while a patient listener this patriarch 's unfavorable opinion as to the prospects of the color people be share by my hopeful young widower before mention who express himself quite as emphatically he be bring up among white people -lrb- i 's be taught a heap he say -rrb- and believe that the salvation of the black lay in they recognition of white supremacy but he be less perspicacious than the older man he be one of the very few person whom i meet at the south who do not recognize I at sight as a yankee be you a legislator-man he ask at the end of we talk the legislature be in session on the hill but perhaps after all he only mean to flatter I if i be long on the way it be because as i love always to have it the go and come be the better part of the pilgrimage the estate itself be beautifully situate with far-away horizon but it have fall into great neglect while the house almost in ruin and occupy by color people be to northern eye hardly more than a larger cabin it put I in mind of the question of a western gentleman whom i meet at st augustine he have come to florida against he will the weather and the doctor have combine against he and be look at everything through very blue spectacles have you see any of those fine old country mansion he ask about which we read so often in description of southern life he have be on the lookout for they he aver ever since he leave home and have yet to find the first one and from he tone it be evident that he think the southern idea of a fine old mansion must be different from he the murat house certainly be never a palace except as love may have make it so but it be old people have live in it and die in it those who once own it whose name and memory still cling to it be now in narrower house and it be easy for the visitor -- for one visitor at least -- to fall into pensive meditation i stroll about the grounds stand between the last year 's cotton-row while a carolina wren pour out he soul from a oleander bush near by admire the confidence of a pair of shrike who have make a nest in a honeysuckle vine in the front yard listen to the sweet music of mocking-bird cardinal and orchard oriole watch the martin circle above the tree think of the princess and smile at the black child who thrust they head out of the window of she big house and then with a sprig of honeysuckle for a keepsake i start slowly homeward the sun by this time be straight overhead but my umbrella save I from absolute discomfort while bird furnish here and there a agreeable diversion i recall in particular some white-crowned sparrow the first one i have see in florida at a bend in the road opposite the water-lily swamp while i be cool myself in the shade of a friendly pine-tree -- enjoy at the same time a fence overrun with cherokee rose -- a man and he little boy come along in a wagon the man seem really disappoint when i tell he that i be go into town instead of come from it it be pretty warm weather for walk and he have mean to offer I a lift he be a scandinavian who have be for some year in florida he own a good farm not far from the murat estate which latter he have be urge to buy but he think a man be not any better off for own too much land he talk of he crop he child the climate and so on all in a cheerful strain pleasant to hear if the pessimist be right -- which may i be keep from believe -- the optimist be certainly more comfortable to live with though it be only for ten minute under a roadside shade-tree when i reach the street-car track at the foot of the hill the one car which ply back and forth through the city be in its place with the driver beside it but no mule be you go to start directly i ask yes sah he answer and then look toward the stable he shout in a peremptory voice do about there do about what do that mean say i hurry up yes sah that be it ` tai not everybody that want to be hurry up so we tell 'em ` do about ' half a minute afterwards two very neatly dress little colored boy step upon the rear platform where you goin ' say the driver uptown they say they be well come inside stay out there and you 'll git hurt and cost this dried-up company more money than you 's wuth they drop into seat by the rear door he motion they to the front corner sit down there he say right there they obey and as he turn away he add what i find more and more to be true as i see more of he i be not de boss but i 's get right smart to say then he whistle to the mule flourish he whip and to a persistent accompaniment of whack and whistle we go crawl up the hill walk about tallahassee i arrive at tallahassee from jacksonville late in the afternoon after a hot and dusty ride of more than eight hour the distance be only a hundred and sixty odd mile i believe but with some bright exception southern railroad like southern man seem to be under the climate and schedule time be more or less a formality for the first two third of the way the country be flat and barren happily i sit within earshot of a amateur political economist who like myself be journey to the state capital by birth and education he be a new york state man i hear he say a old abolitionist who have vote for birney fremont and all they successor down to haye -- the only vote he be ever ashamed of now he be a greenbacker the country be go to the dog and all because the government do not furnish money enough the people would find it out some time he guess he talk as a bird sing -- for he own pleasure but i be pleased too he be a amiable enthusiasm quite exempt as it seem from all that bitterness which a exclusive possession of the truth so commonly engender he be greatly in earnest he know he be right but he could still see the comical side of thing he still have a sense of the ludicrous and in that lay he salvation for a sense of the ludicrous be the best of mental antiseptic it if anything will keep we perishable human nature sweet and save it from the madhouse he discourse be punctuate throughout with quiet laughter thus when he say _ i _ call it the _ late _ republican party it be with a chuckle so good-natured so free from acidity and self-conceit that only a pretty stiff partisan could have take offense even he prediction of impending national ruin be deliver with numberless merry quip and twinkle many good republican and good democrat -lrb- the adjective be use in its political sense -rrb- might have envy he he sunny temper join as it be to a good stock of native shrewdness for something in he eye make it plain that with all he other quality we merry greenbacker be a reasonably competent hand at a bargain so that i be not in the least surprised when he seat-mate tell I afterward in a tone of much respect that the colonel own a very comfortable property at st augustine but he best possession i still think be he humor and he own generous appreciation of it to enjoy one 's own joke be to have a pretty safe insurance against inward adversity happily i say this good-humored talker sit within hear happily too it be now -- April 4 -- the height of the season for flowering dogwood pink azalea fringe-bush cherokee rose and water lily all these have blossom abundantly and mile after mile the wilderness and the solitary place be glad for they here and there also i catch fly glimpse of some unknown plant bear a long upright raceme of creamy-white flower it might be a white lupine i think till at one of we stop between station it happen to be grow within reach then i guess it to be a _ baptisium _ which guess be afterward confirm -- to my regret for the flower lose at once all they attractiveness so ineffaceable -lrb- oftenest for good but this time for ill -rrb- be a early impression upon the least honorably esteem of the five sens as a boy it be one of my task to keep down with a scythe the weed and bush in a rocky thin-soiled cattle pasture in that task -- which at the best be a little too much like work -- my most troublesome enemy be the common wild indigo -lrb- _ baptisium tinctorium _ -rrb- partly from the wicked pertinacity with which it spring up again after every mowing but especially from the fact that the cut or bruised stalk exhale what in my nostril be a most abominable odor other people do not find it so offensive i suspect but to I it be and be ten time worse than the more pungent but comparatively salubrious perfume which a certain handsome little black-and-white quadruped -- handsome but impolite -- be give to scatter upon the nocturnal breeze in moment of extreme perturbation somewhere beyond the suwanee river -lrb- at which i look as long as it remain in sight -- and thought of christine nilsson -rrb- there come a sudden change in the aspect of the country coincident with a change in the nature of the soil from white sand to red clay a change indescribably exhilarating to a new englander who have be live if only for two month in a country without hill how good it be to see the land rise though never so gently as it stretch away toward the horizon my spirit rise with it by and by we pass extensive hillside plantation on which little group of negro man and woman be at work i seem to see the old south of which i have read and dream a south not in the least like anything to be find in the wild of southern and eastern florida a land of cotton and better still a land of southern people instead of northern tourist and settler and when we stop at a thrifty-looking village with neat homelike house open grounds and lordly shade-tree i find myself say under my breath now then we be get back into god 's country as for tallahassee itself it be exactly what i have hope to find it : a typical southern town not a camp in the wood nor a old city metamorphose into a fashionable winter resort a place untainted by northern enterprise whose inhabitant be unmistakably at home and whose house many of they at least have no appearance of be for sale it be compactly build on a hill -- the state capitol crowning the top -- down the pretty steep side of which run road into the open country all about the road too be not so sandy but that it be comparatively comfortable to walk in they -- a blessing which the pedestrian sorely miss in the town of lower florida : at st augustine for example where as soon as one leave the street of the city itself walk and carriage-ride alike become burdensome and for any considerable distance all but impossible here at tallahassee it be plain i should not be keep indoors for want of invitation from without i arrive as i have say rather late in the afternoon so late that i do nothing more than ramble a little about the city note by the way the advent of the chimney swift which i have not find elsewhere and return to my lodgings with a handful of banana-shrub blossom -- smell wonderfully like they name -- which a good woman have insist upon give I when i stop beside the fence to ask she the name of the bush it be my first but by no means my last experience of the floral generosity of tallahassee people the next morning i wake betime and to my astonishment find the city envelop in a dense fog the hotel clerk a old resident to whom i go in my perplexity be as much surprised as he questioner he do not know what it could mean he be sure it be very unusual but he think it do not indicate foul weather for a man so slightly acquaint with such phenomenon he prove to be a remarkably good prophet for though during my fortnight 's stay there must have be at least eight foggy morning every day be sunny and not a drop of rain fall that first bright forenoon be still a bright memory for one thing the mocking-birds outsang themselves till i feel and write that i have never hear mocking-bird before that they really do surpass they brethren of st augustine and sanford would perhaps be too much to assert but so it seem and i be please some month afterward to come upon a confirmatory judgment by mr maurice thompson who if any one must be competent to speak if i be go to risk the reputation of we country on the singing of a mocking-bird against a european nightingale say mr thompson -lrb- 1 -rrb- i should choose my champion from the hill-country in the neighborhood of tallahassee or from the environs of mobile i have find no bird elsewhere to compare with those in that belt of country about thirty mile wide stretch from live oak in florida by way of tallahassee to some mile west of mobile -lrb- footnote 1 : _ by-way and bird-note _ p 20 -rrb- i have go down the hill past some negro cabin into a small straggle wood and through the wood to a gate which let I into a plantation lane it be the fairest of summer forenoon -lrb- to I i mean by the almanac it be only the 5th of April -rrb- and one of the fairest of quiet landscape : broad field rise gently to the horizon and before I wind upward a grassy lane open on one side and border on the other by a deep red gulch and a zigzag fence along which grow vine shrub and tall tree the tender and vary tint of the new leave the lively green of the young grain the dark ploughed field the red earth of the wayside -- i can see they yet with all that florida sunshine on they in the bush by the fence-row be a pair of cardinal grosbeak the male whistle divinely quite unabashed by the volubility of a mocking-bird who balance himself on the treetop overhead superb and sole upon a plumd spray and seem determine to show a yankee stranger what mocking-bird could really do when they set out he do he work well the love note of the flicker could not have be improve by the flicker himself but right or wrong i could not help feeling that the cardinal strike a truer and deeper note while both together do not hinder I from hear the faint song of grasshopper sparrow rise from the ground on either side of the lane it be a fine contrast : the mocker flood the air from the topmost bough and the sparrow whisper they few almost inaudible note out of the grass yes and at the self-same moment the eye also have its contrast for a marsh hawk be skim over the field while up in the sky soar a pair of hen-hawk in the wood compose of large tree both hard wood and pine i have find a group of three summer tanager two male and one female -- the usual proportion with bird generally one may almost say in the pairing season the female be the first of she sex that i have see and i remark with pleasure the comparative brightness of she dress among tanager as among negro red and yellow be esteem a pretty good match at this point too in a cluster of pine i catch a new song -- faint and listless like the indigo-bird 's i think and at the word i start forward eagerly here doubtless be the indigo-bird 's southern congener the nonpareil or paint bunt a beauty which i have begin to fear i be to miss i have recognize my first tanager from afar ten day before he voice and theme be so like he northern relative 's but this time i be too hasty my listless singer be not the nonpareil nor even a finch of any kind but a yellow-throated warbler for a month i have see bird of he species almost daily but always in hard wood tree and silent henceforth as long as i remain in florida they be invariably in pine -- they summer quarter -- and in free song they plumage be of the neatest and most exquisite few even among warbler surpass they in that regard : black and white -lrb- remind one of the black-and-white creeper which they resemble also in they feeding habit -rrb- with a splendid yellow gorget myrtle warbler -lrb- yellow-rump -rrb- be still here -lrb- the peninsula be alive with they in the winter -rrb- and a ruby-crowned kinglet mingle its lovely voice with the simple trill of pine warbler while out of a dense low treetop some invisible singer be pour a stream of fine-spun melody it should have be a house wren i thought -lrb- another be singing close by -rrb- only its tune be several time too long at least four of my longer excursion into the surrounding country -lrb- long not intrinsically but by reason of the heat -rrb- be make with a view to possible ivory-billed woodpecker just out of the town northward beyond what appear to be the court end of marion street the principal business street of the city i have accost a gentleman in a dooryard in front of a long low vine-covered romantic-looking house he be evidently at home and not so busy as to make a interruption probably intrusive i inquire the name of a tree i believe at all event i engage he in conversation and find he most agreeable -- a ohio gentleman a man of science who have be in the south long enough to have acquire large measure of southern _ insouciance _ -lrb- there be time when a french word have a politer sound than any english equivalent -rrb- which take life as make for something better than worry and pleasanter than hard work he have see ivory-bill he say and think i might be equally fortunate if i would visit a certain swamp about which he would tell I or better still if i would go out to lake bradford first because it be nearer i go to the swamp take a early breakfast and setting forth in a fog that be almost a mist to make as much of the distance as possible before the sun come out my course lay westward some four mile along the railway track which thanks to somebody be provide with a comfortable footpath of hard clay cover the sleeper midway between the rail if all railroad be thus furnish they might be recommend as among the best of route for walk naturalist since they go straight through the wild country this one carry I by turn through woodland and cultivate field upland and swamp pine land and hammock and happily my expectation of the ivory-bill be not lively enough to quicken my step or render I heedless of thing along the way here i be equally surprised and delighted by the sight of yellow jessamine still in flower more than a month after i have see the end of its brief season only a hundred mile further south so great apparently be the difference between the peninsula and this tallahassee hill-country which by its physical geography seem rather to be a part of georgium than of florida here too the pink azalea be at its prettiest and the flowering dogwood also true queen of the wood in florida as in massachusett the fringe-bush likewise stand here and there in solitary state and thorn-bushes flourish in bewildering variety nearer the track be the omnipresent blackberry vine some patch of which be especially remember for they bright rosy flower out of the dense vegetation of a swamp come the cry of florida gallinule and then of a sudden i catch or seem to catch the sweet _ kurwee _ whistle of a carolina rail instinctively i turn my ear for its repetition and by so do admit to myself that i be not certain of what i have hear although the sora 's call be familiar and the bird be reasonably near i have be take unaware and every ornithologist know how hard it be to be sure of one 's self in such a case he know too how uncertain he feel of any brother observer who in a similar case seem trouble by no distrust of he own sens the whistle whatever it have be be not repeat and i lose my only opportunity of add the sora 's name to my florida catalogue -- a loss fortunately of no consequence to any but myself since the bird be well know as a winter visitor to the state further along a great blue heron be stalk about the edge of a marshy pool and further still in a woody swamp stand three little blue heron one of they in white plumage in the drier and more open part of the way cardinal mocking-bird and thrasher be singing ground dove be coo quail be prophesy and loggerhead shrike sit trim and silent on the telegraph wire in the pine land be plenty of brown-headed nuthatch full as always of friendly gossip two red-shouldered hawk for whom life seem to wear a more serious aspect three maryland yellow throat a pair of bluebird rare enough now to be twice welcome a black-and-white creeper and a yellow redpoll warbler in the same pine wood too there be much good music : house wren carolina wren red-eyed and white-eyed vireo pine warbler yellow-throated warbler blue yellowback red-eyed chewink and twice welcome like the bluebird a carolina chickadee a little beyond this point in a cut through a low sand bank i find two pair of rough-winged swallow and stop for some time to stare at they be myself meanwhile a gazing-stock for two or three negro lounge about the door of a cabin not far away it be a happy chance when a man 's time be _ doubly _ improve two of the bird -- the first one i have ever see to be sure of they -- perch directly before I on the wire one face I the other with he back turn it be kindly do and then as if still further to gratify my curiosity they visit a hole in the bank a second hole be doubtless the property of the other pair living alternately in heaven and in a hole in the ground they wear the livery of the earth they be not fair to outward view as many swallow be i say to myself but i be not the less glad to see they i should have be gladder for a sight of the big woodpecker whose reputed dwelling-place lay not far ahead but though i wait and listen and go through the swamp and beyond it i hear no strange shout nor see any strange bird and toward noon just as the sun brush away the fog i leave the railway track for a carriage by-way which i feel sure must somehow bring I back to the city and so it do past here and there a house till i come to the main road and then to the murat estate and be again on familiar ground two morning afterward i make another early and foggy start this time for lake bradford my instruction be to follow the railway for a mile or so beyond the station and then take a road bear away sharply to the leave this i do make sure i be on the right road by inquire of the first man i saw -- a negro at work before he cabin i have go perhaps half a mile further when a white man on he way after a load of wood as i judge drive up behind I will not you ride he ask you be go to lake bradford i believe and i be go a piece in the same direction i jump up behind -lrb- the wagon consist of two long plank fasten to the two axle -rrb- thankful but not without a little bewilderment the good-hearted negro it appear have ask the man to look out for I and he on he part seem glad to do a kindness as well as to find company we jolt along chat at arm 's length as it be about this and that he know nothing of the ivory-bill but wild turkey -- oh yes he have see a flock of eight as well as he could count not long before cross the road in the very wood through which i be go as for snake they be plenty enough he guess one of he horse be bite while plough and die in half a hour -lrb- a florida man who can not tell at least one snake story may be set down as have land to sell -rrb- he think it a pretty good jaunt to the lake and the road be not any too plain though no doubt i should get there but i begin to perceive that a white man who travel such distance on foot in that country be more of a _ rara avi _ than any woodpecker we road diverge after a while and my own soon run into a wood with a undergrowth of saw palmetto this be the place for the ivory-bill and as at the swamp two day before so now i stop and listen and then stop and listen again the fate be still against I there be neither woodpecker nor turkey and i push on mostly through pine wood -- full of bird but nothing new -- till i come out at the lake here beside a idle sawmill and heap of sawdust i be greet by a solitary negro well along in year who demand in a tone of almost comical astonishment where in the world i have come from i tell he from tallahassee and he seem so take aback that i begin to think i must look uncommonly like a invalid a northern consumptive perhaps otherwise why should a walk of six mile or something less be treat as such a marvel however the negro and i be soon on the friendliest of term talk of the old time the war the prospects of the color people -lrb- the younger one be fast go to the bad he think -rrb- while i stand look out over the lake a pretty sheet of water surround mostly by cypress wood but disfigure for the present by the doings of lumberman what interested I most -lrb- such be the fate of the devotee -rrb- be a single barn swallow the first and only one that i see on my southern trip on my way back to the city after much fatherly advice about the road on the part of the negro who seem to feel that i run the greatest risk of get lose i make two more addition to my florida catalogue -- the wood duck and the yellow-billed cuckoo the latter unexpectedly early -lrb- April 11 -rrb- since mr chapman have record it as arrive at gainesville at a date sixteen day later than this i do not repeat my visit to lake bradford but not to give up the ivory-bill too easily -- and because i must walk somewhere -- i go again as far as the palmetto scrub this time though i still miss the woodpecker i be fortunate enough to come upon a turkey in the thickest part of the wood as i turn a corner there she stand before I in the middle of the road she run along the horse-track for perhaps a rod and then disappear among the palmetto leave meanwhile two or three day before while return from st mark 's whither i have go for a day on the river i have notice from the car window a swamp or baygall which look so promising that i go the very next morning to see what it would yield i have take it for a cypress swamp but it prove to be compose mainly of oak very tall but rather slender tree heavily drape with hang moss and standing in black water among they be the swollen stump three or four foot high of larger tree which have be fell i push in through the surround shrubbery and bay-tree and wait for some time lean against one of the larger trunk and listen to the noise of which the air of the swamp be full great-crested flycatcher two acadian flycatcher a multitude of blue yellow-backed warbler and what i suppose to be some loud-voiced frog be especially conspicuous in the concert but a carolina wren a cardinal a red-eyed vireo and a blue-gray gnatcatcher the last with the merest thread of a voice contribute they share to the medley and once a chickadee strike up he sweet and gentle strain in the very depths of the swamp -- like a angel singing in hell my walk on the railway that wonderful st mark 's branch -lrb- i could never have imagine the possibility of run train over so crazy a track -rrb- take I through the choicest of bird country the bush be alive and the air ring with music in the midst of the chorus i suddenly catch somewhere before I what i have no doubt be the song of a purple finch a bird that i have not yet see in florida i quicken my step and to my delight the singer prove to be a blue grosbeak i have catch a glimpse of one two day before as i have describe in another chapter but with no opportunity for a final identification here as it soon turn out there be at least four bird all male and all singing chasing each other about after the most persistent fashion in a piece of close shrubbery with tall tree intersperse and act -- the four of they -- just as two bird be often see to do when contend for the possession of a building site at a first hear the song seem not so long sustained as the purple finch 's commonly be but exceedingly like it in voice and manner though not equal to it i should be incline to say in either respect the bird make frequent use of a monosyllabic call correspond to the call of the purple finch and the rose-breasted grosbeak but readily distinguishable from both i be greatly pleased to see they and think they extremely handsome with they dark blue plumage set off by wing patch of rich chestnut a little farther and i be salute by the saucy cry of my first florida chat the fellow have choose just such a tangled thicket as he favor in massachusett and whistle and keep out of sight after the most approved manner of he kind on the other side of the track a white-eyed vireo be assert himself as he have be do since the day i reach st augustine but though he seem a pretty clever substitute for the chat in the chat 's absence he light be quickly put out when the clown himself step into the ring ground dove coo cardinal whistle and mocking-birds sing and mock by turn orchard oriole no unworthy companion of mocking-bird and cardinal sing here and there from a low treetop especially in the vicinity of house to judge from what i see they be among the most characteristic of tallahassee bird -- as numerous as baltimore oriole be in massachusett town and frequent much the same kind of place in one day 's walk i count twenty-five elegantly dress as they be -- and elegance be better than brilliancy perhaps even in a bird -- they seem to be thoroughly democratic it be a pleasure to see they so fond of cabin door-yard of the other bird along the st mark 's railway let it be enough to mention white-throated and white-crowned sparrow red-eyed chewink -lrb- the white-eye be not find in the tallahassee region -rrb- a red-bellied woodpecker two red-shouldered hawk shrike kingbird yellow-throated warbler maryland yellow-throat pine warbler palm warbler -- which in spite of they name seek they summer home north of the united state -- myrtle warbler now grow scarce house wren summer tanager and quail the last-named bird by the way i have expect to find know as partridge at the south but as a matter of fact i hear that name apply to they only once on the st augustine road before breakfast i meet a old negro set out for he day 's work behind a pair of ox take some good exercise he ask by way of a neighborly greet and not to be less neighborly than he i respond with some remark about a big shot-gun which occupy a conspicuous place in he cart oh he say game be plenty out where we be go about eight mile and i take the gun along what kind of game well sir we may sometimes find a partridge i smile at the anti-climax but be glad to hear bob white honor for once with he southern title a good many of my jaunt take I past the gallinule swamp before mention and almost always i stop and go near it be worth while to hear the poultry cry of the gallinule if nothing more and often several of the bird would be see swim about among the big white lily and the green tussock once i discover one of they sit upright on a stake -- a precarious seat off which he soon tumble awkwardly into the water at another time on the same stake sit some dark strange-looking object the opera-glass show it at once to be a large bird sit with its back toward I and hold its wing uplift in the familiar heraldic _ e-pluribus-unum _ attitude of we american spread-eagle but even then it be some seconds before i recognize it as a anhinga -- water turkey -- though it be a male in full nuptial garb i draw nearer and nearer and meanwhile it turn squarely about -- a slow and ticklish operation -- so that its back be present to the sun as if it have dry one side of its wing and tail -- for the latter too be fully spread -- and now would dry the other there for some time it sit preen its feather with monstrous twisting and untwisting of its snaky neck if the chat be a clown the water turkey would make its fortune as a contortionist finally it rise circle about till it get well aloft and then set its wing sail away southward and vanish leave I in a state of wonder as to where it have come from and whether it be often to be see in such a place -- perfectly open close beside the highway and not far from house i do not expect ever to see another but the next morning on my way up the railroad to pay a second visit to the ivory-bill 's swamp i look up by chance -- a brown thrush be singing on the telegraph wire -- and see two anhinga soar overhead they silvery wing glisten in the sun as they wheel i keep my glass on they till the distance swallow they up of one long forenoon 's ramble i retain particular remembrance not on account of any bird but for a half hour of pleasant human intercourse i go out of the city by a untried road hope to find some trace of migrate bird especially of certain warbler the prospect of whose acquaintance be one of the lesser consideration which have bring I so far from home no such trace appear however nor in my fortnight 's stay in tallahassee in almost the height of the migratory season do i so far as i could tell see a single passenger bird of any sort some species arrive from the south -- cuckoo and oriole for example other no doubt take they departure for the north but to the best of my knowledge not one pass through it be a strange contrast to what be witness everywhere in new england by some other route swarm of bird must at that moment have be enter the united state from mexico and beyond but unless my observation be at fault -- and i be assure that sharper eye than mine have have a similar experience -- they line of march do not bring they into the florida hill-country my morning 's road not only show I no bird but lead I nowhere and grow discourage i turn back till i come to a lane lead off to the leave at right angle this i follow so far that it seem wise if possible to make my way back to the city without retrace my step not to spend my strength for naught however -lrb- the noonday sun have always to be treat with respect -rrb- i make for a solitary house in the distance another lane run past it that perhaps would answer my purpose i enter the yard all ablaze with rose and in response to my knock a gentleman appear upon the doorstep yes he say the lane would carry I straight to the meridian road -lrb- so i think he call it -rrb- and thence into the city past dr h 's i ask yes and then i know where i be first however i must let my new acquaintance show I he garden he name be g he say most likely i have hear of he for the legislature be just then have a good deal to say about he sheep in connection with some propose dog-law do i like rose as he talk he cut one after another name each as he put it into my hand then i must look at he japanese persimmon tree and many other thing here be a pretty shrub perhaps i could tell what it be by crush and smell a leaf no it be something familiar i sniff and look foolish and after all he have to tell I its name -- camphor so we go the round of the garden -- frightening a mocking-bird off she nest in a orange-tree -- till my hand be full it be too bad i have forget how many pecan-tree he have plant and how many sheep he keep a well-regulated memory would have hold fast to such figure : mine be certain only that there be four egg in the mocking-bird 's nest mr g be a man of enterprise at any rate a match for any yankee although he have come to florida not from yankeeland but from northern georgium i hope all he crop be still thrive especially he white rose and he marshal niel in the lane after skirt some pleasant wood which i mean to visit again but find no opportunity i be suddenly assault by a pair of brown thrasher half beside themselves after they manner because of my approach to they nest how close my approach be i can not say but it must be confess that i play upon they fear to the utmost of my ability wish to see as many of they neighbor as the disturbance would bring together several other thrasher a catbird and two house wren appear -lrb- all these since blood be thicker than water may have feel some special cousinly solicitude for aught i know -rrb- with a ruby-crowned kinglet and a field sparrow in the valley near a little pond as i come out into the meridian road a solitary vireo be singing in the very spot where one have be hear six day before be it the same bird i ask myself and be it settle for the summer such a explanation seem the more likely because i have find no solitary vireo anywhere else about the city though the species have be common earlier in the season in eastern and southern florida where i have see my last one -- at new smyrna -- march 26 at this same dip in the meridian road on a previous visit i have experience one of the pleasantest of my tallahassee sensation the morning be one of those when every bird be in tune by the road side i have just pass carolina wren house wren a chipper a field sparrow two thrasher a abundance of chewink two orchard oriole several tanager a flock of quail and mocking-bird and cardinal uncounted in a pine wood near by a wood pewee a pine warbler a yellow-throated warbler and a pine-wood sparrow be singing -- a most peculiarly select and modest chorus just at the lowest point in the valley i stop to listen to a song which i do not recognize but which by and by i settle upon as probably the work of a freakish prairie warbler at that moment as if to confirm my conjecture -- which in the retrospect become almost ridiculous -- a prairie warbler hop into sight on a outer twig of the water-oak out of which the music have proceed still something say be you sure and i step inside the fence there on the ground be two or three white-crowned sparrow and in a instant the truth of the case flash upon I i remember the say of a friend that the song of the white-crown have remind he of the vesper sparrow and the black-throated green warbler that be my bird and i listen again though i could no longer be say to feel in doubt a long time i wait again and again the bird sing and at last i discover one of they perch at the top of the oak toss back he head and warble -- a white-crowned sparrow : the one regular massachusett migrant which i have often see but have never hear utter a sound the strain open with smooth sweet note almost exactly like the introductory syllable of the vesper sparrow then the tone change and the remainder of the song be in something like the pleasingly hoarse voice of a prairie warbler or a black-throated green it be soft and very pretty not so perfect a piece of art as the vesper sparrow 's tune -- few bird-song be -- but take for its very oddity and at the same time tender and sweet more than one writer have describe it as resemble the song of the white-throat even minot who in general be the most painstaking and accurate of observer as he be one of the most interesting of we systematic writer say that the two song be almost exactly alike there could be no better example of the fallibility which attach and in the nature of the case must attach to all write upon such subject the two song have about as much in common as those of the hermit thrush and the brown thrasher or those of the song sparrow and the chipper in other word they have nothing in common probably in minot 's case as in so many other of a similar nature the simple explanation be that when he think he be listen to one bird he be really listen to another the tallahassee road to which i have oftenest resort to which now from far massachusett i oftenest look back the st augustine road so call i have speak of elsewhere thither after pack my trunk on the morning of the 18th i betook myself for a farewell stroll my holiday be do for the last time perhaps i listen to the mocking-bird and the cardinal as by and by when the grand holiday be over i shall listen to my last wood thrush and my last bluebird but what then florida field be still bright and neither mocking-bird nor cardinal know aught of my absence and so it _ will _ be when you and i behind the veil be past oh but the long long while the world shall last none the less it be good to have live we day and take we peep at the mighty show ten thousand thing we may have fret ourselves about uselessly or worse but to have live in the sun to have love natural beauty to have feel the majesty of tree to have enjoy the sweetness of flower and the music of bird -- so much at least be not vanity nor vexation of spirit index air-plant alligator
