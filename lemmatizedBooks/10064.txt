eye sweep he with look calm and most dispassionate beltane the smith chapter i how beltane live within the greenwood in a glade of the forest yet not so far but that one might hear the chime of bell steal across the valley from the great minster of mortain on a still evening dwelt beltane the smith alone he live in the shadow of the great tree happy when the piping of the bird be in he ear and joy to listen to the plash and murmur of the brook that run merrily beside he hut or pause ` twixt the stroke of he ponderous hammer to catch its never fail music a mighty man be beltane the smith despite he youth already great of stature and comely of feature much know he of woodcraft of the growth of herb and tree and flower of beast and bird and how to tell each by its cry or song or flight he know the way of fish in the stream and could tell the course of the star in the heaven verse be he likewise in the ancient wisdom and philosophy both latin and greek have learn all these thing from he whom man call ambrose the hermit but of man and city he know little and of woman and the way of woman less than nothing for of these matter ambrose spake not thus be grow from youth to manhood for that a man must need live beltane build he a hut beside the brook and set up a anvil thereby whereon he beat out bill-hook and axe-head and such implement as the charcoal-burner and they that live within the green have need of oft-time of a evening he would seek out the hermit ambrose and they would talk together of many thing but seldom of man and city and never of woman and the way of woman once therefore wonder beltane have say : my father amongst all these matter you speak never of woman and the way of woman though history be full of they doings and all poet sing praise of they wondrous beauty as this helena of troy whom man call ` desire of the world ' but ambrose sigh and shake he head say : art thou indeed a man so soon my beltane and so sit watch he awhile anon he rise and stride to and fro spake sudden and passionate on this wise : beltane i tell thee the beauty of woman be a evil thing a lure to wreck the soul of man by woman come sin into the world by she beauty she blind the eye of man to truth and honor lead they into all manner of wantonness whereby they very manhood be destroy this helen of troy of whom ye speak be nought but a vile adulteress with a heart false and foul by whose sin many die and troy town be utterly destroy alas sigh beltane that one so fair should be a thing so evil thereafter he go he way very sad and thoughtful and that night lie upon he bed he hear the voice of the tree sigh and murmur one to another like soul that sorrow for sin 's sake and broken dream and ideal alas that one so fair should be a thing so evil but above the whisper of the tree loud and insistent rise the merry chatter of the brook speak to he of many thing of life and the lust of life the pomp and stir of city the sound of song and laughter of woman and the beauty of woman and of the sweet mad wonder of love of all these thing the brook sing in the darkness and beltane sigh and sigh fall asleep thus live my beltane in the woodland range the forest with eye quick to see the beauty of earth and sky and ear open to the thousand voice around he or busy at he anvil hearken to the wondrous tale of travel and strange adventure tell by wander knight and man-at-arms the while with skilful hand he mend broken mail or dented casque and thereafter upon the mossy sward would make trial of they strength and valor whereby he both take and give right lusty knock or again when work fail he would lie upon the grass chin on fist pore over some ancient legend or sit with brush and color illuminate on vellum wherein right cunning be he now it chance that as he sit thus brush in hand upon a certain fair afternoon he suddenly espy one who stand watch he from the shade of a tree near by a very tall man he be long and lean and grim of aspect with a mouth wry-twisted by reason of a ancient sword-cut and yet withal he have a jovial eye but now see himself observe he shake he grizzled head and sigh whereat say beltane busy with he brush again : good sir pray what be amiss the world youth the world -- ` tis all amiss yet mark I here sit you a-dabbing color with a little brush answer beltane : a so ye seek to do you duty as regardfully as i now daub this color messire in so much shall the world be better my duty youth quoth the stranger rasp a hand across he grizzled chin my duty ha ` tis well say so need must i now fight with thee fight with I say beltane he keen gaze upon the speaker aye verily nod the stranger and forthwith lay by he long cloak he show two sword whose broad blade glitter red and evil in the sunset but say beltane shake he head i have no quarrel with thee good fellow quarrel exclaim the stranger no quarrel quotha what matter for that surely you would not forego a good bout for so small a matter doth a man eat only when famishing or drink but to quench he thirst out upon thee messire smith but sir say beltane bend to he brush again a i should fight with thee where would be the reason nowhere youth since fighting be ever at odds with reason yet for such unreasonable reason do reasoning man fight none the less i will not fight thee answer beltane deftly touch in the wing of a archangel so let there be a end o not end forsooth we have not yet begin a you must have a quarrel right fully will i provoke thee since fight with thee i must it be so my duty -- how thy duty i be so command by whom by one who be dead yet liveth nay ask no name yet mark I this -- the world 's amiss boy pentavalon groan beneath a black usurper 's heel all the sin of hell be loose murder and riot lust and rapine march you eastward but a day through the forest yonder and you shall see the tree bear strange fruit in we country the world 's amiss messire yet here sit you waste you day a foolish brush stick in thy fist so be i come nor will i go hence until i have try thy mettle quoth beltane shake he head intent upon he work : you speak I riddle sir yet can i speak thee to the point and so it be thy wish as thus -- now mark I boy thou art a fool a dog a fatuous ass a slave a nincompoop a cowardly boy and as such -- mark I again -- now do i spit at thee hereupon beltane have finish the archangel 's wing lay by he brush and with thoughtful mien arise and be upon he foot turn he swift and sudden and catch the stranger in a fierce and cunning wrestling grip and forthwith throw he upon he back whereat this strange man sit cross-legged upon the sward smile he wry and twisted smile and look upon beltane with bright approve eye a pretty spirit he nod ` tis a sweet and gentle youth all good beef and bone a little green as yet perchance but ` tis no matter a mighty arm a noble thigh and shoulder -- body o ' I but ` tis in the breed young sir by these same sign and portent my soul be uplift and hope singeth a new song within I so say the stranger spring nimbly to he foot and catch up one of the sword take it by the blade and give its massy hilt to beltane 's hand say he : look well upon this blade young sir in duchy kingdom or county you shall not find its match nor the like of the terrible hand that bear it time be when this good steel -- mark how it glitter yet -- strike deep for liberty and justice and all fair thing before whose might oppression quail and hang its head and in whose shadow peace and mercy rest 'twa long ago but this good steel be bright and undimmed as ever ha mark it boy -- those eye o ' thine shall ne'er behold its equal so beltane take hold upon the great sword feel the spring and balance of the blade and view it up from glitter point to plain and simple cross-guard and thus grave deep within the broad steel he read this word : resurgam ha cry the stranger see you the legend good youth speak I now what it doth signify and beltane answer : ' i shall arise ' ` arise ' good boy aye verily mark I that ` tis a fair thought look you and the motto of a great and noble house and by the rood i think likewise a prophecy thus speak the stranger stoop and take up the other sword face beltane therewith say in soft and wheedling tone : come now let we fight together thou and i and deny I not lest -- mark I this well youth -- lest i spit at thee again then he raise he sword and smote beltane with the flat of it and the blow sting wherefore beltane instinctively swing he weapon and thrill with sudden unknown joy at the clash of steel on steel and so they engage and there within the leafy solitude beltane and the stranger fight together the long blade whirl and flash and ring upon the stillness and ever as they fight the stranger smile he wry smile mocking and gibe at he whereat beltane 's mouth grow the grimmer and he blow the heavier yet wherever he strike there already be the stranger 's blade to meet he whereat the stranger laugh fierce and loud taunt he on this wise : how now thou dauber of color betake thee to thy little brush belike it shall serve thee better aye I betake thee to thy little brush ` twere better fit to thee than a noble sword thou daub boy now do my beltane wax wroth indeed and smite amain until he breath grow short and thick but ever steel ring on steel and ever the stranger laugh and gibe until beltane 's stroke grow slower : -- then with a sudden fierce shout do the stranger beset my beltane with stroke so swift and strong now to right of he now to leave that the very air seem full of flame whirling steel and in that moment as beltane give back the stranger smite thrice in as many moment with the flat of he blade once upon the crown once upon the shoulder and once upon the thigh fierce eyed and scant of breath beltane redouble he blow strive to beat he mocker to the earth whereat he but laugh again say : look to thy long leg dullard and forthwith smite beltane upon the leg now thine arm slothful boy -- thy leave arm and he smite beltane upon the arm now thy sconce boy thy mazzard thy sleepy golden head and straightway he smite he on the head and thereafter with sudden cunning stroke beat the great sword from beltane 's grip and so laughing yet pause and stand lean upon he own long weapon but beltane stand with bent head hurt in he pride angry and beyond all think amaze yet be humble most of all he keep he gaze bent earthward and speak no word now hereupon the stranger grow solemn likewise and look at beltane with kindly approve eye nay indeed quoth he be not abashed good youth take it not amiss that i have worst thee ` tis true have i be so mind i might have cut thee into gobbet no larger than thy little brush but then body o ' I i have live by stroke of sword from my youth up and have fight in diver war and country so take it not to heart good youth with the word he nod and stoop take up the sword and thereafter cast he cloak about he whereat beltane lift he head and spake : art go sir wilt not try I once again methink i might do a little better this time a so god will aye so thou shalt sweet youth cry the stranger clap he upon the shoulder yet not now for i must begone yet shall i return then i pray you leave with I the sword till you be come again the sword -- ha doth thy soul cleave unto it so soon my good sweet boy leave the sword quotha aye truly -- some day but for the nonce -- no no thy hand be not fit to bear it yet nor worthy such a blade but some day belike -- who know fare thee well sweet youth i come again to-morrow and so the tall grim stranger turn he about smile he wry smile and stride away through the green then beltane go back mind to finish he painting but the color have lose they charm for he moreover the light be fail wherefore he put brush and color aside and strip plunge into the cool sweet water of a certain quiet pool and so much hearten and refresh thereby go betime to bed but now he think no more of woman and the way of woman but rather of this stranger man of he wry smile and of he wondrous sword-play and bethink he of the great sword he yearn after it as only youth may yearn and so sigh fall asleep and in he dream all night be the rush thunder of many fierce foot and the roar din of bitter fight and conflict \* \* \* \* \* up to a elbow spring beltane to find the sun new rise fill he humble chamber with its golden glory and in this radiance upon the open threshold the tall grim figure of the stranger messire quoth beltane rub sleepy eye you wake betime meseemeth aye sluggard boy there be work to do betwixt we how so sir my time in the greenwood groweth short within the week i must away for there be war and rumor of war upon the border quoth beltane wonder : war and conflict have be within my dream all night dream boy i tell thee the time groweth ripe for action -- and mark I this wherein perchance thou too shalt share yet much have i to teach thee first so rise slug-a-bed rise now when beltane be rise and clothe he fold he arm across he broad chest and stare upon the stranger with grave deep-searching eye who art thou he question and what would you here again as to thy first question sir smith ` tis no matter for that but as for thy second to-day be i come to teach thee the use and manage of horse and lance it be so my duty and wherefore thy duty for that i be so command by whom by one who yet liveth be dead now beltane frown at this and shake he head say : more riddle messire yet now will i speak thee plain as thus : i be a smith and have no lust to strife or knightly deed nor will i e'er attempt they for strife begetteth bitter strife and war be a evil thing ` they that trust to the sword shall perish by the sword ' ` tis so written and be meseemeth a faithful say this sorry world have know over much of war and hate of strife and bloodsh so shall these my hand go innocent of more then indeed do the stranger stare with jaw agape for wonder at my beltane 's say and so stare turn he to the door and back again and fain would speak yet could not for a while then : besotted boy he cry o craven youth o babe o suckling be it for this thou wert beget hast thou no bowels no blood no manhood forsooth and must i spit on thee indeed and so it be thy will messire say beltane steady-eyed but as they stand thus beltane with arm yet cross he lip up-curve at the other 's fierce amaze the stranger grim-faced and frowning come a shadow athwart the level glory of the sun and turn beltane behold the hermit ambrose tall and spare beneath he tattered gown barehead and bare of foot whose eye be bright and quick despite the snow of hair and beard and in whose gentle face and humble mien be yet a high and noble look at odds with he lowly guise and tattered vesture at sight of whom the grim-faced stranger of a sudden bow he grizzled head and sink upon he knee lord he say and kiss the hermit 's long coarse robe whereon the hermit bent and touch he with a gentle hand _ benedicite _ my son say he go you and leave we together a while forthwith the stranger rise from he knee and go out into the glory of the morning then the hermit come to beltane and set he two hand upon he mighty shoulder and spake to he very gently on this wise : thou knowest my beltane how all thy day i have teach thee to love all fair and sweet and noble thing for they be of god ` twere a fair thought now to live out thy life here within these calm leafy solitude -- but better death by the sword for some high unselfish purpose than to live out a life of ease safe and cloistered all thy day to live for thine own end -- ` tis human to die for some great cause for liberty or for another 's good -- that my son be god-like and there be a man of sorrow whose word be this that he come ` not to bring peace on this earth but a sword ' for good can not outface evil but strife must need follow behold now here another sword my beltane keep it henceforth so long as thou keep honor so say ambrose the hermit take from beneath he habit that for which beltane have yearn that same great blade whereon whose steel be grave the legend : resurgam so ambrose put the sword in beltane 's hand say : be terrible my son that evil may flee before thee learn to be strong that thou may ` st be merciful then the hermit stretch forth he hand and bless my beltane and turn about and so be go but beltane stand awhile to swing the great blade lightly to and fro and to stare upon it with shine eye then have hide it within he bed he go forth into the glade and here he presently behold a great gray horse tethered to a tree hard by a mettled steed that toss its noble head and snuff the fragrant air of morning paw at the earth with impatient hoof now as he stand gaze come the stranger and touch he on the arm messire say he try a thou canst back the steed yonder beltane smile for he have love horse all he day and loose the horse lead it out into the open and would have mount but the spirited beast know he not rear and plunge and strive to break the grip upon the bridle but the grip be strong and compelling then beltane soothe he with gentle voice and hand and of a sudden vaulted lightly into the saddle and be there feel the great beast rear under he and laugh joyously strike he with open palm and set off at a thunderous gallop away away they speed up the sunny glade past oak and beech and elm through light and shadow until before they show a tree of vast girth and mighty spread of branch now would beltane have rein aside but the great horse ear flat and eye roll hold blindly on then beltane frowned and lean forward seize the bridle close beside the bit and grip it so put forth he strength slowly slowly the great fierce head be draw low and lower the foam-flecked jaw gape wide but beltane 's grip grow ever the fiercer until snort pant wild-eyed the great gray horse falter in he stride check he pace slip stumble and so stand quiver in the shade of the tree thereafter beltane turn he and gallop back draw rein where the stranger sit cross-legged watch he with he wry smile aye he nod we shall make of thee a horseman yet but as to lance now and armor -- quoth beltane smile : good sir i be a smith and in my time have mend many a suit of mail aye and make they too though 'twa but to try my hand as for a lance i have oft tilted at the ring astride a forest pony and betime have run a course with wander man-at-arms say you so boy say the stranger and rise take from behind a tree a long and heavy lance and thrust it into beltane 's grip then draw he sword he set it upright in the sward and upon the hilt he put he cap say : ride back up the glade and try a thou canst pick up my cap on thy point at a gallop so beltane ride up the glade and wheeling at a distance come gallop down with level lance and thunder by with the cap flutter from he lance point art less of a dullard than i think thee say the stranger take back he cap though mark I boy ` tis another matter to ride against a man fully armed and equipped lance to lance and shield to shield than to charge a harmless ancient leathern cap still art less of a dullard than i think thee but there be the sword now -- with the sword thou art indeed but a sorry fool go fetch the sword and i will e ` en belabor thee again so beltane light down from the horse that rear and plunge no more go and fetch the great sword and when they have lay they jerkin by -lrb- for the sun be hot -rrb- they face each other foot to foot and eye to eye then once again the long blade whirl and fly and ring together and once again the stranger laugh and gibe and strike my beltane how and where he would nor give he stay or respite till beltane 's mighty arm grow aweary and he shoulder ache and burn then when he reck not of it the stranger with the same cunning stroke beat the sword from beltane 's hand and laugh aloud and wag he head say : art faint boy and scant o ' breath already methink we ne'er shall make of thee a lusty sworder but behold beltane 's flushing cheek and droop eye reach out and clap he on the shoulder go to cry he art young and all unlearned as yet -- heed not my gibe and quirk ` tis ever so my custom when steel be ring and mark I i do think it a good custom as apt to put a man off he ward and flurry he in he stroke never despair youth for i tell thee north and south and east and west my name be know nor shall you find in any duchy kingdom or county a sworder such as i for mark I now you knight and man-at-arms trusting to he armor doth use he sword but to thrust and smite but -- and mark I again boy a man can not go ever in he armor nor yet be sure when foe be nigh and at all time ` tis well to make thy weapon both sword and shield ` tis a goodly art indeed i think a pretty one come now take up thy sword and i will teach thee all my stroke and show thee how ` tis do thus then this stranger dwell the week with beltane in the greenwood teaching he day by day trick of sword and much martial lore beside and day by day a friendship wax and grow betwixt they so that upon the seventh morning as they break they fast together beltane 's heart be heavy and he look downcast whereat the stranger speak he thus : whence thy dole good youth for that to-day need must i part with thee and thy friend be few belike none messire answer beltane sigh aye I and yet ` tis well enough for -- mark I youth -- friend be ofttime a mixed blessing as for I ` tis true i be thy friend and so shall ever be so long as you shall bear yon goodly blade and wherefore question beltane moreover thou art my scholar and like perchance to prove thyself some day a notable sworder and a sweet and doughty fighter belike yet hast never speak I thy name messire why hast question I but once and then thou wert something of a blockhead dreamer methought but now messire beltane since thou would ` st know -- benedict of bourne be i call now hereupon beltane rise and stand upon he foot stare wide-eyed at this grim-faced stranger who with milk-bowl at lip pause to smile he wry smile aha say he hast hear such a name ere now even here in the greenwood sir answer beltane betime i have talk with soldier and man-at-arms so do i know thee for that same great knight who of all the noble of pentavalon doth yet withstand the great duke ivo -- call you that black usurper ` great ' youth body o ' I i know a greater once methink aye nod beltane there be he man call ` beltane the strong ' ha quoth sir benedict set down he milk-bowl what know you of duke beltane nought but that he be a great and lusty fighter who yet love peace and mercy but truth and justice most of all and to-day sigh sir benedict to-day we have black ivo aye I these be sorry day for pentavalon ` tis say he woo the young duchess yonder hast ever see helen of mortain sir smith nay but i have hear tell that she be wondrous fair hum quoth sir benedict i love not you red-haired spit-fire methink a ivo win she she 'll lead he how she will or be break in the adventure -- a malison upon he be it how it may so have presently make a end of eat sir benedict arise and forthwith don quilted gambeson and thereafter he hauberk of bright mail and plain surcoat and buckle he sword about he stride into the glade where stand the great gray horse now be mount sir benedict stay awhile to look down at beltane while beltane look up at he messire beltane say he point to he scar cheek you look upon my scar i think quoth beltane flush hot : nay sir in truth not i why look now sweet youth ` tis a scar that like I well though 'twa in no battle i take it yet none the less i would not be without it by this i may be know among a thousand ` benedict o ' the mark ' some call I and ` tis methinks as fair a name as any but look now and mark I this well beltane -- should any come to thee within the green by day or night and say to thee ` benedict o ' the mark bid thee arise and follow ' -- then follow messire and so peradventure thou shalt arise indeed dost mark I well youth aye sir benedict heigho sigh sir benedict thou ` rt a fair size babe to bear within a cloak and thou hast be baptize in blood ere now -- and there be more riddle for thee boy and so until we meet fare thee well messire beltane so say sir benedict of bourne smile he twisted smile and wheeling he horse ride away down the glade he mail glisten in the early light and he lance point wink and twinkle amid the green chapter ii how beltane have word with the duke black ivo now it fall out upon a day that as beltane stride the forest way there meet he a fine cavalcade gay with the stir of broidered petticoat and ermined mantle and pause beneath a tree he stand to hearken to the soft sweet voice of the lady and to gaze enrapture upon they varied beauty foremost of all ride a man richly habit a man of great strength and breadth of shoulder and of a bearing high and arrogant he face frame in long black hair that curl to meet he shoulder be of a dark and swarthy hue fierce look and masterful by reason of prominent chin and high-arched nose and of he thin-lipped relentless mouth black be he eye and bold now stare bright and wide now glitter ` twixt heavy narrow lid yet when he smile they glitter brightest and he lip show moistly red beside he ride a lady of a wondrous dark beauty sleepy eyed and languid yet she glance be quick to meet the duke 's bold look and ` neath she mantle she finger meet once in a while and clung with he what time he red lip would smile but for the most part he brow be gloomy and he finger he chin as one in think as he pace along upon he richly caparisoned steed pinching at he long blue-shaven chin with supple finger he heavy brow draw low of a sudden he narrow lid widen and he eye gleam bright and black as they behold my beltane standing in the shade of the tree aha say he draw rein what insolent long-legged rogue art thou to stand gaping at thy betters and beltane answer : no rogue messire but a honest man i pray god whom folk call beltane the smith the stare eye grow suddenly narrow the scarlet mouth curl in a slow smile and the tall man spake yet with he gaze bent ever upon beltane : fair lord he say and you most sweet and gentle lady we sport have be but poor hitherto -- methink i can show you a better ` tis a game we play full oft in my country would that we gracious lady of mortain be here nor have balk we of she wilful company ho gefrous he call come you and break I the back of this ` honest ' rogue and straightway come one from the rear where ride the servant and man-at-arms a great bronzed fellow beard to the eye of he loose he sword-belt as he come who have toss aside cap and pourpoint stride toward beltane he eye quick and bright he tooth agleam through the hair of he beard come thou forest rogue say he my lord duke loveth not to wait for man or maid so -- have at thee great he look and tall as beltane 's self a hairy man of mighty girth with muscle that swell on arm and breast and rippled upon he back thus as he stand and laugh grimly confident and determine not a few be they who sigh for beltane for he youth 's sake and because of he golden curl and gentle eye for this gefrous be account a very strong man and a matchless wrestler withal ` tis a fair match how think you sir jocelyn say the duke and turn he to one who ride at he elbow a youthful slender figure with long curl hair and sleepy eye a fair match sir jocelyn in very sooth sweet my lord gramercy and by you gracious leave -- not so sigh sir jocelyn this gefrous o ' thine be a rare breaker of neck and have o'er-thrown all the wrestler in the three duchy a man be he set in he strength and experienced but this forester tall though he be be but a beardless youth the duke smile he slow smile he curving nostril quiver and be still and he glance toward sir jocelyn through veil lid quoth he : art rather for a game of ball messire or a song upon a lute so say he turn and sign to gefroi with he finger as for sir jocelyn he only curl a lock of he long hair and hum beneath he breath now beltane mislike the matter would fain have go upon he way but wheresoever he turn there gefrous be also bar he path wherefore beltane 's eye kindle and he raise he staff threateningly fellow quoth he stand from my way lest i mischief thee but gefrous only laugh and look to he lord who beckon a archer bid he lay a arrow to he string shoot I the cowardly rogue so soon as he turn he back say he whereat gefrous laugh again wag he head come forest knave quoth he i know a trick to snap thy neck so sweetly shalt never know i warrant thee come ` twill take but a moment and my lord begin to lack of patience so beltane lay by he staff and tighten he girdle face the hairy gefrous and there befall that the which though you shall find no mention of it in any chronicle come much to be talk of thereafter so that a ballade be writ of it the which beginneth thus : ` beltane wrestle in the green with a mighty man a goodlier bout be never see since the world begin ' while beltane be tighten he girdle swift and sudden gefrous close pin he arm in a cunning hold and thrice he swing my beltane from he foot so that many clap they hand the while the squire and man-at-arms shout lustily only sir jocelyn curl the lock of hair upon he finger and be silent to he quoth my lord duke smile : messire a you be in a mind to wager now i will lay you this my roan stallion ` gainst that suit of triple mail you win at dunismere joust that gefroi break thy forester 's back within two fall -- how say you sweet my lord it liketh I beyond tell thy roan be a peerless beast sigh sir jocelyn and so fall once more to hum he song beneath he breath now beltane have wrestle oft with stranger in the greenwood and have learn many cunning and desperate hold moreover he have learn to bide he time thus though gefrous 's iron muscle yet pin he arm he wait calm-eyed but with every nerve a-quiver for that moment when gefrous 's vicious grip should slacken to and fro the wrestler sway knee to knee and breast to breast fierce and silent and grim as have be say this gefrous be a very cunning fellow and once and twice he put forth all he strength seek to use a certain cruel trick whereby many a goodly man have die ere now but once and twice the hold be foiled yet feebly and as though by chance and gefrous wonder a third time he essay it therefore but in that moment sudden and fierce and strong beltane twist in he loosen grasp find at last the deadly hold he seek and gefrous wonder no more for about he be a painful grip that grow ever tighter and more relentless now gefrous 's breath grow short and labor the muscle stand out on he writhe body in knotted cord but ever that cruel grip grow more deadly crush he spirit and rob he of he wonted strength and those about they watch that mighty struggle hush for wonder of it even sir jocelyn have forget he lock of hair and hum no more for desperately though he fight and struggle they see gefrous 's great body be bend slowly backward he eye stare up wild and bloodshot into the fierce set face above he sway now he see the wide ring of face the quiver of leaf and the blue beyond all a-swim through the mist of beltane 's yellow hair and then writhe in he anguish he turn and bury he tooth in beltane 's naked arm and with a cunning twist break from that deadly grip and staggered free straightway the air be full of shout and cry some praise some condemn while gefrous stand with hang arm and pant but beltane look upon he hurt laugh short and fierce and as gefrous come upon he stoop and catch he below the loin then beltane the strong the mighty put forth he strength and whirling gefrous aloft hurl he backwards over he shoulder so gefrous the wrestler fall and lay with hairy arm wide-tossed as one that be dead and for a space no man speak for the wonder of it by all the saint but 'twa a mighty throw sigh sir jocelyn though alack sweet my lord ` twould almost seem my forester have something spoil thy wrestler and be the roan stallion thine frown the duke and to none would i lose he with a fairer grace for 'twa a good bout as i foretold : yet by the head of st martin meseemeth yon carrion might have do I better so say my lord duke give he horse the spur and as he pass the prostrate form of gefrous lean he down and smite the wrestler thrice with the whip he hold and so ride on bidding he follower let he lie but sir jocelyn pause to look down at beltane who be set he dress in order sir forester thou hast a mighty arm quoth he and thy face liketh I well here be for thee and toss a purse to beltane 's foot he ride upon he way so the gay cavalcade pass ` neath the leafy arch with the jingle of bridle and stirrup and the sound of jest and laughter and be presently lose amid the green only gefrous the wrestler lay there upon he back and groan then come beltane and knelt and take he heavy head upon he knee whereat gefrous open he eye and groan again good fellow say beltane i have not mean to throw thee so heavily -- nay forester would it have be a little harder for a ruin man be i this day how so -- have you not life i would ` twere death and i bit you -- in the arm i mind I aye 'twa in the arm for that be i heartily sorry forester but when a man seeth fame and fortune slip from he -- aye and he honor i have nigh forget that -- fame and fortune and honor so small a thing as a bite may be forgive i forgive thee -- full and freely speak like a honest forester say gefrous and groan again the favor of a lord be a slippery thing -- much like a eel -- quick to wriggle away a hour agone my lord duke hold I in much esteem while now and he strike I on the face here slowly gefrous get he upon he foot and have don cap and pourpoint shake he head and sigh quoth he : alack ` tis a ruin man be i this day would i have break thy neck or thou mine -- and so god den to ye forester then gefroi the wrestler turn and plod on he way walk slow and with drooping head as one who knoweth not whither he go or careth now as he watch beltane bethought he of the purse and take it up run after gefrous and thrust it into he hand ` twill help thee to find a new service mayhap so say my beltane turn upon he heel and stride away while gefrous stand stare wide-eyed long after beltane be vanish amid the tree so thus it be that beltane look he first upon duke ivo of pentavalon and thus do he overthrow gefrous the famous wrestler and because of this many be they knight and noble and esquire who seek out beltane 's lonely hut beside the brook with offer of service or to try a fall with he but at they offer beltane laugh and shake he head and all who come to wrestle he throw upon they back and thus my beltane dwelt within the greenwood wax mightier day by day chapter iii how love come to beltane in the greenwood upon a day beltane stand at he forge fashion a axe-head and have temper it thereafter in the brook he lay it by and straighten he back stride forth into the glade all ignorant of the eye that watch he curiously through the leaf and presently as he stand he broad back set to the bole of a tree he blue eye lift heavenwards brimful of dream he brake forth into a song he have make lie sleepless upon he bed to do it tall and stately be the tree tower aloft nod slumberously in the gentle wind fair be the flower lift glad face to they sun-father and fill the air with they languorous perfume yet naught be there so comely to look upon as beltane the smith standing bare-armed in he might he golden hair crisp-curled and he lift eye a-dream merrily the brook laugh and sing among the willow leap in rainbow-hue over its pebbly bed sweet pipe the bird in brake and thicket yet of all they music none be there so good to hear as the rich tone of beltane the smith so think the duchess helen of mortain where she sit upon she white palfrey screen by the thick-budded foliage see nought but this golden-locked singer whose voice thrill strangely in she ear and who so good a judge as helen the beautiful whose lover be beyond count knight and noble and princeling ever kneel at she haughty foot ever sigh forth vow of service and adoration in whose honor many a stout lance have shiver and many a knightly act be work wherefore i say who so good a judge as the duchess helen of mortain thus beltane the maker of verse all ignorant that any hear save the bird in the brake sing of the glory of the forest-land sing how the flower feel the first sweet promise of spring stir within they awake and lo the frost be go the warm sun they have dream of through the long winter be come back the time of they wait pass away so timidly slowly they steal forth from the dark unveil they beauty to they lord the sun and fill the world with the fragrance of they worship somewhat of all this sing beltane while the duchess helen gaze upon he wide-eyed and wonder could this be beltane the smith this tall gentle-eyed youth this soft-voiced singer of dream could this indeed be the mighty wrestler of whom she have hear so many tale of late how that he live a anchorite deep hide in the green hate the pomp and turmoil of city and contemn woman and all they way now bethink she of all this the duchess frown for that he be such a goodly man and so comely to look on and frown mused white chin on white fist then she smile as one that have a bright thought and straightway loose the golden fillet that bind she glowing tress so that they fall about she in all they glory ripple far down she broidered habit then the song be end forth from she cover ride the lady of mortain and come close where beltane lean he in the shade of the tree pause of a sudden and start as one that be surprised and beltane turn find she beside he yet speak not nor move breathless and as one entrance he gaze upon she saw how she long hair glow a wondrous red ` neath the kiss of the die sun see how she purpled gown belt at the slender waist cling about the beauty of she shapely body see how the little shoe peep forth from the perfumed mystery of its fold and so stand speechless bind by the spell of she beauty wherefore at length she speak to he low and sweet and humble on this wise : art thou he whom man call beltane the smith he answer gaze at she lowered lash : i be beltane the smith for a space she sit grave and silent then look at he with eye that laugh ` neath level brow to see the wonder in he gaze but anon she fall a-sighing and braid a tress of hair ` twixt white finger ere she speak : ` tis say of thee that thou art a hermit and live alone within these solitude and yet -- meseemeth -- thine eye be not a hermit 's eye messire quoth beltane with flushing cheek and eye abase : yet do i live alone lady nor be thy way and speech the way of common smith messire yet smith be i in sooth lady and therewithal content now do she look on he ` neath droop lash sweet-eyed and languorous and shake she head and sigh alas messire methinks then perchance it may be true that thou for all thy youth and despite thine eye art a mocker of love a despiser of woman and yet -- nay -- sure ` tis not so then do beltane the strong come nigh to fear by reason of she fair womanhood and look from she to earth from earth to sky and when he would have answer fall a-stammering abashed by she wondrous beauty nay lady indeed -- indeed i know of woman nought -- nought of myself but i have hear tell that they be -- light-minded use they beauty but to lure the soul of man from high and noble thing -- making of love a jest -- a sport and pastime -- but now the duchess laugh very soft and sweeter far to beltane 's thinking than the ripple music of any brook soever aye I messire anchorite say she smile yet whence have you this poor folly quoth beltane gravely : lady 'twa from one beyond all think wise and learn a most holy hermit -- a hermit say she merry-eyed then a he tell thee this need must he be old and cold and withered and beyond the age of love know nought of woman save what memory doth haunt he evil past but young art thou and strong and should love come to thee -- as come methink it may hearken to no voice but the plead of thine own true heart messire she sigh art very blind methink for you sing the wonder of these forest-land yet in thy song be never a word of love o blind o blind for i tell thee nought exist in this great world but by love behold now these sigh tree love they lord the sun and through the drear winter wait he come with wide-stretched yearning arm cry aloud to he in every shudder blast the tale of they great longing and after some while he come and at he advent they clothe themselves anew in all they beauty and with he warm breath thrilling through each fiber put forth they bud singing through all they myriad leave the song of they rejoice something the like of this messire be the love a woman beareth to a man the which until he have feel it tremble in he heart he have not know the joy of living but beltane answer smile a little as one that glory in he freedom : no woman have ever touch my heart yet have i live nor find it lonely hitherto but hereupon rest she white finger on he arm she lean nearer to he so that he feel she breath warm upon he cheek and there steal to he the faint sweet perfume of she hair beware o scorner of woman for i tell thee that ere much time have pass thou shalt know love -- aye in such fashion as few man know -- wherefore i say -- beware beltane but beltane the strong the mighty shake he head and smile nay quoth he a man 's heart may be set on other thing flower may seem to he fairer than the fairest woman and the wind in tree sweeter to he than they voice now as she hearken the duchess helen grow angry yet straightway she dissemble look upon he ` neath droop lash soft and tender-eyed and sigh she answer : ah beltane how unworthy be such thing of a man 's love for if he pluck they that he may lay these flower upon he heart lo they fade and wither and they beauty and fragrance be but a memory ah beltane when next ye sing choose you a worthier theme of what shall i sing say beltane very soft she answer and with eye abase : think on what i have tell thee and sing -- of love and so she sigh and look on he once then wheel she palfrey and be go up the glade but beltane as he watch she go be seize of a sudden impulse and over-took she running beseech thee cry he bar she path tell I thy name then helen the beautiful the wilful laugh and swerve she palfrey mind to leave he so but beltane spring and catch the bridle tell I thy name say he again let I go thy name tell I thy name but the duchess laugh again and think to escape he smite she horse so that it start and rear once it plunge and twice and so stand tremble with beltane 's hand upon the bridle wherefore a sudden anger come upon she and bend she black brow she raise she jewelled riding-rod threateningly but beltane only smile and shake he head say : unless i know thy name thou shalt not fare forth of the greenwood so the proud lady of mortain look down upon beltane in amaze for there be none in all the duchy knight noble or princeling who dare gainsay she lightest word wherefore i say she stare upon this bold forest knave with he golden hair and gentle eye he curved lip and square chin and in eye and mouth and chin be a look of masterfulness challenging commanding and meeting that look she heart leap most strangely with sudden sweet thrill so that she lower she gaze lest he should see and when she speak she voice be low and very sweet : tell I i pray why seek you my name and wherefore quoth beltane soft and slow as one that dream : i have see thine eye look at I from the flower ere now have hear thy laughter in the brook and find thy beauty in all fair thing : methink thy name should be a most sweet name now be it upon she lip to tell he what he ask but be a woman she hold she peace for very contrariness and blush beneath he gaze look down and cry aloud and point to a grub that crawl upon she habit so beltane loose the bridle and in that moment she laugh for very triumph and be off gallop ` neath the tree yet as she go she turn and call to he and the word she call be : -- helen chapter iv of the love and the grief of helen the proud long stand beltane where she have leave he the soft shadow of night deepen about he dream ever of she beauty of she wondrous hair and of the little foot that have peep forth at he ` neath she habit and full of these thought for once he be deaf to the soft voice of the tree nor hear the merry chatter of the brook but later upon he bed he lay awake full long and must need remember yet another helen with the same wondrous hair and eye of mystery for whose sake man have die and a noble city burn and hereupon he heart grow strangely heavy and cold with a unknown dread day come and go and labor at the forge or lie out in the sunshine gaze wistfully beyond the sway tree-top beltane would oft start and turn he head fancy the rustle of she garment in he ear or she voice call to he from some flowery thicket and the wind in the tree whisper helen and the brook sing of helen and helen be in he thought continually thus my beltane forget he love the flower and sing no more the wonder of the forest-land and oft-time the duchess seat in state within she great hall of mortain look down upon she knight and noble would sigh for none be there so noble of form nor so comely as beltane the smith hereupon she white brow would grow troubled and turn from they all she would gaze with deep unfathomable eye away across the valley to where amid the mystery of the tree beltane have he lonely dwelling wherefore it be that look up one evening from where he sit busy with brush and color upon a border of wondrous design beltane behold she of whom he be dream and she stand tall and fair before he see that in he look the which set she heart a-fluttering at she white breast most strangely yet fear she should betray aught of it she laugh gaily and mock he as be the way of woman say : well thou despiser of love i hearken vainly for thy new song as i ride hither through the green red grow my beltane 's cheek and he look not to she as he answer : lady i have no new song why then be thy lesson yet unlearned say she have ye no love but for bird and flower and she red lip curl scornfully quoth beltane : be there aught more worthy o beltane she sigh art then so simple that such will aye content thee doth not thy heart hunger and cry within thee for aught beside then beltane bow he head and fumble with he brush and drop it and ere he could reach it she have set she foot upon it thus it chance that he hand come upon she foot and feeling it beneath he finger he start and draw away whereat she laugh low and sweet say : alack and doth my foot affright thee and yet ` tis none so fierce and none so large that thou shouldst fear it thus messire -- thou who art so tall and strong and a mighty wrestler withal now look up he see she lip curve and scarlet and she eye brimful of laughter and fain would he have take up the brush yet dare not therefore very humbly she stoop and lift the brush put it in he hand then tremble ` neath the touch of she soft finger beltane rise up and that which he have hide deep within he heart brake from he helen he whisper o helen thou art so wondrous fair and belike of high estate but as for I i be but what i be behold I he cry stretch wide he arm i be but beltane the smith who be there to love such as i see my hand be hard and rough and would but bruise where they should caress these arm be unfitted for soft embracement o lady who be there to love beltane the smith now the duchess helen laugh within herself for very triumph yet she bosom thrill and hurry with she breathing she cheek grow red and she eye bright and tender wherefore she stoop low to cull a flower ere she answer beltane she sigh beltane woman be not as thy flower that embrace even such as thine would crush they but beltane stoop he head that he might not behold the lure and beauty of she and clench he hand hard and fierce and thereafter spake : thou art so wondrous fair say he again and belike of noble birth but -- as for I i be a smith awhile she stand turn the flower in gentle finger yet look upon he in he might and goodly youth behold he avert face with its strong sweet mouth and masterful chin its curved nostril and the dream passion of he eye and when she speak she voice be soft and very sweet above all thou art -- a man messire then do my beltane lift he head and see how the color be deepen in she cheek and how she tender eye droop before he tell I he say be there ever a woman to love such a man be there ever a woman who would leave the hum and glitter of city to walk with such as i in the shadow of these forest-land speak oh speak i do beseech thee thus say he and stop wait she answer nay beltane she whisper let thine own heart speak I this all blithe and glorious grow the world about he as he stoop and catch she in he arm lift she high against he heart and in this moment he forget the teaching of ambrose the hermit forget all thing under heaven save the glory of she beauty the droop languor of she eye and the sweet moist tremor of she mouth and so he kiss she murmur ` twixt he kiss : fairer art thou than all the flower o my love and sweeter thy breath than the breath of flower thus helen the proud the beautiful yield she lip to he and in all the world for she be nought save the deep soft voice of beltane and he eye and the new sweet ecstasy that thrill within she surely nowhere in all the world be there such another man as this so strong and gentle so meet for love and yet so virginal surely life might be very fair here in the green solitude aye surely surely -- soft with distance come the peal of bell steal across the valley from the great minster in mortain and with the sound memory wake and she bethink she of all those knight and noble who live but to do she will and pleasure of mortain and the glory of it and so she sigh and stir and look at beltane sigh again quoth she : be this great love i foretold come upon thee beltane and beltane answer : truly a man have not live until he have feel a woman 's kiss upon he lip and thou wilt flout poor love no more nay he answer smile ` tis part of I and must be so henceforth -- forever but now she sigh again and tremble in he arm and clasp he close as one beset by sudden fear while ever soft with distance come the silvery voice of the bell low yet insistent sweet yet commanding wherefore she sigh put he from she why then say she with droop head fare thee well messire nay see you not methink my task be do and it have be a -- please task this -- of teaching thee to love -- o would you have not learn so soon fare thee well beltane but beltane look upon she as one in deep amaze he arm fall from she and he step back and so stand very still and as he gaze a grow horror dawn within he eye what art thou he whisper nay beltane she murmur ah -- look not so who art thou -- and what he say nay do i not tell thee at the first i be helen -- hast thou not know i be helen -- helen of mortain thou -- thou art the duchess helen say beltane with stiffen lip thou the duchess and i -- a smith and he laugh short and fierce and would have turn from she but she stay he with quiver hand and -- do ` st not know she question hurriedly methought it be no secret -- i would have tell thee ere this have i know nay -- look not so beltane -- thou dost love I yet -- nay i do know it and she strive to smile but with lip that quiver strangely aye i love thee helen of mortain -- though there be many fair lord to do that but as for I -- i be only a smith and as a smith greatly would i despise thee yet may this not be for as my body be great so be my love go therefore thy work here be do go -- get thee to thy knightly lover wed this duke who seek thee -- do aught you will but go leave I to my hammer and these green solitude so speak he and turn stride away look not back to where she stand lean one white hand against a tree once she call to he but he heed not walk ever with bow head and hearing only the tumult within he and the throbbing of he wounded heart and now in he pain need must he think of yet another helen and of the blood and agony of blaze troy town and lift up he hand to heaven he cry aloud : alas that one so fair should be a thing so evil all in haste beltane come to he lonely hut and take thence he cloak and great sword he seize upon he mightiest hammer and beat down the roof of the hut and drave in the wall of it thereafter he heave the hammer into the pool together with he anvil and rack of tool and so set the sword in he girdle and the cloak about he turn away and plunge into the deeper shadow of the forest but ever soft and faint with distance the silvery voice of the bell steal upon the warm stilly air speaking of pomp and state of pride and circumstance but now these seem but empty thing and the duchess helen stand long with bent head and hand that strive to shut the sound away but in the end she turn slow-footed amid the gathering shadow and follow whither they call \* \* \* \* \* but that night sit in state within she great hall of mortain the duchess helen sigh deep and oft scarce heed the courtesy address to she and little the whisper homage of she guest duke ivo he the proudest and most potent of all she many wooer yet to-night she cheek burn beneath he close regard and she woman 's flesh rebel at he contact as have never be aforetime thus of a sudden though the meal be scarce begin she arise and step down from the dais and when she wonder lady would have follow forbid they with a gesture and so walk proud and tall she pass out before they whereat duke ivo 's black brow grow the blacker and he stare before he with narrow eye behold which the face of my lady 's counsellor wax anxious and long only winfrida chiefest of the lady watch the duke ` neath droop lid and with a smile upon she full red lip now the duchess be come to she chamber lift she hand and tear the ducal circlet from she brow and cast it from she and thereafter lay by she ring and jewel and come to the open casement fall there upon she knee and reach forth she pale hand to where across the valley the dark forest stretch away ghostly and unreal ` neath the moon my beloved she whisper o my beloved and the gentle night-wind bear she secret in its embrace away across the valley to the dim solitude of the wood beltane she sigh love have come into mine heart even as it come to thee when i recked not of it my beloved -- o my beloved anon she rise and stand awhile with head bow as one that dream and of a sudden she cheek glow warmly red she breath catch and she gaze upon the moon with eye of yearning tenderness thereafter she laugh soft and happily and snatch up a cloak set it about she and flee from the chamber so swift and light of foot she speed by hidden way until she come where old godric she chief huntsman busy himself trim the shaft of a boar-spear who behold he lady rise up in amaze godric say she white hand upon he arm thou didst love I or ever i could walk aye verily thou hast say dear my lady love you I

strictly charge thee to follow ever my call aye my lady then follow now and so she turn and beckon and godric perforce follow after hand in hand they go a-down the wind stair down to the great dim courtyard that whisper to they tread and thereafter mount in haste the duchess gallop from mortain unheeding stern old godric by she side and with never a look behind dream ever of beltane with cheek that crimson ` neath she hood fast and faster she ride ` neath the pale moon she eye ever gaze towards the gloom of the forest she heart throb quick as the hoof-beat of she horse so at last be come to that glade whereby beltane have he dwelling she light down and bidding godric wait steal forward alone autumn be at hand and here and there the fall leaf rustle sadly under foot while the tree sigh and mourn together for that the flower so soon must wither and die but in the heart of the duchess helen spring be come and all thing speak to she of come joy undreamed till now as she hast on flit through the pallid moonbeam that fall athwart rugged hole and far-flung branch splash the gloom with radiant light once she pause to listen but hear nought save the murmur of the brook and the faint stir of leaf and now clear and strong the tender radiance fall athwart the lonely habitation and she heart leap at the sight she eye grow moist and tender and she hurry forward with fly step then -- behold the ruin of thatch and wall she stop and stand aghast gaze wide-eyed and with she heart numb in she bosom then she shiver she proud head droop and a great sob brake from she for that she know she be come too late she dream of wander with beltane through sunny glade be nought but dream after all beltane the smith be go then a great loneliness and desolation come upon she and sink down at the foot of that tree whereby he have be wont to lean so often she yearning arm creep about its rugged hole and she lay there in the passion of she grief weep long and bitterly but the gentle tree cease mourning over they own come sorrow in wonder at the sight and bend they head together seem to whisper one to the other say : he be go beltane the smith be go chapter v which tell of the story of ambrose the hermit deep deep within the green twilight of the wood ambrose the hermit have build he a hut have build and frame it of rude stone and thatch it with grass and moss and from the door of the hut he have form likewise a path strew thick with jagged stone and sharp flint a cruel track the which wind away through the green lead to where upon a gentle eminence stand a wooden cross most artfully work and carven by the hermit 's skilled and loving finger morning and evening winter and summer it be he custom ever to tread this painful way wet the stone with the blood of he atonement now upon a certain rosy dawn ere yet the sun be up beltane standing amid the leaf see the hermit issue forth of the hut and with bow head and fold hand set out upon he appointed way the cruel stone grow red beneath he foot yet he falter not nor stay until be come to the cross he kneel there and with gaunt arm upraised pray long and fervently so that the tear of he passion stream down he furrowed cheek and wet the snow of he beard in a while have make a end he arise and be come to he hut once more he of a sudden espy beltane standing amid the leaf and because he be so fair and goodly to look upon in he youth and might the pale cheek of the hermit flush and a glow leap within he sunken eye and lift up he hand he bless he welcome to this my solitude my son quoth he and wherefore hast thou tarry in thy come i have watch for thee these many day come sit you here beside I in this bless sun and tell I of thy latter doings but the eye of beltane be sad and he tongue unready so that he stammer in he speech look ever upon the ground then suddenly up-starting to he foot he stride before the hut while ambrose the wise look and see yet spake not so presently beltane pause and look he within the eye speak hurriedly on this wise : most holy father thou knowest how i have live within the greenwood all my day nor find it lonely for i do love it so that i have think to die here likewise when my time should come yet now do i know that this shall never be -- to-day i go hence wherefore my son there be come a strange restlessness upon I a riot and fever of the blood whereby i be fill with dream and strange desire i would go forth into the great world of man and city to take my rightful place therein for until a man have loved and joy and sorrow with he fellow he knoweth nought of life perchance my son this be but the tide of youthful blood that tingle in thy vein or be it that thou hast look of late within a woman 's eye then beltane kneel he at the foot of ambrose and hide he face betwixt he knee as he have be wont to do while yet a little child father he murmur thou hast say now look down upon this golden head ambrose sigh and draw the long curl through he finger with a wondrous gentleness tell I of thy love beltane say he forthwith start to he foot beltane answer : ` tis many long and weary month my father and yet doth seem but yesterday she come to I ride upon a milk-white steed at first methought she of the fairy kind thither draw by my poor singing yet when i look on she again i know she to be woman and she be fair -- o very fair my father i may not tell she beauty for 'twa compound of all beauteous thing of the snow of lily the breath of flower the gleam of star on move water the music of stream the murmur of wind in tree -- i can not tell thee more but that there be a flame doth hide within she hair and for she eye -- o methink ` tis for she eye i do love she most -- love she aye my body doth burn and thrill with love -- alas poor fool alas it should be so but for that she be proud and of a high estate for that i be i a poor worker of iron whom man call beltane the smith fit but to sigh and sigh and forever sigh to dream of she and nothing more -- so must i go hence leave the sweet silence of the wood for the strife and noise of city learn to share the burden of my fellow see you not my father see you not the way of it so spake beltane hot and passionate stride to and fro upon the sward while ambrose sit with bitterness in he heart but with eye ineffably gentle and be this love of thine so hopeless my beltane beyond all think she be the duchess helen of mortain now for a while the hermit spake not sit chin in hand as one who halt betwixt two course ` tis strange he say at length and pass strange yet since ` tis she and she so much above thee wherefore would ye leave the tender twilight of these forest quoth beltane sighing : my father i tell thee these wood be full of love and she she looketh at I from the flower and stealeth to I in they fragrance the very brook do babble of she beauty each leaf doth find a little voice to whisper of she and everywhere be love and love and love -- so need must i away and think you so to escape this love my beltane and the pain of it nay my father that be thing impossible for it doth fill the universe so must i need remember it with every breath i draw but in the grief and sorrow of other i may perchance learn to bear mine own silent and patiently as a man should then ambrose sigh and beckon beltane to he knee lay he hand upon he shoulder and look deep within he eye beltane my son say he i have know thee from thy youth up and well do i know thou canst not lie for thy heart be pure as yet and uncorrupt but now be the thing i fear come upon thee -- ah beltane hast thou forget all i have tell thee of woman and the way of woman how that they white body be fill with all manner of wantonness they hand strong in lure and enticement a woman in she beauty be a fair thing to the eye of a man yet i tell thee beltane they be snare of the devil setting father ` gainst son and -- brother ` gainst brother whereby come unnatural murder and bloody war and yet need must i love she still my father aye ` tis so sigh ambrose ` tis ever so and as for thee well do i know the blood within thee for a hot wild blood -- and thou art young and so it be i fear for thee but look up beltane shake he head and answer : holy father thou art wise and wondrous learn in the reading of book and in the ancient wisdom and philosophy yet methink this love be a thing no book can teach thee a truth a man must need find out for himself and think you i know nought of love beltane the pain and joy of it -- and the shame thou seest I a poor old man and feeble bent with year and suffer one who but waiteth for the time when my grievous sin shall be atone for and god in he sweet clemency shall ease I of this burden of life yet do i tell thee there be a time when this frail body be strong and tall well-nigh as thine own when this white hair be thick and black and these dim eye bold and fearless even as thine ah beltane well do i know woman and the way of woman come sit you beside I and because thou art fain to go into the world and play thy man 's part so now will i tell thee that the which i have think to bear with I to the grave then ambrose the hermit lean he head upon he hand begin to speak on this wise : upon a time be two brother noble of a great house and follow each alike lover of peace yet each terrible in war the name of the one be johan and of the other beltane now beltane be elder be duke of that country and the country maintain peace within its border and the people thereof wax rich and happy and because these twain love each other pass well the way of the one be ever the way of the other so that they dwell together in a wondrous amity and as they heart be pure and strong so wax they in body so that there be none could cope with they at hand-stroke nor bear up against the might of they lance and o methink in all this fair world nought be there fairer than the love of these two brethren now it befall upon a day that they set out with a goodly company to attend a tourney in a certain town whither likewise be come many knight of renown noble and prince beyond count eager to prove they prowess thither draw by the fame of that fair lady who be to be queen of beauty all lip speak of she and the wonder of she charm how that a man could not look within she eye but must need fall into a passion of love for she but the brethren smile and pay small heed and so together journey to the city the day of the joust be come forth they ride into the list side by side each in he triple mail and ponderous helm alike at all point save for the golden circlet upon duke beltane 's shine casque and there befall that day a mighty shiver of lance and many a knightly deed be work but for these brethren there be none of all these knight and noble who might abide they onset all day long they together maintain the list till there none remain to cope with they wherefore the marshal would have have they run a course together for proof which be the mightier but beltane smile and shake he head say ` nay it be not meet that brother strive with brother ' and johan say : ` since the day doth rest with we we will share the glory together ' so amid the acclaim of voice and trumpet side by side they come to make obeisance to the queen of beauty and gaze upon she they see that she be indeed of a wondrous beauty now in she hand she hold the crown that should reward the victor yet because they be two she know not whom to choose wherefore she laugh and brake the crown asunder and give to each a half with many fair word and gentle saying but alas my son from that hour she beauty come betwixt these brethren veil they heart one from the other so they tarry awhile in that fair city yet company together no more for each be fain to walk apart dream of this woman and the beauty of she and each by stealth woo she to wife at last upon a evening come johan to he brother and take from he bosom the half of the crown he have win kiss it and give it to beltane say : ` the half of a crown availeth no man take therefore my half and join it with thine for well do i know thy heart my brother -- and thou art the elder and duke go therefore and woo this lady to wife and god speed thee my lord ' but beltane say : ` shame be it in I to take advantage of my year thus doth age or rank make a man 's love more worthy so get thee to thy woo my brother and heaven 's blessing on thee ' then grow johan full of joy say : ` so be it dear my brother but be i come not to thee within three day at sunset then shalt know that my woo have not prosper ' upon the third day therefore beltane the duke gird on he armor and make ready to ride unto he own demesne yet tarry until sunset accord to he word but he brother johan come not therefore he in turn ride upon he woo and come unto the lady 's presence in hauberk of mail and thus ungently clad woo she as one in haste to be go tell she that this world be no place for a man to sigh out he day at a woman 's foot and bid she answer he ' yea ' or ` nay ' and let he be go to he duty and she whom so many have woo on bended knee speak he ' yea ' -- for that a woman 's way be beyond all knowledge -- and therewith give she beauty to he keep so forthwith be they wed with much pomp and circumstance and so he bring she to he duchy with great joy and acclaim then would johan have depart over sea but beltane ever dissuade he and fain these brethren would have love each other as they have do aforetime yet be the beauty of this woman ever betwixt they now within that year come news of fire and sword upon the border of cruel rape and murder so beltane send forth he brother johan with a army to drive back the invader and himself abode in he great castle happy in the love of he fair young wife but the war go ill tiding come that johan he brother be beat back with much loss and he himself sore wounded therefore the duke make ready to set forth at the head of a veteran company but ere he ride a son be bear to he so need must he come to he wife in he armor and behold the child kiss he thereafter duke beltane ride to the war with a glad heart and fall upon he enemy and scatter they and pursue they far and smite they even to they own gate but in the hour of he triumph he fall by treachery into the hand of he cruelest enemy how it mattereth not and for a space be lose to sight and memory but as for johan the duke 's brother he lay long sick of he wound so come the duchess and minister to he and she be fair and pass fair and he be young and when he strength be come again each day be johan mind to ride forth and seek the duke he brother -- but he be young and she pass fair wherefore he tarry still bind by the lure of she beauty and upon a soft and stilly eve as they walk together in the garden she woo johan with tender look and word and wreathe she white arm about he and give to he she mouth and in that moment come one fierce and wild of aspect in dinted casque and rusty mail who stand and watch -- ah god here for a while the hermit ambrose stay he tale and beltane see he brow be moist and that he thin hand clench and wring each other so thus my son come duke beltane home again he and he esquire sir benedict of bourne alone of all he company each alike worn with hardship and spend with wound but now be the duke stricken of a greater pain and lean he upon the shoulder of he esquire faint and sick of soul and know a anguish deeper than any flesh may know then of a sudden madness come upon he and break from the mail arm that hold he he come hot-foot to the courtyard and to the hall beyond hurl aside all such as seek to stay he and so reach at last my lady 's bower he mail foot ring upon the atone and look up the duchess saw and cry aloud and stand thereafter pale and speechless and wide of eye while johan 's cheek grow red and in he look be shame then the duke put up he vizor and when he speak he voice be harsh and strange : ` greet good brother ' say he ` go now i pray you get you horse and armor and wait I in the courtyard yet first must i greet this my lady wife ' so johan turn with hang head and go slow-footed from the chamber then say the duke laughing in he madness ` behold lady the power of a woman 's beauty for i love a noble brother once a spotless knight whose honor reach high as heaven but thou hast make of he a something foul and base traitor to I and to he own sweet name and ` tis for this i will requite thee ' but the duchess spake not nor blench even when the dagger gleam to strike -- o sweet god of mercy to strike but in that moment come benedict of bourne and leap betwixt and take the blow upon he cheek and stanch the blood within he tattered war-cloak cry : ` lord duke because i love thee ne'er shalt thou do this thing until thou first slay I ' a while the duke stand in amaze then turn and stride away down the great stair and come to the courtyard behold he brother johan arm at all point and mount and with another horse equip near by so the duke laugh and close he vizor and he laughter boom hollow within he rusty casque and leap to the saddle ride to the end of the great tilt-yard and wheeling couch he lance so these brethren who have love each other so well spur upon each other with level lance but or ever the shock come -- o my son my son -- johan rise high in he stirrup and cry aloud the battle-cry of he house ` arise arise i shall arise ' and with the cry toss aside he lance lest he might harm the duke he brother -- o sweet clemency of christ -- and crash to earth -- and lay there -- very still and silent then the duke dismount and watch by pale-faced esquire and man-at-arms come and kneel beside he brother and lay aside he brother 's riven helm and behold he comely feature tear and mar and he golden hair all hatefully bedabble feel he heart burst in sunder and he groan and rise to stumbling foot come to he horse and mount and ride away ` neath grim portcullis and over echo drawbridge yet whithersoever he look he see only he brother 's dead face pale and bloody and fain he would have pray but could not and so he come into the forest all day long he ride beneath the tree careless of he go conscious only that benedict of bourne ride behind with he bloody war-cloak wrap about he but on ride the duke with hang head and listless hand for before he haggard eye be ever the pale dead face of johan he brother now as the moon rise they come to a brook that whisper soft-voiced amid the shadow and here he war-horse stay to drink then come sir benedict of bourne beside he ` lord duke ' say he ` what hast thou in thy mind to do ' ' i know not ' say the duke ` though methink ` twere sweet to die ' ` then what of the babe lord duke ' and speak sir benedict draw aside he cloak and show the babe asleep beneath but look upon its innocence the duke cry out and hide he face for the babe 's golden curl be dabble with the blood from sir benedict 's wound and look even as have the face of the dead johan yet in a while the duke reach out and take the child and set it against he breast turn he horse say sir benedict : ` whither do we ride lord duke ' then speak the duke on this wise : ` sir benedict duke beltane be no more the stroke that slew my brother johan kill duke beltane also but as for you get you to pentavalon and say the duke be dead in proof whereof take you this my ring and so farewell ' then my beltane god guide I i bring thee to these solitude for i be he that be the duke beltane and thou art my son indeed chapter vi how beltane fare forth of the green thus speak the hermit ambrose and have make a end sit thereafter with he head bow upon he hand while beltane stand wide-eyed yet see not and with lip apart yet dumb by reason of the wonder of it therefore in a while the hermit spake again : thus do we live together thou and i dear son and i love thee well my beltane : with each succeed day i love thee better for as thine understanding grow so grow my love for thee therefore so soon as thou wert of a age set in thy strength and able to thine own support i tear myself from thy sweet fellowship and live alone lest have thee i might come nigh to happiness then beltane sink upon he knee and catch the hermit 's waste hand and kiss they oft say : much hast thou suffer o my father but now be i come to thee again and know all thing here will i bide and leave thee nevermore now in the hermit 's pale cheek come a faint and sudden glow and in he eye a light not of the sun bethink thee boy say he the blood within thy vein be noble for since thou art my son so a thou dost leave I and seek thy destiny thou shalt perchance be duke of pentavalon -- a god will it so but beltane shake he head quoth he : my father i be a smith and smith be i content to be since thou lord duke art my father so now will i abide with thee and love and honor thee and be thy son indeed then rise the hermit ambrose to he foot and spake with eye uplift : now glory be to god who in he mercy have make of thee a man my beltane clean of soul and innocent yet strong of arm to lift and succor the distressed and therefore it be that you to-day must leave I my well-beloved for there be those whose need of thee be greater even than mine nay dear my father how may this be now hereupon ambrose the hermit stand awhile with bent head and spake not only he sigh full oft and wring he hand i thought but of myself he groan great sorrow be oft-times greatly selfish alas my son -- twenty weary year have i live here sue god 's forgiveness and for twenty bitter year pentavalon have groan ` neath shameful wrong -- and death in many hateful shape o god have mercy on a sinner who think but on himself list my son o list on a day as i kneel before yon cross come one in knightly armor and upon he face ` neath the link of he camail i see a great scar -- the scar this hand have work and even as i know sir benedict in that same moment he know I and give a joyous cry and come and fall upon he knee and kiss my hand as of old thereafter we talk and he tell I many a woeful tale of pentavalon and of its misery how when i be go rise bitter fight and faction baron and knight strive together which should be duke in the midst of the which disorder come one from beyond sea whom man call ivo who by might of sword and cunning tongue make himself duke in my place sir benedict tell of a fierce and iron rule of the pillage and ravishment of town and city of outrage and injustice of rack and flame and gibbet -- of a people groan ` neath a thousand cruel wrong then indeed do i see that my one great sin a thousand other sin have breed and be i full of bitter sorrow and anguish and in my anguish i think on thee and send to thee sir benedict and watch thee wrestle and at stroke of sword and praise god for thy goodly might and strength for o dear my son meseemeth that god have raise thee up to succor these afflict to shield the weak and helpless -- have make thee great and mightier than most to smite evil that it may flee before thee so in thee shall my youth be renew and my sin peradventure purge away father say beltane rise he blue eye wide he strong hand a-tremble o my father then ambrose clasp those quiver hand and kiss those wide and troubled eye and spake thereafter slow and soft : now shall i live henceforth in thee my son glory in thy deed hereafter and if thou must need -- bleed then shall my heart bleed with thee or if thou meet with death my beltane then shall this heart of mine die with thee thus speak the hermit draw the sword from beltane 's girdle and hold the great blade towards heaven behold my son say he the motto of we house ' i will arise ' so now shalt thou arise indeed that thy destiny may be fulfil take hold upon thy manhood my well-beloved get thee to woeful pentavalon and behold its sorrow seek how they may be assuage now my beltane all be say -- when wilt thou leave thy father quoth beltane gather he cloak about he : a so it be thy wish my father then will i go this hour then ambrose bring beltane into he humble dwelling where be a coffer work by he own skilful finger and from this coffer he draw forth a suit of triple mail wondrously fashion behold the which beltane 's eye glisten because of the excellence of its craftsmanship behold quoth the hermit ` tis a armor worthy of a king light be it yet marvellous strong and have be well try in many a desperate affray ` tis twenty year since these limb bear it yet see -- i have keep it bright from rust lest peradventure pentavalon should need thee to raise again the battle cry of thy house and lead she man to war and alas dear son that day be now pentavalon call to thee from out the gloom of dungeon from the anguish of flame and rack and gibbet -- from blood-soaked hearth and shameful grave she call thee -- so my beltane come and let I arm thee and there within he little hut the hermit ambrose duke of pentavalon that be gird the armor upon beltane the mighty duke of pentavalon to be if so god will first the gambeson of stuff and quilt leather and thereafter coif hauberk and chauss with wide sword-belt clamp with broad plate of silver and stud of gold until my beltane stand up arm in shine mail from head to foot then bring ambrose a wallet wherein be six gold piece and put it in he hand say : these have i keep against this day my beltane take they to aid thee on thy journey for the county of bourne lieth far to the south do i then journey to bourne my father aye to sir benedict who yet doth hold the great keep of thrasfordham many siege have he withstand and daily man flee to he -- stricken man runaway serf and outlaw from the green all such masterless man as lie in fear of they life say beltane slow and thoughtful : there be many outlaw within the green wild man and sturdy fighter as i have hear have sir benedict many man my father alas a pitiful few and black ivo can muster bow and lance by the ten thousand -- yet doth sir benedict withstand they all my father yet must he keep ever within bourne beltane all pentavalon save bourne lieth ` neath ivo 's iron foot rule by he fierce noble and they be strong and many ` gainst whom sir benedict be helpless in the field ` tis but five year agone since ivo give up fair belsaye town to ravishment and pillage and thereafter build he a mighty gallows over against it and hang many man thereon now hereupon of a sudden beltane clench he hand and fall upon he knee father say he pentavalon indeed doth cry so must i now arise and go unto she give I thy blessing that i may go then the hermit lay he hand upon beltane 's golden head and bless he and whisper awhile in passionate prayer thereafter beltane arise and together they come out into the sunshine south and by west must you march dear son and god methink shall go beside thee for thy foot shall tread a path where death shall lie in wait for thee let thine eye be watchful therefore and thine ear quick to hear hearken you to all man yet speak you few word and soft but when you act let you deed shout unto heaven that all pentavalon may know a man be come to lead they who fear only god and so my beltane fare-thee-well come kiss I boy we next kiss perchance -- shall be in heaven and thus they kiss and look within each other 's eye then beltane turn he swift and sudden and stride upon he way but in a little look back he see he father kneel before the cross with long gaunt arm upraise to heaven chapter vii how beltane talk with one hight gile brabblecombe who be a notable and learn archer the morning be yet young when my beltane fare forth into the world a joyous golden morning trill with the glad song of bird and rich with a thousand dewy scent a fair sweet joyous world it be indeed whose glory steal in at eye and ear fill he with they gladness on stride my beltane by ripple brook and sleepy pool with step swift and light and eye wide and shine thread a unerring course as only a forester might now cross some broad and sunny glade where dawn yet linger in rosy mist anon plunge into the green twilight of dell and dingle through tangled brush and scented bracken gemm yet with dewy fire by marsh and swamp and lichen rock until he come out upon the forest road that great road lay by the iron man of rome but now little better than a grassy track yet here and there with mossy stone set up to the glory of proud emperor and hardy centurion long since dust and ash a rutted track indeed but lead ever on ` neath mighty tree over hill and dale towards the blue mystery beyond now in a while be come to the brow of a hill need must my beltane pause to look back upon the woodland he have love so well and sigh he stretch he arm thitherward and lo out of the soft twilight of the green steal a gentle wind full of the scent of root and herb and the fresh sweet smell of earth a cool soft wind that stir the golden hair at he temple like a caress and so -- be go for a while he stand thus gaze towards where he know he father yet kneel in prayer for he then turn he slowly and go he appointed way thus do beltane bid farewell to the greenwood and to woodland thing and thus do the green spirit of the wood send forth a gentle wind to kiss he on the brow ere he go out into the world of man and city now after some while as he walk beltane be aware of the silvery tinkle of bell and therewith a full sweet voice upraise in song and the song be right merry and the word likewise : o ne'er shall my lust for the bowl decline nor my love for my good long bow for as bow to the shaft and as bowl to the wine be a maid to a man i trow look about beltane see the singer a comely fellow whose long leg bestride a plump ass a lusty man he be clothe in shirt of mail and with a feather of green brooch to he escalloped hood a long-bow hung at he back together with a quiver of arrow while at he thigh swing a heavy broad-bladed sword now he espy beltane amid the leaf bring the ass to a sudden halt and clap hand to the pommel of he sword how now goliath cry he _ pax vobiscum _ and likewise _ benedicite _ come ye in peace forsooth or be it to be _ bellum internecinum _ though by st gile which be my patron saint i care not how it be for mark ye _ vacuus cantat coram latrone viator _ sir goliath the which in the vulgar tongue signifieth that he who travel with a empty purse laugh before the footpad -- moreover i have a sword but beltane laugh say : i have no lust to thy purse most learn bowman or indeed to aught of thine unless it be thy company my company quoth the bowman look beltane up and down with merry blue eye why now do i know thee for a fellow of rare good judgment for my company be of the best in that i have a tongue which loveth to wag in jape or song hear ye how the bird and i be a-carolling a right blithesome morn methink what with my song and the bird ' song and this poor ass 's bell -- aye and the flower a-peep from the bank yonder god give ye joy of it tall brother as he doth I and this goodly ass betwixt my knee patient beast now lean on he quarter-staff beltane smile and say : how come ye by that same ass master bowman well -- i meet a monk quoth the fellow with a gleam of white tooth o a ponderous monk brother of most mighty girth of belly now as ye see though this ass be sleek and fat as a abbot she be something small ` and shall so small a thing need bear so great a mountain o ' flesh ' say i -lrb- much move at the sight brother -rrb- ` no by the bless bone of st gile -lrb- which be my patron saint brother -rrb- so thereafter -lrb- by dint of a little persuasion brother -rrb- my mountainous monk to ease the poor beast 's back presently get he down and i forthwith get up -- as be more in proportion to she weight sweet beast o surely ne'er saw i fairer morn than this and never in so fair a morn see i fairer man than thou sir forester nor taller and i have see many man in my day wherefore a so ye will let we company together what time we may ` tis a solitary road and the tongue be a rare shortener of distance so beltane stride on beside this garrulous bowman hearken to he merry talk yet himself speak short and to the point as be ever he custom as thus : bowman how do man call thee tall brother beltane beltane bowman ha ` tis a good name forsooth i have hear worse -- and yet forsooth i have hear better yet ` tis a fairish name -- ` twill serve as for I gile brabblecombe o ' the hill man call I for 'twa in the hill country i be bear thirty odd year agone since then twelve siege have i see with skirmish and onfall thrice as many death have i beheld in many and diver shape and in experience of wound and danger be rich though by st gile -lrb- my patron saint -rrb- in little else yet do i love life the better therefore and i have read that ` to despise gold be to be rich ' beltane do all bowman read then bowman why look ye brother i be not what i be aforetime -- _ non sum quail eram _ -- i be breed a shavele a mumbler a be-gowned do-nothing -- brother i be a monk but the flesh and the devil make of I a bowman heigho -- so wag the world though methink i be a better bowman than ever i be a monk have get I some repute with this my bow beltane -lrb- shake he head -rrb- methink thy choice be but a sorry one for -- bowman -lrb- laughing -rrb- choice quotha 'twa no choice 'twa force upon I _ vi et armis _ i should be chant prime or matins at this very hour but for this tongue o ' mine god bless it for when it should have be drone psalm it be forever lilting forth some blithesome melody some merry song of eye and lip and steal kiss in such sort that the good brethren be wont to gather round and listening -- sigh whereof it chance i be one night by order of the holy prior drub forth of the sacred precinct so brother anselm become gile o ' the bow -- the kind saint be praise in especial holy saint gile -lrb- which be my patron saint -rrb- for heed I -- better the blue sky and the sweet strong wind than the gloom and silence of a cloister i have rather hide this sconce of mine in a hood of mail than in the mitre of a lord bishop -- _ nolo episcopare _ good brother thus be i a fighter and a good fighter and a wise fighter have learn ` tis better to live to fight than to fight to live beltane and for whom do ye fight bowman for he that pay most _ pecunia obediunt omnium _ brother beltane -lrb- frowning -rrb- money and nought beside bowman -lrb- stare -rrb- as what brother beltane the justice of the cause wherefore ye fight bowman justice quotha -- cause o innocent brother what have such matter to do with such as i see you now such lieth the case you let we say be a baron -lrb- and therefore noble -rrb- have a mind to a certain other baron 's castle or wife or both -- -lrb- the which be more usual -rrb- wherefore ye come to I who be but a plain bowman know nought of the case and you chaffer with I for the use of this my body for so much money and thereafter i shoot my best on thy behalf as in mine honor bind thus have i fight both for and against black ivo throughout the length and breadth of he duchy of pentavalon if ye be mind to sell that long sword o ' thine to none better market could ye come for there be ever work for such about black ivo beltane aye ` tis so i hear bowman nor shall ye anywhere find a doughtier fighter than duke ivo nor a leader quicker to spy out the vantage of position and attack beltane be he so lusty a man-at-arms bowman with lance axe or sword he have no match i have see he lead a charge i have watch he fight afoot i have storm behind he through a breach and i know of none dare cope with he -- unless it be sir pertolepe the red beltane hast ne'er hear tell then of benedict of bourne bowman -lrb- clap hand to thigh -rrb- now by the blood and bone of st gile ` tis so out o ' the mouth of a babe and suckling be i correct verily if there be one to front black ivo ` tis benedict o ' the mark to behold these two at handstroke -- with axis -- ha there would be a sweet affray indeed -- a sight for the eye of holy archangel dost know aught of sir benedict o innocence beltane i have see he bowman then my soft and gentle dove-like youth get thee to thy marrow-bone and pray that kind heaven shall make thee more he like for in he shoe doth stand a man -- a knight -- a very paladin beltane who fighteth not for -- hire sir bowman bowman yet who hireth to fight sir dove-eyed giant for i have fight for he ere now within he great keep of thrasfordham within bourne but a ye seek employ he be but a poor service where a man shall come by harder knock than good broad piece beltane and yet ` spite thy cunning and all thy war thy purse goeth empty bowman my purse sir dive aye i tell thee so for that i be by nature cautious -- _ sicut mo est nobis _ but thy dive 's eye be honest eye so now shall you know that hide within the lining of this my left boot be eighty and nine gold piece and in my right a ring with stone of price and moreover here behold a goodly chain so say the bowman draw from he bosom a gold chain thick and long and heavy and hold it up in the sunlight i get this sir dive together with the ring and diver other toy at the storm of belsaye five year agone aha a right good town be belsaye and grow rich and fat against another pluck and how come belsaye to be storm quoth gile the bowman eye he golden chain : my lord duke ivo have a mind to a certain lady who be yet but a merchant 's daughter look ye but she be young and wondrous fair for duke ivo have a quick eye and rare judgment in such pretty matter but she -lrb- and she but a merchant 's daughter -rrb- take it ill and when duke ivo 's messenger come to bear she to he presence she whine and struggle as be ever woman 's way and thereafter in the open street snatch a dagger and thereupon before she father 's very eye do slay herself -lrb- and she but a merchant 's daughter -rrb- whereat some hot-head pluck out sword and other citizen likewise and of my lord duke 's messenger there none escape save one and he sore wound so belsaye city shut its gate ` gainst my lord duke and set out fighting-hoard upon its wall yet my lord duke batter and breach it for few can match he in a siege and storm it within three day and by saint gile though he lose the merchant 's daughter methink he lack not at all for the woman of belsaye be wondrous fair the rise sun make a glory all about they pour he beam ` twixt mighty tree whose knotted far-flung branch dapple the way here and there with shadow but now beltane saw nought of it by reason that he walk with head a-droop and eye that stare earthward moreover he hand be clench and he lip close and grim-set as for gile o ' the bow he chirrup merrily to the ass and whistle full melodiously mock a blackbird that pipe amid the green yet in a while he turn to stare at beltane rubbing at he square shaven chin with strong brown finger forsooth quoth he nod thou ` rt a lusty fellow sir gentleness by the tooth of st gile which be my patron saint ne'er saw i a goodlier spread of shoulder nor such a proper length of arm to twirl a axe withal and thy leg like I well -- hast the makings of a right lusty man-at-arms in thee despite thy soft and peaceful look yet a lover of peace be i say beltane he head yet droop peace quotha -- peace ha by all the holy saint -- peace a soft word a woman 's word a word smacking of babe and milk out upon thee what have a man with such a arm -- aye and leg -- to do with peace a you would now i could bring ye to good service ` neath duke ivo 's banner ` tis say he have swear this year to burn thrasfordham keep to hang benedict o ' the mark and lay waste to bourne aha you shall see good fighting ` neath ivo 's banner sir dive then beltane raise he head and spake swift and sudden on this wise : a i must fight the which god forbid yet once this my sword be draw ne'er shall it rest till i lie dead or black ivo be no more then do the archer stare upon my beltane in amaze with eye full wide and mouth agape nor spake he for awhile then : black ivo -- thou he cry and laugh amain go to my tender youth say he methink a lute be better fit to thy hand than that great sword o ' thine now behold beltane 's gloomy face he smile within he hand yet eye he thoughtfully thereafter and so they go with never a word betwixt they but in a while the archer fall to snuff the air and clap beltane upon the shoulder aha quoth he methink we reach the fair duchy of pentavalon smell ye aught brother and now indeed beltane become aware of a cold wind foul and noisome a deadly clammy air breathing of thing corrupt chill the flesh with swift unthinking dread and halt in disgust he look about he leave and right above -- above cry gile o ' the bow this be sir pertolepe 's country -- look you heavenward sir innocence then lift he eye to the shiver leave overhead beltane of a sudden espy a naked foot -- a down-curving claw-like thing shrivel and hideous and glance higher yet behold a sight to blast the sun from heaven : now stare up at the contorted horror of this shrivelled thing that once have live and laugh beltane let fall he staff and be suddenly sick and faint sink upon he knee and cover he eye crouch there in the grass the while that grisly silent thing sway to and fro above he in the gentle wind of morning and the cord whereby it hang creaked faintly how now -- how now cry gile do ye blench before this churlish carrion aha ye shall see the tree bear many such hereabouts get up my qualmish maid-like youth he ne'er shall injure thee nor any man again -- save by the nose -- faugh rise rise and let we be go so presently beltane shiver get he to he foot and look up pale-faced beheld upon the ragged breast a parchment with this legend in fair good writing : he kill a deer then speak beltane ` twixt pallid lip : and do they hang man for kill deer in this country aye forsooth and very properly for heed I you ragged rogue be a plenty but a stag be a noble creature and something scarcer -- moreover they be the duke 's by whose order be this do why the parchment beareth the badge of sir pertolepe call the red but look you sir innocent no man may kill a deer unless he be of gentle blood and wherefore ` tis so the law and who make the law why -- as to that quoth gile rub he chin as to that -- what matter it to you or I pah come away lest i stifle but now even as they stand thus out of the green come a cry hoarse at first but rise ever higher until it seem to fill the world about and set the very leave a-quiver once it come and twice and so -- be go then beltane tremble stooped and catch up he long quarter-staff and seize the bowman in a shake hand that yet be strong and drag he from the ass all in a moment plunge into the underbrush whence the cry have come and in a while they behold a cottage upon whose threshold a child lay -- not asleep yet very still and beyond the cottage he back to a tree a great hairy fellow quarter-staff in hand make play against five other whose steel cap and ringed hauberk glitter in the sun close and ever closer they beset the hairy man who bleed at the shoulder yet swing he heavy staff but ever the glitter pike-head thrust more close beside the man a woman crouch young and of comely seeming despite wild hair and garment tear and wrench who of a sudden with another loud cry leap before the hairy man cover he with she clinging body and in that moment she scream die to a choke gasp and she sink huddle ` neath a pike-thrust then beltane leap the great sword flash in he grasp and smite the smiter and set he foot upon the writhe body and smote amain with terrible arm and he laughter ring out fierce and wild so for a space sword clash with pike but ever beltane laugh loud drave they before he till but two remain and they writhe upon the sward then beltane turn to see gile o ' the bow who lean against a tree near by wide-eyed and pale look he cry point with quiver finger one dead and one sore hurt -- saint gile save we what have ye do these be sir pertolepe 's forester -- behold he badge but beltane laugh fierce-eyed how bowman dost blench before a badge then i be too meek and gentle for thee ere this but now if thou ` rt afraid -- get you go art surely mad quoth gile the saint be my witness here be no act of mine so say he turn away and hast swift-footed through the green now when the bowman be go beltane turn he to the hairy man who yet kneel beside the body of the woman say he : good fellow be there aught i may do for thee wife and child -- and dead the man mutter child and wife -- and dead a week ago my brother -- and now the child and then the wife child and wife and brother -- and dead then beltane come mind to aid he

the while this state continue friar thou art either rogue or fool beltane well thou hast thy choice friar alack this sorry world be full of rogue and fool and -- beltane and friar friar who seek the salvation of this wretched world beltane as how friar forsooth we meditate and pray -- beltane and eat friar aye verily we do a little in that way as the custom be for you reverent eater begetteth a devout pray-er the which mindeth I i grow a hungered yet will i forego appetite and yield thee this fair pasty for but two of thy gold piece and look ye ` tis a noble pasty i have this day from my

knight -- beltane that ravisheth the defenceless whose hand be foul with the blood of innocence -- friar how -- how ` tis a godly lord who giveth bounteously to holy church -- beltane who stealeth from the poor -- friar stealeth holy saint dunstan dare ye speak thus of so great a lord -- a son of the church a companion of we noble duke steal forsooth the poor have nought to steal beltane they have they life friar not so they and they life be they lord 's ` tis so the law and -- beltane whence come this law friar it come youth -- it come -- aye of god beltane say rather of the devil friar holy saint michael -- ` tis a blasphemous youth never hear ear the like o ' this -- beltane whence cometh poverty and famine friar ` tis a necessary evil doth it not say in holy writ ` the poor ye have always with you ' beltane aye so shall ye ever -- until the law be amend so need must man starve and starve -- friar there be worse thing and these serf be bear to starve breed up to it and ` tis better to starve here than to perish hereafter better to purge the soul by lack of meat than to make of it a fetter of the soul excellently say holy sir quoth beltane stooping of a sudden but for this pasty now ` tis a somewhat solid fetter meseemeth so now do i free thee of it -- thus so say my beltane drop the pasty into the deeper water of the brook and thereafter take up he staff sir friar say he behold to-day be thy soul purge of a pasty against the day of judgment then beltane go on beside the ripple water of the brook but above its plash and murmur rise the deeptoned malediction of friar guus chapter ix wherein be some account of the philosophy of folly and the wisdom of a fool as the day advance the sun grow ever hotter bird chirp drowsily from hedge and thicket and the warm still air be full of the slumberous drone of a myriad unseen wing therefore beltane seek the deeper shade of the wood and risk the chance of rove thief or lurk foot-pad follow a devious course by reason of the underbrush now as he walk he thus within the cool green twilight watchful of eye and with heavy quarter-staff poise upon he shoulder he presently hear the music of a pipe now very mournful and sweet anon break into a merry lilt full of ripple trill and soft bubble note most pleasant to be hear wherefore he go aside and thus lead by the music behold a jester in he motley lie a-sprawl beneath a tree a long-legged knave be he pinch and something doleful of visage yet with quick bright eye that laugh ` neath sombre brow and a wide up-curving mouth upon he escalloped cape and flaunt cock 's - comb be many little bell that ring a silvery chime as up-starting to he elbow he greet my beltane thus : hail noble youthful sir and of thy sweet and gracious courtesy i pray you mark I this -- the sun be hot my belly lacketh and thou art a fool and wherefore question beltane lean he upon he quarter-staff for three rarely reasonable reason sweet sir as thus : -- item for that the sun burneth item my belly be empty and item thou lure by this my foolish pipe art hither come to folly so i a fool do greet thee fool and welcome thee to this my palace of ease and pleasaunce where a ye be mind to list to the folly of a rarely foolish fool i will with foolish jape and quip befool thy mind to mirth and jollity for thou art a sad fool methink and something melancholic quoth beltane sigh : ` tis a sad world and very sorrowful nay -- ` tis a sweet world and very joyful -- for such as have eye to see withal to see quoth beltane frown this day have i see a dead man a-swing on a tree a babe dead beside its cradle and a woman die upon a spear all day have i breathe a air befoul by nameless evil whithersoever i go need must i walk ` twixt murder and shame then look ever before thee so shalt see neither yet will they be there yet doth the sun shine in high heaven so must these thing be till god and the saint shall mend they but if thou must need be doleful go make thee trouble of thine own but leave the woe of this wide world to god nay say beltane shake he head how if god leave these thing to thee and I why then methink the world must wag as it will yet must we repine therefore out upon thee for a sober long-legged doleful wight now harkee here sit i -- less fool a fool who have this day be drive forth of my lord 's presence with blow and cruel stripe and wherefore 'twa for set a bird free of its cage a small matter methink -- though there be bird -- and bird but mum for that yet do i grieve and sigh therefore o doleful long-shank not so -- fie o not i blow away my sorrow through the music of this my little pipe and lie here set my wit a-dancing and lo i be a duke a king a very god i create I a world wherein be neither hunger nor stripe a world of joy and laughter for bless within he dream even a fool may walk with god and juggle with the star aye nodded beltane but how when he awake why then messire laugh the fellow leap nimbly to he foot why then doth he ask alms of thee as thus : prithee most noble messire of thy bounty show kindness to a fool that lack everything but wit so give messire give and spare not so may thy lady prove kind thy woo prosper and love strengthen thee now when the jester spake of love my beltane must need sigh amain and shake a doleful head alas say he within my life shall be no place for love methink heigho sigh the jester thy very look doth proclaim thee lover and ` tis well for love maketh the fool wise and the wise fool it changeth saint into rogue and rogue into saint it teacheth the strong man gentleness and maketh the gentle strong ` tis sweeter than honey yet bitter as gall -- love ah love can drag a man to hell or lift he high as heaven aye verily sigh beltane i once do dream of such a love but now be i awake nor will i dream of love again nor rest while lust and cruelty rule this sorrowful duchy -- ha what would ye then fond youth i be come to smite they hence say beltane clench mighty fist how cry the jester wide of eye alone nay methink god goeth with I moreover i have this sword and speak beltane touch the hilt of the great blade at he side what -- a sword scoff the jester think ye to mend the woe of thy fellow with a sword go to thou grave-visaged youthful fool i tell thee ` tis only humor and good fellowship can mend this wretched world and there be nought so lack in humor as a sword -- unless it be you prating priest or mumble monk a pope in cap and bell now -- aha there would be a world indeed a world of joy and laughter no more gloom no more ban and damning of holy church no more groan and snivel in damp cloister and mildewed chapel no more burning and hanging and racking -- yet say beltane shake he head yet would king and duke remain christian knight and godly lord to burn and hang and rack the defenceless aye sir gravity nod the jester but the church be paramount ever set the pope a-blowing of tune upon a reed and king would lay by they sceptre and pipe too and find no time or lust for war so strife would end sword rust and wit grow keen and wit look you biteth sharper than sword laughter be more enduring than blow and he who smiteth smiteth only for lack of wit so a you would have a happy world lay by that great sword and betake thee to a little pipe teach man to laugh and so forget they woe learn wisdom of a fool as thus : ` tis better to live and laugh and beget thy kind than to perish by the sword or to dangle from a tree here now be advice and in this advice thy life thus in give thee advice so do i give thee thy life and i be hungry and in thy purse be money wherewith even a fool might come by food and youth be generous and thou art very young come sweet youthful messire how much for thy life -- and a fool 's advice then beltane smile and take out one of he three remain gold piece put it in the jester 's hand fare thee well good fool say he i leave thee to thy dream god send they be ever fair -- gold cry the jester spin the coin upon he thumb ha now do i dream indeed may thy wake be ever as joyous farewell to thee thou kind sweet youthful fool and if thou must hang some day on a tree may every leaf voice small prayer for thy gentle soul so say the jester nod wave aloft he bauble and skip away among the tree but as beltane go ponder the jester 's say the drowsy stillness be shiver by a sudden loud cry follow thereafter by a clamor of fierce shout therefore beltane pause and turn behold the jester himself who run very fleetly yet with three lusty fellow in close pursuit messire pant the jester wild of eye and with a trickle of blood upon he pallid face o sweet sir -- let they not slay I now while he speak and be yet some way off he trip and fall and as he lay thus the foremost of he pursuer a powerful red-faced man leap towards he whirling up he quarter-staff to smite but in that moment beltane leap also and take the blow upon he staff and swing it aloft yet stay the blow and bestride the prostrate jester spake soft and gentle on this wise : greet to thee forest fellow thy red face liketh I well let we talk together but hereupon as the red-faced man fall back stare in amaze there come he two companion albeit panting and short of breath what roger cry one doth this fellow withstand thee but roger only growl while beltane smile upon the three gentle-eyed but with heavy quarter-staff poise lightly in practiced hand quoth he : how now would ye harm the fool ` tis a goodly fool forsooth yet with leg scarce so nimble as he wit and a tongue -- ha a golden tongue to win all man to humor and good fellowship -- enough growl red-faced roger sir pertolepe 's forester we be give we yon scurvy fool then that we may hang he out of hand nay answer beltane first let we reason together let we hark to the wisdom of folly and grow wise -- ha roger cry one of the man tap I this tall rogue on he golden mazzard or say beltane the fool shall charm thy soul to kindliness with he pipe -- ho roger cry the second forester split I this tall talker 's yellow sconce now come growl roger threaten of mien yield we the fool ` tis a arrant knave have angered he lord what matter for that say beltane so he have not angered he god come now ye be hearty fellow and have face that might be honest tell I how long will ye serve the devil devil ha what talk be this we serve no devil aye nod beltane though they call he pertolepe the red hereabouts devil cry black roger aghast and fall back a step he gape in amaze from beltane to he gaping fellow devil forsooth he gasp aha i have see many a man hang for less than

beltane he eye widen those hand of thine belike have hang a man ere this aye many a score oho folk know black roger 's name hereabouts i carry ever a noose at my girdle here -- behold it and he show a coil of rope that swing at he belt now look from the man 's grim feature to this murderous cord beltane blench and shiver whereat black roger laugh aloud and point a scornful finger look ` ee ` tis fair good rope this and well-tried and shall bear even thy great carcase sweetly -- aye sweetly -- how -- would ` st hang I also say beltane faintly and the heavy quarter-staff sag in he loosen grip hang thee -- aye thou didst withstand we with this fool thou hast dare miscall we lord -- we be all witness to it so now will we -- but swift as lightning-flash beltane 's long quarter-staff whirl and fall and for all he hood of mail black roger throw wide he arm and stagger fall upon he face and so lay then fierce and grim he have leap upon the other two and the air be full of the rattle and thud of vicious blow but these forester be right lusty fellow and they together beset my beltane so furiously right and leave that he perforce give back ` neath they swift and grievous blow and be overmatched turn and betake he to he heel whereat they incontinent pursue with loud gibe and fierce laughter but on run beltane up the glade very fleetly yet watchful of eye until see one have outstrip he fellow he check he go somewhat stumbling as one that be spend whereat the forester shout the louder and come on amain then do my cunning beltane leap aside and leap turn and smite the fellow clean and true upon the crown and laugh to see he fall run in upon the other forester with whirling quarter-staff now this fellow see himself stand alone stay not to abide the onset but turn about make off into the green then beltane lean he pant upon he staff what time the fall man get he unsteadily to he leg and limp after he comrade as for the jester he be go long since only black roger lay upon he face and groan faintly ever and anon wherefore come beltane and stand above he as one in thought and see he begin to stir take from he he sword and coil of rope and loose off he swordbelt therewith bind he hand fast together and so drag he ` neath a tree that stand hard by thus when at last black roger open he eye he behold beltane standing above he and in he hand the deadly rope now look from this to the desolation about he black roger shiver and gaze up into ' the stern face above he florid cheek grow pale master say he hoarsely what would ye i would do to thee as thou hast do to other hang I aye quoth beltane and set the noose about he neck cast the rope across a branch master how shall my death profit thee the world shall be the better and thy soul know less of

shrine that stand beside the way where be a grot build by some pious soul for the rest and refreshment of wearied traveller and here also be a crystal spring the which bubble up fall with a musical plash into the basin hollow within the rock by those same kindly hand here beltane stay and when he have drunk he fill lay he down in the grateful shade and set he cloak beneath he head despite he hunger presently fall asleep when he awake the sun be down and the world be become a place of mystery and glooming shadow a bird call plaintively afar off in the dusk the spring bubble softly near by but save for this a deep silence brood over all thing above the gloom of the tree the sky be clear where bat wheel and hover and beyond the purple upland a orb moon be rise now as beltane breathe the cool sweet air of evening and look about he drowsily he suddenly espy a shadow within the shadow a dim figure -- yet formidable and full of menace and he start up weapon in fist whereupon the threatening figure stir and spake : master -- ` tis i say a voice then beltane come forth of the grot and stare upon black roger grave-eyed o hangman say he where be thy noose but roger quail and hang

away master he whisper these should be sir pertolepe 's man methink but beltane shake he head : i be fain to see why they laugh say he and speak steal forward soft-footed amid the shadow and so presently parting the leaf look down into a open dell or dingle full of the light of the rise moon light that glint upon the steel cap and hauberk of some score man who lean upon pike or gisarm about one who sit upon a fall tree -- and beltane see that this be gile the bowman but the arm of gile be bind behind he back about he neck hang a noose and he face show white and pallid ` neath the moon as lift up he head he begin to sing : o ne'er shall my lust for the bowl decline nor my love for my good long bow for as bow to the shaft and as bowl to the wine be a -- the rich voice be strangle to a gasp sob as the rope be tighten suddenly about the singer 's brawny throat and he be swing kick into the air amid the hoarse gibe and laughter of the man-at-arms but grim and silent beltane leap down among they he long blade glittering in the moonlight and before the mighty sweep of it they fall back crowd upon each other and confused then beltane turn cut asunder the cord and gile brabblecombe fall and lay ` neath the shade of the tree wheeze and whimper in the grass and now with a clamor of cry and fierce rally shout the man-at-arms see beltane stand alone set themselves in array and begin to close in upon he but beltane face they in the tender moonlight set the point of he sword to earth and reach out he mail hand in salutation greet brother say he why seek ye the death of this we brother come now suffer he to go he way in peace and god 's blessing on ye one and all now at this some laugh and some growl and one stand forth before he fellow stare upon beltane ` neath close-drawn

now will i ransom this man 's life of ye here be two piece of gold ` tis my all -- yet take they and yield I he life hereupon the man fall to mutter together doubtfully but in this moment the grizzled

` tis he that come upon we in the green this day and slew we comrade michael come now let we hang he forthwith and share he money betwixt we after then my beltane sigh amain and sigh unsheathed he dagger alas say he and must we shed each other 's blood forsooth come then let we slay each other and may christ have pity on we soul thus say he glance up at the pale splendor of the moon and round he on the encircle shadow of the wood dense and black beneath the myriad leaf and so quick-eyed and poise for action wait for the rush and even as they come upon he he spring aside where the gloom lay blackest and they be many and the clearing small they hamper each other and fall into confusion and in that moment beltane leap among they and smote and smote again now in the moonlight now in shadow leap quick-footed from the thrust of sword and pike crouching ` neath the heavy swing of axe and gisarm and ever he terrible blade dart with deadly point or fall with deep-biting edge hand grip at he from the gloom arm strive to clasp he but he dagger-hand be swift and strong pike head leap at he and be smite away axe and gisarm strike yet find he not and ever as he leap he smite and now in he ear be cry and groan and other hateful sound and to he nostril come a reek of sweating flesh and the scent of trampled grass while the moon 's tender light show face wild and fierce that come and go now here -- now there it glint on head-piece and ringed mail and flash back from whirling steel -- a round placid moon that seem all at once to burst asunder and vanish smitten into nothingness he be down -- beat to he knee deafen and half blind but struggle to he foot he stagger out from the friendly shadow of the tree out into the open a sword hard-driven bent and snapped short upon he triple mail the blow of a gisarm half stun he a goring pike-thrust drive he reel back yet ringed in by death he thrust and smite with fail arm axe and pike sword and gisarm hedge he in nearer and nearer he sword grow suddenly heavy and beyond he strength to wield but stumble slip dazed and with eye a-swim he raise the great blade aloft and lift drooping head cry aloud the battle-cry of he house -- high and clear it ring above the din : arise arise i will arise and even in that moment come one in answer to the cry one that leap to he right hand a wild man and hairy who ply a gleaming axe and ` twixt each stroke seem from hairy throat to echo back the cry : arise arise and now upon he left be black roger fierce-eye behind he buckler thereafter a voice hail they as from far away a sweet deep voice cheery and familiar as one hear aforetime in a dream and betwixt every sentence come the twang of swift-drawn bow-string o tall brother fall back o gentle paladin o fair flower of lusty fighter fall back and leave the rest to we comrade to I and my good bow here so dazed and breathless come beltane on stumbling foot and lean he gasp in the shadow of a great tree whereby stand gile o ' the bow with arrow plant upright in the sod before he the which he snatch and loose so fast 'twas a wonder to behold of a sudden he utter a shout and setting by he bow draw sword and leap from the shadow be go but as for beltane he lean a while against the tree as one who be very faint yet soon lift heavy head wonder at the hush of all thing and look toward the clearing see it empty and himself alone therefore turn he thitherwards now as he go he stumble and he foot strike a something soft and yield that roll before he in the shadow out -- out into the full brilliance of the moon and look down he behold a mangled head that stare up at he wide-eyed and with mouth agape then beltane let fall he reek sword and stagger out into the light see he bright mail befoul with clot blood and of a sudden

some day and yet ` tis cold and hard methink for one so young and tender so say he sigh and turn bring they to a hut near by a humble dwelling of mud and wattle dim-lighted by a glimmering rush but be come within the hut beltane stay of a sudden and hold he breath stare wide-eyed at that which lay so still : then bare he head sink upon he knee she lay outstretch upon a bed of fern and look as one that sleep save for the deathly pallor of she cheek and still and pulseless bosom : and she be young and of a wondrous gentle beauty behold say the friar but one short hour agone this be alive -- a

pertolepe wreak vengeance dire upon they then say beltane then must i have word with sir pertolepe now when he say this black roger stare agape and even the archer 's tongue fail he for once but walkyn smile and grip he axe art mad tall brother cry gile at length sir pertolepe would hang thee out of hand or throw thee to he dog lord say roger sir pertolepe have ten score man-at-arms in

roger so will i come and watch thee die -- hangman and loose a shaft or two on mine own account but now of a sudden walkyn raise a warn hand hark say he : and in a while as they listen upon the stillness come a rustle of leaf and thereafter a creep step draw slowly nearer : then swift and soft-treading walkyn steal out into the shadow very soon he return lead a woman pale and haggard who clasp a babe within she threadbare cloak she eye be red and sore with much weep and upon the threshold she pause as one in sudden fear but espy the friar she utter a cry : o father martin -- good father -- pray pray for the soul of he who be father to my child but who at dawn must die with many other upon my lord duke 's great gallows alas cry the friar wring he hand what news be this o good

sudden she scream and point at black roger with she finger : ` tis roger she cry ` tis black roger that slew my father then roger the black groan and hide he face within he arm and shrink before the woman 's outstretched finger and groan cower to he knee whereupon the archer turn he back and spat upon the floor while walkyn glare and finger he great axe : but in this moment my beltane come beside he and lay he hand on roger 's stoop shoulder nay say he this be my friend henceforth a man among man who liveth to do great thing as thus : to-night he will give back to thee the father of thy child

never again shall a man hang from the great gallows of black ivo the usurper -- from this night it shall cease to be now would the woman have kneel and kiss he hand but beltane smile and bring she to the door then wonder and amaze she make she obeisance to beltane and with she babe clasp to she bosom go forth into the night thereafter beltane turn and look grave-eyed upon the three my master quoth he ye have hear my word how this night i go to take down black ivo 's great gallows come ye with I aye or no aye lord cry the three in one acclaim do ye then stand with I henceforth ` gainst black ivo and all he might aye or no aye lord cry they again then beltane smile and draw he sword and come to they the great blade gleam in he hand ` tis well say he but first come now and lay you hand here

high or low be thine henceforth to-day be ivo duke and i thy companion-in-arm no more no less -- this i pray you all remember so say beltane sheathe he sword and behold friar martin on he knee beside that muffle figure he kneel also and the three with he thereafter at a sign from the friar beltane stoop and raise this slender shroud figure in he arm and reverently bear it out into the shadow and there all in the tender radiance of the moon they bury she whose name they never know and stand a while in silence then point to the new-turned earth friar martin speak soft-voiced : lo here -- in but a little time wild flower shall bloom above she -- yet none purer or sweeter than she in a little shall the grass be green again and she sleep here forget by all -- save god and god my brother be a gentle god and very pitiful -- so now do we leave she in god 's abide care and presently they turn soft-footed and go upon they way leave the place to solitude but from the vault of heaven the star look down upon that lonely grave like the watch eye of holy angel chapter xii which tell how duke ivo 's great gallows cease to be scarce a mile without the wall of the fair city of belsaye my lord duke have build he a great gallows have set it high upon a hill for all the world to see from whose lofty cross-beam five score rogue have hang ere now have writhe and kick they life away and rot there in company that all the world might know how potent be the anger of my lord duke ivo day in day out from rosy morn till dewy eve it frown upon belsaye a thing of doom whose grim sight should warn rebellious townsfolk to dutiful submission by night it loom a dim-seen brooding horror whose loathsome reek should mind they how all rogue must end that dare lift hand or voice against my lord duke or those proud baron lord and knight who by he pleasure hold they fief with rights of justice the high the middle and the low day in day out the man of belsaye eye it askance ` neath scowl brow and by night many a clenched hand be shake and many a whisper malediction speed toward that thing of doom that menace they from the dark to-night the moon be full and thus follow friar martin 's bony outstretched finger beltane of a sudden espy afar the duke 's great gallows rise grisly and stark against the moon 's round splendor so for a space standing yet within the shade of the wood beltane stare fierce-eyed the while gile with roger at he elbow point out diver shape that dangle high in air at sight of which the friar kneel with bow head and lip that move in prayer : and walkyn scowling mutter in he beard messire say the archer my lord duke 's gallows be great and very strong and we but five all tell i have mine axe quoth walkyn have we fifty axis we scarce should bring it down ere dawn : moreover the night be very still and sound carry far -- nathless quoth roger to-night we surely shall destroy it -- my lord have say so aye -- but how question gile in belsaye be that pale fox sir guus of allerdale with many trusty man-at-arms to hold the town for black ivo and teach belsaye its duty : how may we destroy my lord duke 's gallows ` neath the very beard of my lord duke 's garrison wilt tell I that my good black rogerkin aye nod roger that will i -- when i have ask my lord so say he come and touch beltane and humbly put the question then with he gaze yet upon the gallows beltane sigh and answer : there have be no rain for week look you : the underbrush be dry methink and should burn well aye for sure say roger we shall burn black ivo 's gallows to ash bowman and a good end ` twill be by fire cry the archer aghast but lord so soon as they shall see the flame sir guus and he man will sally out upon we nay say beltane for we shall sally in into belsaye mean you lord certe answer beltane how else may we break open the dungeon the night be young yet but we have much to do -- follow so say beltane turn and keep ever within the shadow of the tree set off towards that distant hill where stand the gallows black against the moon swiftly they go and for the most part in silence for beltane 's mind be busy upon many matter so betime they climb the hill and stand at last beneath the gallows and glance up beltane behold noisome shape black and shrivel that once have live and laugh forthwith he draw he sword and fall to cut down the brush whereat friar martin gird up he frock take walkyn 's sword and fall to likewise now as beltane labor thus he be suddenly aware of a wild and ragged figure the which start up before he as if from the very ground a

oho ` caw ' they shall cry ` caw -- give we to eat -- fair white flesh ' yet how may they eat when the gallows be no more thus speak he with shrill laughter while beltane labor until the sweat run from he while walkyn 's great axe flash and fall near by and steel glitter among the underbrush that clothe the slope of the hill very soon they have stack great pile of kindle about the gallows ' weather-beaten timber -- twig below faggot above -- cunningly order and higher than beltane 's head now as beltane lean upon he sword to wipe the sweat from he eye come roger and walkyn yet pant from they labor master say roger they should burn well i trow and yet -- and yet quoth walkyn these beam be thick : methink when the other go one man should stay to tend the fire until the flame get fair

with the stalwart friar behind he so while the five stand hushed and wide of eye the old man kneel before they in he rag and strike flint to steel once he strike and twice -- and behold a spark that leap to a small flame that die to a glow but now flat upon he belly lay gile and purse he lip puff and blow until the glow brighten spread and burst into a crackling flame that leap from twig to twig and when the fire wax hot beltane take thence a glowing brand and come to the other great pile fire it therewith up rise the flame high and higher until they begin to lick pale-tongued about the gibbet 's two great support timber and ever as they rise walkyn and roger gile and the friar labor amain stack log near by wherewith to feed the fire enough say beltane at last it shall suffice

the old man fall to dancing and caper amid the spark and roll smoke fill the air with wild talk and gabble high-pitched laughter that rise above the roar of the fire and so in a while beltane sigh turn and lead the way down the hill towards the glooming shadow of the wood but ever as they go the flame wax fiercer behind they and the madman 's laughter shrill upon the air swift-footed they plunge into the underbrush and thus hide begin to close in upon belsaye town and of a sudden they hear a cry and thereafter the shatter blare of a trumpet upon the wall and now from within the wake city rise a confused sound a hum that grow louder and ever more loud pierce by shout and trumpet-blast while high above this grow clamor the tocsin peal alarm thus in a while the tremble citizen of belsaye start from they slumber stare in pallid amaze behold afar a great and fiery gibbet whose flame leap heavenward seem to quench the moon chapter xiii how they brake ope the dungeon of belsaye be yet in the shade of the wood beltane pause hearken to the distant uproar of belsaye town and watch the torch that hover upon its wall and the cresset that glow on tower and bartizan messire beltane

and must forever jesu pity and lean against a tree near by the stalwart friar shiver violently and hide he eye why good brother martin say beltane set a arm about he doth memory pain thee so indeed good brother martin be comfort -- nay nay -- ` tis past but -- o my son i -- have a sister say the good friar and groan yet in a while he raise he head and spake again : and when duke ivo have work he

memory sir guus and he butcher slumber in a false security for stern man be they and strong and wait but god 's appoint time pray god that time be soon aman say beltane now even as he speak come the sound of a distant tucket the great gate of belsaye swing wide and forth ride a company of man-at-arms they bascinet agleam ` neath the moon now speak the friar and you be for belsaye my brother follow I i know a way -- albeit a moist way and something evil -- but a you will follow -- come so say friar martin set off among the tree and beltane beckon to the other follow close fast stride the friar he white robe flutter on before through moonlight and shadow until they reach a brook or freshet that run bubble betwixt flowery bank beside this stride the tall friar follow its wind course until before they amid the shadow -- yet darker than the shadow -- loom high a embattled flanking tower of the wall of belsaye town but ever before they flit the friar 's white gown on and on until the freshet become a slow-moving river bar they advance -- a broad river that whisper among the reed on the one side and lap against rugged wall on the other here the friar stay to glance from gloomy wall and turret to fast wane moon on they left then gird up he gown he step down into the reed and a moment later they see he -- to they amaze -- ford the river that flow scarce knee deep so needfully beltane follow and step into the water find he foot upon a narrow causeway cunningly devise thus slowly and carefully because of the flow of the water they come betime to where the friar wait in the shadow of the massy wall yet even as they come near the friar wave he arm stoop -- and be go whereon my beltane stare amaze and the three mutter uneasily behind he but come nearer beltane espy above the hurry water the curve of a arch or tunnel and point it to the other take a great breath and stoop beneath the water stumble on and on until it shallow and he be free to breathe again on he go through water now breast-high with slimy wall above he and around see naught by reason of the pitchy blackness and hearing only the smother splash of those behind and gasp breath that boom hollow in the dark yet presently he see a gleam before he that broaden with each step and of a sudden be out beneath the sky -- a narrow strip wherein star twinkle and so beheld again friar martin 's white frock flit on ghost-like before in a while he bring they to a slimy stair and climb this with ever grow caution they find themselves at last beneath the frown shadow of the citadel within the wall of belsaye town now look north beltane beheld afar a fiery gallows that flame to heaven and from the town thitherward come a confused hum of the multitude who watch but hereabouts the town seem all desert the dungeon lie beneath we foot whisper friar martin come so keep ever in the shadow of the great square keep they go on soft-treading and alert of eye till be come to the angle of the wall the friar stay of a sudden and raise a warn hand then come beltane with walkyn close behind and peer over the friar 's broad shoulder they behold a sentinel who stand with he back to they lean on he spear to watch the burning gallow he chain-mail agleam and he head-piece glittering as he stir lazily in time to the merry lilt he sing softly then or ever beltane could stay he walkyn o ' the dene lay by he axe and he soaked shoe soundless upon the stone begin to steal upon the unconscious singer who yet loll upon he spear some thirty pace away with great body bow forward and hairy finger crooked walkyn steal upon he six pace he go ten -- twenty -- twenty-five -- the soldier cease he humming stand erect and turn about and walkyn leap -- bear he backward down into the shadow -- a shadow wherein they body writhe and twist silently awhile when walkyn rise out of the shadow and beckon they on so follow ever the friar 's lead they come to a narrow doorway that give upon a small guard-room light by a smoking torch socket to the wall the place be empty save for a medley of arm stack in corner wherefore tread cautiously the friar lead they a-down a narrow passage and so to a second and larger chamber where burn a fire of log upon the wall hang shine head-piece cloak and mantle lay where they have be fling on bench and floor but none be there to give they let or hindrance then friar martin take a torch that smoke near by and cross to the hearth reach down a massy key from the wall and with this in he hand come to a door half hide in a corner beyond which be step that wind downward into the dark a darkness close and dank and heavy with corruption but on go the friar -- he torch light the way -- down and ever down until they tread a narrow way ` twixt reek wall where breathe a air so close and foul the very torch languish at length the friar stop before a mighty door thick-banded with iron bar and with massy bolt and while beltane hold the torch he fit key to lock and thereafter the great door swing on scream hinge and show a dungeon beyond -- a place foul and noisome where diver pale-faced wretch lay or crouch blinking in the torch 's glare what cry one come to he foot a squat broad-shouldered man -- be this the dawn so soon well we be ready better to hang i ' the clean air than rot in a dungeon say i so we be ready eh my brother but now some groan and weep and other laugh while yet other get they to they knee bow of head and silent then go in the friar to they and lay he hand upon the squat man 's shoulder and speak he gently and be it osric say he day be not yet my son nor with the day shalt thou die nor any here a ye be silent all and follow where we lead soft-footed so will we bring you to god 's good world again rise then each one speak nothing but follow so then do these man snatch of a sudden from the horror of death to the hope of new life follow on stumbling foot out from the noisome gloom of the dungeon out from the clammy air breathing of death up the narrow wind stair and with each step come strength and manhood thus as they stride forth of the frown keep each man bear sword or gisarm so with breath in cheek but heart high-beat they come one and all to where the slimy stair lead down into the gloom yet here friar martin pause sigh to look behind whence rise the distant hum of those throng townsfolk who yet crowd wall and street and market square to watch the gallows burn now sweet christ shield ye good people of belsaye he sigh what mean ye my brother question beltane alas my son groan the friar i need must think upon the coming day and of the vengeance of sir guus for this we work he vengeance friar there will be torture and death busy hereabouts tomorrow my son for the prisoner be go so will sir guus vent he anger on the

shadow black and long and in these shadow beltane creep and so betime come within the outer guard-room and to the room beyond and here behold a low-arched doorway whence step lead upward -- a narrow stair gloomy and wind whose velvet blackness be stab here and there by moonlight flooding through some deep-set arrow-slit up he go and up pause once with breath in check fancy he hear the stealthy sound of one who climb behind he in the black void below thus stay he a moment with eye that strive to pierce the gloom and with naked dagger clench to smite yet hear nought save the faint whisper of he own mail and the soft tap of he long scabbard against the wall wherefore he presently speed on again climb swiftly up the narrow stair thus in a while he behold a door above : a small door yet stout and strong a door that stand ajar whence come a beam of yellow light so with sure and steady hand beltane set wide the door that creak faintly in the stillness and behold a small square chamber where be a narrow window and in this window a mail-clad man loll he unhelmed head thrust far without to watch the glow that leap against the northern sky then beltane sheathe he dagger and in three long stride be close behind and stoop above the man seek and find he hairy throat and swing he mighty-armed that he head strike the wall then beltane sigh lay he upon the floor and turn toward a certain arras-hung arch : but or ever he hand come upon this curtain from beyond a voice hail -- a voice soft and musical hugo -- o hugo spawn of hell hither to I then beltane lift the curtain open the door and stride into the chamber beyond closed and bar the door behind he and so stand tall and menacing look on one who sit at a table busy with pen and ink-horn a slender man this and richly habit : a sleepy-eyed man pale of cheek with long down-curving nose and mouth thin-lipped and masterful who presently lift he head stare up in amaze sleepy-eyed no longer : for now behold beltane the mighty sheathed in mail from head to foot the pen drop from he finger and he long pale hand slowly clench themselves so for a space they front each other speak not while eye meet eye unswerving -- the menacing blue and the challenging black and through the open casement near by come a ruddy glow that flicker on arras-hung wall and rugged roof-beam now raise he hand beltane point toward this glowing window sir guus quoth he lord seneschal of belsaye town thou hast good eye -- look now and tell I what ye see i see say sir guus stir not i see a presumptuous knave -- a dog who shall be fling

friend quoth he as ye say so let it be and may god 's hand be over we this day now as he speak with eye uplift to heaven he espy a faint blue mist far away above the soft-stirring tree top -- a distant haze that rise lazily into the balmy air thicken ever as he watch ah he exclaim fierce-eyed of a sudden and point with rigid finger whence cometh that smoke think ye why quoth roger frown wendonmere village lieth yonder nay ` tis nearer than wendonmere say walkyn shoulder he axe see the smoke thicken cry beltane now god forgive I the while i tarry here red pertolepe be busy meseemeth so say he catch up he sword and incontinent set off at speed toward where the soft blue haze steal upon the air of morning grow denser and ever denser fast and furious beltane speed on crash through

ever close behind would i have eat less panted gile would we leg be longer growl walkyn would my belt bear fewer notch quoth roger and so they run together sure-footed and swift and ever as they run the smoke grow denser and ever beltane 's prayer more fervent now in a while they hear a sound faint and confused : a hum that presently grow to a murmur -- to a drone -- to a low wail of voice pierce of a sudden by a shrill cry no man 's lip could utter that swell high upon the air and die lose amid the grow clamor they have fire the rick first pant roger ` tis ever pertolepe 's way they be torture the woman hiss walkyn ` tis ever so red pertolepe 's pleasure and i have but twelve arrow leave I groan gile but beltane run in silence look neither right nor left until above the hum of voice he hear one upraised in passionate supplication follow by another -- a loud voice and jovial -- and thereafter a burst of roar laughter soon beltane behold a stream that flow athwart they way and beyond the stream a line of willow thick grow upon the marge and again beyond these clustering willow the straggle village lay then beltane motion the other to caution ford the stream and come in the shade of the osier draw on he hood of mail and so unsheathing he long sword peer through the leaf and this be what he see : a wide road flank by row of scatter cottage rude of wall and thatch a dusty road that lead away east and west into the cool depths of the forest and a cringe huddle of wretched village folk whose pallid face be all set one way where some score of man-at-arms loll in they saddle watch a tall young maid who struggle fiercely in the grasp of two lusty fellow she garment rent she white flesh agleam in the sunlight a comely maid supple and strong who ever as she strive ` gainst the clutch hand that hold she keep she blaze eye turn upon one in knightly mail who sit upon a great war-horse hard by watch she big chin in big mail fist and with wide lip up-curl in a smile : a strong man this heavy and broad of chest he casque hang at he saddle-bow and he mail-coif throw back upon he wide shoulder show he thick red hair that fall a-down frame he square-set rugged face ha cuthbert quoth he turn to one who ride at he elbow -- a slender youth who stare with evil eye and suck upon he finger aha by the fiend ` tis a sweet armful sir squire aye my lord pertolepe ` ti rarely shaped and delicately flesh answer the esquire and so fall to suck he finger again what silly wench will ye defy I still cry sir pertolepe jovial of voice must ye to the whip in sooth ho ralph -- otho strip I this stubborn jade -- so -- ha verily cuthbert hast shrewd eye ` tis a dainty rogue come say he smile down into the girl 's wide fierce eye save that fair body o ' thine from the lash now and speak I where be thy father and brother that i may do justice on they along with these other dog for the foul murder of my forester yest be ` en they end shall be swift look ye and as for thyself -- shalt find those to comfort thee anon -- speak wench but now come a woman pale and wear who throw herself on tremble knee at sir pertolepe 's stirrup and bow thus before he in the dust raise a passionate outcry supplicate he mercy with bitter tear and clasped hand lift heavenwards o good my lord pertolepe she wail 'twa not my husband nor son nor any man of we village work this thing innocent be we my lord -- o witch quoth he who bid thee speak so say he draw mail-clad foot from stirrup and kick she back into the dust ho whip he call lay on and thereafter will we hang these vermin to they own roof-tree and fire they hovel for a warning but now even as the struggle maid be drag forward -- even as pertolepe smile settle chin on fist to watch the lithe play of she writhe limb the willow behind he sway and part to a sudden panther-like leap and a mail-clad arm be about sir pertolepe -- a mighty arm that bear he from the saddle and hurl he headlong and thereafter sir pertolepe half stunned and stare up from the dust behold a great blade whose point prick he naked throat and beyond this blade a mail-clad face pallid fierce grim-lipped from whose blaze eye death glare down at he dog pant beltane ha cuthbert roar red pertolepe writhe ` neath beltane 's grind heel to I cuthbert -- to I but as the esquire wheel upon beltane with sword uplift out from the green a arrow whistle and cuthbert shrill-screaming sway in he saddle and thud to earth while he great war-horse rear affrighted plunge among the man-at-arms and all be shout and confusion while from amid the willow arrow whiz and fly ` neath whose cruel barb horse snort stumble and kick or crash into the dust and ever the confusion grow but now sir pertolepe wriggle beneath beltane 's iron foot have unsheathe he dagger yet ere he could stab down upon he red pate crash the heavy pommel of beltane 's sword and sir pertolepe sink backward lay out-stretched in the dust very silent and very still then beltane sheathe he sword and stoop catch sir pertolepe by the belt and drag he into the shade of the willow and be come to the stream throw he captive down thereby and fall to splash he bruised face with the cool water and now above the shout and the trampling of hoof upon the road come the clash of steel on steel and the harsh roar of walkyn and black roger as they ply axe and sword -- arise ha arise then as beltane glance up the leaf near by be dash aside and gile come bound through he gay feather shear away he escalloped cape wrench and tear he broadsword a-swing in he hand ho tall brother -- a sweet affray he pant the fool give back already : they cry that pertolepe be slay and the wood full of outlaw they be fall back from the village -- have i but a few shaft in my quiver now -- but here behold the face of beltane 's captive gile let fall he sword stare round-eyed holy st gile he gasp ` tis the red pertolepe and so stand agape what time a trumpet bray a fitful blast from the road and be answer afar thereafter come roger stoop as he run and shout : archer archer -- run lord but beltane stir not only he dash the water in sir pertolepe 's twitch face wherefore come roger and catch he by the arm plead : master o master he pant the forest be a-throng with lance and there be archer also -- let we make the wood ere we be beset but beltane see the captive stir shake off black roger 's grasp but now one laugh and walkyn tower above he white tooth agleam who stare down at sir pertolepe whirl up he bloody axe to smite fool cry beltane and throw up he hand to stay the blow and in that moment sir pertolepe ope he eye ` tis pertolepe pant walkyn ` tis he that slew wife and child : so now will i slay he since we in this hour must die not so quoth beltane stand back -- obey I -- back i say so muttering walkyn lower he axe while beltane draw he dagger stoop above sir pertolepe and spake swift and low in he ear and with dagger at he throat and in a while beltane rise and sir pertolepe also and side by side they step forth of the leave out into the road where on the outskirts of the village pikeman and man-at-arms archer and knight be halt in a surge throng while above the jostle confusion rise the hoarse babel of they voice but of a sudden the clamor die to silence and thereafter from a hundred throat a shout go up : a pertolepe ` tis sir pertolepe now in this moment beltane lay he dagger-hand about sir pertolepe 's broad shoulder and set the point of he dagger ` neath sir pertolepe 's right ear speak quoth beltane softly and he dagger-point bit deeper speak now as i command thee a while sir pertolepe bit savagely at he knuckle-bone then lift he head spake that all might hear : ho sir he cry i be fain to bide awhile and hold talk with one beltane who styleth himself -- duke of pentavalon hie ye back therefore one and all and wait I in garthlaxton yet a i come not by sunset ride forth and seek I within the forest go hereupon from the disorder rank a sound arise a hoarse murmur that voice they stark amaze and for a while all eye stare upon those two grim figure that yet stand so close and brotherly but sir pertolepe quell they with a gesture : go he command so they disarray fall into rank and order and wheeling about they march away along the forest road with helm agleam and pennon a-dance the while sir pertolepe stare after they wild of eye and with mail hand clench once he make as if to call they back : but beltane 's hand be heavy on he shoulder and the dagger prick he throat and thus stand they side by side until the tramp of foot be die away until the last tremble villager have slink from sight and the broad road be desert all save for cuthbert the esquire and diver horse that lay stiffly in the dust silent and very still then beltane sigh and sheathe he dagger and sir pertolepe face he scrowl fierce-eyed and arrogant ha outlaw quoth he give back my sword and i will cope with thee -- wolf 's head though thou art -- aye and any two other rogue beside nay answer beltane i fight with such as thee but when i need must what -- roger he call go fetch hither a rope dog -- would ye murder I not so sigh beltane shake he head have i not promise to leave thee alive within the greenwood yet i would see thee walk in bond first ha dare ye bind I then he that toucheth I toucheth duke ivo -- dare ye so do rogue aye messire nod beltane i dare so bring hither the rope roger but when roger be come nigh sir pertolepe turn and stare upon he what cry he jovial of voice yet deadly-eyed be it my runaway hangman in very sooth do i not pay thee enough thou black-avised knave do i not love thee for thy skill with the noose thou traitorous rogue now mark I roger : one day will i feed thee to my hound and watch they tear thee as they have certain other rogue -- aha -- you mind they belike pale of cheek and with tremble hand roger bind the arm of he that have be he over-lord while walkyn and gile silent and wide-eyed watch it do whither would ye take I quoth red pertolepe arrogant that shalt thou know anon messire how a i defy thee then must we carry thee messire answer beltane yet thine own leg be better methink -- come let we begone thus presently have ford the brook they strike into the forest first go walkyn axe on shoulder tooth agleam next stride sir pertolepe head high ` twixt pale-faced roger and silent beltane while the bowman follow after call upon st gile beneath he breath and cross himself : and ever and anon walkyn would turn to look upon they scowling captive with eye that glare ` neath shaggy brow now after they have go some while sir pertolepe brake silence and spake my beltane proud and fierce fellow quoth he if ` tis for ransom ye hold I summon hither thy rogue ' company and i will covenant for my release i seek no ransom of thee messire answer beltane and for my company -- ` tis here here i see but three sorry knave yet with these same three do i o'ercome thy forester sir pertolepe rogue thou liest -- ` tis thing impossible moreover with these three do i last night burn down black ivo 's mighty gallows that stand without belsaye town and thereafter set wide the dungeon of belsaye and deliver thence certain woeful prisoner and send they abroad with word that i -- beltane son of beltane the strong duke of pentavalon be come at last bear the sword of my father that be wont to strike deep for liberty and justice : nor have life will i lay it by until oppression be no more now indeed do sir pertolepe stare upon my beltane in amaze and speak no word for wonder then of a sudden he laugh scornful and loud ho thou burner of gibbet quoth he take heed lest thy windy boast bring thy lordly neck within a noose art lusty of arm yet lustier of tongue -- and as to thy father whoe'er he be -- messire beltane 's voice be soft yet meet the calm serenity of he gaze sir pertolepe check the jeer upon he lip and stare upon beltane as one new-waked beheld in turn he high and noble look the costly excellence of he armor he great sword and belt of silver -- and stride on thereafter with never a word yet view beltane aslance ` neath brow close-knit in dark perplexity so at last they come into a little clearing deep-hid among the denser green beltane pause here and lift mail hand point to a certain tree but hereupon sir pertolepe stare round about he and down upon he galling bond speak : sir knight say he who thou art i know not yet if indeed thou art of gentle blood then know that i be sir pertolepe baron of trenda seneschal of garthlaxton lord warden of the march : moreover friend and brother-in-arm be i to duke ivo -- nay say beltane all this i know for much of thee have i hear messire : of thy dark doings of the agony of man the shame of woman and how that there be many desolate hearth and nameless grave of thy make lord pertolepe thou wert indeed of a high estate and strong and these but lowly folk and weak -- yet mercy on they have ye none i have this day hear thee doom the innocent to death and bitter shame and lord as god seeth we it be enough sir pertolepe 's ruddy cheek show pale but he blue eye stare upon beltane wide and fearless have ye then drag I hither to die messire lord pertolepe all man must die aye e ` en great lord such as thou when they have sin sufficiently : and thy sin methink do reach high heaven so have i bring thee hither into the wilderness that god 's will may be work upon thee how -- wilt forswear thyself cry sir pertolepe writhe in he bond quoth beltane : come roger -- walkyn -- bring I he to the tree yonder ha rogue -- rogue pant sir pertolepe would ` st leave I to die in a noose unshriven and unannealed my soul drag hell-ward weight with my sin now even as he speak swift and sudden he leap aside and would have flee but walkyn 's fierce finger drag at he throat and roger 's iron arm be close about he desperately he fight and struggle but mighty though he be he captor be mighty also moreover he bond gall he wherefore fight yet they drag he to the tree and to the tree beltane fast bind he while the forest ring and echo with he panting cry until he great voice crack and break and he hang ` gainst the tree spend and breathless then speak beltane grim-lipped yet soft of voice : lord pertolepe fain would i hang thee as thou hast hang many a man ere now -- but this methink be a better way : for here unless some wanderer chance to find thee must thou perish a so god will it thus do we leave thee in the hand of god to grant thee life or death : and may he have mercy on thy guilty soul thus say beltane sombre of brow and pale of cheek and so beckon to the other turn away despite sir pertolepe 's passionate threat and prayer and plunge into the dense underbrush stride swift-footed from the place with the captive 's wild cry ringing in he ear haphazard go beltane yet strain he ear to catch those mournful sound that grow faint and fainter with distance till they be lose in the rustle of the leaf but of a sudden he stay he go and stand with he head aslant hearken to a sound that seem to have reach he from the solitude behind and presently it come again a cry from afar -- a scream

leafy stirring rise the mournful lilting of a pipe clear and very sweet that draw nearer and louder until it be of a sudden drown in a cry hoarse and woeful then beltane hasting back soft-treading stand to peer through the leaf and presently he cock 's - comb flaunt he silver bell a-jingle there step a mountebank into the clearing -- that same jester with whom beltane have talk aforetime beda

the grass and turn away beltane leave he lie there with beda the jester kneel above he chapter xvi of the rueful knight of the burning heart southward march beltane hour after hour tireless of stride until the sun begin to decline on and on thoughtful of brow and speak not at all wherefore the three be gloomy and silent also -- even gile have no mind to break in upon he solemn meditation but at last come roger and touch he on the shoulder master say he the day groweth to a close and we famish why then -- eat say beltane now while they set about build a fire beltane go aside and wander slow and thoughtful presently come to a broad glade or ride and stretch himself out ` neath a tree lay there stare up at the leafy canopy ponder upon sir pertolepe he sin and the marvellous way of god lie thus he be aware of the slow plod hoof-stroke of a horse drawing near of the twang of a lute with a voice sweet and melodious intone a chant and the tune be plaintive and the word likewise be these : -- alack and woe that love be so akin to pain that to my heart the bitter smart return again alack and woe glance up therefore beltane presently espy a knight who bestride a great and goodly war-horse a youthful knight and debonair slender and shapely in he bright mail and surcoat of flame-coloured samite he broad shield hang behind he shoulder balance by a long lance whose gay banderol flutter wanton to the soft-breathing air above he mail-coif he wear a small bright-polished bascinet while at he high-peaked saddle-bow he ponderous war-helm swing together with broad-bladed battle-axe now as he pace along in this right gallant estate he rove glance by hap light on beltane whereupon check he powerful horse he pluck daintily at the string of he lute delicate-fingered and brake into song anew : -- ah woe be I that i should be a lonely wight that in mankind no joy i find by day or night ah woe be I thereafter he sigh amain and smite he bosom and smile upon beltane sad-eyed spake : most excellent tall and sweet young sir i who love 's lorn pilgrim be do give thee woeful greet and entreat now the courtesy of thy pity and wherefore pity sir quoth beltane sit up for reason of a lady 's

flame-like here beneath behold my motto ` ardeo ' which signifieth ' i burn ' other device have i lay by for the nonce what time my pilgrimage shall be accompt but beltane look not so much upon the shield as on the face of he that bear it and behold its high and fearless look the clear bright eye and humorous mouth -lrb- albeit school to melancholy -rrb- he smile and get he to he foot now well meet sir knight of the burning heart quoth he what would ye here alone within these solitude sigh messire i sing and sigh and sigh and sing ` tis a something empty life methink not so messire sigh the rueful knight for when i chance to meet a gentle youth young and well beseen -- as thou bedight in goodly mail -- as thou with knightly sword on thigh why then messire ` tis ever my wont to declare unto he that she i honor be fairer nobler and altogether more worthy and virtuous than any other she soever and to maintain that same against he on horse or afoot with lance battle-axe or sword thus see you messire even a love-lorn lover have betime he compensation and the sward be soft underfoot and level say which the knight cock a delicate eyebrow in question fashion and lay a slender finger

they gleaming steel and so the long blade ring together and thereafter the air be full of a clash din in so much that roger come run sword in hand with walkyn and gile at he heel but see how matter stand they sit they down on the sward watch round-eyed and eager and now sir jocelyn -lrb- happy-eyed -rrb- he doleful heart forget do show himself a doughty knight skip lightly to and fro despite he heavy armor and lay on right lustily while the three a-sprawl upon the grass shout gleefully at each shrewd stroke or skilful parry but once sir jocelyn 's blade clash upon beltane 's mail thigh and straightway they fall silent and once he point touch the link on beltane 's wide breast and straightway they brow grow anxious and gloomy -- yet none so gloomy as roger but now on a sudden be the flash and ring of hard smitten steel and behold sir jocelyn 's sword spring from he grasp and thud to earth a good three yard away whereupon the three roar amain -- yet none so loud as roger now by

see long file of man-at-arms ride along very orderly with archer and pike-men little by little amid all these hostile form he seem to recognize a certain pair of leg that go on just before : sturdy leg that yet falter now and then in they stride and look higher he see a broad belt whose edge be notch and saw-like and a wide mail-clad back that yet bent weakly forward with every shambling step

lose in a sharp curve here the array be halt and abode very still and silent with helm and lance-point wink in the last red ray of sunset o brother whisper gile ne'er saw i place sweeter or more apt for ambushment here shall be bloody doings anon and we -- helpless as babe o I the pity o not but now with blow and gibe the four archer drag they unto a tall tree that stand beside the way a tree of mighty girth whose far-flung branch cast a deep gloom within this gloom lay my beltane stir not and speak no word be faint and sick with he hurt but gile the archer sit beside he vent by turn bitter curse upon sir pertolepe and humble prayer to he patron saint so fluent and so fast that prayer and curse become strangely blent and mingled on this wise : may red pertolepe be thrice damned with a candle to the bless saint gile that be my comfort and intercessor may he bone rot within he with my gold chain to sweet saint gile may he tongue wither at the root -- ah good saint gile save I from the fire may he be curse in life and may the flesh shrivel on he bone and he soul be eternally damned with another candle and fifty gold piece to the altar of holy saint gile -- but now hear roger

horse climb the ascent with the sound of cheery voice upraise in song and ever the sink sun glint redly on helm and lance-point where sit sir pertolepe 's mail rider grim and silent while the cheery voice swell near and more near till all at once the song die to a hum of amaze that rise to a warning shout that be drown in the blare of a pierce trumpet blast whereat down sweep glitter lance-point forward lean shine bascinet and the first rank of sir pertolepe 's rider striking spur thunder upon they down the hill come thereafter the shock of meeting rank with shout and cry that grow to a muffle roar up rise the dust a eddy cloud wherein steel flicker and dim form strove horse to horse and man to man while sir pertolepe sit he great white charger nurse he big chin and smile wait he chance presently from the eddy cloud stagger the broken remnant of sir gille ' van-ward whereon laugh fierce and loud sir pertolepe rise in he stirrup with beltane 's long sword lift high he trumpet bray the charge and down the hill thunder sir pertolepe and all he array and the road near by be desert save for the prisoner and the four archer who stand together they face set down-hill where the dust rise denser and denser and the roar of the conflict fierce and loud but now above the din and tumult of the fight below shrill and high rise the note of a horn wind from the wood in the east that be answer -- like a echo out of the wood in the west and down the bank to right and left behold sir pertolepe 's archer come leap and tumble pursue by a hissing arrow shower whereat up spring gile despite he bond shout amain : o walkyn o ' the long leg -- a rescue to we arise i will arise now while he shout thus come one of the four archer and gile be smite to he knee but as the archer whirl up

riderless horse burst and thunder past and after they -- a staggering rout mount and afoot spur and trample each other ` neath the merciless arrow-shower that smite they from the bank above horse and foot they thunder by until at last amid a ring of cower men-at-arms sir pertolepe gallop he white horse bespatter with blood and foam he battered helm a-swing upon its thong grim-lipped and pale he

broad axe and wrench hard at he bridle round stagger the white horse down come the heavy axe and the great horse death-smitten rear up and up back and back and crash over be lose ` neath the dust of swift-trampling hoof now presently beltane be aware that he bond cramp he no longer find roger 's arm about he and at he parched lip roger 's steel head-piece brim with cool sweet water and gulp thirstily soon feel the numbness lift from he brain and the mist from he eye in so much that he sit up and gaze about beheld himself alone with roger quoth he look down at he swollen wrist : do we go

and go they way while the dead youth lay with wide eye that seem to out-stare the pallid moon now as they go on very silently together of a sudden black roger catch beltane by the arm and point into the gloom where far before they small light wink redly through the murk yon should be sir gille ' watch-fire he whisper aye nod beltane so i think master -- what would ye now pray roger -- i pray god sir gille ' man be few and that they be sound sleeper howbeit we will go right warily none the less so say beltane turn aside from the road and lead on through underbrush and thicket through a gloom of leaf where a boisterous wind riot where great branch dim see sway groan in every fierce gust and all be pipe stir and tumult twig whip they viciously thorn drag at they while the wind go by they moan in the dark but ever and anon as they stumble forward guide themselves by instinct the moon send forth a pale beam from the whirling cloud-wrack -- a phantom light that steal upon they sudden and ghost-like and like a ghost be go again what time black roger follow hard on beltane 's heel cross himself and mutter fragment of forget prayer thus at last they come to the river that flow before they vague in the half-light whose sullen water gurgle evilly among the willow that droop upon the marge master say roger wipe sweat from he face there be evil hereabouts -- i have have a warning -- a

thus black roger spring and catch beltane 's arm grip it fast for on the air bear upon the wind yet louder than the wind a shrill sound ring and echo the which pass seem to have stricken the night to silence then beltane brake from roger 's clasp and run on beside the river until beyond the sullen water the watch-fire flare before he in whose red light the mill loom up rugged and grim its massy wall scar and crack its great wheel fall to ruin now above the wheel be a gap in the masonry a opening roughly square that have be a window mayhap whence shine a warm mellow light master pant roger a god 's name -- what be it a woman scream quoth beltane stare upon the light window as he speak a man laugh sleepily beside the nearest watch-fire scarce a bow-shot away look ` ee master whisper roger we may not cross by the ford because of the watch-fire -- ` tis a fair light to shoot by and the river be very deep hereabouts yet must we swim it roger lord the water be in flood and we armor heavy then must we leave we armor behind quoth beltane and throw back he hood of mail he begin to unbuckle he broad belt but of a sudden stay to point with outstretched finger then look whither he point roger see a tree whose hole lean far out across the stream so that one far-flung branch well nigh scrape the broken roof of the mill yon lieth we way roger -- come say he be come to that side of the tree afar from the watch-fire beltane swing himself lightly and begin to climb but hear a groan pause roger he whisper what ail thee roger alas groan roger ` tis my wound irketh I o master i can not follow thee this way nay let I aid thee whisper beltane reach down to he but despite beltane 's strong hand desperately though he try black roger fall back groan master he plead o master adventure not

pertolepe and guus of allerdale will have raise the country against we go now do even as i command and may god keep thee my faithful roger then beltane begin to climb but be come where the great branch fork look down to see roger 's upturned face pale amid the gloom below the holy angel have thee in they keep lord and master he sigh and so turn with head a-droop and be go and now beltane begin to clamber out across the swirl of dark water while the tough bough swing and sway beneath he in every gust of wind wherefore he go be difficult and slow and he take heed only to he hand and foot but all at once he hear a bitter broken cry and glance up it chance that from he lofty perch he could look within the light window and thus behold a nun whose slender black-robed body writhe and twist in the clasp of two leathern-clad arm vicious arm that bent she back and back across the rough table until into beltane 's vision come the leathern-clad form of he that hold she : a black-haired shapely man whose glowing eye and eager mouth stoop ever nearer above the nun 's white loveliness and thus it be that my beltane first look upon sir gille of brandonmere he have lay sword and armor by but as the nun yet struggle in he arm she white hand come upon and draw the dagger at he girdle yet ere she could strike sir gille have see and leap back out of reach then beltane clamber on at speed and with every yard they voice grow more loud -- hers proud and disdainful he low and soft pierce now and then by a evil lazy laugh now ever as beltane go the branch sway more dizzily bend more and more beneath he weight and ever as he draw nearer between the wind-gust come snatch of they talk be thou nun or duchess or stroll light-o ' - love art woman -- by venus fair and pass fair -- captive art thou -- aye mine i tell thee -- yield thee -- hast struggle long enough to save thy modesty -- yield thee now else will i throw thee to my lusty rogue without -- make they sport -- o -- beast -- i fear thee not for thy man -- how shall they harm I see i shall be dead down sway the branch low and lower until beltane 's mail foot a-swing in mid air find something beneath -- slip away -- find it again and thereupon loose the branch down he come upon the ruin mill-wheel then stand upon the wheel he grope finger find diver crack in the worn masonry -- moreover the ivy be thick so cling with finger and toe up he go higher and higher until he steel-mittened hand grip the sill : thus slowly and cautiously he draw himself up until he golden head rise above the sill and he could peer into the room sir gille half stand half sit upon the table while the nun face he cold and proud and disdainful the gleaming dagger clutch to she quick-heaving bosom and sir gille assure and confident laugh softly as he lean so lazily yet ever he watch that gleam steel wait he chance to spring now as they stand front each other thus the nun stir beneath he close regard turn she head and on the instant beltane know that she have see he know by the sudden tremor of she lip the widening of she dark eye wherein he seem to read wonder joy and a passionate entreaty then even as he thrill to meet that look down sweep languorous lid and curl lash and sigh she lay the dagger on the table for a moment sir gille stare in blank amaze then laugh he lazy laugh ah proud beauty ` tis surrender then say he and speak reach for the dagger but even as he do so the nun seize the heavy table and thrust with sudden strength so that sir gille take unaware stagger back and back -- to the window then beltane reach up into the room and from behind catch sir gille by the throat and grip he with iron finger strangle all outcry and so draw himself over the sill and into the room drag sir gille to the floor and choke he there until he eye roll upward and he lay like one dead then swiftly beltane take off the belt of sir gille and buckle it tight about the wrist and arm of sir gille and rend strip from sir gille ' mantle that lay near therewith fast gag and bind he now it chance that as he kneel thus he espy the dagger where it lay and take it up glance from it to sir gille lie motionless in he bond but as he hesitate there come a sudden knock on the door and a voice spake without : my lord my lord -- ` tis i -- ` tis lupo my lord we man be few and wearied as ye know must i set a guard beyond the ford think you or will the four watch-fire suffice now glance up scarce breathing beltane behold the nun who crouch down against the wall she stare eye turn towards the door she cheek ashen she lip a-quiver with deadly fear yet even so she speak but that 'twa she indeed who utter the word he scarce could credit so soft and sweetly slumberous be she voice : my lord be a-weary and sleepeth hush you and come again with the dawn now be a moment 's breathless silence and thereafter a evil chuckle and so chuckle the man lupo go down the rickety stair without and when he step be die away beltane draw a deep breath and together they arise and so speak no word they look upon each other across the prostrate body of sir gille of brandonmere chapter xix concern the eye of a nun eye long thick-lashed and darkly blue that look up awhile into he and anon be hide ` neath languorous-drooping lid a nose tenderly aquiline lip red and full that part but to meet again in sweet and luscious

upon she rounded bosom with eye abase and scarlet lip apart as one who wait -- expectant now hereupon my beltane feel himself vaguely at loss and finding he yet hold the dagger set it upon the table and spake low-voiced reverend mother -- he begin and stop -- for at the word she dark lash lift and she stare upon he curiously while slowly she red lip quiver to a smile and surely surely this nun so sweet and saintly in veil hood and wimple be yet a very woman young and pass fair and the eye of she -- how deep and tender and yet how passionate now behold she eye memory stir within he and he sigh whereat she sigh also and meekly bow she head speak he with all humility sweet son speak on -- thy reverend mother heareth now do beltane my innocent rub he innocent chin and stand mumchance awhile

thing to have save a nun -- even though she be neither old nor wrinkled nor toothless and behold the nun 's meek head be high and proud she humility forget quite then she frown and ` neath she sombre drapery she foot fall a-tapping a small foot dainty and slender in its gaily broidered shoe so much at variance with she dolorous habit but beltane reck nought of this for espy a narrow window in the opposite wall he come thither and thrust he head without look down upon the sleep camp and thus he see that sir gille ' man be few indeed scarce three-score all tell he count as they lay huddle about the smoulder watch-fire deep-slumbering as only man greatly weary might even the sentinel nod at they post and all be still save for the rush of a sudden wind-gust or the snort and trampling of the horse and lean thus beltane marked well where the sentinel loll upon they pike or march drowsily to and fro betwixt the watch-fire and long he gaze where the horse be tethered two sway trample line dim-seen amid the further shadow now be busy measure with he eye the distance ` twixt sentinel and sentinel and note where the shadow lay darkest he be suddenly aware of the nun close beside he of the feel of she soft and warm against he and start at the contact turn to find she hand small and white upon he mail arm sweet son say she soft-voice from the shadow of she sombre hood thy reverend mother now would chide thee for that have but short while to live thou dost stand thus mumchance stare upon vacancy -- for with the dawn we die quoth beltane deeply conscious of the slender hand : to die nay -- nay -- thou ` rt too young and fair to die -- sigh she with rueful smile : thou too art neither old nor cold nor bent with year fair son come then till death let we speak together and comfort each other lay by thy melancholy as i now lay by this hood and wimple for the night be hot and close methink nay lady indeed ` tis cool for there be much wind abroad say beltane my innocent moreover while stand here methink i have see a way whereby we may win free -- now hereupon she turn and look on he quick-breathing and with eye brim-full of fear messire she pant o messire bethink thee for death be i prepare -- to live each moment fully till the dawn then when they come to drag I down to -- to shame then should thy dagger free I quite -- such death i would smile to meet but ah should we strive to flee and thou in the attempt be slay -- and i alive -- the sport of that vile rabblement below -- o christ -- not that and cower she hide she face noble lady say beltane look on she gentle-eyed indeed i too have think on that and come to the table he take thence the dagger of sir gille and would have put it in she hand but lo she shrink away not that messire not that she sigh thy dagger let it be since true knight art thou and honorable i pray you give I thine it be thy reverend mother ask and smile pale and wan she reach out a white imperious hand so beltane draw he dagger and give it to she keep then have set the other in he girdle he cross to the door and stand awhile to hearken lady say he there be no way for we but this stair and meseemeth ` tis a dangerous way yet must we tread it together reach I now thy hand and set it here in my girdle and whatsoe'er befall loose not thy hold so say beltane draw he sword and set wide the door look to thy foot he whisper and tread soft then with she trail habit catch up in she left hand and with she right upon he belt the nun follow beltane out upon the narrow stair step by step they steal downward into the dark pause with breath in check each time the timber creak and hearken with strain ear down they go amid the gloom until they spy a open door below beyond which a dim light shone and whence rise the snore of wearied sleeper ever and anon a wind-gust smote the ancient mill and a broken shutter rattle near by what time they creep a pace down the creaking stair until at last they stand upon the threshold of a square chamber upon whose broken hearth a wane fire burn by whose uncertain light they espy diver vague form that stir now and then and groan in they sleep as they sprawl upon the floor : and beltane count three who lay ` twixt he and the open doorway for door be there none awhile stand beltane view the sleeper ` neath frown brow then sheathe he sword he turn and reach out he arm to the nun in the darkness and in the dark she give herself warm and yield into he embrace she arm cling soft about he and he feel she breath upon he cheek as clasp he left arm about she he lift she high against he breast and now even as she tremble against he so tremble beltane also yet know not why therefore of a sudden he turn and step into the chamber a man start up beside the hearth mutter evilly and beltane standing rigid grip he dagger to smite but even then the mutter cease and fall back the man roll over and fall a-snoring again so lightly swiftly beltane stride over the sprawl sleeper -- out through the open doorway -- out into the sweet cool night beyond -- out into the merry riot of the wind swift and sure of foot he speed go ever where the shadow lay deepest skirt beyond reach of the pale watch-fire until he be come nigh where the horse stamp and snort here he set the nun upon she foot and bid she stir not creep towards the horse quick-eyed and watchful and thus he presently espy a man who lean he upon a long pike he face set toward the nearest watch-fire : and the man 's eye be close and he snore gently then beltane shift he dagger to he left hand and be come within reach draw back he mail fist and smite the sleeper betwixt he closed eye and catch he as he fall lay he gently on the grass now swift and silent come beltane to where the horse champ and have make choice of a certain powerful beast slip off he chain mitten and roll back sleeve of mail and low-stooping in the shadow seek and find the rope whereto the halter be make fast and straightway cut they in sunder then have look to girth and bridle he vault to the saddle and draw sword shout he battle-cry fierce and loud : arise arise and so shout smite the frighted horse to right and leave with the flat of the long blade so that they rear up whinnying and set off a-galloping in all direction fill the air with the thunder of they rush hoof and now come shout and cry with a prodigious confusion and run to and fro about the die watch-fire trumpet blare shrill hoarse voice roar command that pass unheeded in the grow din and tumult that swell to a wild clamor of frenzied shouting : fly fly pertolepe be upon we ` tis the red pertolepe but beltane ride warily amid the gloom come to that place where he have leave the nun yet find she not and immediately be seize of a great dread but as he stare wildly about he he presently hear a muffle cry and spur thitherward behold two dim figure that sway to and fro in a fierce grapple ride close beltane see the glint of mail raise he sword for the blow feel a shock -- a searing smart and know himself wound but now she be at he stirrup and stoop he swing she up to the withers of he horse and wheeling short about spur to a gallop yet as he ride above the rush of wind and thud of hoof he hear a cry hoarse and dolorous on galloped beltane all unheed until he come ` neath the leafy arch of the friendly wood within whose gloom need must he ride at a hand 's pace thus as they go they could hear the uproar behind -- a confused din that wax and wane upon the wind but beltane ride slow and cautious within the green heed this not at all nor the throb of he wounded arm nor aught under heaven save the pressure of this slender body that lay so still so warm and soft within he arm and as he go he begin to wish for the moon that he might see she face blue eye long and heavy-lashed surely blue eye be fairest in a woman and then the voice of she liquid and soft like the call of merle or mavi and she be a nun how white and slim she hand yet strong and resolute as when she grasp the dagger ` gainst sir gille aye -- resolute hand like the spirit within she soft and shapely body and then again -- she lip red and full up-curving to sweet slow smile yet withal

well bethought o rare fool so shall it be forthwith sir pertolepe summon certain of he guard and incontinent beltane be drag a-down the wind stair and thereafter fast shut within a place of gloom a narrow cell breathe a air close and heavy and void of all light therefore beltane sit he down on the floor he back to the wall stare upon the dark chin on fist long he sit thus stir not and in he heart a black void deeper and more awful than the fetid gloom of any dungeon -- a void wherein a new beltane come into be now presently as he sit thus upon the silence steal a sound low and murmurous that rise and fall yet never quite die away and beltane know what sound this be clench he hand and bow he face upon he knee as he listen this drone grow to a sudden squealing cry that ring and echo from wall to wall while beltane crouch in that place of horror feel the sweat start out upon he yet shiver as with deadly cold and ever the cry thrill within the dark or sink to whimper moan and stifle supplication and ever beltane hearken to these fall sound stare blindly into the gloom and ever the new beltane grow the stronger within he hour after hour he crouch thus so very silent so very quiet so very still but long after the groan and wailing have die to silence beltane stare grim-eyed into the gloom and gnaw upon he finger of a sudden he espy a glowing spark in the angle of the wall to the right -- very small yet very bright now as he watch behold the spark change to a line of golden light so that he eye ache and he be fain to shade they in he shackled arm and thus he behold a flagstone that seem to lift itself with infinite caution and thereafter a voice breathe he name messire -- messire beltane and now through the hole in the floor behold a hand bear a lanthorn -- a arm -- a shoulder -- a shroud head thus slowly a tall cloaked figure rise up through the floor and set down the lanthorn lean toward beltane put back the hood of he mantle and beltane behold beda the jester art awake messire beltane aye quoth beltane lift he head and i have use mine ear the wheel and the pulley be rare begetter of groan as thou do ` st foretell fool 'twa a good thought to drag I

jester cut asunder the chain that bind the fetter and beltane arise and stretch himself and the manacle gleam on each wide-sundered wrist quoth he : what now whereat the jester sit cross-legged upon the floor look up at he and speak on this wise : two day agone as i walk I in the green dream such foolish dream as a fool may there come very suddenly a sorry wight -- a wild man very ragged -- who

dream here within this boskage how i might perchance win this same beltane to life without thy scurvy aid black roger moreover methink i know a way -- and thou spare I life to do it ' ` aye forsooth ' say roger put away he dagger ` thou wert ever a fool of thy word beda -- so now do i spare thy life and spare it i save it and thus do i cut another accursed notch from my belt ' ` why then ' say i `

messire so say beda rise and take the lanthorn begin to descend through the floor have first show how the flagstone must be lower in place thereafter beltane follow the jester down a narrow stair build in the thickness of the wall and along a passage that end abruptly nor could beltane see any sign of door in the solid masonry that bar they way here beda pause finger on lip and extinguish the lanthorn then in the dark a hinge creak faintly a quiver hand seize beltane 's manacle wrist draw he on and through a narrow opening that yawn suddenly before they thereafter the hinge creak again and they stand side by side within a small chamber where be a doorway hang across with heavy curtain beyond which a light burn now even as beltane look thitherward he hear the rattle of dice and a sleepy voice that curse drowsily and shake off the clutch desperate finger that strive to stay he he come soft-treading and peer through the curtain thus he behold two man that face each other across a table whereon be wine with dice and store of money and as they play these man yawn lean heavily upon the table back sweep the curtain and stride into the room beltane stare upon these man who yet lean upon the table stare back at he open-mouthed but behold the look in he blue eye and the smile that curl he mouth they stumble to they foot and seek to draw weapon -- then beltane spring and catch they each about the neck and swing they wide-armed smite they head together and together these man sink in he grasp and lay in a twisted huddle across the table among the spill wine a coin ring upon the stone floor roll into a distant corner and come to rest the jester gasp in the shadow of the curtain and so come silence break only by the soft drip drip of the spill wine o mercy of god whisper the jester hoarsely at last what need be there for this -- they would have sleep -- aye smile beltane but not so soundly as now methink come let we go silently the jester go on before by narrow passage-way that writhe and twist in the thickness of the wall up sudden flight of step until at length they come out upon a parapet whose grim battlements scowl high in air but as they hast on flit soft-footed ` neath pallid moon the jester of a sudden stop and turn drag beltane into the shadow for upon the silence come the sound of mail foot pacing near now once again beltane brake from the jester 's clutch finger and stride forward come face to face with one that bare a pike on mail shoulder and who behold beltane halt to peer at he with head out-thrust quoth he : ha stand stand i say and speak I who thou art then beltane laugh softly say he : o fool not to know -- i be death and with the word he leap come a cry muffle in a mighty hand a grapple fierce yet silent and beda cowering back behold beltane swing a writhe body high in air and hurl it far out over the battlements thereafter above the soft rustle of the night-wind a sound far below -- a faint splash and beda the jester shiver in the soft-stirring night wind shrink deeper into the gloom and make a swift motion as though for all he folly he have cross himself then come beltane the smile still twist he mouth quoth he : forsooth my strength be come back again be there any more that i may deal withal good fool lord whisper the shiver jester methink i smell the dawn -- come so beltane follow he from the battlements down wind stair through hall that whisper in the dark down more stair down and ever down ` twixt wall slimy to the touch through a gloom heavy with mildew and decay on speed the jester stay not to light the lanthorn nor once touch nor once turn with help hand to guide beltane stumble after in the dark then at last deep in the clammy earth they reach a door a small door whose rust iron be hand with mighty clamp of rust iron here the jester pause to fit key to lock to strain and pant awhile ere bolt shriek and turn and the door yawn open then stoop he strike flint and steel and in a while have light the lanthorn and look upon beltane with eye that stare in the pallor of he face he point toward the yawning tunnel messire say he yonder lieth thy way to life and the world as thou do ` st give I life so do i give thee thine thou wert as i remember thee a very gentle tender youth -- to-night be three dead without reason -- reason good fool say beltane thou do ` st see I bear in a prisoner to

be swallow in the dark chapter xxvii how beltane take to the wild-wood a faint glimmer grow ever brighter a jagged patch of pale sky a cleft in the rock o'er-grown with bush and creep vine this beltane see ere he step out into the cool sweet air of dawn a while he stand to stare up at the sky where yet a few star show pale to the day and to drink in mighty breath of the fragrant air and thus plain to he ear steal the ripple of run water hard by and go thitherward he strip and naked come down to the stream where be a misty pool and plunge he therein now as he bath he thus gasp somewhat because of the cold yet glory in the rush and tingle of he blood behold the leaf part near by and uprising in he naked might beltane behold the face of one that watch he intently master cry a voice harsh but very joyful o dear my lord and roger spring down the bank and heedless of the water plunge in to catch beltane 's hand and kiss they master he cry and thus it be these two meet again and presently have don clothes and harness beltane sit down he beside the brook head upon hand stare at the swift-running water while roger sit near watch he in a silent ecstasy whence come ye roger from

roger and so -- fare thee well now as he speak beltane turn on he heel and stride along beside the brook but even as he go so go roger whereon beltane turn frown quoth he : roger -- thrasfordham lieth behind thee aye master but death lieth before thee why then death will i face alone roger nay master -- not while roger live thy man be i -- ha -- wilt withstand I black roger thy man be i to follow thee in life and go down with thee in death -- now hereupon beltane come close and in the dim light black roger behold the new beltane glare down at he fierce-eyed and with great mail fist clench to smite but even so black roger give not back only he draw dagger and strove to set it in beltane 's iron finger take this quoth he for a ye would be free of roger first must ye slay he master so beltane take the dagger and fumble with it awhile then give it back to roger 's hand roger mutter he he hand upon he brow my faithful roger so man can be faithful -- say which he sigh -- a long hissing breath and hide he face within he mittened hand and turn stride swiftly upon he way now in a while they be come into the forest roger touch he on the arm master say he whither do ye go nay it mattereth not so long as i can lie hide a while for i must sleep roger then can i bring thee to a place where none shall ever find thee -- come master so say roger turn aside into the denser wood burst a way through a tangle of brush plunging ever deeper into the wild until they come to a place where great rock and boulder jut up amid the green and the tree grow scant day be break and before they in the pale light rise a steep cliff whose jagged outline clothe here and there with brush and vine loom up before they bar they advance but at the foot of this cliff grow a tree gnarl and stunt the which as beltane watch black roger begin to climb until be some ten foot from the ground he reach out and seize a thick vine that grow upon the rock step from the tree and vanish into the face of the cliff but in a moment the leaf be part and roger look forth beckon beltane to follow so have climb the tree beltane in turn seize hold upon the vine and stumble amid the leaf find himself on he knee within a small cave where roger 's hand meet he thereafter roger lead he to the end of the cavern where be a wind passage very rough and narrow that bring they to a second and larger cave as beltane judge for in the dark he hand could feel nought but space here roger halted and whistle three time a melodious call that wake many a slumbering echo and in a while behold a glow that grow ever brighter until of a sudden a man appear bear a flaming pine-torch that show a wide cave whose rugged roof and wall glisten here and there and whose rocky floor end abruptly in a yawning gulf from whose black depths come soft murmur and rippling of water far below now halt on the opposite side of this chasm the man lift he flaming torch and lo it be walkyn who behold beltane in he mail utter a hoarse shout of welcome and stoop thrust a plank across the gulf so beltane cross the plank and give he hand to walkyn 's iron grip and thereafter follow he along wind low-roofed passage-way hollow within the rock until they come to a cavern where a fire blaze whose red light dance upon batter bascinet and polished blade that hang against the wall while in one corner upon a bed of fern gile o ' the bow lay snore right blissfully to he go roger to shake he into groan wakefulness and to point with eager finger to beltane whereat up spring gile and come run with hand outstretch in welcome yet of a sudden pause and stand stare upon beltane as do the other also for the place be very bright and moreover beltane 's mail-coif be fall back so they look on he all three yet speak no word therefore beltane sit he down beside the fire and rest he head upon he hand as one that be weary sit thus he tell they briefly what have chance but of the duchess he say nothing and in a while lift he head he see they watch he all three and all three incontinent glance otherwhere quoth beltane : wherefore do ye stare upon I why as to that good brother say the archer ` tis but that -- that we do think thee something -- change of aspect change say beltane and laugh short and bitter aye ` tis like i be lord quoth walkyn clench mighty fist have they torment thee -- be it the torture lord aye nod beltane 'twa the torture so now good comrade here will i sleep awhile but first -- go forth with the sun and question all ye may of ivo and he doings -- where he doth lie and where he force muster -- hear all ye can and bring I word for methink we shall be busy again anon then throw himself upon the bed of fern that roger have re-made beltane presently fall asleep and while he sleep come the three very silent and tread very soft to look down upon he sleep face and the manacle that gleam upon he wrist and behold even as he sleep he groan and writhe he tender lip grow fierce a relentless down-curving line -- he jaw grim set and between he frown brow a lock of silky hair that gleam snow-white among the yellow the torture growled roger and so soft as they come the three turn and leave he to he slumber but oft he moan and once he speak a word sudden and fierce ` twixt clenched tooth and the word be : helen chapter xxviii of the place of refuge within the green it be toward evening that beltane awake and sit up look about he he be in a chamber roughly square a hollow within the rock part natural and part hew by hand a commodious chamber light by a jagged hole in the rock above a fissure all o'er-grown with vine and creep plant whose luxuriant foliage temper the sun 's ray to a tender green twilight very grateful and pleasant now pendant from the opening be a ladder of cord and upon this ladder just beneath the cleft beltane behold a pair of lusty well-shaped leg in boot of untanned leather lace up with leathern thong as for they owner he be hide quite by reason of the leafy screen as he lean forth of the fissure look upon these leg beltane know they by they very attitude for the leg of one who watch intently but while he look they stir shift and grow lax become the leg of one who lounge then slow and lazily they begin to descend lower and lower until the brown comely face of gile brabblecombe o ' the hill smile down upon beltane with a gleam of white tooth cry he : hail noble brother and likewise the good god bless thee hast sleep well it lacketh scarce a hour to sundown and therefore should ` st eat well how say ye now to a toothsome haunch o ' cold venison in faith cunningly cook and sufficiently salted and seasoned -- ha and mark I with a mouthful of malmsey ripely rare oho rich wine that i filch from a fatuous friar jig-jogging within the green forsooth tall brother ` tis a wondrous place the greenwood wherein a man shall come by all he doth need -- a he seek far enough thus a my purse be empty you beefy burgher shall by dint of gentle coax haste to fill I it with good broad piece but a my emptiness be of the belly then sweet saint gile send I some ambulate abbot or pensive-pacing prior for you churchman do ever ride with saddle-bag well line as i do know have be breed a monk and therefore with a rare lust to creature comfort now while he speak thus the archer be busily set forth the viand upon a rough table that stand hard by what time beltane look about he ` tis a wondrous hiding-place this gile quoth he aye verily brother -- a sweet place for hunt man such as we here be cave and cavern enow to hide a army and rocky passage-way narrow and wind i ' the dark where we four might hold all black ivo 's power at bay from now till gabriel 's trump -- a we have food enow quoth beltane : ` tis a fair thought that and i have hear there be many outlaw in the wood hereabouts yea forsooth and each and every a clapper-claw a rogue in faith o very lewd bloody-minded knave see ye now that would have slay I three day agone but for my comrade walkyn scurvy dog fit for the halter they be in faith ha quoth beltane thoughtful of brow they be wild man meseemeth desperate knave one and all and look ye they would have slay -- aye nod beltane all the off-scouring of town and village -- and look ye they would -- aye say beltane thief rogue and murderer brand felon runaway serf and villein -- ` tis well say beltane so shall they be my comrade henceforth thy comrade stammer the archer stare in amaze -- thy comrade these base knave that would have hang I -- I that be free-born like my father before I -- so peradventure gile will we make they free man also howbeit this day i seek they out -- seek they -- ` tis death death let it be ` tis none so fearful they will slay thee out of hand -- a wild rabblement lawless and disorder so would i bring order among they gile and thou shalt aid I i -- aid thee how -- would ` st have I company with such vile carrion not i forsooth i be a soldier free-born and no serf like walkyn or villein like roger but sure you do but jest brother so will i laugh with thee -- but now very suddenly beltane reach out he long arm and seize gile in mighty hand drag he to he knee and gile stare up in amaze look into the face of the new beltane whose blue eye glare ` neath frowning brow and whose lip curl back from gleam tooth gile say he softly rock the archer in he grasp o gile brabblecombe o ' the hill do i not save thy roguish life for thee do not walkyn and roger preserve it to thee so doth thy life belong to walkyn and to roger and to I four man be we together four brother in arm vow to each other in the fulfilment of a purpose -- be it not so yea verily lord good man and true be we all but see you not lord these outlaw be lewd fellow -- base-born -- see you not gile these outlaw be man even as we who like we can laugh and weep can bleed and die -- who can use they life to purpose good or evil even as we therefore since they be man i will make of they we comrade also a it may be thus say beltane loose gile and turn to the table fall to eat again while the archer sit upon the floor nursing he bruised arm and stare open-mouthed quoth beltane at last : we will seek out and talk with these outlaw to-night gile talk with a pack of -- yea forsooth nod gile rub he arm i be mind to strike such a blow as shall hearten sir benedict for the siege and shake

save themselves and walkyn know that walkyn methink be great among they once and where be walkyn so soon as ye sleep lord he and roger go forth accord to thy word as for I i stay here to watch from the spy-hole yonder you may command the road a-wind in the valley and unseen see you may see but come a thy hunger be allay reach I thy hand that i may file off those iron bracelet nay let be gile i will wear they henceforth until my vow be accomplish hereupon beltane arise and climb the ladder look forth through a screen of leaf and underbrush and see that from the fissure the ground slope steeply down a boulder-strewn hill thick with gorse and bramble at whose base the road lead away north and south until it be lose in the green of the forest now as beltane stand thus gaze down at the wind road whose white dust be already mellow to evening he behold one who run wondrous fleetly despite the ragged cloak that flap about he long leg and whose rough-shod foot spurn the dust beneath they so fast 'twa a marvel to behold moreover as he run he bound hither and thither and with every bind a arrow speed by he from where some distance behind run diver forester bedight in a green livery beltane think he recognize but even as beltane grasp the branch that screen he mind to swing himself up to the fellow 's aid the fugitive turn aside from the road and come leap up the slope but of a sudden utter a loud cry and throw up he hand fall face down upon the ling and so lay what time come up one of the pursuer that have outstrip he fellow but as he pause he sword shorten for the thrust up spring the fugitive a great axe flash and whirl and fall nor need be there for further stroke then while the rest of the pursuer be yet a great way off walkyn come leap up the hill back from the ladder beltane leap and down through the fissure come walkyn to fall cat-like upon he foot to shake free the ladder after he and thereafter to sit panting upon a stool he bloody axe betwixt he knee

fill the dark with stealthy rustling master quoth roger shiver and glance about he here be hangstone waste and yonder the swamp of hundleby fen -- you can smell they from here and ` tis a evil place this for ` tis say the soul of murder folk do meet here betime and hold high revel when the moon be full here on wild night witch and warlock ride shriek upon the wind with goblin damned -- ha say ye so good roger quoth the archer now the sweet saint gile go with we -- aman and he cross himself devoutly so go they in silence awhile until they be come where the sedge grow thick and high above whisper ooze and where tree stunt and misshapen lift knotted arm in the gloom lord spake walkyn he voice low and awe-struck here be the marsh a place of death for they that know it not where a a man tread awry be a quake slime to suck he under full many a man lieth ` neath the reed yonder for there be but one path very narrow and wind -- follow close then and step where i shall step aye master whisper roger and look ye touch no tree as ye go ` tis say they do grow from the bone of perished man so touch they not lest some foul goblin blast thee so go they follow a narrow track that wind betwixt slow-stirring sedge past tree huddle and distort that seem to writhe and shiver in the clammy air until beyond the swamp they come to a place of rock where ragged crag loom high and vague before they now all at once walkyn raise a warn hand as from the shadow of those rock a hoarse voice challenge : stand cry the voice who go what and be it thou rogue perkyn cry walkyn art blind not to know I aye growl the voice but blind or no i see other with thee good friend all quoth walkyn stand forth that i may see these friend o ' thine drawing near beltane behold a man in filthy rag who hold

and what of eric spake a third voice -- a soft voice and liquid and a man step forth of the rock with two other man at he heel now well meet eric o ' the noose quoth walkyn i bring promise of more booty and mark this eric -- i bring also he that you wot of now hereupon the man eric draw near a broad-set man clothe in skin and rusty mail who look upon beltane with head strangely askew and touch a furtive hand to he battered head-piece ye come at a evil hour say he speak low-voiced tostig holdeth high feast and revel for to-day we take a rich booty at the ford beyond bassingthorp -- merchant out of winisfarne with pack-horse well laden -- and there be woman also -- in especial one very fair she tostig bear hither but a while since when he bid they bring she to he behold she have stab herself with she bodkin so be she dead and tostig rage thus i say ye come in a evil hour not so answer beltane methink we come in good hour i be fain to speak with tostig -- come and he step forward but eric catch he by the arm : messire say he soft-voiced yonder be over five score lusty fellow fierce and doughty fighter all that live but to do the will of tostig and do proclaim he chief since he have prove himself full oft mightiest of all -- ah nod beltane a strong man beyond equal a fierce man that knoweth not mercy swift to anger and joyful to slay at all time -- why look you sigh beltane neither be i a lamb come fain be i to speak with this tostig a while stand eric head aslant peer at beltane then at a muttered word from walkyn he shake he head and beckon the man perkyn aside lead the way through a cleft in the rock and up a precipitous path beyond and as he go beltane see he loosen sword in scabbard ever as they clomb the path grow more difficult until at last they be come to a parapet or outwork with mantelet of osier beyond cunningly work above which a pike-head glimmer and from beyond which a voice challenge they but at a word from eric the sentinel stand aside and behold a narrow opening in the parapet through which they pass and so up another path defend by yet another parapet of osier now of a sudden have climb the ascent beltane pause and stand lean upon he axe for from where he now stand he look down into a great hollow green and rock-begirt whose steep side be shaded by tree and dense-growing bush in the midst of this hollow a fire burn whose blaze show many wild figure that sprawl round about in garment of leather and garment of skin its ruddy light show face fierce and hairy it glint on rusty mail and flash back from many a dinted head-piece and broad spear-head and upon the air be the sound of noisy talk and boisterous laughter through the midst of this great green hollow a stream wound that broaden out in one place into a still and sleepy pool upon whose placid surface star seem to float a deep pool whereby be a tall tree now beneath this tree far remove from the fire sit a great swarthy fellow chin on fist scowl down at that which lay at he foot and of a sudden he spurn this still and silent shape with savage foot oswin he cry walcher throw I this useless carrion into the pool hereupon come two sturdy rogue who lift the dead betwixt they bear she to the edge of the silent pool once they swing and twice and lo the float star shiver to a sullen splash and subside rippled softly to the reedy bank slowly the swarthy giant rise and stand upon he leg and beltane know he for the tallest man he have ever see oswin quoth he and beckon with he finger oswin do i not bid thee keep watch upon yon dainty light o ' love now meet the speaker 's baleful eye the man oswin spring back strive to draw sword but even so a iron hand be about he throat he be lift by a mighty arm that hold he a while choke and kick above the silent pool until he have gasp and kick he life out ` midst shout and gibe and hoarse laughter thereafter again the sullen water quiver be still and tostig stand empty-handed frown down at those float star then beltane leap down into the hollow and stride swift-footed nor stay until he stand face to face with tostig beside the sullen pool but swift as he have come roger have follow and now stand to he back hand on sword aha quoth tostig in stare amaze and stand a while eye beltane with hungry gaze by thor say he but ` tis a good armor and should fit I well off with it -- off i be tostig so say he draw a slow pace nearer he tooth agleam he great hand open and shut whereat out leap roger 's blade but now the outlaw come run to throng about they shout and jostle one another and brandish they weapon yet striking no blow wait gleefully for what might befall and ever beltane look upon tostig and tostig assure and confident smile grimly upon beltane until the ragged throng about they watch eager-eyed grow hushed and still then beltane spake : put up thy sword roger say he in very truth this tostig be a foul thing and should not die by thy good steel -- so put up thy sword roger and now no man spake or move but all stand rigid and scarce breathing wait for the end for tostig smile no more stand agape as one that doubt he sens then laugh he loud and long and turn as if to reach he sword that lean against the tree and in that instant spring straight for beltane 's throat he gripe hand outstretch but swift as he beltane let fall he axe slip aside and smite with mail fist and as tostig reel from the blow close with and catch he in a deadly wrestling hold for all man might see beltane have lock one arm ` neath tostig 's bearded chin and that tostig 's shaggy head be bend slowly backwards then the outlaw surge closer a dark menacing ring where steel flicker but lo to roger 's right hand spring walkyn grip he axe and upon he left come gile he long-bow poise a shaft upon the string so stand the three alert and watchful eager for fight what time the struggle wax ever more fierce and deadly to and fro the wrestler sway lock in vicious grapple grimly silent save for the dull trampling of they foot upon the moss and the gasp and hiss of pant breath writhe and twist stumbling and slip or suddenly still with foot that grip the sod with bulge muscle swell and rigid that crack beneath the strain while eye glare death to eye but beltane 's iron finger be fast lock and little by little slow but sure tostig 's swart head be tilt up and back further and further until he fork beard point upward -- until of a sudden there brake from he writhen lip a cry loud and shrill that sink to groan and end in a sound -- a faint sound soft and sudden but now behold tostig 's head sway loosely backwards behind he shoulder he knee sag he great arm loose they hold : then or he could fall beltane stoop beneath and put forth all he strength raise he high above he head and panting groan with the strain turn and hurl dead tostig down into the pool whose sullen water leap to a mighty splash and presently subside whisper softly in the reed and for a while no man stir or speak only beltane stand upon the marge and pant then turn he to the outlaw and catch up he axe therewith point downward to that stilly pool whose placid water seem to hold nought but a glory of float star behold he pant here be a evil man -- a menace to well-being wherefore be he dead but as for ye come tell I -- how long will ye be slave hereupon rise a hoarse murmur that grow and grow -- then stand the man perkyn forward and scowl pointed at beltane with he spear comrade he cry he have slay tostig he have murder we leader -- come now let we slay he and speak he leap at beltane with level spear but quick as he leap so leap walkyn he long arm rise and fall and thereafter set he foot upon perkyn 's body he shake he bloody axe in the scowling face of the outlaw back fool he cry have ye no eye see ye not ` tis he of whom i spake -- he that burn belsaye gallows and brake ope the dungeon of belsaye -- that be friend to all distressed folk and broken man know ye not beltane the duke hear he ye fool hear he hereupon the outlaw stare upon beltane and upon each other and fumble with they weapon as man that know not they own mind while beltane wipe sweat from he lean upon he axe and pant with

and slew tostig the mighty with naked hand behold beltane the duke be he not worthy to be we leader -- shall we not follow he then come a roar of voice : aye -- let we follow -- let we follow on then cry walkyn he glittering axe aloft to garthlaxton then from a hundred brawny throat a roar go up to heaven a cry that hiss through clench tooth and ring from eager lip wilder fiercer than before and the cry be : -- garthlaxton chapter xxx how they smite garthlaxton it be in the cold still hour ` twixt night and dawn that beltane halt he wild company upon the edge of the forest where run a water-brook gurgle softly in the dark here do he set diver eager fellow to fall a tree and thereafter to lop away branch and twig and so bid they wait steal forward alone soon before he rise garthlaxton frowning blacker than the night a gloom of tower and turret of massy wall and battlement its mighty keep rise stark and grim against a faint light of star now as he stand to scan with purposeful eye donjon and bartizan merlon and arrow-slit for gleam of light for glint of mail or pike-head he grow aware of a sound hard by yet very faint and sweet that come and go -- a small and silvery chime he could by no means account for so creep he near and nearer quick-eyed and with ear on the stretch till he be stay by the broad sluggish water of the moat and thus he presently espy something that move in the gloom high above the great gateway something that stir pendulous in the cold-breathing air of come dawn now as he peer upward through the gloom come the wind colder stronger than before -- a chill and ghostly wind that flap the heavy fold of he mantle that sigh forlornly in the wood afar and softly smite the misty jingle thing above -- sway it -- swing it out from the denser shadow of scowling battlement so that beltane could see at last and see -- start back faint and sick he flesh a-creep he breath in check ` twixt pale and rigid lip and behold what manner of thing this be he fall upon he knee with head bow low yet speak no prayer only he hand grip fiercely upon he axe while to and fro in the dark above that awful shape turn and swing -- its flaunt cock 's - comb dreadfully awry its motley stain and rent -- a wretched thing twist and tear a thing of blast horror and ever as it swing upon the air it ring a chime upon its little silver bell a merry chime and mocking that seem to gibe at come day now in a while look upon that awful dim-seen shape beltane speak low-voiced o beda he whisper o manly heart hide ` neath a fool 's disguise o fool that now art wiser than the wisest thy pain and sorrow have lift thee to heaven methink and free now of thy foolish clay thou dost walk with angel and look within the face of god but by thine agony endure now do i swear this night to raise to thy poor fool 's body a pyre fit for the flesh of king then beltane arise and lift high he axe shake it against garthlaxton 's frowning might where be neither glint of armor nor gleam of pike-head and turn hast back to that dark and silent company which at he word rise up from brake and fern and thicket and follow whither he lead a long line soundless and phantom-like within a phantom world where a gray mist swirl and drift in the death-cold air of dawn swift and silent they follow he these wild man with fierce eye and scowl face all set toward that mighty keep that loom high against the glimmer star axe and bow sword and pike and gisarm in rusty mail in rag of leather and skin they creep from bush to bush from tree to tree till they be come to that little pool wherein beltane have bath he aforetime in the dawn here they halt what time beltane seek to and fro along the bank of the stream until at last within a screen of leaf and vine he find the narrow opening he seek then turn he and beckon those ghostly silent shape about he and speak quick and low counsel they thus : look now this secret burrow leadeth under the foundation of the keep thus so soon as we be in let walkyn and gile with fifty man haste to smite all within the gate-house then up with portcullis and down with drawbridge and over into the barbican there to lie in ambush what time roger and i with eric here and the fifty and five shall fire the keep and hide within the dark raise a mighty outcry that those within the keep and they that garrison the castle rouse by the fire and we shout shall issue out amaze so will we fall upon they and they take by surprise shall seek to escape we by the gate then walkyn sally ye out of the barbican and smite they at the drawbridge so shall we have they front and rear how think you be it agree agree agree come the gruff and whisper chorus then last -- and mark this well each one -- till that i give the word let no man speak let death be swift but let it be silent then have draw he mail-hood about he face and lace it close beltane catch up he axe and step into the tunnel there he kindle a torch of pine and stoop ` neath the low roof go on before one by one the other follow roger and gile walkyn and eric bear the heavy log upon they shoulder and behind they axe and bow sword and pike and gisarm a wild company in garment of leather and garment of skin soft-treading and silent as ghost -- yet purposeful ghost withal soon come they to the iron door and beltane stand aside whereon the mighty four bend brawny shoulder swing the log crash against the iron thrice and four time smite they might and main ere rust bolt and rivet give beneath the battery and the door swing wide down go the log and ready steel flash as beltane stride on he torch aflare ` twixt ooze wall up step of stone that yet be slimy to the tread on and up by wind passage and steep-climbing stairway until they come where be a parting of the way -- the first still ascend the second lead off at a sharp angle here beltane pause in doubt and bidding the other halt follow the second passage until he be come to a narrow flight of step that rise to the stone roof above but here in the wall beside the step he behold a rusty iron lever and reach up he bear upon the lever and lo the flagstone above the step rear itself on end and show a square of gloom beyond then go beltane and signal to the other so one by one they follow he up through the opening into that same gloomy chamber where he have lie in bond and hearken to wail of torment but now the place be bare and empty and the door stand ajar so come beltane thither bear the torch and step softly into the room beyond a wide room arras-hung and richly furnished and look around upon the voluptuous luxury of gilded couch and wide soft bed beltane frown suddenly upon a woman 's dainty broidered shoe roger he whisper what place be this ` tis red pertolepe 's bed-chamber master ah sigh beltane ` tis rank of he methink -- lead on roger go you and walkyn before they in the dark and wait for I in the bailey one by one the wild company go by beltane fierce-eyed and stealthy until there none remain save gile who lean upon he bow look with yearning eye upon the costly splendor aha he whisper a pretty nest tall brother i 'll warrant ye full many a fair white dive have beat she tender pinion -- come say beltane and speak reach out he torch to bed-alcove and tapestried wall and immediately silk and arras go up in a puff of flame -- a leap fire yellow-tongued that lick at gilded roof-beam and carven screen and panel brother whisper gile o brother ` tis a sin methink to lose so much good booty that coffer now -- ha with the cry the archer leap out through the tapestried doorway come the ring of steel a heavy fall and thereafter a shriek that ring and echo far and near ere it sink to a silence wherein a voice whisper : quick brother -- the besotted fool stir at last -- away then o'erleap that which sprawl behind the curtain beltane speed along a passage and down a wind stair yet pause ever and anon with flare torch : and ever small fire wax behind he so come he at last to the sally-port and hurl the blaze torch behind he close the heavy door and now stand upon the platform he look down into the inner bailey dawn be at hand a glimmering mist wherein vague form move what time walkyn loom ghostly and gigantic in the mist muster he silent ghostly company ere lift he axe he turn and vanish he fifty phantom at he heel now glance upward at the rugged face of the keep beltane behold thin wisp of smoke that curl from every arrow-slit slow-wreathing spiral grow ever denser ere they vanish in the clammy mist of dawn while from within a muffle clamor rise -- low and inarticulate yet full of terror then beltane stride down the zig-zag stair and come forthright upon roger pale and anxious who yet greet he in joyous whisper : master i begin to fear for thee what now to the arch of the parapet yonder let each man crouch there in the gloom nor stir until i give word now as they crouch thus with weapon tight-gripped and eye that glare upon the coming day a sudden trumpet bray alarm upon the battlements -- shout be hear far and near and a running of mail foot steel clash the great castle wake at last be all astir about they and full of sudden bustle and tumult and ever the clamor of voice wax upon the misty air from hurry group dim-seen that flit by arm as they run and ever the fifty and five crouching in the dark impatient for the sign watch beltane -- he firm-set lip he frowning brow and ever from belch arrow-slit the curl smoke-wreaths wax blacker and more dense of a sudden out from the narrow sally-port burst a huddle of choke man whose gasping cry pierce high above the clamor : fire fire sir fulk be slay sir fulk lieth death-smitten fire from near and far man come run -- man affright and daze with sleep a push jostle unordered throng and the air hum with the babel of they voice and now at last -- up spring beltane he mittened hand aloft arise he cry arise and smite for pentavalon and from the gloom behind he a hoarse roar go up : arise arise -- pentavalon then while yet the war-cry thunder in the air they sweep down on that disorder press and the bailey ring and echo with the fell sound of a close-locked reel battle a hateful din of hoarse shouting of shriek and cry and clash steel axe and spear sword and pike and gisarm smote and thrust and sway stumbling foot spurn and trample yielding form that writhe groan beneath the press face glare at face haggard with the dawn while to and fro through swirl mist and acrid smoke the battle rock and sway but now the press thin out break and yield before beltane 's whirling axe and turn he find roger beside he all a-sweat and direfully besplash he mail breast heaving as he lean gasp upon a broadsword red from point to hilt ha master he pant -- ` tis do already -- see they break and fly on cried beltane on -- pursue pursue after they to the gate with axe and spear with sword and pike and gisarm they smite the fugitive across the wide space of the outer bailey under the narrow arch of the gate-house and out upon the drawbridge beyond but here of a sudden the fugitive check they flight as out from the barbican walkyn leap brandish he axe and with the fifty at he back so there upon the bridge the fight rage fiercer than before man smite and die until of sir pertolepe 's garrison there none remain save they that litter that narrow causeway

crouch upon she knee and spake in strange hushed accent messire she whisper mine eye do tell I thou art the lord beltane aye ` tis so ah she cry now glory be and thanks to god that i do see thee hale and well so say she shiver and cover she face now while beltane yet stare amaze by she say the bush part near by and a hooded figure step forth silent and soft of foot at sight of whom all man give

she utter no groan nor complaint only the maid cry aloud most pitiful to hear whereat gile dagger in hand push and strive to come at gurth then beltane alight from he horse and parting the throng with mail hand stand within the circle and look round upon they laugh and he laugh be harsh and bitter forsooth and must ye war with helpless woman o man of pentavalon quoth he and laugh again right scornfully whereat those that hold the witch relax they hold and fain would justify themselves she be a witch -- a cursed witch they cry she be a woman say beltane aye -- a devil-woman -- a notable witch -- we know she of old verily cry one ` tis but a sennight since she plague I with ache tooth -- and I with a ague cry another she bewitch my shaft that they all fly wide o ' the mark cry a third she cast on I a spell whereby i nigh do perish i ' the fen -- she be a hag -- she be demon-rid and shall to the fire they shout amain ha -- witch -- witch that doeth no man harm by day say beltane so by day shall no man harm she -- aye lord quoth roger but how by night ` tis by night she may work she spell and blast any that she will or haunt they with goblin damned that they do run mad or -- enough cry beltane frown on I let she bewitchment fall thus see you a i within this next week wither and languish ` neath she spell then let she burn a ye will : but until this flesh doth shrivel on these my bone no man shall do she hurt so now let there be a end -- free these woman let you rank be order and march -- comrade all cry red-haired gurth will ye be slave henceforth to this girl-faced youth we have arm now and rich booty let we back to the merry greenwood where all man be equal -- come let we be go and take these witch with we to we sport -- but in this moment beltane turn girl-faced quotha he cry and behold he look gurth of a sudden loose the swoon maid and draw sword leap and smite at beltane 's golden head but beltane catch the blow in he mail hand and snap the blade in sunder and seize gurth about the loin whirl he high in air then while all man blench and hold they breath wait the thud of he broken body in the dust beltane stay and set he down upon he foot and lo gurth 's cheek be pale he eye wide and vacant and he soul sit numbed within he so beltane take he by the throat and laugh fierce shake he to and fro beast say he unfit art thou to march with these my comrade now therefore do i cast thee out take thy life and go and let any follow thee that will -- pentavalon needeth not thy kind get thee from among we empty-handed as i find thee -- thy share of treasure shall go to better man now even as beltane spake gurth 's red head sink until he face be hide within he hand strong hand that slowly clench themselves into anger-trembling fist and ever as beltane speak the witch toss back she long gray hair look and look on he with bright and eager eye a wonder look quick to note he shape and goodly size he wide blue eye he long and golden hair and the proud high carriage of he head : and slowly to she wonderment come awe and grow joy but beltane speak on unheed : thou dost know I for a hunt man with a price upon my head but thou art thing so poor thy death can pleasure no man so take thy life and get thee hence but come not again for in that same hour will i hang thee in a halter -- go so with droop head gurth of the red hair turn he about and plunge into the green be go then beltane look awhile upon the other that stand shift on they foot and with never a word betwixt they comrade quoth he mighty deed do lie before we -- such work as only true man may achieve and what be a man a man methink be he that when he speaketh speaketh ever from he heart that be quick to hate all evil action be quicker to forgive and who fear neither ghost nor devil spell nor witchcraft dreadeth only dishonor and thus live without fear he without fear may die so now god send we all be man my brother to you file there -- pike to the front and rear bow to the flank -- forward but now as with a ring and clash and tramp of foot the ragged company fall into rank and order the witch-woman come swiftly beside beltane and touch he not speak softly in he ear beltane -- beltane lord duke of pentavalon now hereupon beltane start and turn look upon she grave-eyed what would ye woman he question bear wert thou of a mother chaste as fair true wife unto the duke thy father -- a woman sweet and holy who liveth but to the good of other : yet be brother slay by brother and thou baptise in blood ere now woman quoth he he strong hand a-tremble who art thou --

methink yet witch and beggar do we thank thee lord duke fare thee well -- until the full o ' the moon so spake she and clasp the young maid within she arm they pass into the brush and so be go now while beltane stand yet ponder she word come roger to he side to touch he humbly on the arm lord say he be not beguile by yon foul witch ' art : go not to hangstone waste lest she be-devil thee with goblin or transform thee to a loathly toad thou wilt not go master at the full o ' the moon roger why then mutter roger gulp and clench tremble hand we must need be plague-smitten blast and everlastingly damned for need must i go with thee very soon pike and bow and gisarm fall into array the pack-horse stumble forward the dust rise upon the warm still air now as they stride along with ring and clash and the sound of voice and laughter come gile to walk at beltane 's stirrup and oft he glance back along the way and oft he sigh a thing most rare in he at last he speak and dolefully : witchcraft be forsooth a deadly sin tall brother verily gile yet there be worse methink worse ha ` tis true ` tis very true nod the archer and then forsooth shall the mother 's sin cleave unto the daughter -- and she so wondrous fair the saint forbid now hereupon the archer 's gloom be lift and he stride along singing softly ` neath he breath yet in a while he frown sudden and fierce : as for that foul knave gurth -- ha methink i have be wiser to slit he roguish weasand for ` tis in my mind he may live to discover we hide place to we foe and perchance bring down red pertolepe to hundleby fen in truth say beltane slow and thoughtful so do i think 'twa for this i spare he life now here gile the archer turn and stare upon beltane with jaw agape and fain he would have question further but beltane 's gloomy brow forbid yet oft he look askance at that golden head and oft he sigh and shake he own what time they march out of the golden glare of morning into the dense green depths of the forest chapter xxxii how beltane meet with a youthful knight now at this time the fame of beltane 's do go throughout the duchy insomuch that diver and many be they that seek he out within the green masterless man serf new-broke from thraldom desperate fellow beyond the law thief and rogue in dire jeopardy of life or limb : off-scouring these of camp and town and village hither come seek shelter with beltane in the wild wood and eager for he service in very truth a turbulent company this prone to swift quarrel and deadly brawl but at these time fiercer than any be walkyn o ' the axe grimmer than any be roger the black whereas gile be quick as he tongue and eric calm and resolute : four mighty man be these but mightier than all be beltane wherefore at this time beltane set himself to bring order from chaos and to teach these wild man the virtue of obedience but here indeed be a hard matter for these be lawless man and very fierce withal but upon a morning ere the sun have chase the rosy mist into marsh and fen beltane stride forth from the cave wherein he sleep and lift the hunting horn he bare about he neck sound it fierce and shrill whereon rise a sudden uproar and out from they cave from sleeping-place hollow within the rock stumble he ragged following -- a unordered rabblement half-naked unarmed that run hither and thither shout and rub sleep from they eye or stare fearfully upon the dawn anon beltane sound again whereat they behold he come throng about he and question he eagerly on all side as thus : master be we attack forsooth be the red pertolepe upon we lord what shall we do -- lead we master -- lead we then look upon they wild disorder beltane laugh for scorn : -- rat quoth he o rat -- be it thus ye throng to the slaughter then be i in sooth red pertolepe with but a score at my back i have slay ye all ere sun-up where be you out-post -- where be you sentinel be ye so eager to kick within a hangman 's noose now hereupon diver growl or mutter threateningly while other yawn would have turn they back to sleep but stride among they beltane stay they with voice and hand -- and voice be scornful and hand be heavy : moreover beside he stand roger and gile with walkyn and eric of the wry neck fool he cry for that pentavalon doth need man so now must i teach ye other way fall to you rank there -- ha scowl and ye will but use well you ear -- mark I now but two night ago we burn down my lord duke 's great castle of garthlaxton : think you my lord duke will not seek vengeance dire upon these we body therefore think ye the red pertolepe will not be eager for we blood but yest be ` en when i might have slay yon knavish gurth i suffer he to go -- and wherefore for that gurth be at heart a traitor and rogue ingrain might straightway he he to the duke at barham broom with offer to guide he power hither but when they be come he chivalry and heavy armed foot here within the green then will we fire the wood about they and from every point of vantage beset they with we arrow -- ha bow -- bow cry gile toss up he bow-stave and catch it featly -- oho tall brother -- fair lord duke here be a sweet and notable counsel ha bow hey for bow and bill i ' the merry greenwood so perceive I quoth beltane thus shall the hunter peradventure become the hunt for a duke ivo come ` tis like enough he ne'er shall win free of we ring of fire now from these long and ragged rank a buzz arise that swell and swell to a fierce shout the fire they cry ha to burn they i ' the fire but so to do quoth beltane rat must become wolf valiant man ye be i know yet be ye but a poor unordered rabblement mete for slaughter so now will i teach ye how here within the wild-wood we may withstand black ivo and all he power gile bring now the book of clean parchment i take from garthlaxton together with pen and ink-horn and it shall be henceforth a record of we every one we name we number and the good or ill we each one do achieve so there and then while the sun rise high and higher and the mist of dawn thin and vanish phantom-like the record be begin two hundred and twenty and four they muster and the name of each and every gile duly write down within the book in right fair and clerkly hand thereafter beltane number they into four company over the first company he set walkyn over the second gile over the third roger and over the fourth eric of the wry neck moreover he cause to be bring all the armor they have win and order that all man should henceforth go arm from head to foot yet many there be that need must go short awhile now he ordain these four company should keep watch and watch day and night with sentinel and outpost in the green and when they murmur at this he stare they into silence fool say he a ye would lie secure so must ye watch constantly against surprise and furthermore shall ye exercise daily now at the speak command to address you pike ` gainst charge of horse or foot and to that company adjudge the best and stoutest will i each week give store of money from my share of booty so now walkyn summon ye you company and get to you ward thus it be that slowly out of chaos come order yet it come not unopposed for many and diver be they that growl against this new order of thing but beltane 's hand be swift and heavy moreover remember how he have deal with tostig they growl amain but hast to obey so in place of idleness be work and instead of quarrel and riot be peace among the wild man and a grow content insomuch that upon a certain balmy eve gile the archer loll beside the fire look upon black roger who sit beside he furbish he mail-shirt spake he mind on this wise : mark ye these lamb-like wolf of ours sweet roger there have be no blood-letting betwixt they these four day and scarce a quarrel roger aye this come of my lord my master have a wondrous tongue gile gile my brother-in-arm have a wondrous strong fist rogerkin -- roger thy brother-in-arm archer thine forsooth ha gile snort not my gentle roger for i fall in company with he ere he know aught of thee -- so thy snort availeth nothing my rogerkin howbeit we snarl wolf do live like tender lamb these day the which doth but go to prove how bless a thing be a fist -- a fist mark you strong to strike big to buffet and swift to smite : a capable fist roger to strike buffet and smite a man to the good of he soul roger in sooth my master be a noble knight ne'er shall we see he equal and yet gile methink he doth mope and grieve these day he groweth pale-cheeked and careworn harsh of speech and swift to anger behold he now and roger point to where beltane sit apart -lrb- as be become he wont of late -rrb- he axe betwixt he knee square chin prop upon clenched fist scowl into the fire that burn before he sleeping-cave whence cometh the so great change in he think you gile for that while i be i and he be himself thou art but what thou art my rogerkin -- well enough after thy fashion mayhap but after all thou art only thyself ha growl roger and what of thee archer i be he brother-in-arms rogerkin and so know he therefore as a wondrous lord a noble knight a goodly youth and a sweet lad some day when i grow too old to bear arm i will to pen and ink-horn and will make of he a ballade that shall mayhap outlive we time a notable ballade something on this wise : -- of gentle beltane i will tell a knight who do all knight excel who love of all man here below he faithful gile that bare the bow for gile full strong and straight could shoot a goodly man be gile to boot a lusty fighter sure be gile in counsel sage and full of wiles and gile be handsome gile be young and gile he have a merry -- how now roger man -- wherefore interrupt I for that there be too many of gile hereabouts and one gile talketh enough for twenty so will i to walkyn that seldom talketh enough for one so say roger arise don he shirt of mail and buckle he sword about he stride incontinent away and in a while beltane arise also and climb one of the many precipitous path answer the challenge of sentinel and outpost and go on slow-footed as one heavy in thought yet with eye quick to heed how thick be the underbrush hereabouts with dead wood and bracken apt to firing before he rise a upland crown by a belt of mighty forest tree and beyond a road or rather track that dip and wind away into the haze of evening presently as he walk beneath this leafy twilight he hear the lure sound of run water and turn thither lay he down where be a small and placid pool for he be athirst but as he stoop to drink he start and thereafter hang above this pellucid mirror stare down at the face that stare up at he with eye agleam ` neath lower brow above whose close-knit gloom a lock of hair gleam snow-white amid the yellow long stay he thus to mark the fierce curve of nostril the square grimness of jaw and chin and the lip that meet in a harsh line down-trending and relentless and gaze thus upon he image he speak beneath he breath : o lady o wilful helen thy soft white hand have set its mark upon I the love-sick youth be grow a man meseemeth well so be it thus say he laugh harshly and stoop drink he fill now as he yet lay beside the brook hearken to its pretty babel he be aware of another sound drawing nearer -- the slow plodding of a horse 's hoof upon the road below and glance whence it come he behold a solitary knight whose mail gleam ` neath a rich surcoat and whose shield flame red with sunset while beltane yet watch this solitary rider behold two figure that crouch in the underbrush grow beside the way stealthy figure that flit from tree to tree and bush to bush keep pace with the slow-riding horseman and as they come nearer beltane see that these man who crouch and steal so swift and purposeful be walkyn and black roger near and nearer they draw the tracker and the track till they be come to a place where the underbrush fall away and cover there be none : and here very suddenly forth leap roger with walkyn at he heel up rear the startled horse and thereafter the knight be drag from he saddle and walkyn 's terrible axe swing aloft for the blow but black roger turn and catch walkyn 's arm and so they strive together furiously what time the knight lay out-stretched upon the ling and stir not ha fool rage walkyn loose my arm -- what would ye shalt not slay he cry roger ` tis a notch -- ` tis a notch from my accursed belt -- shalt not slay he i tell thee now out upon thee for a mad knave quoth walkyn knave thyself roar black roger and so they wrestle fiercely together but little by little walkyn 's size and bull strength begin to tell whereupon back spring nimble roger and as walkyn 's axe gleam so gleam roger 's sword but now as they circle warily about each other seek a opening for blow or thrust there come a rush of foot and beltane leap betwixt they and bestride the fall knight front they in black and bitter anger ha rogue he cry art become thief and murderer so soon then would ` st shed each other 's blood for lust of booty like any other lawless knave forsooth shame -- o shame on ye both so say he stoop and lift the unconscious knight fling he across he shoulder and stride off leave the twain to stare upon each other shame-faced scowling and fierce-eyed beltane descend into the hollow whereupon up spring gile with diver other and would have look upon and aid with the captive but behold beltane 's frown they stay they question and stand from he path so come he to a certain cave hollow within the hill-side -- one of many such -- but the rough wall of this cave black roger have adorn with a rich arras and have prepare also a bed of costly fur here beltane lay the captive and sit within the mouth of the cave -- beyond which a fire burn -- fall to scowl at the flame and presently as he sit thus come roger and walkyn who fain would have make they peace but beltane fiercely bid they to begone lord quoth walkyn fumble with he axe we find this knight hard by so lest he should disclose the secret of this we haven -- i would have slay he -- master say roger ` tis true i have a mind to he horse and armor since we do such thing lack yet would i have save he alive and cut from my belt another accursed notch -- so art thou a fool roger quoth walkyn for a this knight live this we refuge be secret no longer ha sneer beltane what matter for that a it shelter but murderer and thieve knave -- dost name I murderer growl walkyn and I a thief master sigh roger i that be thy man that would but have borrow -- peace cry beltane hence -- begone and leave I to my thought hereupon walkyn turn and stride away twirl he axe but roger go slow-footed and with head a-droop what time beltane frown into the fire he scowl blacker than ever but as he sit thus from the gloom of the cave behind he a voice spake -- a soft voice and low at sound whereof he start and turn he about meseemeth thy thought be evil messire of a verity sir knight : for need must i think of woman and the way of woman to-night be i haunt of bitter memory now of a sudden the stranger knight behold beltane in the light of the fire start up to he elbow to stare and stare then quail shiver shrink away hide he face within he mail hand whereat spake beltane in amaze : how now sir knight -- art sick in faith dost ail of some wound -- not so -- ah god not so those fetter -- upon thy wrist messire -- alack sir knight laugh beltane and be it my look afflict thee so ` tis true we be wild rogue hereabout evil company for gentle knight amongst we ye shall find man new break from the gallows-foot and desperate knave for whom the dungeon yawn as for I these gyve upon my wrist be rivet there by folly for fool be he that trusteth to woman and the way of woman so will i wear they henceforth until my work be do to mind I of my folly and of one i love so much i would that she have die ere that she slew my love for she thus spake beltane stare ever into the fire joy bitterly to voice he grief unto this strange knight who have rise softly and now stand upon the other side of the fire and look upon he in a while beltane see that he be but a youth slender and shapely in he rich surcoat and costly mail the which lace close about cheek and chin show little of he face below the gleaming bascinet yet that little smooth-skinned and pale sir knight say beltane free art thou to go hence nor shall any stay or spoil thee yet first hear this : thou art perchance some roving knight seek adventure to the glory and honor of some fair lady o folly choose you something more worthy -- a horse be a noble beast and dog they say be faithful but see you a woman 's love be a pitiful thing at best while dog and horse be a-plenty give not thine heart into a woman 's hand lest she tear it in she soft white finger : set not thine honor beneath she shapely foot lest she tread it into the shameful mire so fare thee well sir knight god go with thee and keep thee ever from the love of woman so say beltane rise and lift the bugle-horn he wear sound it whereon come all and sundry running and with weapon brandish -- but roger first of all to all of whom beltane spake thus : behold here this gentle knight we guest be for the nonce -- entreat he courteously therefore give he all that he doth lack and thereafter set he upon he way -- but hereupon diver cast evil look upon the knight murmuring among themselves -- and loudest of all walkyn he knoweth the secret of we hiding-place ` tis say he knoweth the causeway through the fen he will betray we dog say beltane clench he hand will ye defy I then i say this knight shall go hence and none withstand he make way then -- or must i but now speak the youthful knight he gaze still bent upon the flame nor seem he to heed the fierce face

loud-voiced proclaim himself the traitor that have ope and show the secret way into the dungeon unto that charcoal-rogue for whose misdeed so many folk have suffer so they take this rascal friar and scourge he and set he in the water-dungeon where rat do frolic and to-night at sunset he dieth by slow fire as a warn to -- ah sweet noble good my lord what -- what would ye -- for beltane have rise and be look down at the crouch pardoner suddenly haggard pallid-lipped and with eye a-glare with awful menace but now the pardoner see that those eye look through he and beyond -- live eye in a face

forthwith come man that run towards he at speed but now be there no outcry or confusion and they mail gleam in the early sun as they fall into they appoint rank and company then beltane set he hand unto he eye and thereafter stare up to the heaven and round about upon the fair earth as one that wake from a dream evil and hateful and spake sudden and harsh-voiced : now hither to I walkyn gile and roger ye do remember how upon a time we meet a white friar in the green that be a son of god -- they call he brother martin ye do remember brave friar martin aye lord we mind he quoth the three ye will remember how that we do within the green aid he to bury a dead maid young and fair and tender -- yet do to shameful death verily master -- a noble lady growl walkyn and very young say roger and very comely alas add gile so now do i tell thee that as she die -- snatch out of life by brutal hand -- so at this hour even as we stand idle here other maid do suffer and die within belsaye town to-day as we stand here good friar martin lieth within the noisome water-dungeon where rat do frolic -- ha the pale fox growl walkyn bloody guus of allerdale that i do live but to slay one day with pertolepe the red -- thou dost remember roger how within the keep at belsaye i sware a oath unto sir guus so now -- this very hour -- must we march on belsaye that this my oath may be keep but here a murmur arise that hum from rank to rank head be shake and gruff voice speak on this wise : belsaye ` tis a long day 's march to belsaye -- ` tis a very strong city -- very strongly guard -- and we muster scarce two hundred -- the wall be high and we have no ladder or engine for battery and storm -- forsooth and we have here much booty already -- ha -- booty cry beltane there speak tall orson methink aye cry another voice loud and defiant and we be no soldier master to march ` gainst walled city look ` ee forester be we to live secure and free within the merry greenwood be ' t not so good fellow and there speak jenkyn o ' the ford quoth beltane stand forth orson and jenkyn with thee -- so now hearken again within belsaye man -- aye and woman too have endure the torment orson to-day at sundown a noble man doth burn jenkyn why look ` ee master spake jenkyn bold-voiced yet blench from beltane 's unswerving gaze look ` ee good master here be no matter for honest woodsman look ` ee -- aye nod tall orson ` tis no matter of ours so wherefore should we meddle and ye have sword i see quoth beltane and thereto hand wherewith to fight yet do ye speak forsooth of booty and fain would lie hide secure within the green so be it bring forth the record gile and strike I out the name of orson and jenkyn the which be shape like man be yet no man give therefore unto each he share of booty and let he go hence so say beltane turn and look upon the close-drawn rank that murmur and mutter no more quoth he : now and there be any here among we so faint-hearted -- so unworthy as this orson and jenkyn that do hold treasure and safety above flesh and blood -- if there be any here who regard he own base body will strike no blow for these distressed -- why let he now go forth of this we company o man o man of pentavalon do ye not hear they these woeful one -- do ye not hear they cry to we from sear flame from dungeon and gibbet -- do ye not hear be there one that remember the torment endure of groan body the dire wrong of innocence shame and trample in the mire -- live there a man that will not adventure life and limb and all he doth possess that such thing may be smitten hence and make a end of for all time but if such there be let he now stand forth with orson here and jenkyn o ' the ford thus speak beltane quick and passionate and thereafter pause wait they answer but no man spake or move only from they grim rank a growl go up ominous and deep and eye grow bright and fierce glare upon tall orson and jenkyn o ' the ford who shuffle with they foot and fumble with they hand and know not where to look ` tis well ` tis well good comrade all speak beltane in a while this night mayhap shall we each one achieve great thing go now dig ye a pit and therein hide such treasure as ye will and thereafter arm ye at point for in the hour we march eric see each doth bear with he food and gile look that they quiver be full so say beltane turn and come to he sleeping-place forthwith begin to don he armor and presently he be aware of orson and jenkyn standing without the cave and each with look downcast and eke they fumble with they hand and shuffle with they foot and fain be to speak yet find no word but at last spake jenkyn humbly and on this wise : master here come i look ` ee with orson that be my comrade look ` ee -- nay go get thee to thy ` booty ' say beltane busy with he armor nay but look ` ee master we be -- no man quoth beltane thus would i be free of ye both -- so get you hence but good master spake orson we do ha ' change we mind -- it do be a direful thing to burn and if they do ha ' tormented maid -- ` tis no matter of thine quoth beltane so go thy way and meddle not but master look ` ee now we be stout man and look ` ee we be full of lust to fight -- o master let we go kneel orson bend -- bend thy long shank look ` ee -- and forthwith on they knee fall jenkyn and tall orson with plead eye and eager hand outstretch o master look ` ee let we go aye we do ha ' change we mind master then be it so say beltane and i pray ye be ever faithful to you mind then take they beltane 's hand to kiss and thereafter up they spring and go rejoice to they company and within the hour mail and bascinet agleam the two hundred and twenty and four march forth of the hollow with step blithe and free and swing away through the green till the sound of voice and laughter the ring and clash of they go be die away and none remain save where cross-legged upon the sward he open wallet on he knee the round and buxom pardoner sit to cherish a bruised arm and to stare from earth to heaven and from heaven to earth with eye wider and rounder even than be they wont and custom chapter xxxiv how they come to belsaye through broad glade deep-hid within the wild by shady alleyway and leafy track they hold they march south and by east a close well-ordered company stride long and free and wake the solitude to a blithe babblement of laugh echo and who among they all so merry as gile o ' the bow at the head of he sturdy archer oft troll some merry stave or turn with some quip or jape upon he tongue but with eye quick to mark the rhythmic swing of broad mail-clad shoulder eye critical yet eye of pride who so grimly eager as mighty walkyn he heavy axe lightly a-swing he long leg schooling themselves to he comrade 's slower time and pace who so utterly content as black roger oft glance from beltane 's figure in the van to the file of he pike-man they sling shield agleam they spear well sloped and who so gloomy and thoughtful as beltane unmindful of the youthful knight who go beside he and scarce heed he soft-spoke word until he gaze by chance light upon the young knight 's armor that gleam in the sun ` neath rich surcoat armor of the newest fashion of link reinforce by plate of steel gorget and breast elbow and knee and with cunningly joint solleret moreover he shield be small and light accord with the new fashion and bare the blazon of two hand tight clasped and the legend : semper fidelis now view all this with a smith 's knowledgful eye quick to note the costly excellence of this equipment beltane forthwith brake silence : how do man name thee sir knight hereupon after some delay the young knight make answer : messire the motto i bear upon my shield be a good motto methink so shalt call I fideli a ye will my lord so be it sir faithful say which beltane fall to deep thought again i pray you my lord quoth fideli wherefore so sad so full of gloom and think i seek how we may win through the gate of belsaye sir fideli for they go strongly guard night and day yet this day ere sunset ope to we they must but how -- how my lord spake sir fideli i have hear say that few may go where many oft-time may not let first some two or three adventure it hide ` neath some close disguise -- a disguise cry beltane ha -- a disguise ` tis well bethought good fideli forsooth a disguise and ` twill be market day thereafter beltane stride on head bent in frown think nor spake again for a space and ever the file swing along behind in time to a march song carol blithe in the rich sweet voice of gile at length beltane raise he head and behold the sun well-risen halt he company beside a stream that flow athwart they way and sit thereby summon to he the four -- namely walkyn and roger gile and eric of the wry neck and while they eat together they hold counsel on this wise : beltane how think ye of this we adventure comrade all gile forsooth as a man do i think well of it ho for the twang of bowstring the whirr and whistle of well-sped shaft loose from the ear ha as a archer and a man ` tis a adventure that jumpeth with my desire but -- as a soldier and one of much and vary experience as one that have storm belsaye ere now -- with diver other town city keep and castle beyond number -- as a soldier i do think it but a gloomy business and foredoom to failure -- beltane and wherefore gile method tall brother method precise and soldier-like war be a very ancient profession -- a honorable profession and therefore to be treat with due reverence now without method war would become but a scurvy sorry hole-and-corner business unworthy you true soldier so i a soldier loving my profession do stand for method in all thing thus would i attack a city i do it _ modo et forma : _ first i set up my mantelet for my archer and under cover of they swift shooting i set I up my mangonel my trebuchet and balista : then push I up assault the wall with cat battering-ram and sap and have make I a breach would forthwith take I the place by sudden storm roger ha bowman here be overmuch of thee methink and dost speak like a very archer-like fool -- and forsooth a foolish archer to boot sure well ye know that engine for the battery have we none -- gile verily so shall we none of belsaye methink lack engine we lack for all -- no method no city remember that dolt rogerkin roger nay i remember garthlaxton aflame the gallows aflare and the empty dungeon so a we go up ` gainst belsaye again shall we surely take it remember these long-winded gile and be a soldier be ye also -- a man beltane what think you walkyn walkyn -lrb- pat he axe -rrb- of guus of allerdale master beltane and you eric eric that where thou dost go messire we follow beltane ` tis well now here beside I sitteth sir fideli who though methink the most youthful of we all have a head in council wiser than we all for he have speak I that whereby though few in number and lack engine for battery gile -- we yet may win through the wall of belsaye ere sun-down know you this country walkyn walkyn as my hand lord beltane be there a village hereabouts walkyn aye five mile west by south be brand-le-dene but there be a mill scarce a mile down stream i wot beltane a mill ` twill serve -- go ye thither here be money -- buy therewith four hat and smock the like that miller wear and likewise four meal-sack well stuff with straw walkyn -lrb- rise -rrb- smock master straw and meal-sacks beltane and haste walkyn we must be far hence within the hour forthwith up rise walkyn and summon diver of he company stride away down stream what time gile stare after he in wonderment thereafter shake he head at roger quoth he : tall brother and lord now do i see that we roger burneth for knowledge panteth for understanding and fain would question thee but that he mouth be full-crammed of meat yet do he bulge eye supplicate the wherefore of smock and he goodly large ear do twitch for the why of sack o impatient rogerkin bolt thy food man gulp -- swallow and ask and importune my lord thyself not i -- not i quoth roger a my master lacketh for a smock or a sack for I be no question of wherefore or why so long as he doth get they but the straw roger say gile glance askew at beltane a thou should ` st plague my lord with question how think ye then he shall answer of this straw thus thou crafty gile answer beltane belsaye be strong but strength may be perchance beguile so may a miller 's smock hide a shirt of mail and straw i have hear will burn oho a wile cried gile aha some notable wile what more more shalt thou know mayhap in belsaye market-place and when beltane have handle the well-worn smock have view the bulge meal-sack that walkyn and he fellow bring he he arise at he word the company fall to they rank and forthwith swing off again south and by east what time gile carolled blithely and diver chorus lustily : while roger whistle and even grim walkyn -lrb- bethink he of guus of allerdale -rrb- rumble hoarsely in he hairy throat so the mile pass unheeded until as the sun decline they leave the wild country behind wherefore beltane command all man to a strict silence and thus come they betime to the edge of the wood and halt within the green beheld afar across the plain the wall of fair belsaye town we be well to time quoth beltane glance from sink sun to lengthen shadow we have yet a hour to sunset but in this hour much have we to do hark ye now and draw the four about he he speak they thus : walkyn and roger and eric shall into the town with I in miller 's guise each bear he sack of flour what time you gile with sir fideli and all we power bide here well hide till such time as ye shall see a smoke within belsaye and when ye see this smoke rise up and make you ready one and all yet stir not from the green till that ye hear my bugle-horn sound we rallying-note then come ye on amain and be within the city charge ye where my horn shall sound how now be ' t agree aye lord nod gile ` tis a excellent strategy in faith and yet ` twere wiser methink to suffer I in roger 's place : for be guileful in war so should i be a very beguiling miller whereas roger a we plaster he with flour would ne'er be other than rogerkin the black nay gile thy post be here let you bow be string and ready but set you pike to the fore -- and gile watch walkyn bring now the smock so say beltane tighten he belt draw on he hood of mail and lace it close and turn find sir fideli close by to aid he with the hooded smock and beltane wonder to see he so pale and he slender hand a-tremble so the smock be don with straw about they leg bind by withy as be the custom and take the sack upon they shoulder they turn aside into the green and be go chapter xxxv how guus of allerdale cease from evil sir guus of allerdale lord seneschal of belsaye town ride hawk on fist at the head of diver noble knight and gentle esquire with verderer and falconer attendant the dusty highway that lead across the plain to the frown gate of belsaye be a-throng with country folk trudge on foot or seat in heavy cart whose clumsy wheel creak and groan city-ward for though the sun be far decline it be market-day : moreover a man be to die by the fire and though such sight be a-plenty yet 'twas seldom that any lord seneschal warden castellan or -- in fine any potent lord dower with right of pit and gallows -- dare lay hand upon a son of the church even of the lesser and poorer order but sir guus be a bold man and greatly daring wherefore it be that though the market-traffic be well nigh do the road be yet a-swarm with folk all eager to behold and watch how a white friar could face death by the flame so on horse and afoot in creak cart and wain they throng toward the goodly city of belsaye sir guus ride at a hand-pace and as

hast anger I full oft art but a very youth -- gramercy for my so much youthfulness my lord methink i shall be full long a-growing old -- heed I sir knight ` tis a fell place this where direful beast do raven -- nathless messire my youthfulness be but where it would be -- aye forsooth and there it be where thou would ` st be -- thou forsooth art indeed a wilful youth and very headstrong and wherefore here to cheer thee in thy loneliness my lord how so thou shalt reproach I for my youth and quarrel with I when thou wilt be i of so ill humor indeed look within thyself my lord now here they ride a while in silence but presently beltane turn he again in the saddle and see again only arm and shoulder quoth he : fidelis art a strange youth and a valiant -- and yet thy voice -- thy voice have betime a -- a something i love not -- a note of softness that mindeth I of bitter day then heed it not my lord ` tis but that i grow a-weary belike here silence again what time beltane fall to frown and sir fidelis head a-slant to watch he furtive-eyed yet with lip that curve to wistful smile come you in sooth from -- the duchess helen fideli in truth my lord dost love she -- also aye my lord -- also then alas for thee poor youthful fool ` twere better i have leave thee to thy death methink for she -- this wilful helen -- my lord cry sir fideli nought will i hear to she defame fidelis

for lithe and swift sir fideli have spring to earth and have seize the great roan 's bridle and check he in he stride face beltane with cheek suffuse and flaming eye shame messire -- o shame he cry how vile be he that would with lie tongue smirch the spotless honor of any maid and as to helen i do name thee liar -- liar would ` st quarrel with I in matter so unworthy enough quoth fideli unworthy art thou to take she name within thy lip -- enough so say sir fideli step back a pace and draw he sword now beltane yet astride the mighty roan that snuff the fragrant air and stoop to crop the tender herbage look upon the youthful paladin ` neath wrinkled brow and pull he lip as one in doubt anon he sigh and therewith smile and shake he head quoth he : o fideli now do i see that i must need love thee some day fidelis art a fool but a right sweet fool so do i humbly sue thy foolish pardon and as to helen may she prove worthy thy sweet faith and i thy love and friendship so fair knight put up thy sword -- come mount and let we on sir mar methink doth snuff water afar and i do yearn I for the cool of it so in a while they ride on again yet presently sir fideli meek-voiced prefer a sudden question thus : lord fain would i know why thou dost contemn she so -- nay sigh beltane here be a tale un-meet thy tender year speak we of other thing -- as thus wherefore didst keep we life in jeopardy to bring away the wallet that cumbereth thy hip for that within doth lie first -- we supper -- o foolish youth these wood do teem with food a neat 's tongue delicately seasoned -- o say beltane ` twixt manchet of fair white bread -- ah say beltane with a small skin of rare wine -- enough quoth beltane these be thing forsooth worth a little risk now do i thirst and famish yet know it not a thou wilt eat my lord nay first will we find some freshet where we may bathe awhile ha to plunge naked within some sweet pool -- ` tis a sweet thought fideli but hereupon the young knight make answer none and fall into a reverie and beltane also what time they ride by murmur rill through swampy hollow past brake and briar until as evening begin to fall they come unto a broad slow-moving stream whose water aglow with sunset glory split asunder the greeny gloom of tree most pleasant to behold then sigh for very gladness beltane check he horse and speak right gleefully : light down light down good fideli ne'er saw i fairer haven for wearied traveller we have ride hard and far so here will we tarry the night and down to earth he spring to stride up and down and stretch he cramped limb the while sir fideli loose off the great high-peaked saddle lead the foam-flecked war-horse down to the water now because of the heat beltane lay by he bascinet and hearken to the soft cool ripple of the water he straightway unbuckled he sword-belt and begin to doff he heavy hauberk perceive the which cometh sir fideli to he something hastily what do you messire he question do fidelis forsooth i would bathe I in yon cool sweet water -- list how it murmureth ` neath the bank yonder come then strip as i do youth strip and let we swim together -- pray you aid I with this lacing my lord i -- indeed i do think it unsafe -- unsafe boy a we foe should come upon we -- o content you quoth beltane stoop to loose off he spur we foe be lose hour since nor shall any find we here in the wild methink -- pray you loose I this buckle come list how the water do woo we with they pretty babble but messire quoth fideli faint-voiced and fumble awkwardly with the buckle indeed i -- i have no art in swim then will i teach thee nay spake the young knight hastily he trouble grow i do dread the water well there be shallows ` neath the alder yonder aye but the shallows will be muddy and i -- muddy cry beltane pause with he hauberk half on half off to stare at sir fideli in amaze muddy forsooth art a dainty youth in faith and over-nice methink what matter for a little honest mud prithee why ` tis mud and slimy under foot and i love not mud so will i none of the shallows then verily must i chide thee fidelis for -- then verily will i unto yon boskage messire to prepare we a fire ` gainst the ` beast that raven ' and we bracken bed howbeit bathe I i -- will -- not messire o luxurious youth then will i and shame thy nice luxuriousness quoth beltane and off come hauberk and quilted gambeson and away skip sir fideli into the green so presently beltane plunge he into the stream and swimming with powerful stroke feel he youth and strength redouble thereby and rejoice to be alive thereafter he leap ashore he blood aglow with ardent life and as he clothe he feel a great and mighty hunger but scarce have he don chauss and gambeson than he hear a outcry and sudden clamor within the green whereupon stay not for he armor he catch up he sword and unsheathe it as he run plunge in among the tree and there espy sir fideli stoutly withstand three foul knave unwashed and ragged then shout beltane and fall upon they right joyously and smite they gleefully and laugh to see they reel and scatter before he sudden onset whereon behold sir fideli pale and scant of breath he stay to clap he on the shoulder blithely do good fideli quoth he rest thee awhile and catch thy wind for fain be i to try a bout with yon tall rogue so say he advance upon the scowl three he eye a-dance he nimble foot light-poised for swift action -- for lusty rogue be these who see he alone forthwith meet he point and edge beset he with many swashing blow that whistle do but cleave the empty air or ring loud upon he swift-opposing blade so hew they and smite amain until they brow shine moist and they breath wax short whereat beltane mock they say : ha -- sweat ye forsooth do ye puff so soon this cometh of foul eating and fouler life off -- off ye beefy do-nothing a ye would be worthy fighter eat less and bathe ye more then beltane lay on with the flat of he heavy sword and soundly belabour these hard-breathing knave insomuch that one hard-smitten on the crown stumble and fall whereupon he comrade to save they bone leap forthwith a-down the steepy bank and plunge into the stream make across to the farther side splash prodigiously and cursing consumedly for the water they like not at all now as beltane lean he on he sword watch they floundering joyful-eye the weapon be dash from he loosen hold he stagger ` neath the bite of vicious steel and start round behold the third rogue he deadly sword swing high but even as the blow fall sir fideli spring between and take it upon he own slender body and staggering aside fall and lay with arm wide-tossed then while the robber yet stare upon he sword shiver by the blow beltane leap and ere he could flee catch he about the loin and whirling he aloft dash he out into the stream then kneel by sir fideli he take he heavy head upon he arm and behold he cheek pale and wan he eye fast shut and see he shine bascinet score and deep-dinted by the blow fideli he groan o my brave fideli and art thou slay -- for my sake but in a while what time beltane kneel and mourn over he full sore the young knight stir feebly sigh and spake beltane he whisper and again beltane anon he white lid quiver and open swoon eye he speak again with voice grow stronger : my lord -- my lord -- what of thy wound and lo the voice be sweet to hear as note of merle or mavi these eye be long and deeply blue beneath they heavy lash eye that look up brimful of tenderness ere they close slow and wearily eye so much at odds with grim bascinet and close-laced camail that beltane must need start and hold he breath and fall to sudden tremble what time sir fideli lay there pale and motionless as one that be dead now great fear come upon beltane and he would have utter desperate prayer but could not tremble yet full gently he draw he arm from under that droop head and steal soft-footed to the river 's marge stand there stare down at the ripple water and he heart be rent with conflict passion -- amazement fear anger joy and a black despair and of a sudden beltane fall upon he knee and bow he low and lower until he burn brow be hide in the cool sweet grass -- for of these passion fiercest strongest wildest be -- despair chapter xlii how beltane dream in the wild-wood now in a while he start to feel a hand among he hair and the hand be wondrous light and very gentle wherefore wonder he raise he head but behold the sun be go and the shadow deepen to night yet even so he stare and thrill ` twixt wonder and fear to see sir fideli bend over he fidelis he murmur and be it thee in truth -- or do i dream dear my lord ` tis i indeed how long hast lain thus i do but now wake from my swoon be it thy hurt -- suffer I to look nay ` ti of none account but i do dream thee -- dead -- fideli ah messire thy hurt bleedeth apace -- the steel have go deep sit you thus thy back against the tree -- so within my wallet i have a salve -- wait you here so whiles beltane stare dreamily upon the twilit river sir fideli hast up the bank and be back again the wallet by he side whence he take a phial and goblet and mixed therein a draught which dreamy beltane perforce must swallow and thereafter the dreamy languor fall from he what time sir fideli fall to bathing and bandage the ugly gash that show beneath he knee now as he watch these busy skilful finger he know a sudden uneasy qualm and forthwith speak he thought aloud : thy hand be wondrous -- small and slender sir fideli belike messire they shall grow bigger some day yet be they wondrous fair -- and soft -- and white fideli mayhap messire they shall grow rough and brown and hairy anon -- so content you yet wherefore be they so soft fideli and so -- maid-like and wherefore -- see you my lord thus must the bandage lie fast-knotted -- so nor must it slacken lest the bleeding start afresh so say sir fideli arise and take the wallet in one hand and set the other ` neath beltane 's arm lead he to where deep-bowered under screen willow a fire burn cheerily whereby be two bed of scented bracken dark and darker the shadow creep down deepen to a night soft and warm and very still whose quietude be unbroken save for the drowsy lap and murmur of the river and the sound the war-horse mar make as he crop the grass near by full of a languorous content lay beltane despite the smart of he wound what time sir fideli come and go about the fire and there within this great and silent wilderness they sup together and while they sup beltane look oft upon sir fideli heedful of every trick of mail-girt feature and gesture of graceful hand as he ne'er have be ere now wherefore sir fideli grow red grow pale be by turn talkative and silent and be fain to withdraw into the shadow beyond the fire and from there see beltane silent and full of thought grow bold to question he dost meditate we course to-morrow my lord beltane nay -- i do but think -- a strange thought -- that i have see thy face ere now fideli yet art full young to bear arm a-field doth my youth plague thee still messire believe I i be -- older than i seem thou at peril of thy life fideli didst leap ` twixt I and death so need must i know thee for my friend and yet -- and yet messire thou hast betime the look and speech of one -- of one beyond all traitor vile ah murmured sir fideli a sudden tremor in he voice thou dost mean -- helen of mortain -- poor fideli -- whom thou dost love whom thou dost hate beltane and o i pray thee wherefore be thy hate so bitter fideli there live a fool that for she beauty love she with a mighty love : that for she seeming truth and purity honor she beyond all thing : that in the end do find she beyond all thing vile aye there live a fool -- and i be he ah beseech thee cry sir fideli white hand outstretch how know you she thus false to thee beltane know then sir fideli that -- upon we wedding-eve i be -- by she command strike down -- within the chapel -- upon the very altar and by she bear in bond unto garthlaxton keep -- a present to mine enemy duke ivo -- o ` tis a lie -- o dear my lord -- ` tis lie most foul -- in witness whereof behold upon my wrist the shameful iron from my dungeon -- alas here be no work of helen 's -- no thought no will -- helen would have die to save thee this -- so fidelis do i scorn all woman that do live upon this earth henceforth -- but above all helen the beautiful the wilful who in she white bosom doth bear a heart more foul than trojan helen that be a woman false and damned so now all ' say now fell sir fideli upon he knee and spake quick and passionate : nay beltane hear I for now do i swear that he who tell thee 'twas helen work thee this vile wrong -- who tell thee this doth lie -- o doth lie now do i swear that never by word or thought or deed have she be false to thee -- i do swear she loveth thee -- ah spurn I not -- o believe -- enough -- enough good fideli perjure not thy sweet youth for one so much unworthy for with these eye do i behold she as they bear I in my bond -- and shall i not believe mine eye never -- ah never when they do shew thee helen false and cruel to thee here be some vile magic -- witchcraft -- enough fideli ` tis past and do here be a woman false -- well ` tis none so singular -- there have be other -- there will be other so god keep thee sweet youth from the way of woman nay let we speak of this no more for in sooth i grow a-weary and we must ride with the dawn to-morrow so betake thee to thy rest nor grieve thee for my sorrow past and do -- mayhap they shall be thing to smile upon one day so say beltane sigh and lay he down among the bracken and thereafter fideli do the like the fire sink and wane and oft sir fideli stir restless in the shadow the river murmur slumberously among the sedge but beltane hearken with drowsy ear oft think to hear another sound very soft and repress yet very dolorous ere worn and spend and something weaken by wound and loss of blood he sink at last to deep and gentle sleep but in he sleep he dream that one knelt above he in the dark keep watch upon he slumber in the attitude of one in prayer -- one whom he know yet know not it seem to beltane in he dream that this silent slender shape stoop of a sudden low and lower to kiss the iron fetter that bind he wrist then beltane strove to wake yet could not wake but in he slumber sigh a name soft-breathed and gentle as the languorous murmur of the stream : helen chapter xliii how beltane know great humility the rise sun dart a inquisitive beam ` twixt a leafy opening fall upon beltane 's wide slow-heaving breast creep upward to he chin he cheek and finally strive to peep beneath he slumberous close-shut lid whereat beltane stir yawn throw wide and stretch he mighty arm and thereafter blinking drowsily sit up he golden hair be-tousled and stare sleepily about he bird pipe joyously near and far hide among the leaf near by the war-horse mar stamp eager hoof and snuff the fragrant air of morning but sir fideli be nowhere to be see thus in a while beltane arise to find he leg very stiff and sore and he throat be parch with feverish thirst wherefore limp painfully he turn where a little water-brook go singing o'er pebbly bed to join the slow-moving river but put aside the leaf he pause of a sudden for there beside the noisy streamlet he behold sir fideli he bascinet upon the grass beside he he mail-coif throw back betwixt he shoulder stoop to bathe he face in the sparkling water now would he have call a greet but the word die upon he lip he breath stay and he stare at something that have catch in the link of the young knight 's mail-coif something that stir light and wanton kiss by the breath of early morn -- a lock of bright hair that glow a wondrous red-gold in the new-risen sun so stand beltane awhile and behold this a tremble seize he and therewith sudden anger and he stride forth of the leaf and lo on the instant on go hood of mail and thereafter shine bascinet and sir fideli arise but ere he could turn beltane be beside he have catch he within a powerful arm and set a hand ` neath mail chin lift the young knight 's head and scowl down into he face eye long black-lashed and darkly blue that look up awhile into he wide yet fearless and anon be hide ` neath languorous-drooping lid a nose tenderly aquiline lip red and full that meet in ripe and luscious curve this beltane saw and straightway he anger grow ah cry he hoarsely now by the living god who art thou and -- what thy -- comrade-in-arms lord beltane why hast thou the seeming of one beyond all woman false why dost thou speak I betime in she voice look at I with she eye touch I with she soft white traitor 's hand -- answer I my lord we be akin she and i -- of the same house and blood -- then be thy blood foul with treachery yet do i save thy life beltane yet thy soft voice thy red mouth and false eye -- thy very blood -- all these do prove thee traitor -- hence and beltane throw he off nay my lord he cry prithee take care beltane -- see -- thou hast displace the bandage thy wound bleedeth amain -- so will i bind it up for thee -- but beltane nothing heed turn and stride back into the green and there fall to don he armor as swiftly as he might -- albeit stealthily thereafter come he to the destrier mar and have saddle and bridle he with the same swift stealth set foot in stirrup and would have mount yet find this a painful matter by reason of he wound thus it befall that ere he could reach the saddle the leaf part close by and sir fideli speak soft-voiced : my lord beltane why dost thou steal away thus a it be thy will to leave I to perish alone here in the wilderness first break thy fast and suffer I to bind up thy hurt so shalt thou ride hence in comfort now stand beltane motionless and silent nor turn nor dare he look upon sir fideli but bow he head in bitter shame and therewith know a great remorse ah fideli say he at last thy rebuke stingeth deep for it be just since i indeed do purpose thee a most vile thing how vile a thing then be i -- nay beltane -- dear my lord i would not have thee grieve indeed 'twa but -- once ere this i would have slay thee fideli -- murder thee before my wild fellow -- i -- i that do preach they mercy and gentleness to-day i would have leave thee to perish alone within this ravening wilderness -- that do bear so honorable a name o beltane my father yet believe I i do love honor once and be account gentle i do set forth to do great thing but now -- now do i know myself unfit and most unworthy therefore sir fideli do thou take the horse and what thou wilt beside and leave I here for fain be i to end my day within these solitude with no eye to see I more -- save only the eye of god so say beltane go aside and sit ` neath a tree beside the river bow he head upon he hand and groan then come sir fideli full swift and stoop touch he bow head with gentle hand whereat he but groan again god pity I quoth he i be in sooth so change meseemeth some vile demon doth possess I betime and sigh deep he gaze upon the ripple water wide-eyed and fearful and as he sit thus abashed and despairing sir fideli speak no word bath and bind up he wound and thereafter bring and spread forth they remain viand eat say he gently come let we break we fast mayhap thy sorrow shall grow less anon come eat i pray thee beltane for none will i eat alone and o i famish so they eat together while the war-horse mar paw impatient hoof oft turn he great head to view they with round and wistful eye fideli quoth beltane suddenly thou didst name I selfish and verily a selfish man be i -- and to-day o fideli why dost not reproach I for the evil i purposed thee to-day for that i do most truly love thee beltane my lord yet wherefore do ye so yesterday and for lesser fault for that i do love thee so would i see thee a strong man -- yet gentle : a potent lord yet humble : a noble man as -- as thou wert say to be alas my fideli harsh have i be proud and unforgiving -- aye my lord -- thou art unforgiving -- a little so now fideli would i crave forgiveness of all man then come the young knight nearer yet he face radiant with sudden joy he white hand clasp lord he whisper o beltane could ` st indeed forgive all -- all harm do thee howsoever great or small thy mind doth hold they -- could ` st forgive all aye i could forgive they all fideli -- all save helen -- who have break this heart of mine and make my soul a thing as black as she have white this my hair now of a sudden beltane hear a sound -- a small sound ` twixt a sob and a moan but when he raise he heavy head -- lo sir fidelis be go chapter xliv how a madness come upon beltane in the wild-wood the sun rise high jet still beltane sit there beside the stream stare down into the gurgle water grieve amain for he unworthiness thus presently come sir fideli and standing afar spake in voice strange and bitter : what do ye there my lord dost dream ever upon thy woe and ill wilt dream thy life away here amid the wild forsooth quoth beltane very humbly : and wherefore not sir fideli unfit be i for great achievement but as to thee take now the horse and ride you ever north and west -- yea but where be north and where west -- the tree shall tell you this hearken now -- nay my lord no forester be i to find my way through trackless wild so a thou stay so perforce must i : and if thou stay then art thou deeply forsworn how mean you good sir i mean belsaye -- i mean all those brave soul that do wait and watch pale-cheeked ` gainst ivo 's threaten vengeance -- ha -- belsaye quoth beltane lift he head thou must save belsaye from flame and ravishment my lord aye forsooth cry beltane clench he hand though i be unworthy to stand in my noble father 's place yet belsaye must be save or i die in it o fideli friend art thou indeed and wise beyond thy year but as beltane arise sir fideli incontinent turn away and presently come back lead the great horse so in a while they set out northwards but now be no arm to clasp and cling since sir fideli find hold otherwhere thus after some go beltane question he : art easy fideli aye lord wilt not take hold upon my belt as yesterday methink i be better thus nay then shalt have stirrup and saddle for i be fain to walk and re-open thy wound messire nay let be -- i ride easily thus art anger with I fidelis nay lord i do but pity thee and wherefore for thy so great loneliness -- in all thy world be none but beltane and he be very woeful and dreameth ever of he wrong -- would ` st call I selfish again forsooth nay lord -- a martyr o a very martyr that huggeth he chain and kisseth he wound and joyeth in the recollection of he pain have i not suffer fideli thou hast know the jangling gloom of a dungeon -- 'twa at garthlaxton keep methink fetter cry beltane a dungeon these be thing to smile at -- my grief be of the mind -- the deeper woe of high and noble ideal shatter -- a holy altar blacken and profane -- a woman worship as divine and prove baser than the basest and be this all my lord all quoth beltane amaze all saith he turn to stare so much of woe and tribulation for so little reason nay hear I for now will i make thee a prophecy as thus : there shall dawn a day lord beltane when thou shalt see at last and know truth when she stand before thee and in that day thou shalt behold all thing with new eye : and in that day shalt thou sigh and long and yearn with all thy soul for these woeful hour wherein self loom for thee so large thou art blind to aught else good fideli thy prophecy be beyond my understanding aye my lord ` tis so i think indeed pray thee therefore rede and expound it unto I nay time mayhap shall teach it thee and thou methink shalt passionately desire again the solitude of this wilderness aye but wherefore for that it shall be beyond thy reach -- and mine and fidelis sigh in deep and troubled fashion and so fall to silence what time beltane cunning in wood-lore glancing hither and thither at knotted branch and writhen tree bole view earth and heaven with a forester 's quick eye ride on into the trackless wild of the forest-land now here thinketh the historian it booteth not to tell of all those minor hap and chance that befall they how despite all beltane 's wood-craft they go astray full oft by reason of fordless river and quake swamp : of how they snare game to they sustenance or how for all the care and skill of sir fideli beltane 's wound heal not by reason of continual ride for that each day he grow more restless and eager for knowledge of belsaye so that because of he wound he know small rest by day and a fevered sleep by night -- yet despite all he love for fidelis daily wax and grow what time he press on through the wild country north-westerly five weary day and night wander they lose to sight and knowledge within the wild day of heat and night of pain and travail until there come a evening when rack with anguish and faint with thirst and weariness beltane draw rein within a place of rock whereby be a shady pool deep-bowered in tree down spring fideli to look anxiously on beltane 's face pale and haggard in the light of a great moon say beltane look round about with knit brow : fideli -- o fideli methink i know this place -- these rock -- the pool yonder -- there should be a road hereabout the great road that leadeth to mortain climb now the steep and tell I a you can see a road run north and south forthwith sir fideli climb the rocky eminence and be there cry right joyously : aye lord -- ` tis the road -- the road and so come hastily down glad-eyed ` tis the end of this wilderness at last my lord aye sigh beltane at last and groan he sway in the saddle -- for he pain be very sore -- and would have fall but for the ready arm of sir fideli thereafter with much labor beltane get he to earth and fideli bring he where beneath the steep be a shallow cave carpet with soft moss very excellent suit to they need here beltane lay he down watch a little cataract that ripple o'er the rocky bank near by where fern and lichen grow what time sir fideli come and go and have set fire a-going whereby to cook they supper bring a armful of fragrant heather to set ` neath beltane 's weary head then have give he to drink of the cordial fall to work bathing and bandage he wound sigh often to see it so swollen and angry fideli quoth beltane methink there be some magic in thy touch for now be my pain abate -- hast a wondrous gentle hand -- ` tis the cordial giveth thee respite lord -- nay ` tis thy hand methink sure no man e'er be bless with truer friend than thou my fideli brave art thou yet tender as any woman and rather would i have thy love than the love of any man or woman soever henceforth dear my friend nay wherefore hang thy head without thee i have die many time ere this without thy voice to cheer I in these solitude thy strength and skill to aid I i have fall into madness and death wherefore i do love thee fidelis and fain would have thee go beside I ever -- so great be become my need of thee ah beltane thou dost know i will ne'er desert thee so henceforth be i content -- and yet -- well my lord to-morrow perchance shall see the end of this we solitude and close comradeship -- to-morrow we should reach hundleby fen so fidelis promise I if thou at any time hereafter should see I harsh or proud or selfish -- do thou mind I of these day of we love and companionship wilt promise I aye lord spake sir fideli low-bending to he task and thereafter sigh and bow he lower yet wherefore dost thou sigh for that i feel as if -- ah beltane -- as if this night should be the end of we love and comradeship nought but death shall do this methink why then say fidelis as he rise a it must be fain would i have death but when beltane would have question he further he smile sad and wistful and go forth to the fire up rise the moon a thing of glory fill the warm stilly night with a soft and radiant splendor -- a tender light fraught with a subtle magic whereby all thing rock and tree and leap brook find a new and add beauty and in some while come sir fideli to set out they viand neat and orderly as be ever he custom and thereafter must need chide beltane soft-voiced for he lack of hunger and cut dainty morsel woo he thereby to eat fideli say beltane on so fair a night as this methink the old fable and romance might well be true that tell of elf that dance on moony night and of shapely nymph and lovely dryad that be the spirit of the tree aye in the magic of so fair a night as this aught might happen -- miracle and wonder save one thing dear my lord as what my fideli that thou should ` st dream helen pure and faithful and worthy to thy love -- that doubt thine own sens thou should ` st yearn and sigh to hold she once again heart on heart -- ah fidelis quoth beltane sigh deep why wilt thou awake a sleep sorrow my love be dead long since meseemeth and bury in mine heart o fideli mine eye mine ear my every sense do tell I she be false -- so be a end of love for I henceforth dear my lord spake fideli and he voice thrill strangely in beltane 's ear -- o beltane my lord could ` st thou but doubt thyself a little -- could ` st thou doubt thine own sens for love 's sake believe she now true -- true as thou would ` st have she then love indeed might work for thee a miracle this night and thou be love as man of god-like faith nay sweet fideli i be but a man apt to evil betime and betime seek good howbeit now be i a weary man that fain would sleep come then lay you down here beside I where i may touch thee a i awake i ' the night and lie down beltane beckon fideli beside he so in a while the young knight come and do as beltane bade and side by side they lay within the shelter of the little cave and in the dark beltane set he mighty arm about he and thereafter spake wonder : art not cold fideli nay lord then why dost tremble indeed i know not -- mayhap i grieve that -- the age of miracle -- be pass away now at this beltane wonder the more and would fain have question he but in that moment sigh and fall to slumber but in he sleep he dream that fideli be beset by foe and cry to he for aid whereon he would have hast to he deliverance yet could not for that unseen hand hold he fast then strive he amain against these gripe hand and so awake in sudden terror and lay there tremble in the dark and in the dark he reach out cautious hand further and further and so find himself alone -- for the young knight be go now be very sick with the fever of he wound dread come upon he fear seize and shake he and tremble in the dark he call aloud fidelis fideli but no sound hear he save the ripple of the brook near by groan he arise and limp forth of the cave stand in the glory of the moon voiceless now by reason of he ever-growing terror conscious only of he passionate desire to find again the youth whose gentle voice have cheer he often in the dark whose high courage and tender care have never fail so lean upon he great sword beltane limp through light and shadow heedless of direction until he be stay by the water of the pool a faint splash a ripple of the sleepy water and out into the moonlight come one that swim the pool with long easy stroke one that presently leap lightly ashore and stand there to shake down the unwetted glory of she hair at first he think this some enchanted pool and she the goddess of the place but even then she turn and thus at last -- he know and in that moment also she behold he amid the leaf tall and fair she stand proud and maidenly nor move she nor spake : only she shake about she loveliness the shine mantle of she hair and behold the reproachful sadness of those clear virgin eye beltane abashed by she very beauty bow he head and turn stumble away and thus presently find himself within the cave throw himself down and clasp he head within fierce hand yet even so need must he behold the slim white beauty of she the ripple splendor of she hair and the deep shy sadness of she eye and because of she beauty he tremble and because of she falsity he groan aloud now as he lay thus after some while he hear a swift light footfall the whisper of mail and know that she stand above he yet he heed not wherefore at last she speak sweet-voiced and gentle beltane -- dear my lord now dost thou know who be fideli and thou didst -- love fideli but beltane stir not and find he silent she speak on yet falter a little : when i wake from my swoon within the chapel at -- at blaen and find thee go i distraught with woeful fear and a most strange sickness take thy sword and therewith horse and armor and in that same hour

methink thou dost swear over-many oath art man and woman full of youth and love wherefore not marry wherefore heed a vow here or there need must i wrestle with the good saint cuthbert in the matter but here beltane fall again to meditation and roger likewise so come they presently to the forest-road and turn north towards winisfarne they stride on side by side in silence profound and deep and of a sudden upon this silence rise a voice high-pitched and quaver : o ye that have eye have pity -- show mercy on one that be maim and helpless and creepeth ever in the dark chapter li how black roger win to fuller manhood forthwith beltane pause and presently behold one that sit by the wayside -- a man who crouch ` neath a dusty cloak and keep he white head down-bent and who now reach out a hand to grope and grope for the staff that lay near wherefore beltane take hold upon this hand and raise the white-haired traveller and thereafter put the cudgel in he grasp messire say the blind man though i have no eye i do know thee young for thy clasp be strong and quick with life yet wondrous gentle god bless thee youthful sir for ` tis well to meet with gentleness within a world so cruel tell I i pray doth this road lead unto belsaye town verily answer beltane but ` tis a long day 's march thither yet need must i reach there since i do bear a message but o young messire when cruel man put out mine eye the good god in he sweet clemency make sharp mine ear so do i know thy voice methink for voice of one who long month since do cherish I in my need and hunger and send I unto the

thy father then be thy name beltane for i have hear he name thee oft -- forsooth and do he so but how come you here and wherefore to seek thee lord beltane accord to thy saintly father 's word and the manner of it thus : as we sit together of a certain fair noon within holy cross thicket there come to we thither a woman young methink and fair for she speech be soft and wondrous sweet in mine ear and she do hail thy father ` duke ' and thereafter speak thy name full oft and so they fall to many word walk together up and down before the hut anon sudden and silent as she come she be go and thy father walk full long pray oft as one that rejoiceth greatly and oft as one in deep perplexity in a while cometh he to I and give I scrip and therewith food and money and bid I seek thee in belsaye

not roger the black no no there be a many roger but who art thou dost bear such a name and wherefore cower and gasp ye then stand the blind man with head out-thrust and awful arm upraise before which black roger shrink and shrink to cower in the deeper shadow of a sudden the blind man turn and come beside beltane grasp he by the mantle lord he question who be he that trembleth before the maim and blind -- who be he that croucheth yonder nay fear ye nothing say beltane ` tis none but my trusty roger my good comrade in arm -- comfort ye then he beckon roger and take the purse and give to the

sightless go then the blind man bless beltane and turn forthwith set out upon he way and he staff tap loud upon the forest-road right joyfully beltane stride on again he mind ever busy with thought of he father but roger 's step be listless and heavy so that beltane must need turn to look on he and straightway marvel to see how he hang he head and that he ruddy cheek be grow wondrous pale and haggard roger quoth he art sick roger sick lord nay -- not sick ` tis but that i -- i -- but when he would have say more he voice fail he he lip fall a-quivering and even as beltane stare in wonder black roger groan and fling himself upon he knee and hide he face within he hand why roger what ail thee roger man say beltane and lay a hand upon he shoulder whereat roger groan again and shrink away ah lord touch I not he cry unfit be i for hand of thine unfit and all unworthy -- nay good friend -- master -- master groan roger and therewith a great cry brake from he and he cast himself face downward in the dust unworthy be i to be thy man so must i leave thee this night -- aye leave thee for o my lord yon poor blind man -- 'twa i -- at the red pertolepe 's command -- 'twa i -- do burn

the dust groan in the agony of he remorse little by little he passion spend itself but still he lay there yearning mightily for sound of he master 's voice or touch of he hand yet dare he not look up because of he abasement at last whenas he sob have cease he lift he wretched head and stare in wide-eyed wonder to see beltane upon he knee he mail hand clasp and he lip move in silent prayer when he prayer end he raise he head and straightway roger 's wonder grow for behold the eye of beltane be wondrous gentle he mouth sweet-curved and tender the old harsh line of grim-curled lip and lower brow have vanish quite and thus at last black roger see again the face of my beltane that have smile on he long since amid the green across the prostrate form of poor beda the jester so now my beltane smile and smile reach forth he hand roger say he by shame and agony some man do win to new life and fuller manhood and such a man methink thou art so have god need of thee and from this the dust of thy abasement mayhap shall lift thee one day high as heaven stand up roger good my friend stand up o man for he only be unworthy that ne'er have weep remorseful in the dust for evil past and do then roger grasp that strong uplifting hand and stand upon he foot yet speak he no word and presently they go on along the road together and roger 's habit be stain with dust and on he cheek the mark of bitter tear -- but he head be high and manfully uplifted chapter lii how they have news of walkyn now go they in silence again for that beltane dream of many thing while roger marvel within himself oft turn to look on my beltane 's radiant face while ever he wonder grow so oft do he turn thus to gape and stare that beltane chance to meet he look smile and question he thus : why gape ye on I so roger man for wonder master wherefore to see thee so suddenly thyself again -- truly saint cuthbert be a potent saint and thou a sturdy pray-er good roger and most vile sinner lord howbeit i have dare supplicate on thy behalf and behold thou art indeed thyself again -- that same sweet and gentle youth that smite I on my knavish mazzard with thy stout quarter-staff in sheven thicket in the matter of beda red pertolepe 's fool -- a dour ding yon master -- forsooth a woundy rap now fall they to thoughtful silence again but oft black roger 's stride wax uneven and oft he stumble in he go wherefore beltane slacken he pace what be it roger naught but my leg master heed 'em not thy leg they be shorter than thine lord and love not to wag so fast a thou could ` st abate thy speed a little -- a very little master they shall thank thee dearly art so weary roger master i be afoot ere sunrise why truly roger yet do i to mine own selfish end keep thee from thy slumber thus verily a selfish man i not

bethought roger come thy way forthwith turn they from the forest-road and force they way through a leafy tangle presently come out into a ride or narrow glade but they have go only a very little

sullen pool swift and sure-treading as only forester might they descend the steep and lure by some elfin fancy beltane must need come to stand beside the pool and to stare down into those silent water

these well-ordered rank a great shout arise : beltane -- the duke -- the duke now rein in he eager beast beltane look upon that stern array and as he look he eye kindle and he heart swell within he o man say he i that ye do acclaim be but a man even as ye be man to bear with ye the heat and labor of the day what ye must endure that will i endure with you here stand i ready to spill my blood that wrong may cease even as ye i be prepare to adventure I life and limb that lust and murder may cease to be and innocence and truth may walk again all unashamed so shall i lead ye into battle and affray desperate and bloody where foe shall be a-many and we few but we do fight for hearth and home and the thought of this methink shall nerve we strong as giant yet be we way a perilous way and some of we belike must die but by the blood of such this we country be hallowed unto those that shall come after we so shall we memory teach other how to die -- and better -- how to live that this we country may stand hereafter for all thing great and noble he that dieth for home and child shall mayhap from the floor of heaven look down upon a great and happy people whose freedom he -- by weary march by pain of wound by sharp and sudden death -- he himself have help to purchase and in they peace and happiness find a add joy o man who would not be a man to fight in such just cause who would not cherish life that he might lose it to such noble purpose now therefore all ye that do love pentavalon -- follow thus say my beltane wheel he horse and with rhythmic ring and clash together rank on rank horseman and footman they follow hard behind a silent grim array with eye that gleam ` neath helm and bascinet and purposeful hand that gripe full strong on lance and spear-shaft as come to the forest-road they swing away northwards towards winisfarne chapter lvi what they find at winisfarne two and two they ride -- for the way be oft-times narrow -- they flank well cover by light-armed archer who march within the green with mount archer far in they van and other in they rear a glory of sun dapple they way with dancing shadow flower be a-bloom in bank and hedgerow and bird carol blithe in the fragrant air what time sir benedict ride beside beltane he ponderous casque a-swing at saddle-bow and oft he turn he grizzled head to view my thoughtful beltane as one might look upon a son new-found now in a while beltane turn and meet he look reach out to he he hand dear benedict say he how much -- how very much i owe to thee thou art methink the greatest knight that e'er couch lance -- save thy noble father quoth sir benedict with solemn nod my father -- you be he esquire and much-loved comrade benedict i be beltane know you my mother well also thy mother why -- aye

aye verily -- she be he wife thy father be a noble knight and peerless -- and oft war on the march but methink -- she be something lonely -- at time beltane alas sigh beltane and again alas so fall they incontinent to deep thought and ride full long in silence but ever and anon as they pace along together thus sir benedict must need lift he head to gaze upon my beltane and he grim lip curve to smile infinite tender and in he eye be grow wonder quoth he at last : beltane d'ye mark this we silent company not a stave have they carol since we set forth but how shall a man sing and jest whose heart be set on great emprise verily thy word have fire e ` en this shrivel heart o ' mine till i even as they methink do burn to fight pentavalon 's cause to shield she from woeful shame and -- ha -- such vile sight as yon now look where sir benedict point beltane behold a thing crookedly contorted a-dangle from a knotted branch that jut athwart the way insomuch that the must need stoop cowering in he saddle lest he touch the twisted foot of it dead three day i judge muse sir benedict much be possible to the red pertolepe in three day and he have a great and powerful follow ` tis say quoth beltane pale-cheeked and frown a little : so would i have it benedict -- they shall be the more for we to smite i have hear he muster full three thousand beltane what then good benedict yon poor dead thing we pass but now be worth a score of man to we -- and there will be other -- sir pertolepe loveth to see man hang so perchance ere we come to winisfarne the strength of thousand shall lie within these arm of ours ` tis a fair thought lad -- aye ` tis a right fair thought may all the poor soul do thus to sudden cruel death march within we slender rank and smite with we shoulder to shoulder henceforth and now as they go come they on many and diver sign of the red pertolepe 's pass here a smoulder heap of ruin whereby lay pale stiff shape half hide in the grass -- yonder a little child outstretch as though asleep save for wide eye that look so blindly on the sun : and there beyond upon the white dust of the road great gout and pool that have trickle from something sprawl among the underbrush and the soft wind croon and whisper in the leaf -- leave that parting show other shape swing high in air whose pallid face look down on they awful-eyed from the tender green face draw and haggard with tooth agleam or open mouth whence scream have come but very silent now until the day of judgment so ride they with death above they and around death in many hateful shape and oft sir benedict bow he head as one that pray the while he strong hand knit themselves to iron fist and oft from those grim rank behind a sound go up to heaven a sound ominous and low that be like unto a moan thus march they through heat and dust through cool green shadow splash through noisy brook and shallow ford until as the sun reach the zenith they come to the brow of a hill and see afar the wall and roof of the prosperous town of winisfarne and ever as they draw nearer sir benedict stare on it he black brow close-knit and finger he square chin as one puzzle beltane quoth he at last ` tis full ten year since i see winisfarne and yet -- meseemeth -- it look not so ` tis as though i miss somewhat and yet -- but now come roger a dusty figure spur from the rear : master he cry point with eager finger o master the keep -- where be the great keep that stand yonder aye verily -- the keep nod sir benedict clap mail hand to thigh and 'twa a great and mighty hold as i do mind I now look they gloomily on each other and halt they array what time sir benedict pass word for bow to be string and every eye and every ear to be strained right needfully then move they on again betime they reach the outskirts of the town for defence it have none but no man move therein and no sound reach they but the noise of they own go thus in a while with hand tight-clenched and lip firm-set they ride into the desolation of the market-place befoul by sign of battle fierce and fall while beyond a mass of char ruin lay all that be leave of winisfarne 's once great and famous keep now above this ruin diver gibbet have be set up and behold these gibbet each bear a heavy burden then beltane light from he horse and go apart lay by he casque and sit he down he head bow betwixt he hand as one that be direly sick in a while as he sit thus heedless of all thing cometh roger master say he see ye the gibbet yonder i see they roger upon those gibbet be diver of we good fellow master there be diccon and peter

walkyn for walkyn have swear full oft -- ha master -- master behold what cometh here -- see yonder then beltane arise and look where roger point behold a strange misshapen thing half beast half man that run wondrous fleetly towards they and as it run flourish aloft a broken sword now be he lose to sight behind some bush or quick-set now he bound high over stream or stone or fall tree -- nought be there could let or stay he -- until he come where stand sir benedict 's outpost to whose conduct he yield he forthwith and so be presently bring into the market-square a wild figure this great and hairy of head and with the arm and shoulder of a very giant bedight be he in good link-mail yet foul with dirt and mire and spatter with blood from heel to head and in one great hand he gripe still the fragment of a reddened sword all a-sweat be he and bleed from the hair while he mighty chest heave and labor with he run so stand he betwixt he brawny captor what time he pant hoarse and loud and stare about he fierce-eyed ` neath beetle brow thus of a sudden he espy my beltane stand bare-headed in he youthful might whereon this monstrous man forthwith dash aside he stalwart guard as they have be babe and run towards beltane with hairy hand outstretch whereon spring roger to front he dagger a-gleam but lo roger be catch up in those mighty arm and shake helplessly fool cry this grim fellow think ye i would harm beltane that be my most love lord henceforth i be ulf call the strong and as this my hateful body be strong so be my love -- lie there so say ulf lay roger upon he back and come

love and serve thee till i die -- a thou wilt take I misshapen and unlovely ye behold I -- a vile thing that man would jeer at but that they fear to die for god who have deny I all else have give I strength beyond all man yet do i hate myself and do hide I from the eye of my fellow : but a thou canst bear with I canst suffer I beside thee and be not ashamed of my unloveliness then will i front all eye right boldly now lord a thou wilt take ulf for thy man reach down to I thy hand then beltane reach down and take ulf 's hairy hand in he ulf say he thou that god have bless with such noble strength methink ` neath thy grim shape thy heart be noble also and thy soul mayhap straight and lovely so will i make thee brother in arm to my faithful roger that ye two shall ride ever near I when the battle join now ulf the strong stand up erect upon he foot and on he swart cheek great tear roll glisten lord say he o beltane my lord and master -- and bow grim head with sudden sob whereat beltane question he full hastily as thus : art wound ulf and whence come ye in such guise lord say ulf wipe off he tear and choke upon a sob i come through bloody pertolepe 's array through -- nay how mean you question beltane the while sir benedict and many wonder knight and esquire press round they in a ring i mean through lord for walkyn 's need be dire so burst i through they -- i have a axe but it brake in my hold see you even as this my sword -- alack there be no weapon that i do not break howbeit here be i lord hither come with word for one sir benedict of bourne that do covenant to meet with walkyn here at winisfarne behold we here -- speak on quoth sir benedict thus then saith walkyn o ' the dene : that scarce have he storm and set fire to yonder prison-keep than from the south cometh a great company the which he at the first do take for ye but in a while behold sir pertolepe 's accursed raven banner the which giveth walkyn much to think now cometh to he one beyond all woman noble and gracious and holy -lrb- as i do know -rrb- the fair and stately abbess veronica who year agone do build and endow yon great and goodly abbey wherein all poor desolate soul should be cherish and comfort by she and she saintly nun and where the stricken fugitive might find sanctuary and peace and moreover be heal of he hurt -lrb- all this know i since i be fugitive hurt and very woeful and find I solace there -rrb- so cometh this noble lady to walkyn -lrb- and with she i -rrb- and speaketh he calm and sweetly thus : ` yonder rideth sir pertolepe that be knight of noble birth yet the rather would i trust myself and these my good sister in thy hand o man so do i pray thee when thou goest hence yield we the protection of thy strength so shall heaven bless thee ' hereon walkyn frowned and pluck he beard awhile but thereafter come he to kneel and kiss she hand and swear to aid she the while life he last then summon he he company -lrb- lusty fellow all -rrb- and call for thirty man that would remain to hold red pertolepe in play what time he seeketh place of greater vantage well beknown to he forthwith stand out one tall orson hight -lrb- a doughty fellow -rrb- and with he nine and twenty other lusty fellow right willing -lrb- and with they i -rrb- and thereafter walkyn formeth he company -lrb- the nun in the midst -rrb- and march in haste for brand that be a lonely tower then do these thirty -lrb- and with they i -rrb- shoot arrow amain on pertolepe 's vanguard from every place of vantage hereabouts and meet they with right lusty hand-stroke and stay thus they advance until of the thirty there none remain alive save seven -lrb- and of these i -rrb- and since we could do no more i -lrb- that do know this country from my misshapen youth -rrb- bring these man by secret way unto the tower of brand that be desolate and a ruin yet strong withal and there lay walkyn -lrb- that be a notable fighter -rrb- keep watch and ward within the tower what time he wait thy succor now who so skilful and tender with we wound as this sweet and gracious lady abbess next day sure enough cometh pertolepe with brave show of horse and foot -lrb- above three thousand lord -rrb- and straightway sendeth he a haughty fellow to demand incontinent surrender -- a loud-voiced knight whom walkyn forthwith shoot and slew with he own hand whereat sir pertolepe wax exceed wroth and come on amain and beset the tower on all side whereby they lose other of they man for walkyn 's fellow shoot exceed strong and true -lrb- and with they i -rrb- then o my lord in all that fierce debate who so brave and calm heartening wearied and wound with gentle voice and gentler hand than this same noble lady abbess for two day lay we besiege whereby we food and drink begin to fail -lrb- for the well within the tower be well-nigh dry up -rrb- yet none do eat or drink so sparingly as this same holy abbess now on this -lrb- the second day lord -rrb- cometh pertolepe himself -lrb- under flag of truce lord -rrb- and demand we yield to he the body of this same lady abbess -lrb- to we ransom -rrb- swearing on he knightly word he then will march away forthwith and seek we hurt no more and to save we life fain would this brave lady have yield she to pertolepe 's hand but walkyn -lrb- mindful of he oath lord -rrb- lean he from the battlement spake red pertolepe defiantly call he knave and liar and therewith spat upon he very fairly whereat pertolepe sware to hang we one and all and the battle join again fiercer than before therefore on this the third day see no hope of succor walkyn make he ready to sally out -lrb- a right desperate venture because of the woman -rrb- then speak i before they all say i doubt not i might win through and bring thee to they aid -lrb- a ye have keep the tryst -rrb- would they but ply they shaft amain to cover I the which be so agreed then do this saintly lady abbess set she white hand on this my hateful head and pray the sweet christ to shield this my monstrous body and i thereafter be bedight in right good mail -lrb- as thou seest -rrb- issue suddenly out of the tower while we foemen sit at meat and run among they roar dreadfully and smite amain full many until my axe brake and i betook I to my sword and smite they as i run what time walkyn 's archer shoot right furiously and well thus come i through bloody pertolepe 's array and thus lord ye do behold a something weary man and a mighty hungry one withal now come sir benedict to grasp ulf 's great hand forsooth hast do a great and noble thing quoth he thy twisted body doth hide a great and manly soul meseemeth so ne'er shalt lack for friend while benedict doth live and after sir benedict come many other knight and esquire of degree to bring he of they own viand and press upon he rich and goodly wine in so much that ulf grow hot and awkward and presently steal away to eat with roger in a quiet corner but now within the market-place be sound of song of jest and laughter where bow-string be look to heedfully sword-belt buckle tighter mail-coif lace the closer stirrup-chain and saddle-girth carefully regard while ever and anon all eye turn where beltane sit among the older knight sir benedict beside he hearken to they counsel and presently he rise and lift he hand whereat the trumpet blare and thereafter with ring of hoof and tramp of foot march they forth of winisfarne the sun bright on helm and shield a right gallant array and at they head ride ulf the strong chapter lvii telleth of the onfall at brand by wild and lonely way ulf lead they through mazy thicket o'er murmurous rill through fragrant bracken that sweep to they saddle-girths whisper as they pass now ride they by darkle wood now cross they open heath all unerring ride ulf the strong now wheeling sharp and sudden to skirt treacherous marsh or swamp now plunge into the gloom of desolate wood on and on past lonely pool where doleful curlew pipe nor falter he nor stay until as the sun grow low they climb a sloping upland crown by mighty tree and thick with underbrush here ulf check he horse and lift long arm in warn whereon the company halt hard-breathing yet very orderly and silent forthwith down light beltane with sir benedict and ulf who point before they with he finger lord say he beyond yon tree be a valley and in the valley the tower of brand the which you may see from the brush yonder -- aha and hear also methink and indeed the air be full of a strange droning sound that rise and fall uncease a drowsy ominous hum ah benedict say beltane frown a little i like not that sound summon we we wisest head for here be matter for thought and sudden action methink hereupon sir benedict beckon to he five chiefest knight and they together follow ulf 's broad back up the slope until they be come within the little wood and ever as they advance the strange hum grow louder hoarser -- a distant roar pierce ever and anon by sharper sound a confused din that be the voice of desperate conflict presently ulf bring they to the edge of the little wood and parting twig and leaf they look forth and down and what they see be this : a little valley wondrous green but very desolate-seeming for here and there stand ruin wall and char timber that once have be fair dwelling and in the midst of this small and ruin hamlet a mighty tower uprose hoary and weather-beaten yet stark and grim against the sunset all about this tower a great camp lay set well out of bow-shot and ` twixt camp and tower be many man whose armor flash rank on rank and archer who kneel behind mantlet shoot amain at battlement and loophole against the tower be two great ladder roughly fashion and a-swarm with man but ever as they strive to reach the battlement a mighty axe whirl and swing and a long sword flash and ever as they fall so fell one of the besieger there stand walkyn and tall orson quoth ulf bite he nail ha -- they be dour fighter -- would i stand with they we come in due season methink say sir benedict stroke he square chin what be you counsel my lord quoth young sir john of griswold : let we to horse and sally out on they the hill be with we and we shall -- slay and be slay quoth sir benedict verily nod grim sir bertrand dost speak like a very youth john here methink say sir benedict be work for pike and bow-string first break we they charge then down on they in flank with shock and might of all we lance ha ` tis well be-thought benedict growl old hubert of erdington so let I march with the pike art silent lord beltane quoth sir hacon dost agree aye truly answer beltane rise but let we pike march in v formation we mightiest man at the point of the v and with archer behind then ere the foe do engage let the v become a l so shall we oppose they two face now when sir pertolepe 's chivalry charge let sir benedict with two hundred knight and man-at-arms spur in upon they flank drive they confuse upon they main battle what time i yet hide within the green will sound my rally note that walkyn knoweth of old whereat he shall sally out upon they further flank then will i with my hundred horse charge down upon they rear so should we have they methink how say you my lord truly quoth sir bertrand close he vizor thy father liveth again in thee methink forthwith pikeman and archer fall into array with cnut at they head while behind the spreading rank of pike prat and he archer be range bow string and quiver sling before and presently at beltane 's word they swing forth of the shelter green fierce-eyed grim-lipped bascinet and pike-head a-twinkle away they swing down the slope a stalwart company swift-treading and light and in they midst old hubert of erdington in he heavy armor whose long sword flash as he flourish he farewell with rhythmic step and swing of broad mail shoulder they march until they be come down into the valley and now as they advance swift and steady rise shout from besiege and besieger sir pertolepe 's trumpet bray defiance and alarm and of a sudden forth of he camp mail horseman ride rank upon rank pennon a-flutter and armor flash in the sunset glare but as they muster to the charge as shield flash and lance sink sir benedict 's pikeman wheel they rank swing wide and lo the v be become a l now from this l bow twanged and arrow fly amain above the kneel pikeman what time sir pertolepe 's trumpet blare the charge and down upon those slender rank he heavy-armed chivalry thunder horse rear and fall scream beneath the whistle arrow-shower but on sweep the charge those thin rank bent and sway ` neath the shock as lance cross pike but these pike-butt rest on firm ground and upon they deadly point horse smite low rear transfix and above these rock pike steel flash and flicker where the stout archer ply they heavy broadsword while loud above the din sir hubert 's voice boom hoarse encouragement what time he thrust and smite above the kneel pikeman now out from the green sir benedict pace astride he great black charger and behind he he two hundred steel-girt knight and man-at-arms they vizor close they shield sling before the point of they long and ponderous lance agleam high in air then turn sir benedict and look on they grimly rank glad-eyed : o sir quoth he who would not be a man to fight in such just cause so say he smile he wry and twisted smile and close he vizor : then with shield address and foot thrust far within the stirrup he lightly feutr he deadly lance and behold down sweep every lance behind he as lean low behind he shield he shout right joyously : come ye messire -- lay on this day for pentavalon forward bound the great horse a-down the slope -- away away gather speed with every stride -- away away across the level with fly rein and busy spur and now a loud shouting and dire amaze among sir pertolepe 's battle with desperate wheeling of rank and spur of rear horse while sir benedict 's rider sweep down on they grim and voiceless fast and faster come a roar crash beneath whose dire shock sir pertolepe 's rank be riven and rent asunder and over and through they red confusion sir benedict ride in thunderous resistless might straight for where above they mid-most close-set rank flutter and fly sir pertolepe 's raven banner now in hot haste sir pertolepe launch another charge to check that furious onset what time he reform and strengthen he main battle but with speed unchecked sir benedict 's mighty rank meet they in full career -- break they fling they reel back on sir pertolepe 's staggering van and all be wild disorder above which roaring tumult the raven banner reel and sway and the fray wax ever fiercer now run beltane where stand roger to hold he horse with ulf who lean upon a goodly axe and young sir john of griswold who clench and wring he mail hand and bit upon he boyish lip and stamp in he impatience my lord he cry my lord suffer we to charge -- ah see -- we good sir benedict will be surround -- cut off -- nay methink he be too wise in war he fighteth ever with calm head sir john but messire do but see -- he charge be check -- see -- see he yieldeth ground -- he giveth back aye verily quoth beltane spring to saddle but behold how he order he line o lovely knight o wise benedict see you not he wisdom now sir john in he retreat he draweth sir pertolepe 's main battle athwart we line of charge they flank expose and open -- to horse sir john to horse yet stir not until i give the word forthwith spring sir john to saddle and roger and ulf also what time beltane sit he gaze upon the conflict he bugle-horn in he hand of a sudden he clap it to lip and sound the old fierce rally note high and shrill and loud it ring above the roar of battle and lo distant and far like a answer to the call from the grim and battered tower of brand a mighty shout go up -- arise arise -- pentavalon oho cry roger sit close on beltane 's left list ye to that now and see -- ha there cometh we long-legged walkyn first of they all see how they order they pike -- o master they be sweet and doughty fellow see how jenkyn 's archer shoot -- each man to the ear awhile sit beltane watch wide-eyed while sir benedict fight sword in hand fall back and back before the furious onset of sir pertolepe 's main battle until he have draw the fight mid-way then quick-breathing my beltane close he vizor now cry he now good comrade all god willing we have they let each man choose he foe and smite this day for liberty and justice so say he level he lance and a hundred lance sink behind he spur strike deep horse rear plunge and speed away before they gallop line ride sir john of griswold with roger and ulf : and before these beltane he feel the wind a-whistle through the eye-vent of he casque hear the muffle thunder of the gallop hoof behind mingled with the grow din of battle hear a shout -- a roar of anger and dismay see a confusion of rear horse as sir pertolepe swing about to meet this new attack steady he aim and with he hundred lance thunder close behind drive in upon those bristle rank to meet they shield to shield with desperate shock of onset -- feel he tough lance go home with jarring crash -- see horse that rear high and be go lose beneath the trample fray and find he lance shiver to the very grip out flash he sword for all about he be a staggering press of horse that neigh and scream and man who smite shout and be smitten unseen blow batter he while he thrust and hew and wonder to see he long blade so dimmed and bloody and ever as he fight through the narrow vent of he casque he catch small and sudden vision of this close-locked desperate fray of ulf standing in he stirrup to ply he whirling axe whose mighty crash blow no armor might withstand of grim roger scowl and fierce wield ponderous broad-sword of young sir john of griswold reel in he saddle he helpless arm wide-flung so cut they bloody path through pertolepe 's deep array on and forward with dart point and deep-biting edge unheed wound or shock of blow until beltane behold the press yield thin out and melt away thereupon shout he hoarse and loud ride down a knight who seek to bar he way unhorse a second and wheeling he snort charger wonder at the seem quiet then lift he vizor look about he and lo wheresoever he glance fall be man that crawl groan or lay very mute and still amid a huddle of fall horse and beyond these again be other man a-horse and a-foot that gallop and run amain for the shelter of the green sir pertolepe 's array be scatter up and down the valley -- the battle be lose and win now while he yet sit thus daze by the shock of blow and breathing deep of the sweet cool air he behold one rise up from where the battle-wrack lay thickest a awful figure that limp towards he hold aloft the broken shaft of a axe aha lord beltane cry ulf wipe sweat and blood from he there be no more -- leave to smite see you the which -- be well for weapon -- have i none this axe be the third this day -- broken

that staggered faint with wound and many that sink upon the trampled grass a-swoon with weariness but in the eye of each and every be the look of man that triumph cnut be there he bascinet go he fiery hair betousle : tall orson be there lean on a bent and battered pike and there he comrade jenkyn o ' the ford with many other that beltane well remembered and other whose face he know not so form they

beyond the camp armor glint ever and anon against the blackness of the surround wood where outpost and sentinel keep vigilant watch and ward though late the hour beltane sit wakeful chin on fist beside a glimmer watch-fire oft turn he glance towards the massy weather-beaten tower bethink he of the noble lady abbess of she strange look and word and so fall to brooding thought high overhead the moon ride obscure by fly cloud a wild wrack up-whirling from the south : at fitful interval be a wind that moan drearily ` mid the gloom of distant wood a desolate sound that sob upon the air and die to a wail be go now become aware of this beltane raise he head and look up at the ominous heaven and round about he and thus he espy a light that hover hither and thither above the distant battle-field a small light whose red flame flash back from cloven casque and riven shield where eye glare unseeing and mouth gape mute and dumb from a dark confusion whence mail arm stiffly rise with hand tight-clenched that seem to menace heaven and rigid foot whose spur heel yet gore the flank of rigid fall charger to and fro and up and down this small flame leap merrily dance from dead face to dead face but stay never a fiendish fire that seem to mock the horror of wound and gibe at solemn death now as he watch this devilish light beltane arise and reach for he sword go soft-footed to meet it then pause for the light be move towards he near and nearer it come until into the glow of the fire he betousled head wild and bare he link-mail yet befoul with battle walkyn stride and hurl he torch upon the grass crush it out ` neath he heel then come he to the fire and stand there arm cross frown down at the flame greet to thee waldron of brand swift turn walkyn he gloomy scowl relax at beltane 's voice and stoop he take and kiss my beltane 's hand whence come ye walkyn from go to and fro among the dead seek pertolepe master ha they do lie thick yonder five hundred and twenty and

laugh -- full loud 'twa tell I so ` twere just he should have die here to-day methink 'twa for this i lure he hither -- and he liveth yet but god be a just god walkyn now therefore leave he to god henceforth -- to god cry walkyn he eye wild he hand tight-clenched to god -- ha master ye leave he to god on a time and because of thee i -- i that have my dagger at he rogue 's throat -- i yearning to slay he do but mark he i ' the brow -- aye forsooth we leave he to god and lo to-day he burneth he slayeth and hangeth as be ever he wont -- god 's time be not ours walkyn but for the evil work by sir pertolepe sir pertolepe need must answer when god so will so leave he to the vengeance of god -- lest the fire of thy vengeance consume thee quite thou art strong and few may cope with thee in fight yet have vengeance fettered and make thee bond-slave forego thy vengeance then and be free good comrade nay master a i so do what be leave I the love of thy fellow walkyn thou art forsooth a man

head of bloody pertolepe so say walkyn rise and stand scowl down at the fire again whose glow shine ominous and red upon the broad blade of the mighty axe that lay on the grass at he foot now of a sudden forth from the shadow swift and silent on he long leg come crooked ulf and stoop would have lift the weapon but in that moment walkyn snarl and set he foot upon it off he growl touch not mine axe thou vile mannikin -- lest i tread on thee but scarce be the word speak than with great back low-crouched ulf spring and whirling mighty walkyn aloft mail foot on high hold he writhe above the fire : then swing about hurl he roll over and over upon the ling so lay walkyn awhile prop on a elbow stare on ulf with wide eye and mouth agape what time string for sudden action beltane sit cross-legged upon the green look from one to the other mannikin roar ulf great hand open and shut unworthy to touch axe of thine thou pestilent beast dare ye so say to one gently bear base fellow now will i break thee thine accursed axe -- and thee thereafter a ye will so say ulf the mighty catch up the axe and wheeling it full-armed smote and bury it in a young tree close by -- wrench it free and smote again and lo with prodigious crack and rending of fiber the tall tree sway crash to earth now while ulf yet stand to stare amaze upon this wondrous axe upon its sharp-glittering flawless edge walkyn have rise dagger in hand but even as he crouch to spring a voice spake -- a gentle voice but command and in the fire-glow stand the white abbess tall and gracious the silver crucifix agleam upon she bosom child she sigh and look from scowl walkyn to frown ulf she reach a slim hand to each o child say she lay by you steel and give to I you hand fumble and awkward walkyn sheathe he dagger while ulf lay the mighty axe upon the grass very tenderly as it have be a sleep child so come they both shame-faced unto the lady abbess and give she each a hand hold they thus she look with sad sweet eye from one grim face to the other and draw they nearer the fire walkyn son of god say she behold here ulf whose valiant heart and mighty strength have be we salvation ulf child of heaven whom god have make so mighty behold here brave walkyn who do protect the weak and helpless and fighteth for the right come then as ye be child of god go ye in brotherly love together henceforth and may heaven bless ye valiant son thus say she set they hand one in another and these hand grip and hold quoth ulf sighing : forsooth i do but mean to try the balance of thine axe walkyn and truly it be a mighty weapon and a peerless -- one that even my strength can not break quoth walkyn grim-smiling : there be in this world no axe like unto it save one that be my brother 's -- and shall be thine henceforth ulf the strong come now and i will give it unto thee then bent they reverently before the abbess salute beltane and side by side stride away together would all feud might so end sweet son sigh the abbess she wistful eye down-bent upon the fire would there be more sweet soul abroad to teach man reason quoth beltane why sit you here my son wakeful and alone and the hour so late for that sleep doth fly my woo holy mother then fain would i share thy vigil awhile forthwith beltane bring she a stool rough and rudely fashion and while she sit he lay beside she in the firelight and thus despite she hood and wimple he see she face be of a calm and noble beauty smooth and unwrinkled despite the silver hair that peep forth of she loosen hood a while they sit thus nothing speak he view she she gaze ever on the fire at last : thou ` rt young messire she say wistfully yet in thy life have be much of strife i have hear thou hast know much of hardship my son and sorrow methink so do i live for that fair day when peace shall come again noble lady full oft have i hear tell of thee my son strange tale and marvellous some do liken thee to a demon joying in slaughter and some to a archangel bear the sword of god and how think you reverend mother i think of thee as a man my son i have hear thee name ` outlaw ' and ` lawless ravener ' and some do call thee ` beltane the smith ' now wherefore smith for that smith be i breed lady but thou ` rt of noble blood lord beltane yet know i nought of it until i be man grow thy youth -- they tell I -- have be very lonely my son -- and desolate not desolate for in my loneliness be the hermit ambrose who teach I many thing and most of all how to love he so live i in the greenwood happy and content until on a day this saintly ambrose tell I a woeful tale -- so do i know this humble hermit for the noble duke my father thy father the duke a hermit tell he of -- all he sorrow my son all reverend mother and thereafter bid I beware the falsity of woman the pale cheek of the abbess grow suddenly suffuse the slim hand clench rigid upon the crucifix at she bosom but she stir not nor lift she sad gaze from the fire liveth thy father yet my son ` tis so i pray god lady and -- thy mother ` tis so i have hear pray you not for -- for she also i never know my mother lady alas poor lonely mother so doth she need thy prayer the more ah think you she have not perchance yearn with break heart for she babe to have kiss he into rosy slumber to have cherish he boyish hurt and sorrow to have glory in he youthful might and manhood o sure there be no sorrow like the loneliness of desolate motherhood would ` st seek this unknown mother lord beltane truly there be time when i do yearn to find she -- and there be time when i do fear -- fear my lord holy mother i learn of she first as one false to she vow light-minded and fickle from she youth -- o have there be none to speak thee good of she -- in all these year there be jolette that folk do call a witch and there be sir benedict that doth paint she pure and noble as i would have she yet would i know for myself fain would i be sure ere we do meet if she be but the woman who bear I or the proud and noble mother i fain would love could ` st not love she first and judge she after my son could not she very motherhood plead she cause with thee must she be weigh in the balance ere thou yield she a son 's respect and love so many weary year -- ` tis something hard methink nay heed I not my lord -- seek out thy mother unbeknown -- prove for thyself she worthiness or falsity prove for thyself she honor or she shame -- ` tis but just aye ` tis but just in very truth but i beholding thing with woman 's eye know only that a mother 's love shrinketh not for any sin but reacheth down through shame and evil with shelter arm outstretch -- a holy thing fearless of sin more lasting than shame and stronger than death itself so say the lady abbess rise and turn to look up at the light that burn within the tower ` tis late my lord she sigh get thee now to thy rest for i must begone to my duty till the dawn there be many sick and good sir bertrand lieth very nigh to death -- he ne'er will see another dawn methink so need must i away good night sweet son and in thy prayer forget not thy -- thy most unhappy mother then she lift she hand and bless he and ere he rise up from he knee she set that white hand upon he bow head and touch he yellow hair -- a light touch furtive and shy but a touch that be like to a caress thereafter beltane come into he hut of weave wattle roll himself in he weather-worn mantle and presently fall to slumber chapter lix telleth how sir benedict go a-fishing next day sir bertrand die of he hurt so they bury he beside young sir john of griswold and sturdy old hubert of erdington and a hundred and twenty and five other of they company who have fall in that desperate affray therefore tarry they a while what time they sick and wounded grow towards health and strength by reason of the skill and tender care of the lady abbess and she nun now on the afternoon of this day sir benedict be sick a-bed of he wound beltane sit in council among the oldest and wisest of the knight and presently summon walkyn and ulf roger and jenkyn o ' the ford speak they on this wise : good comrade list ye now these noble knight and i have hither summon ye for

and hast away rejoice now sir benedict 's hurt have prove a evil one and deep wherefore the abbess in accent soft and tender have incontinent order he to bed and there within the silken tent that have be sir pertolepe 's beltane oft sit by the while she with slim and dexterous finger wash and anoint and bind the ugly wound : many time come she soft-treading gentle and gracious ever and at such time beltane notice that full often he would find she deep sad gaze bent upon he he notice also that though she voice be low and gentle yet she speak ever as one ` custome to obedience thus it be that sir benedict be order to he couch obey the soft-spoke command but be keep there all day grumble -lrb- albeit to beltane -rrb- : be keep there the second day he fall to muttered oath and cursing -lrb- albeit to beltane -rrb- : but at sunset he become unruly in so much that he venture to remonstrate with the lady abbess -lrb- albeit humbly -rrb- whereon she smile and bidding beltane reach she cup and spoon forthwith mix a decoction and dose sir benedict that he fall asleep and slumber amain thus during this time beltane saw and talk much with the lady abbess : oft go he to watch she among the

rough hand be stretch forth to furtive touch she white habit as she pass hear harsh voice grow sudden soft and all unfamiliar -- voice that break in murmurous gratitude all this saw and hear he and fail not morn and eve to kneel he at she foot to hear she bless he and to feel that soft shy touch among he hair so pass two day but neither roger nor walkyn nor ulf nor indeed any of the twenty choose man have yet return or send word or sign wherefore beltane begin to wax moody and anxious thus it be that upon a sunny afternoon he wander beside a little rivulet bower in alder and willow : here a merry brook that prattle over pebbly bed and laugh among stone and mossy boulder there a drowsy stream that widen to dreamy pool stay its haste to woo down-bending branch with soft kiss noise now as beltane walk beside the stream head a-droop and very thoughtful he pause of a sudden to behold one richly dight in gambeson of fair-wrought leather artificially quilt and pink who sit ensconce

sixty over the first company he set walkyn over the second roger over the third ulf over the fourth jenkyn o ' the ford then speak he on this wise : walkyn take now these sixty good fellow and march you north-westerly yonder across the valley let you man lie well hide a bow-shot within the forest but do you stay upon the verge of the forest and watch for the come of we foe and when they be come ` tis sure they will plant outpost and sentinel within the green so be ye wary to smite outpost and sentinel suddenly and that none may hear within the camp nor take alarm when ` tis do cry you thrice like unto a curlew that we may know be all thing understand aye lord they cry one and all why then be ye cautious each and every for a we foe do take alarm so shall it be we death march walkyn -- away forthwith walkyn lift he axe and stride off up the slope until he and he sixty man have vanish quite into the glooming wood to the north-west jenkyn didst hear my command to walkyn so shalt thou do also -- you post doth lie to the east yonder aye master and look ` ee now -- my signal shall be three owl-hoots master look ` ee so say jenkyn turn he sixty at he heel and swing away until they be lose to sight in the wood to the east ulf the strong thy post doth lie south-westerly and roger 's south-easterly thus i lie south shall have ye on my left and right : go get ye to you place watch ye and wait in patience for the signal and when time for action cometh be swift and sure away march roger and ulf with they company and presently be go and there remain within the little valley only beltane and he sixty man awhile he stand to look to the north and east and west but nought saw he save the dense gloom of forest grow dark and ever darker with evening then of a sudden turn he and summon he company stride away into the forest to the south thus as night fall the valley of brand lay desert quite and no sound brake the pervade quiet save the wind that moan feebly through those dark and solitary wood wherein death lay hide so very silent -- so very patient but death in grim and awful shape chapter lxi how the forest fight for they a hum upon the night-wind lose ever and anon in wail gust yet a hum that never cease a sound that grow and grow loud and ever more loud until it seem to fill the very night a dreadful sound ominous and threaten a sound to shake the boldest heart -- the ring and tramp of a armed oncoming multitude now lie amid the leaf and fern with cnut and the small man prat beside he beltane presently espy certain figure move in the valley below stealthy figure that be man of sir rollo 's van-ward soft-creeping they approach the desert camp soft-creeping they enter it and suddenly they trumpet bray loud and long and die away give place to the ring and trample thunder of the advance host on they come knight and man-at-arms rank upon rank company by company until the valley seem full of the dull gleam of they armor and the air ring loud with clash and jingle and the trample of countless hoof yet still they come horseman and foot-man and ever the sound of they wax upon the air a harsh confused din -- and ever from the glooming wood above death stare down on they and now the trumpet blow amain light flicker and flare as one by one fire be light whose red glow flash back from many a helm and shield and breast-plate from broad gisarm and twinkling lance-point what time above the confused hum above stamp hoof and clash armor voice shout hoarse command so little by little from chaos order be work pack-horse and charger be lead away to be water and picket and gleaming figure sink wearily about the many camp-fire where food be already prepare in a while from the stir of the camp bright with its many watch-fire diver small group of man be detach and pike and gisarm on shoulder begin to mount toward the forest at vary point hereupon beltane reach out in the dark and touch the small man prat the archer quoth he : hither come they outpost go now and bring up my company -- and bid they come silently forthwith prat sink down among the fern and be go while beltane watch keen-eyed where four man of sir hollo 's outpost climb the slope hard by and one be singing and one be cursing and two be quarrel and all four beltane judge be man aweary with long march thus singing cursing quarrel come they to keep they ward within these dark and silent wood crash through the underbrush careless of they go and all unheed the sombre stealthy form that rise up so silently behind they and before from brush and brake and thicket creep figure that move only when the night-wind moan in the shiver leave beltane 's dagger be out and he rise up from the fern crouch and string for action -- but from the gloom near by rise a sudden strange flurry amid the leave a whimper sound evil to hear and swiftly end a groan a cry choke to strangle gasp and thereafter -- silence save for the fitful wail of the wind -- a long breathless pause then high and clear rise the cry of a owl thrice repeat and presently small prat be beside he in the fern again lord say he softly albeit pant a little these man be fool we do but wait we comrade ' signal now and he fall to cleanse he dagger-blade carefully with a handful of bracken ha -- list ye whisper cnut there sound ulf 's warning methink and from the gloom on they leave a frog croak hoarsely a hundred watch-fire blaze in the valley below and around each fire armor glitter little by little the great camp grow to silence and rest until nought be hear but the stamp and snorting of the many horse and the cry of the sentinel below but ever dagger in hand beltane strain eye and ear northward across the valley while big cnut bit he nail and wriggle beside he in the bracken and small prat softly snap he finger so wait they with ear on the stretch and eye that glare ever to the north at last faint and far across the valley rise the doleful cry of a curlew thrice repeat the which be answer from the east by the hooting of a owl which again be catch up like a echo and repeat thrice upon they right then beltane sheathe he dagger look say he cnut -- prat look north and tell I what ye see fire my lord quoth prat ha it burneth well -- see see how it spread and there again -- in the east say cnut oho jenkyn be busy -- look master aye and roger too say beltane grim-lipped we ring of fire be well-nigh complete -- it lacketh but for we and ulf -- to work then come the sound of flint meeting steel -- a sound that spread along the rank that lay unseen beyond prat and cnut and behold -- a spark a glow a little flame that die down leap up catch upon dry grass and bracken seize upon crackle twig flare up high and ever fiercer -- a devour flame hungry and yellow-tongued that lick along the earth -- a vengeful flame pitiless and unrelenting -- a host of fiery demon that leap and dance with crackling laughter change little by little to a angry roar that be the voice of awful doom now of a sudden above the hiss of flame from the valley of brand a cry go up -- a shout -- a roar of fear and amaze and thereafter rise a wild clamor a babel inarticulate split ever and anon by frantic trumpet-blast but ever the dreadful hubbub wax and grow shriek and cry and the scream of madden horse with the awful rolling thunder of they fierce-galloping hoof within that valley of doom death be abroad already death in many dire shape proud knight doughty archer and man-at-arms who have front death unmoved on many a stricken field weep aloud and crouch upon they knee and scream -- but not so loud as those wild and maddened horse that burst all bond asunder rear and leap with lash hoof and choke with roll smoke-cloud blind by flame plunge headlong through and over the doomed camp wave upon wave of wild-flung head and toss mane on they come with nought to let or stay they they wild hoof trample down hut of osier and silken tent spurn the tremble earth and fill the air with fly clod and wheresoever they gallop there be flame to meet they so swerve they scream they terror and flee round and round within the valley so race they blindly to and fro and back and forth trample down maim and mangle ` neath reddened cruel hoof all and every that chance to lie athwart they wild career : on and ever on they gallop until sob panting they fall to be crushed ` neath the thunder hoof behind within the little valley of brand death be rife in many and awful shape that no eye might see for the many watch-fire be scatter and trample out but up from that pit of doom rise shriek and cry and many hateful sound -- sound to pierce the brain and ring there everlastingly thus beltane march swift to the south at the head of he three hundred forester hear nought of they joyful acclaim heed not they triumph see nought of watchful roger 's troubled glance but go with head bow low with pallid cheek and eye wide-stare for he see yet again the fierce leap of those merciless flame and in he ear ring the scream and cry of sir rollo 's proud chivalry chapter lxii how they come to belsaye for the third time the sun be high as they come to the western road that lead to the ford at thornaby but upon the edge of the forest beltane stop of a sudden to stare up at a adjacent tree what be ' t master question roger halt beside he a arrow -- and new-shot by the look of it say beltane gloomily aye master and it have travel far -- see it have scarce pierce the bark 'twa shot from the brush yonder methink say beltane point to the dense underwood that skirt the opposite side of the dusty highway reach I it down roger so say beltane stoop and hove roger aloft until he could grasp and draw the arrow from the tree here be no woodsman 's shaft master quoth roger turn the missile over in he hand ere he give it to beltane no forester doth wing he shaft so true nod beltane frowning at the arrow walkyn ulf here have be a ambushment methink -- ` tis a likely place for such let we company scatter and search amid the fern hereabouts -- but even as he speak come a cry a clamor of voice and prat the archer come frowning and snap he restless finger my lord say he yonder doth lie my good comrade martin and three other fellow of my archer-company that march with sir benedict and all dead lord slay by arrow all four show I say beltane and when he have view and touch those stark and pallid form that lay scatter here and there amid the bracken he anxious frown deepen these have be dead man full six hour quoth he aye lord say prat and ` tis unmeet such good fellow should lie here for beast to tear shall we bury they not so answer beltane turn away take they shaft and fall to you rank -- we must march forthright thus soon the three hundred be stride fast behind beltane keep ever to the forest yet well within bow-shot of the road and though they travel at speed they go very silently as only forester might in a while beltane bring they to those high wooded bank betwixt which the road run wind down to thornaby ford -- that self-same hilly road where upon a time the red pertolepe have surprise the lawless company of gille of brandonmere and now as then the dark defile be litter with the wrack of fight fall charge that kick and snort in they pain or lay mute and still man in battered harness that stare up from the dust all unseeing upon the new day they lay thick within the sunken road but thicker beside the ford and they dot the white road beyond grim sign of sir benedict 's stubborn retreat hereupon beltane halt he hard-breathing forester and bid they rest awhile and break they fast hast down into the roadway with walkyn and cnut and black roger aha cry walkyn point to diver of the slay that hamper they go these be pertolepe 's rogue -- aye quoth roger throw back he mail-coif and yonder lie four five -- six of sir benedict 's good fellow it have be a dour fight hereabouts -- they have fight every yard of the way forsooth nod cnut sir benedict be ever most fierce when he retreat look you a while stand beltane in that dark defile the which untouch as jet by the sun 's level beam strike dank and chill a place of gloom and awful silence -- so stand he glance from one still form to another twice he kneel to look more closely on the dead and each time he rise thereafter he brow be blacker and he shiver despite he mantle ` tis strange say he and pass strange that they should all lie dead -- not a living man among they how think you roger i think lord other have be here afore we see you this knight now he gorget loose off -- o messire say a faint voice hard by if ye have any pity save I from the crone -- for the love of christ let not the hag slay I as she have so many -- save I start round beltane espy a pale face that glare up at he from a thick furze-bush beside the way a youthful face albeit haggard and draw fear not say beltane kneel beside the wounded youth thy life be safe from we but what mean you by talk of hag and crone ah messire to-day ere the dawn we fall upon sir benedict of bourne -- a seditious lord who have long withstand duke ivo but though he man be few they fight hard and gain the ford ahead of we and in the fight i with many other as ye see be smite down and the fight roll on and leave we here in the dust as i lay strive to tend my hurt and hearken to the sigh and groan of the stricken i hear a scream and look about behold a ancient woman -- busy with she knife -- slaying -- slaying and rob the dead -- ah behold she -- with the black-haired archer -- yonder and verily roger step forth of the underwood that clothe the steep drag a thing of rag and tatters a wretched creature bent and wrinkle that mop and mow with toothless chap and clutch a misshapen bundle in yellow talon-like finger and these yellow finger be splotch horribly with dark stain even as be the rag that cover she she whine and whimper querulously mouth inarticulate plaint and prayer as roger hale she along with cnut and walkyn fierce and scowl behind have bring she to beltane roger loose she and wrenching away she bundle open it and lo a yellow-gleaming hoard of golden neck-chain of ring and armlet of golden spur and belt-buckle the which he incontinent scatter at beltane 's foot whereon the gibbering creature scream in high-pitched crack and ancient voice and screech throw herself upon the gold and fall to scrabble among the dust with she gnarled and bony finger and ever as she rake and rake she screech harsh and high -- a hateful noise that end of a sudden in a wheeze sob and sink down she lay outstretched and silent she wrinkled face in the dust and a cloth-yard shaft transfix she yellow throat so swift have death be deal that all man fall back a pace and be yet stare down at this awful dead thing when forth from the brush a archer crawl painfully he bow yet in he hand and so lay panting loud and hoarse ha cry cnut ` tis lusty siward of we archer how now siward i be speed cnut groan siward but yon hag lieth dead so be i -- content i have watch she slay john that be my comrade you 'll mind -- for he armlet and -- good sir hugh she stab -- yonder he lieth -- he she slew for -- spur and chain when i fall i -- drop my bow -- in the brush yonder -- i have be two hour creep -- a dozen yard to -- reach my bow but -- i get it at last -- aha and siward feebly point to the ancient dead woman strive to laugh and so -- die then beltane turn and come beside the wounded youth speak he tender and compassionate young sir we must hence but first can i do aught forthee o messire a i might -- come to the river -- water say no word beltane stoop and lift the young knight very carefully bear he down toward the ford messire quoth the young knight stifle he groan art very strong and wondrous gentle withal presently beltane bring he beside the river and while the youth drink lay bare a ugly wound above the knee and bath it with he hand and thereafter tear a strip from he ragged cloak he bind it tight above the hurt -lrb- even as he have see sir fideli do -rrb- and thus stay the bleeding now while this be a-do the young knight must need talk ho cry he 'twa a good fight messire and he who give I this be none other than benedict of bourne himself -- whom we good duke doth fondly imagine pen up within thrasfordham o indeed 'twa sir benedict i see he hawk-face plain ere he close he vizor and he fight left-handed moreover beside he i recognize the leap dog blazon on the shield of hacon of trant -- oho this shall be wondrous news for duke ivo methink but faith ` tis wonder how he escape sir rollo and as for the outlaw beltane we see nought of he -- sir pertolepe vow he be not of this company -- mayhap sir rollo have he ` tis so i pray -- so peradventure i shall see he hang yet my grateful thanks messire for thy tender care of I at home i have a mother that watcheth and prayeth for I -- prithee tell I thy name that she may remember it in she prayer i be call beltane the outlaw sir knight -- and i charge thee to heed that thy bandage slip not lest the bleeding start afresh -- fare thee well so say beltane turn and go on across the ford what time the young knight prop upon weak elbow stare after he wide of eye and mouth forthwith beltane set horn to lip sound the rally and very soon the three hundred cross the ford and swing off to the leave into the green thus hearten and refresh by food and rest they press on amain southward through the forest with eye and ear alert and on the strain what time grim sir benedict ride with he rearguard peer through the dust of battle but see only the threatening column of the foe upon the forest road behind rank upon rank far as the eye could reach and the dense green of the adjacent wood on either flank whence unseen arrow whiz ever and anon to glance from he heavy armor ha benedict quoth sir brian they do know thee methink ` spite thy plain armor -- ` tis the third shaft have strike thee in as many minute so need must i stifle and sweat within closed casque sir benedict groan upon he right hand sir brian ride and upon he left he chiefest esquire and oft need must they wheel they charger to front the thunderous onset of red pertolepe 's fierce van at the which time sir benedict laugh and gibe through he vizor as he thrust and smite left-armed parrying sword and lance-point right skilfully nevertheless since shield he bare none time and again they beat back they assailant thus until spend and short of wind they give place to three fresh knight by we lady of hartismere pant sir brian but

by dismounted knight from the underwood see as i live ` tis the nuns they make for nothing say sir benedict spur forward beside he hard-pressed company in the midst of the column be dire tumult and shout where from the dense wood upon they leave a body of knight sheathe in steel from head to foot be cut they way toward the lady abbess who conspicuous in she white habit be soothing she frightened palfrey all about she a shout reel press of sir benedict 's light-armed footman be give back and back before the swing of ponderous axe and mace and sword be smite down and trample ` neath those resistless steel-clad rank ha the abbess they cry yield we the lady abbess into this close and desperate affray sir benedict spur strive with voice and hand to re-form he broken rank hew he a path by dint of sword until he have win beside the abbess yolande he shout above the din keep thou beside I close -- close yolande -- stoop -- ah stoop thy head that i may cover thee -- the debate waxeth a little sharp hereabouts even as he speak he reel ` neath the blow of a heavy mace steady himself cut down he smiter and thrust and smote amain until the grim fierce-shouting rank give back before the

and die about we i must go -- i will go my lord let I pass -- loose my bridle -- a hunting horn fiercely wind among the wood hard by a confused roar of harsh voice and forth of the green four terrible figure spring two that smite with long-shafted axis and two that ply ponderous broadsword and behind these man be other lean and brown-faced -- the very wood seem alive with they and from these fierce rank a mighty shout rent the air : arise arise ha beltane -- pentavalon then do sir benedict laugh loud and joyous haste to re-form he sway rank the bloody gap in he column close up and sir pertolepe 's knight hem in thus smote and be smitten and but scant few be they that win they free and presently through that red confusion brake beltane with roger and ulf and walkyn at he heel and sword in hand he spring and catch the abbess in a close embrace mother he cry dear dear son of mine -- and thou art safe thanks be to god who have hear the passion of thy mother 's prayer now sir benedict turn and wheeling he horse leave they together and so beheld sir hacon near by who stand high in he stirrup point to they rear benedict he pant ha look -- brian be over-borne ho a rescue -- a rescue to sir brian of hartismere so shout he drave back into the confusion of the staggering rear-guard with sir benedict spur behind but as sir benedict ride push past the file of he halted company he feel hand that grip either stirrup and glance down beheld ulf the strong on he one flank and grim walkyn upon the other so come they where the road broaden out and where the battle rage sway and surge above the form of sir brian prostrate in the dust where horseman and footman strive together in desperate grapple where knightly shield aflare with proud device ring ` neath the blow of beltane 's lusty forester and sir benedict 's veteran pikeman then of a sudden walkyn shout fierce and loud and spring forward with mighty axe whirl aloft ha -- pertolepe turn he roar ho bloody pertolepe -- turn thou dog ` tis i -- ` tis waldron of brand so cry he and plunge into the thick of the affray smite aside all such as bar he way until he front sir pertolepe who astride a powerful mail charger wield a bloody mace and who hear that hoarse cry turn and meet the shear axe with blazon shield -- and behold the gorgeous shield be split in twain but even so he smite in turn and mighty walkyn be beat to he knee forth spring ulf swift and eager but walkyn bound up shoulder he aside -- he axe whirl and fall once and sir pertolepe 's mace be dash from he loosen hold -- whirl and fall again and sir pertolepe 's great casque be beat from he head and all man might see the ghastly jagged cross that scar he brow beneath he fiery hair -- whirl again but ere it could fall knight and esquire mount and afoot have burst ` twixt walkyn and they reel lord and walkyn be dash aside shout cursing foam with rage what time sir pertolepe be bear out of the fight but the rear-guard be save and with a hedge of bristle pike behind sir benedict 's sore-battered company march on along the forest-road and breathe again the while they pursuer stagger in they onset pause to re-form ere they thunder down upon that devoted rear-guard once more but sir benedict be there loud-voiced and cheery still despite fatigue and sir hacon be there he wonted gloom forget quite and beltane be there equip with shield and vizored war-helm and astride a noble horse and there too be roger grim and silent and fierce ulf and walkyn in black and evil temper quoth he : ha -- ` tis ever so he life within my very grasp yet

again -- stand firm pike so shout sir benedict wheel he horse and beltane with he and once again the road echo to the din of battle thus all day long they fight they way south along the forest-road as time and again sir pertolepe 's heavy chivalry thunder down upon they to check and break before that hedge of deadly pike so march this valiant rear-guard parch with thirst choke with dust grim with blood and wound until as the sun sink westwards the wood thin away and they behold at last glad-eyed and joyful the wall and tower of fair belsaye town now just beyond the edge of the wood sir benedict halt he shrunken column he dusty pikeman draw up across the narrow road with archer behind support by he cavalry to hold sir pertolepe 's power in check amid the wood what time the nun with the spend and wound hast on towards the city hereupon beltane raise he vizor and set horn to lip sound the rally and lo from the city a glad and mighty shout go up the while above the square and frown keep a great standard arise and flap out upon the soft air discover a red lion on a white field aha beltane quoth sir benedict yon be a rare-sweet sight -- behold thy father 's lion banner that have

we like to be crushed ` twixt hammer and anvil quoth sir hacon tighten the lacing of he battered casque so will i give thee charge of we knight and man-at-arms -- what be leave of they alas -- to meet black ivo 's banner my doleful hacon spake sir benedict nay benedict say sir hacon grim-smiling my dole be but caution so say he close he vizor and ride away to muster he chivalry to meet they new assailant the while sir benedict fall to re-form he scanty rank of pikeman and archer meantime beltane sit he weary charger glance from sir pertolepe 's deep array of knight and man-at-arms that throng and jostle each other in the narrow forest-road to the distant flash and glitter of duke ivo 's mighty van-ward and from these again to the wall of belsaye and as he look thither he see the great drawbridge fall the portcullis raise and the gate fling wide to admit the fugitive even at that distance he think to recognize the abbess who pause to turn and gaze towards he as last of all she ride to safety into the city then my beltane sigh and close he vizor turn to find ulf beside he with roger and walkyn who stand to watch the while sir benedict ride to and fro order he company for they perilous retreat across the plain swift and silent he war-worn veteran fall to they appoint rank he trumpet blow and they begin to fall back on belsaye town grimly silent they march and ever beltane gaze where near and ever more near flash and flicker duke ivo 's hard-riding van-ward and now from the forest-road sir pertolepe 's company march and form in the open spur down upon they stand

he sword and go softly up the narrow stair that lead to the battlements it be a bleak dawn full of a thick low-lying mist beyond the wall but within this mist to north and south and east and west be a faint stir while ever and anon rise the distant cry of some sentinel within duke ivo 's sleep camp a mighty camp whose unseen power hold the fair city in deadly grip in belsaye nothing stir and none wake at this dead hour save where high on the bartizan above the square and mighty keep the watchman pace to and fro while here and there from curtain wall and massy tower spear-head and bascinet gleam slow and light of foot beltane climb the narrow stair that lead up to one of the two square tower that flank the main gate but be come thither he pause to behold gile who chance to be captain of the watch sit upon a pile of great stone beside a powerful mangonel or catapult and stare he dolefully upon the lighten east : full oft sigh he and therewith shake despondent head and even thus fall

light fellow in matter of love -- forget not i be breed a monk noble brother thus brother a mope owl i -- a very curst fellow gloomy and silent as the grave saving my breath for sigh and groan and curse fall wherefore i have build I a ` mockery ' above the wall and there-from do curse we foe as only a churchman may brother nay how mean you gile question beltane stare follow I lord and i will show thee so say gile lead the way down to the battlement above the great gate where be a thing like unto a rough pulpit build of massy timber very stout and strong and in these timber stand many arrow and cross-bow bolt here lord quoth gile behold my ` mockery ' wherefrom it be my wont and custom to curse we foe thrice daily the which be a right good strategy brother in that my amorous anguish findeth easement and i do draw the enemy 's shaft for there be no man that heareth my contumacious dictum but he forthwith falleth into rageful fury and a angry fellow shooteth ever wide o ' the mark brother thus thrice daily do we gather a full sheaf of they ill-sped shaft whereby we shall not lack for arrow a they besiege we till gabriel 's trump -- heigho thus do i live by curse for a i could not curse then would my surcharged heart assuredly in sunder burst -- aye I now while they sit thus in talk up rise the sun before whose joyous beam the stealthy mist slink away little by little until beltane beheld duke ivo 's mighty camp -- long line of tent gay with flutter pennon and gonfalon of hut and booth set well out of bowshot behind the work of contravallation -- stout palisade and barrier with earthwork very goodly and strong and presently from among these booth and tent be the gleam and glitter of armor what time from the wake host a hum and stir arise with blare and fanfare of trumpet to usher in the day : and in a while from the midst of the camp come the faint ring and tap of many hammer now as the mist clear look thitherward beltane stare wide-eyed to behold wooden tower in course of building with the grim shape of many powerful war-engine whose mighty flying-beam and massy supporting-timber fill he with great awe and wonderment ha quoth gile they work apace yonder and by saint gile they lack not for engine verily black ivo be a master of siege tactic -- but so be giles brother see where he setteth up he mangonel trebuchet perrier and balista with bosson or ram tower and cat in the use of the which he be right cunning -- but so also be giles brother and verily though you mangonel and trebuchet be well enough yet for defense the balista be weapon more apt methink as be more accurate in the shooting and therefore more deadly -- how think you lord indeed gile be a forester i could scarce tell you one from another ha -- then you 'll know nought of they nature and use lord nought gile ne'er have i see they like until now say ye so brother cry gile full eager he brown eye a-kindle say ye so in very truth then -- a it be so thy wish -- i might instruct thee vastly for there be no man in the world to-day shall discourse you more fluent and learn upon siege-craft engine and various tormenta than i so -- a it be thy wish lord -- it be my wish : say on gile why then firstly lord firstly we have the great mangon or mangonel _ fundi fundibulum _ that some do also term _ catapultum _ the which worketh by torsion and shall heave you great stone of the bigness of a man fully two hundred yard a it be dry weather next be the trebuchet like to the mangon save that it swingeth by counterpoise next cometh the balista or springald that worketh by tension -- a pretty weapon and shall shoot you dart or javelin so strong as shall transpierce you six lusty fellow at a time hauberk and shield like so many fowl upon a spit -- very sweet to behold brother then have we the bear or cat that some again do name _ musculus _ or mouse for that it gnaweth through thick wall -- and some do call this hog sow _ scrofa _ or _ sus _ brother and some again _ vulpe _ and this cat be a massy pole that beareth a great and sharp steel point the which be mount within a pent-house swingeth merrily to and fro much like to a ram brother and shall blithely pick you a hole through stone and mortar very please to behold then we have the ram _ cancer testudo _ that battereth next we have the tower or beffrous that goeth on wheel -- yonder you shall see they a-building and these tower move forward against you city shall o'ertop the wall and from they archer and cross-bowman may shoot into you town what time they comrade fill up and dam you moat until the tower may come close unto you wall and these tower be come against the wall do let fall drawbridge over which the besieger may rush amain and carry you wall by assault lastly there be mantlet -- stake wattle together and cover with raw-hide -- by the which mean the besieger make they first approach then might i descant at goodly length upon the mine and furnace with diver and sundry other stratagem device engine and tormenta but methink this shall mayhap suffice thee for the nonce aye verily -- ` twill suffice say beltane rise truly war be even more terrible than i have think why lord ` tis a art -- a notable art and -- ha this doth mind I of my heart heigho and of all terrible thing of all the woe and ill man-heart may know be -- love o I alack and woe when doth thy watch end gile it end a hour agone but to what end be a lover i sleep little and pine much and this be a fair good place and solitary so will i pine awhile and likewise mope and languish alack so presently as beltane descend the stair he hear the archer break forth again in doleful song across the wide market-square go beltane with brow o'ercast and head low-bowed until he come to one of the many door of the great minster there pause he to remove bascinet and mail-coif and thus bareheaded enter the cathedral 's echo dimness the new-risen sun make a glory of the great east window and with he eye uplift to this many-coloured glory beltane soft-treading cross dim aisle and whisper transept but as he mount the broad step of the sanctuary he pause with breath in check for he hear a sound -- a soft sound like the flutter of wing or the rustle of silken drapery now as he stand thus he broad mail-clad shoulder and golden hair bath in the refulgence of the great window it seem to he that from somewhere near there breathe a sigh tremulous and very soft and thereafter be the quick light tread of foot and silence a while stand beltane scarce breathing then slow and reverent he approach the high altar and ever as he go be a fragrance wonder-sweet that grow stronger and stronger until he be come behind the high altar where be he mother 's grave and lo upon that long white stone lay flower a-bloom rose and lily whose dewy loveliness fill the place with they pure and fragrant sweetness so look he round about and upon these flower with grateful wonder and sink to he knee bow he head and fold he hand in prayer but presently as he kneel thus he be rouse by the clank of steel and a shuffling step wherefore he arise and cross to the shadow of the choir sit he down within the deeper gloom to wait until he disturber should be go slowly these halt step advanced foot that stumble oft near they come and nearer until beltane perceive a tall figure whose armor gleam dully and whose shoulder be bow like one that be feeble or very weary yolande say a voice a hoarse voice but very tender yolande beloved and on the word the voice break and end upon a great sob swift follow by another and yet another the fierce sobbing of a man then beltane clench he hand and rise up for behold this man be sir benedict but now and very suddenly sir benedict be upon he knee and bent and kiss that white smooth stone whereon as yet be no inscription yolande he whisper now thou art one among the holy angel o forget not thy most unworthy benedict god -- o god father to whom all heart be open thou dost know how as child and maid i love she how as a wife i love she still -- how in my madness i spake my love -- and she be saint and woman bid I to my duty so by she purity keep she my honor unstained -- beltane 's long scabbard strike the carven panelling a soft blow that yet echo and re-echo in vaulted arch and dim roof and glance swiftly up sir benedict behold he and kneel thus beside the grave of the woman he have love sir benedict look up into beltane 's face with eye wide eye unflinching but dim with great grief and pain quoth he firm-voiced : my lord thou hast learn my life 's secret but ere thou dost judge I hear this long ere thy princely father meet thy mother we love she and i and in we love grow up together then come the duke thy father a mighty lord and she mother be ambitious and very guileful -- and she -- but a maid thus be she wed then ride i to the foreign war seek death -- but death take I not so the war end come i home again burn ever with my love and seek she out and behold the sadness in she eye i spake my love and forgetful of honor and all save she sweet soul and the glory of she beauty i tempt she -- aye many time -- tempt she in fashion merciless and cruel insomuch that she weep many bitter tear and upon a day speak I thus : ` benedict ` tis true i love thee for thou wert a noble knight -- but now a thy love for I be so small that thou canst bring I to this shame then -- take I where thou wilt -- but -- ne'er shall all thy love nor all my tear thereafter cleanse we from the shame of it ' thus go i from she nor have i look on woman since so follow i thy father in all he war and all my day have i fight much -- fierce foe within I and without and live -- a very solitary life and to-day she lieth dead -- and i be here old and worn a lonely man and sinful to be judge of as ye will then come beltane and look down into sir benedict 's pale sad face and behold he thus in he abasement haggard with wound and bow with grief need must beltane kneel also and thereafter spake thus : sir benedict who be i to judge of such as thou i tempt she -- i woo she to shame i that love she beyond life -- do cause she many bitter tear -- alas yet in the end sir benedict because thy love be a great and noble love thou didst triumph over base self so do i honor thee and pray that i in like case may act as nobly and now -- she lieth dead so for I be life end also methink she be a saint in heaven benedict live forever as to thee on whose skill and valiance the safety of this fair city doth hang -- so have god need of thee here methink so now for thy sake and for she sake need must i love thee ever and always thou noble knight she be dead yet liveth and shall go betwixt we henceforth draw we together in closer bond of love and amity -- be it not so dear my friend and speak beltane reach out he hand across he mother 's narrow grave and straightway come sir benedict 's hand swift and eager to meet and clasp they for a while knelt they thus hand clasp hand above that long white stone whence steal to they the mingled fragrance of the flower like a silent benediction and presently together they arise and go they way but now see how sir benedict limp by reason of he wound beltane set a arm about he so come they together out of the shadow into the glory of the morning now as they come forth of the minster the tocsin ring loud in sudden alarm chapter lxiv how gile curse belsaye out of she fear within the market-place all be dire confusion man hast hither and thither buckle on armor as they go woman weep and child wail while ever the bell clash out its fierce summons presently through the populace cometh sir brian of hartismere equip in he armor and lean on the mail arm of he brother eric of the wry neck but perceive sir benedict and beltane they turn and come up forthwith eric -- brian what meaneth the tumult question sir benedict he eye kindle be we attack -- so soon not so answer sir brian at the least -- not by ivo 's man ` tis worse than that sigh eric shake he head yonder cometh a churchman bear on the shoulder of he monk and with chorister and acolyte attendant ha say sir benedict frowning and rub he chin i have dread this the citizen do shake and shiver already i 'll warrant I there be nought like a cowl with bell book and candle to sap the courage of you citizen soldier let we to the wall in a corner hard by the main gate they behold gile hold forth to roger and walkyn and ulf but perceive sir benedict he cease abruptly and advance salute the noble company each in turn but address himself to sir benedict my lord quoth he eye a-dance yonder cometh a pompous prior that be not very long since nought but massy monk that do upon a time -lrb- though by dint of some small persuasion -rrb- bestow on I a goodly ass my lord i be breed a monk so do i know by diver sign and portent he cometh here to ban the city with book bell and candle wherefore the townsfolk fear greatly do shiver and shake especially the woman and maid -- sweet soul and lord by reason of the matter of the ass i do know this priest prolific of damnatory pronouncement and curse contumacious -lrb- o verily -rrb- yet i messire -lrb- have be breed a monk -rrb- shall blithely he out-curse a the joy be permit I thus turn tear to laughter and gloomy fear to loud-voiced merriment -- my lord messire how say you ` tis blasphemy unheard quoth sir brian save in the greenwood where man do breathe god 's sweet air and live free say wry-necked eric and spake sir benedict stroke he square chin there be a fear can be quell but by ridicule so may thy wit sir archer avail more than we wisdom -- a thou canst make these pale-cheeked townsfolk laugh indeed how think you my beltane that be the wise and valiant knight thou art sir benedict thy will during the siege be law in belsaye henceforth now hereupon gile make he obeisance and together with roger and walkyn and ulf hast up to the battlement above the gateway benedict say sir brian as they climb the turret stair blasphemy be a dread and awful thing we shall be excommunicate one and all -- better methink to let the populace yield up the city and die the death than perish everlastingly brian quoth sir benedict pause something breathless by reason of he recent sickness i tell thee fire and pillage and ravishment of woman be a thing more dread and awful -- better methink to keep innocence pure and unspotted while we may and leave hereafter in the hand of god and he holy angel upon the tower there meet they the reeve anxious of brow who point where the townsfolk talk together in fearful undertone or cluster mute and tremble while every eye be turn where in the open ` twixt town and camp a procession of black-robed priest advance chant very solemn and sweet my lord say the reeve look round with haggard eye a these priest do come to pronounce the church 's awful malediction upon the city -- then woe betide already there be many -- aye

beyond the moat over against the main gate the procession halt the chair with its portly burden be set down and lift up a white be-ringed hand the haughty cleric spake thus in voice high-pitched mellifluous and sweet : whereas it have pleased ye o rebellious people of belsaye to deny to cast off and wantonly repudiate you rightful allegiance to you most just most merciful and most August lord

and set up they mightiest engine and tower day in day out mangonel trebuchet and balista whir and crash from keep and tower and curtain-wall while from every loophole and crenelle long-bow twang and arrow fly yet with each succeed dawn the besieger ' fence-works creep nearer closing in upon the city until within close bowshot of the wall they set up earthwork and stockade and from these strong barrier ply the defender with cloth-yard shaft and cross-bow bolt what time they mighty engine advance perrier and ram wherewith to batter and breach the city 's massy wall so day in day out eric 's choose man ply trebuchet and balista and beltane behold the dire havoc work by heavy stone and whiz javelin among the dense rank of the besieger despite they mantlet and stout palisade grow sick at time and be fain to look otherwhere but the besieger be many and duke ivo have swear swift destruction on belsaye thus heedless of all else he push on the attack until despite they heavy loss he man be firmly establish close beyond the moat wherefore my beltane wax full anxious and be for sally out to destroy they work : at the which gloomy sir hacon limp in he many bandage grow suddenly jovial and fain be to call for horse and lance forthwith quoth sir benedict placidly : nay let they come messire they be a sea but belsaye be a rock duke ivo be cunning in war but be mark I a passionate man and he who fighteth in blind anger fighteth ill so let they come i say the time for we to beware be when ivo 's hot temper shall have cool ha look yonder and sir benedict point where a great wooden

swift so sudden and unexpected that ere they could be meet with pike or sword the thing be do and now from that narrow way dim-lit by lanthorn and torch-glare there rise a sound more awful to hear than roar of battle a hoarse and vicious sound like to the worrying snarl of many great and fierce hound with ancient sword with axe and dagger and fierce-rending tooth they fight those father of belsaye thick and fast they fall yet never alone while ever they rave on a company of madman behind the friar 's white robe back and back the besieger reel before that rage fury -- twice the white

get back and take thy rest awhile my arm be fresh and my steel scarce blood so get thee to thy rest -- moreover thou art a notch lord -- another accursed notch from my belt wherefore beltane presently creep down from the breach and thus behold many man who labor amain beneath sir benedict 's watchful eye to build a defense work very high and strong where they might command the breach and as beltane

the battle o methink the time be now benedict with helen 's soft hand a-tremble in he beltane hast down from the tower and sir benedict follow until they be come to the square where amid the joyful acclaim of the populace they small and hardy following be draw up and as they come from townsfolk and soldiery a shout arise : beltane -- the duke -- the duke my lord duke of mortain quoth sir benedict i and thy company do wait thee to lead we but beltane smile and shake he head not so my lord of bourne thou art so cunning in war and hast lead we so valiantly and well -- shalt lead we to

methink shall yet bring he to thine embrace so say sir benedict mount and ride to the head of he lance where fly he banner unbar the gate he cry and presently the great gate of belsaye town swing wide the portcullis clank up the drawbridge fall and thus afar off they behold where ` mid swirl dust-cloud the battle rage fierce and fall and behold a sorry wight who hobble toward they on a crutch so begirt and bandage that little be to see of he but bright eye o sir hacon cry the duchess do i not bid thee to thy bed why truly dear my lady but since i may not go forth myself fain would i see my

and with ring and tramp he with he six hundred knight and man-at-arms ride forth of the market-square clattering through the narrow street thunder over the drawbridge and form in the open spur away into the battle then beltane sigh and kneel kiss he lady 's white hand : beloved spake he low-voice e ` en now must i go from thee but howsoever fortune tend -- thine be i through life -- aye and beyond beltane she whisper ` twixt quiver lip o love beltane take heed to thy dear body cover thee well with thy shield since thy hurt be my hurt henceforth and with thee thou dost bear my heart -- o

forward bear a blue banner my lord say the duchess behold here thy banner that we have work for thee genevra and i so say she take the banner and give it into beltane 's mail hand but as he arise and while pale-cheeked genevra hand clasp upon the green scarf at she bosom look wet-eyed where the archer stand rank forth step gile and spake quick and eager lord say he to-day methink will be more hard smiting than chance for good archery wherefore i do pray let I bear thy standard in the fight -- ne'er shall foeman touch it while that i do live -- lord i pray thee be it so gile so giles take the banner while beltane fit on he great plumed helm thereafter come roger with he shield and ulf lead he charger whereon he mount forthwith and wheeling put himself at the head of he pikeman and archer with roger and ulf mount on either flank and gile bestride another horse behind yet now need must he turn to look he last upon the duchess standing forlorn and behold the tender passion of she tearless eye he yearn mightily to kiss they and sigh full deep then give the word ride out and away the blue standard a-dance upon the breeze but he heart sink to hear the clash and clang of gate and portcullis shut away from he she that be more to he than life itself now when they have go some way need must he look back at belsaye its battered wall its mighty tower and high upon the bartizan he behold two figure the one be-swathed in many bandage and one he know who pray for he even then and all at once wall and tower and distant figure swim in a mist of tear wherefore he close he bascinet yet not before gile have see -- gile whose merry face be grim now and hard-set and from whose bright bascinet a green veil float lord say he blinking bright eye we have fight well ere now but to-day methink we shall fight as ne'er we fight in all we day aye nodded beltane verily gile methink we shall thus say he turn and look upon the roll battle-dust and settle he foot within the stirrup clench iron finger upon he long sword chapter lxix how at last they come to pentavalon city all day long the din and thunder of battle have roar upon the plain all day the duchess helen with sir hacon at she side have watch the eddy dust-cloud roll now this way now that strain anxious eye to catch the gleam of a white plume or the flutter of the blue banner amid that dark confusion and oft she hear sir hacon mutter oath half-stifled and oft sir hacon have hear snatch of she breathless prayer as the tide of battle swing to and fro a desperate fray whence distant shout and cry mingled in awful din but now as the sun grow low the close-locked fray begin to roll southwards fast and ever faster a mighty storm of eddy dust wherein armor gleam and steel glimmer back and forth as duke ivo and he proud array fall back and back on they last stronghold of pentavalon city whereupon sir hacon upon the bartizan curse no more but forgetful of he many wound wax jubilant instead now by holy rood he cry see lady -- they break -- they break 'twa that last flanking onset none but beltane the strong could have marshal that last charge -- draw on black ivo to attempt he center see you and crush in he flank

duchess frowning and pale i pray you summon I the reeve yonder and when the reeve be come she speak he very soft and sweet : messire i pray you let we out and aid the poor stricken soul yonder but lady the battle be not yet win -- to open we gate be unwise methink good reeve one die but lately whom all man love but die friar martin speak these word -- ' i see belsaye rich and happy she gate ever open to the woeful and distressed ' come ope the gate and let we out to cherish these afflict thus presently forth from belsaye ride the duchess helen with sir hacon beside she and many of the townsfolk hasting pale-cheeked and tremble to minister unto the hurt and die and many there be that day who sigh out they life in blessing on she head but meantime the battle roar fierce and furious as ever where black ivo 's stubborn rank beset now on three side give back sullenly fight step by step and amid the blood and dust in the forefront of that rage tumult a tear and tattered blue banner rock and sway where beltane with gile at he right hand lead on he grim forester they rank woefully thin and with never a horse among they but roger be there he face besmear with blood that ooze ` neath he dinted bascinet and ulf be there foul with slaughter and there be walkyn fierce and grim while side by side amid the trample pikeman behind jenkyn and tall orson fight and presently to beltane come walkyn point eagerly to they left master he cry yonder flaunteth pertolepe 's banner beseech thee let we make thitherward -- not so quoth beltane stoop ` neath the swing of a gisarm o

at he in fierce anxiety : fall out roger fall out and rest ye man not while i can stand archer art a fool roger belike i be gile -- and therefore do i love thee rogerkin ha bear up man yonder be water -- a muddy brook -- o bless saint cuthbert pant roger now before they be a water-brook and beyond this brook black ivo 's harass column make a fierce and desperate rally what time they strive to re-form they hard-pressed rank but from duke beltane 's midmost battle the trumpet bray fierce and loud whereat from a thousand parched throat a hoarse cry rise and chivalry and foot the man of mortain charge with level lance with goring pike with whirling axe and sword and over and through and beyond the brook the battle rage sweeping ever southwards presently before they the ground slope sharply down and while beltane shout warn to those behind he voice be drown in sudden trumpet-blast and glance to he left he behold at last all those knight and man-at-arms who have ride with he father in they reserve all day -- a glitter column rank on rank at whose head he sable armor agleam he great white charger leap ` neath the spur duke beltane ride swift and sure the column wheel and with lance couch thunder down upon black ivo 's reel flank a crash a sudden roaring clamor and where have march black ivo 's reserve of archer and pikeman be nought but a scatter rout but on ride duke beltane he lion banner a-flutter in and through the enemy 's staggering column and ever as he charge thus upon they leave so charged sir jocelyn upon they right then beltane lean he on he sword and look down upon the battle bow he head now praise be to god and he holy saint quoth he yonder be victory at last aye master say roger hoarsely and yonder as the dust clear you shall see the wall and tower of pentavalon city and lord -- lord cry walkyn yonder -- in they rear -- you shall see red pertolepe 's accursed raven banner why tarry we here lord see they rank break everywhere -- ` twill be hot-foot now for the city gate -- ha let we on master aye verily quoth beltane look westward it groweth to sunset and the city be yet to storm to you rank there -- forward now as they advance beltane beheld at last where high above embattled wall and tower rise pentavalon 's mighty keep wherein he have be bear and remember he proud and gentle mother he droop he head and grieve and bethink he of he proud and gentle helen he take fresh grip upon he sword and lengthen he stride look where black ivo 's broken column weary with battle grim with blood and wound already begin to ride ` neath the city 's frown gateway while hard upon they straggle rearguard duke beltane 's lion banner flutter a desperate hewing and thrust in the narrow gateway and black ivo 's shatter following be drive in and the narrow street and alley of the town full of battle and slaughter street by street the town be win until before they loom the mighty keep of pentavalon 's ducal stronghold outer and inner bailey be storm and so at last come they a desperate close-fighting company into the great tilt-yard before the castle now of a sudden a shout go up and thereafter be a great quiet -- a silence wherein friend and foe panting and weary stand alike at gaze and amid this expectant hush the two duke of pentavalon front each other no word say they but while all eye watch they each take lance and ride to the extremity of the courtyard wheel and couch they lance spur fiercely against each other and now man hold they breath to behold these two great knight who crouch low in they saddle meet midway in full career with crash and splinter shock of desperate onset duke beltane reel in he stirrup recover and lean forward stare down upon he enemy who prostrate on he back slowly lift gauntleted hand that fall weakly clash upon the stone -- a small sound yet plain to be hear by reason of that breathless hush slow and stiffly duke beltane dismount and reel in he gait come and kneel beside black ivo and loose off he riven helm thereafter slow and painfully he arise and look round upon all man speak faint-voiced god -- have judge -- betwixt we this day say he and to-day -- methink -- he doth summon I -- to judgment -- even as he speak he lift he hand struggle with the lacing of he helmet stagger and would have fall wherefore beltane spring forward yet one there be quicker than he one whose goodly armor smirch and batter yet show the blazon of bourne benedict quoth duke beltane feebly faithful wert thou to the last o benedict where be my noble son father cry beltane thou hast this day win pentavalon from she shame and misery but the duke lay very still in they arm and speak no word so when they have uncover he white head they bear he tenderly into the great banqueting hall and lay he on goodly

smile wondrous glad and tender yield he soul to god in a while beltane come forth into the courtyard and beheld sir jocelyn muster they knightly prisoner in the ward below for with black ivo 's death all resistance be end and now the trumpet blare rally they various company but beltane abode very full of sorrowful thought to he presently cometh gile yet grasp the blue standard befoul with dust and blood the which he lay reverently at beltane 's foot lord say he my trust be end see yonder standeth we company of forester and he point where a single rank of grimed and weary man lay upon the hard

be a-dying methink -- and ulf and walkyn be not but even as he speak he turn and start for from the ward below a hunting horn bray feebly ` tis we forester 's rally master quoth he and see -- jesu what man be these for into the courtyard follow by many who gape and stare in wonderment six man stagger man hideously stain and besplash from head to foot and foremost come two and walkyn be one and

thing that trundle softly across the pavement and stop shew a pallid face crown with red hair ` neath which upon the brow betwixt the stare eye be a jagged scar like to a cross now while all man stare upon this direful thing hold they breath walkyn laugh loud and high and break from ulf 's clasp stagger to where it lay and point thereto with shake finger behold he cry behold the head of bloody

and choke -- die chapter lxx which speaketh for itself it be not the piping of throstle or sweet-throated merle that have wake my beltane who with slumberous eye stare up at carven canopy round he upon rich arras and down upon embroidered bed-covering and silken pillow while through the narrow lattice the young sun play upon gilded roof-beam and polished floor so lay beltane blinking sleepy eye and hearken to a soft and melodious whistle from the little garden below he casement be thus heavy with sleep he wonder drowsily what great content be this that fill he and wherefore wonder yet he sigh and because of the sun 's radiance close slumberous eye again and would have sleep but of a sudden the whistle cease and a rich sweet voice fall to gentle singing hark in the whisper of the wind love calleth thee away each leaf a small soft voice doth find each pretty bird doth cry in kind o heart haste north to-day beltane sit up broad awake for blaen lay to the north and in blaen -- but gile be singing on : youth be quick to speed away but love abideth ever fortune though she smile to-day fickle be and will not stay but true-love changeth never the world doth change as change it must but true-love changeth never proud ambition be but dust the bow doth break the sword doth rust but love abideth ever beltane be lean half out of the casement of the which fact who so unconscious as gile busily furbish armor and bascinet gile he cry o gile -- rouse ye man how lord -- art awake so early question gile look up innocent of eye be it not for this thou didst sing rogue gile go now bid roger have three horse saddle for within the hour we ride hence to mortain lord question gile eagerly aye gile to mortain -- north to blaen where else should we ride to-day so say beltane turn back into he sumptuous chamber and fall to don not he habiliment of state but those well-worn garment all fray by he heavy mail swift dress he and almost stealthily oft pause to glance into the empty garden below and oft stay to listen to some sound within the massy building and thus it be he start to hear a soft knock at the door and turn beheld sir benedict forsooth art up betime my lord duke quoth he bright eye a-twinkle and verily i do commend this so great zeal in thee since there be many and diver matter do need thy ducal attention -- matter of state and moment -- matter of state saith

thy year shall be full of discord what matter a my people prosper but thou art older and much wiser than i benedict bethink thee of these thing then i pray and judge how best such change may be ` stablish for a week hence god willing i summon my first council but now dear benedict i go to find my happiness farewell my lord -- god speed thee my beltane o lad lad the heart of benedict goeth with

behind soon be they free of the city and reach that roll down where the battle have rage so lately beltane set he horse to a stretch gallop and away they race over upland and lowland until they behold afar to they right the wall and tower of belsaye but on they ride toward the green of the wood and ever as they ride gile sing full blithely to himself while roger gloomed and sigh wherefore at last the archer turn to clap he on the shoulder what aileth thee my rogerkin quoth he ha growled roger the world waggeth well with thee gile these day but as for I -- poor roger lacketh saint cuthbert knoweth i have strive and likewise plague he sore upon the matter and yet my belt -- my accursed belt yet beareth a notch -- behold why ` tis but a single notch roger yet a notch it be forsooth and

she of whom he dream bethink he ever of the deep shy passion of she eye the soft tone of she voice the clinging warmth of she caress and all the sweet warm beauty of she betime they cross the march into mortain but it be late evening ere they see at last the sleepy manor of blaen its white wall and steepy roof dominate by its one square watch-tower above which a standard stir lazily in the gentle air discover the red lion of pentavalon and now beltane 's breath grow short and thick he strong hand tremble on the bridle and he grow alternate hot and cold so ride they into the echo courtyard whither hast old godric to welcome they and diver servant to take they horse be usher forthwith into the garden now who so silent and awkward as my beltane what time he lady duchess make know to he she gentle lady among whom sweet genevra flush of cheek gaze breathless upon gile even as gile gaze upon she -- who so mumchance as beltane i say who see and hear and be conscious only of
